which is a tool for doing refactoring
it's of tool written in Erlang for
refactoring airline programs and you can
use it we did a survey when we started
doing this project which was a number of
years ago we did a survey of what the
the most the most used IDs were 44
Erlang and came up with the conclusion
that Emacs was the most heavily used and
li d we've integrated with as well but
that was before IntelliJ was supporting
the supporting Erlang but you can also
use the tools stand alone so you can you
can call the commands from the command
line or from the Erlang shell and still
get refactoring that way so Wrangler is
a tool but it's also a toolkit as I say
it's usable from the shell and the
command line but what we've built inside
and I'll talk about this as the talk
goes on we've tried to build a language
to make it easy for online programmers
to write their own refactorings and we
spent a long time worrying about what
that would look like and I think the
reason that we spent a lot of time
worrying about it was because we were
trying to find one language for writing
new refactorings or one language for
extensibility whereas in fact what was
lying under the hood were two different
things are so we've produced an API for
writing your own refactorings from
scratch and we've got a domain-specific
language on which allows you to script
refactorings simple refactorings into
more complex assemblies and i'll talk
about both of those things and on top of
that we built a tool for doing API
migration so for example maps came into
Erlang are 17 people had used
dictionaries for doing similar things so
we built a tool that allows you to help
migrate your code from dictionaries to
maps and also we built a all using this
API migration tool allowing you to go
from the old regular expression library
reg ex to the new one our
um I don't really have time to talk
about that my talk I gave at the airline
user conference last last June if you
look at the video of that that will talk
about that stuff in detail so wranglin
gives you that toolkit for writing your
own refactorings it's got that sort of
extensibility built in but also it's a
tool set so inside there as well as
being able to do refactorings as other
tools that allow you to detect clone
detect clones in your code so you can
detect arm when you've got duplicated
code or almost duplicated code and gives
you ways of detecting that and
eliminating that I'll show you an
example of that and as well ways of
automating things that people want to
automate like frameworks for web
services testing and I'll say a tiny bit
about that at the end if I got some time
so it's been a platform we've used to do
a number of things and what I'll do in
this talk is show you some of those in
action the one thing I wanted to do
before before I go into this in any more
detail is to explain where the name
comes from um we still think of all it's
it's Erlang right and we're doing
refactoring for a line so we could call
it rua lang but then we did a bit of I
like doing crosswords so you know
anagrams came to mind so if you do a
little bit of anagramming you get
wrangler and if you stick a W in front
you get a real word so that's where it
came from and a Wrangler is somebody who
can look after horses who can tame
difficult horses well somebody who link
engages in a lengthy and complicated
dispute some refactoring seem lengthy
and complicated or it's somebody who
gets a first-class degree in math from
Cambridge so there's you know there's a
whole there's a nice collection of
connotations for that so let me explain
a bit about what what Wrangler is like
as a tool so refactoring is the idea of
refactoring is to change what a program
does but not um change my program does
what it does without changing what it
does and we see it as being part of a
programmer standard tool kit we saw
yesterday
in need in the presentation about
IntelliJ you can see there that that
it's one of the things that you can do
as a matter of course some of the
refactorings there for renaming and so
on you can just as a matter of course as
part of standard program development and
we provide things like renaming function
extraction generalization as budget
integrated into people's standard
programming workflow and I guess
refactoring is something that we do but
you want to have tools to help you do it
the the phrase that people who advocate
refactoring tools always use is that
doing refactoring is tedious and
error-prone doing it in practice
changing the name of a function
throughout a project is something you
can do with an editor but you'll
probably get some false positives and
some false negatives so you have to
check all those instances are to make
sure that you're doing exactly the
renaming is you want and no more and no
less and you can easily make mistakes so
what we want to do is automate the
simple things and and cover the
bureaucracy that it will be hard for you
to do yourself in an editor off the
shelf and I guess one of the things that
you realize quite quickly is that um if
you're doing this you need to cover the
whole language you need to make sure you
cover Oliver lang you need to make sure
you can cover a whole project you don't
want to refactor in a single file and
there's also there's a rather vague
question about where refactoring ends so
you refactor a project but perhaps you
better refactor the tests for that
project perhaps you better refactor the
make files for that project because if
you start renaming modules you better
make sure that you rename them in your
make files as well as in your tests and
your your project itself so it can cover
the whole project lifestyle I like start
life cycle and in something like
IntelliJ you've got advantages they're
working within an IDE which will cover
certainly
cover testing and I guess we'll have a
make as well so you're getting all that
you're getting all that renaming within
that closed world similar with Erlang li
de if you're working with in Emacs then
you're pulling in tools of different
kinds okay let me just show you a tiny
bit about what we do this is going to
allow me to do it it's a look okay so
here we are in we're in Emacs we've got
a we've got a module here called ping
pong we can rename we click on there you
can see Wrangler is a menu in in Emacs
you you can go to the menu of course
because it's Emacs you don't need ever
to go to the menu because there are
these beautiful rooms that allow you to
go straight to I'm sorry which font the
one is that you can the trouble yeah
this screen is yet we can do that just
let me show here are the menus and as
you can see we're getting these
beautiful runes here ctrl c ctrl w
that's the introduction for wrangler and
then you get all the other stuff which
is how he max works right an RV for
rename variable RF or rename function so
let's let's rename this function now
let's rename this one actually I'd
rather rename this and you wanted the
font bigger John is that better okay so
let's rename the function so you get the
same we're allowed to rename it let's
call it in it be and of course that's
failed because we can't do that it's
already in scope so we have to check
it's not simply a matter of doing a
substitution you can't rename it
something that's already in scope but
let's rename it's something isn't in
scope
let's go back and call it IA unless we
can preview this if you like that let's
just commit it and you can see for
example not only did it rename in did it
rename the function rename that I a it
also had to rename it in a spawn and it
had to rename it in the export because
you have to track the values of arm you
have to see that some atoms don't aren't
just atoms but they mean a function so
when you rename a function you have to
make sure it symbol it calls to that
function also renamed so you have to do
that sort of analysis under the hood and
of course if you did that with a text
editor it would simply rename it might
do okay there but it could rename the
things you didn't want to and we can
undo that let's just undo that
refactoring so we can go back to where
we were and of course we could rename if
we wanted what system update modules
called ping pong I could rename the
module let's commit that and you can see
that's changed in the spawn it's
actually changed the name of the module
as well so we have to make sure again
that we we rename the things we want to
rename and we don't rename the things we
don't so it's built into its built-in to
Emacs and support those beautiful runic
command sequences and also stuff things
into an appropriate menu let me move on
go back to my presentation
okay and just for completeness to show
you that you can you can call this from
the command line if you want to
integrate this into two other editors or
do it outside an editor and that's
particularly that's particularly the
case for when you're doing battery
factoring for instance suppose you're
changing the naming convention across a
whole project moving from camel case
where you have a capital letter inside a
word to inside an identifier to
replacing that capital letter with an
underscore and a small letter you can do
that across a whole project for every
name in the project because you might
want to do you probably want to do that
outside an editor you can do that okay
so that explains what we can do by way
of the simple sort of refactorings you
see inside arm IDEs what else could we
do well because Wranglers written in
Erlang URL all line programmers so we
can just say you can modify it however
you wish you can write your own
refactorings using our beautifully
crafted libraries because we say that
and nothing nobody uses them because you
know they might look a bit like that so
what we tried to do is present a much
clearer high-level view of what airline
or what our tool can provide and as an
embedded in Erlang still but allowing
you at hiding some of the details of
what's inside our implementation so it
allows you to write extensions of the
tool that much more easily and you know
Erlang you're a lying programmers so
we're quite happy with expecting you to
be able to write Erlang stuff but not
having to know the details or for
instance the way that the syntax trees
are represented it's not your job to do
that it's our job to hide that tube ride
an interface so that you can extend
things in the appropriate way and as i
said earlier on I think one of the
things that we we tripped over when we
first started thinking about this was
trying to find a single
language so what we finished up with is
is it's providing two things its API to
define completely new refactorings from
scratch and we allow you to do that
inner line concrete syntax so we have a
template language which I'll explain in
a minute that allows you to describe
like syntax trees and so on using Erlang
syntax concrete syntax not not abstract
so that allows you to write something
entirely new but we can also do is put
refactorings together so we can write
script which are actually rather more
complicated than script because we can
control we can generate whole sets of
refactorings rather than forcing you to
write down each refactoring you can say
I want to rename every function which
has this property so an erlang function
that returns a boolean and I want it to
be renamed using this Erlang function so
that's how we do things like the
changing from camel case to Erlang
identifies with an underscore in them so
it's a sort of DSL it sort of scripting
language on steroids if you like but
again embedded in our legs for T's is
you can use to to describe these
particular transformations the sort of
things people have asked us to do this
camel case thing I've talked about we
did some work for cubic on instrumenting
code in particular ways to avoid when
people at kubica writing models they
want perhaps to avoid certain certain
behaviors in those models and we were
writing little transformations for them
to do that we've done work on the work
on a API migration of automating
migration from an old library to a new
library again we've used we've used this
framework for doing so what does the API
look like let me just give you an
overview of how we
the rationale for what we need to do so
what you see here is an example where
what have we done we have generalized
this function body over the particular
message that's output there so you
select but if we're to automate this if
were to use our API for do to do this
that turns into a parameter and then as
every call we have to pass that in as an
actual parameter to the call to the new
the new function so in order to describe
a transformation like this we have to be
able to describe expressions inner line
we have to be able to say something like
this head or something like this call
gets transformed in a particular way so
we have to be able to describe
expressions and how they are transformed
you can see those transformations going
on there but also you've got to describe
the context in which this goes on the
context and scope in which that goes on
in order to verify certain preconditions
so for example you can't generalize over
something that contains one of the
parameters to your function doesn't make
any sense because that n is bound that
they did from the parameter list doesn't
make any sense to to generalize over
that so you have to be able to check
check those things so we've got to be
able to build the API like this we have
templates that will allow us to describe
particular expressions using our line
concrete syntax then rules that allow us
to transform from the old form to the
new form we use the context to describe
some preconditions and then we have to
describe a traversal about how the
athlete how the transformations applied
across a project so those are the things
that together give us our extension API
but again all embedded in Erlang now let
me explain a bit about what we've been
doing more recently on providing support
for introducing concurrent
see there's a nice analogy about
introducing concurrency I don't know if
anyone's a cricket fan perhaps not I
couldn't I should have perhaps upgrade
updated this to have a baseball game but
what you see here is the oval in South
London indeed so very it's a very calm
it's a very serene very clear picture of
what's going on you've got a single
cricket match going on there in the
middle of this beautiful green green
pitch very nice very elegant but an
awful lot of that pitch is not being
used right you know they've got the
action is going on there and they're
people scattered around if you go to to
Mumbai there's a place called The Oval
Maidan where people create play cricket
and it looks like this so there's one
set of stumps there's another and there
are about 30 cricket matches going on
concurrently it's complete chaos but it
works so I guess the lesson here is that
you get nice elegant computations when
you're sequential if you try and
introduce concurrency to get more
performance then your programs might get
more complicated and you need to think a
lot harder about how you how you produce
that so what we've been doing is trying
to identify parts of computations that
we can perform independently and base
decisions on doing that on doing what we
call program slicing what's called
program slicing we've also we've worked
on a tool called percept to an extension
of percent that's in OTP that allows us
to see what's going on within within a
particular application and you can see
here these are three variants of
actually our clone detection code you
can see that by making some
transformations by parallelizing parts
of our code we've managed to
dramatically increase the amount of
potential parallelism there is in that
central
processing our phase and then in the
final processing phase there so trying
to identify what I'm trying to identify
places where you might introduce
concurrency and then introducing it now
in practice it can be some things are
easy there's some low-hanging fruit if
you see a map then you can turn that
into a parallel map if you see a list
comprehension you can turn that into a
parallel map but in practice it often
isn't like that and so what we've tried
to do is provide some support for
situation where it's not as simple as
that so what we tried to do is design
try and help you make transformations
which which fit in with an airline
design philosophy so working with OTP
behaviors perhaps turning synchronous
calls to a server to asynchronous calls
and dealing in general with tail
recursive functions and providing some
sort of automation to support those
things in wrangler so here's an example
of the sort of thing we can do you can
say which part of the computation
effects that that part of the result and
that's effectively what what slicing
provides and if you do it in this case
you'll see that the bits I'm
highlighting in blue are other things
that that hit that this is a particular
regular thing you might guess that
you're doing something to two files and
those those are the two bits of
processing there are relatively
identical now what you can see here is
that the computation of these things
only requires the stuff highlighted in
blue so you can think of transforming
what you see on the left into what you
see on the right so what we have done is
replace the computation in line do that
and then that with a spawn the pink
stuff is the boilerplate we need to add
to support that and we shift the arm we
shift the blue computation into a
separate separate process and then we we
receive the result here and that allows
us to do those two pieces of computation
in parallel so that's sort of and within
a single function and we can do a
similar thing here with turning a a
handle call where you respond to a an
asynchronous response from the gen
server so that's saying instead of
waiting for the result of that
computation before you you give the
reply just return the updated state and
reply when you're ready which I think
was related to the things that Jose was
talking about in his talk with things
he's thinking about in alexia separating
out bits of computation to do with state
change bits of computation that are pure
computation so separating out those two
those two things from a gen server um
and just to show you the change here an
example of what we do in the in their
angular API how we support that at the
top level we have a transformation that
says what we're going to do is apply a
transformation top down to our code and
it's going to apply rule one when
possible and rule one is described like
this you can see that there are three
aspects to it you match the pink bit
replace the pink bit with the green bit
in the case that the orange condition
holds and you can see that what we do is
write the thing we want to replace in
erlang concrete syntax with some meta
variables
so the Erlang variables that end with at
symbols are actually airline variables
but we treat them as meta variables and
that will match a sequence of Erlang
variables so however many arguments
there are there that args @ @ will match
and so on so we can write in in a
familiar format you don't have to know
how we're representing things internally
in order to see what's going on there
what we do here is is the return result
and the side condition here is is simply
saying this is that your refactoring the
code that reflects arm the position of
the cursor when you selected the
transformation and here you see what we
do for arm in actually generating a new
call what we've done here is we do two
slices we do a backward slice from the
result and from the state and we find
the things that are involved in
computing the result but not computing
the state so we have a list difference
there and this from here we're able to
generate the new body of the function
which removes the expressions that are
oh yeah sorry that's the body yeah and
we
what's going on there
okay those are the ones in the in the
start end location of their yeah that's
right so we get the new body like that
and then we generate arm again using the
erlang concrete syntax we generate the
replacement code well what we do is is
using this template we replace all the
meta variables with the actual variables
we've computed up there so we're using
our lang as the meta language for doing
these transformations so if you
understand Erlang you can write these
these transformations okay let me just
show you um briefly they're slicing in
action oh yeah this is something from
RabbitMQ if I do what's control C
control w/e if I select a variable and
then do the slicing ctrl c ctrl w x 0
not selected expression sorry about that
that gives us the slice for that
particular expression so that's showing
that that particular component of the
result the members state won depends on
this bit of code it depends on the input
variable state but there are these are
that this activity here is independent
of of the result that you're computing
there so potentially that's something
you might float out into a parallel
computation so using this using this
function slicing to provide you with
hints about how to transform your
programs you can see this we could cover
the whole you can cover the whole
expression here if we select the whole
expression I guess we'd expect to see
we'd expect to see in fact they that
activity isn't being used at all so
that's intriguing
so
and this gives you a way of exploring
your your code in general whoops rid of
that so plenty of other things to look
at here so there you can see that that
internal broadcast the pub count there
just depends on the state and not the
message in the sizing so you get that
you you can see the dependencies within
your functions so let's go back to our
presentation well no I didn't mean print
I meant that um how much time I got
can't remember what tires started if i
go back okay um write an example here of
handling a tail recursive computation is
typically Erlang computations are tail
recursive what can we do here to produce
some arm some more parallelism what
we've got is a computation that's
entirely sequential at the moment it
looks like it's a tail recursion what
are we doing we've got our termination
condition is when we have an empty list
when we have a non-empty list what do we
do weird we're computing on we're
matching they're on us on the variable
it's one so we've got this number
variable as well which were perhaps
counting down on and oh yeah okay so
we're counting we're terminating either
on empty list or having one there so in
general what we do here is a a tail
recursion on then this list here and
this number here and what can we do what
we would like to do is throw off as much
computation as a as a separate process
from this chelle recursion
what are we doing we're computing this
group and this remain and then some new
groups and then a new accumulator and
then calling they are calling the
function again so what's going on here
in doing this transformation we work
through a whole series of steps we check
is a function tail-recursive we then
have to analyze which of the variables
is an accumulator and then what we need
to do is partition the body of the
function in order to see find out what
types of computation we can float out
what part of the computation gives us
new values of the parameters and what
gives us a new value of the accumulator
so the sort of analysis we're doing arm
or tail recursion we do at a syntactic
check that's not complicated so what how
do we work out what the accumulator is
what we do is apply this condition it
will be a value that depends on itself
and some others it will be that no other
parameter depends on its value and its
value is not used in the termination
condition of the recursion that's the
way we characterize what the accumulator
is and if you look remain has some of
the other parameters remain is what am I
looking at here
no other parameter transference value so
if we're looking here then the number of
nodes there other things do depend on
that so remain is a candidate but gets
thrown out for that reason this
parameter gets thrown out because it's
used in the termination condition but
this parameter meets that condition so
we can see that the final parameter is
potentially an accumulator and then we
can ask what can we float out what we
want to do is float out from the things
that the accumulator depends on those
bits of the computation which don't
depend on the value of the accumulator
and don't overlap with slices of other
parameters so these are the things which
we can compute separately and which
don't affect the other parameters and so
the thing that we find we can float out
from here is this new group computation
that's the thing which is being done
independently of the other things so
that's something we can float out and we
produce you know what looks like a
horrendously complicated piece of code
but what we do is effectively put inside
a sorry we leave that put inside a piece
of worker arm right that comes
automatically inside a whole lot of
template code we've got the four lines
which made up our original body of our
tail recursion all the rest is is
dispatching values off and collecting
the results in an appropriate order so
what we've done is make this whole thing
more parallel make it make it
substantially more efficient by
transforming that original function body
into what we see here and that we can do
entirely automatical
now you might ask that looks absolutely
horrendous why on earth would I put this
into my code why would you make a
transformation like that explicit I
think the answer is that this is a step
that's part of your explicit development
you've decided you want to make your
your code more efficient so you better
put that into your repository put that
step in your repository could you just
do that inside a compiler well maybe but
compiler based transformation is is
notoriously fragile you can't be sure
that the compiler will do exactly what
you want so it's much better to make
that transformation put it in your
repository if you don't like it you can
always undo it but no I think making
that putting that in there explicitly
means that you know precisely in your
development cycle what you have done and
why you've done it your document it arm
and you've done it in an entirely
automated way which you can undo if you
want to APR migration I will not I won't
say anything about cuz I talked about
that at the EUC last last summer that's
all in my I talk from there but let me
see a tiny bit about Wrangler as a tool
set one of the things that we we've
implemented and we use quite widely is
armed we've used particularly in looking
at a cleaning up test code for example
is armed clone detection so for example
you can see here it's actually similar
code to to my demo code let me show you
this in a demo actually escape
my demo code here we are let's go back
to this ping-pong I'm going to make it a
tiny bit smaller John I hope you don't
mind to allow us to do a bit of clone
detection you can see here these two
pieces of code look pretty similar um
let me see what our clone detection will
do let us so we can go into a similar
code detection we've got a number of
flavors of this I don't want to don't
have time to go into the details this
completely you can do a search across a
whole project for similar code or you
can search within a single buffer I'll
do the latter just now you can do it in
a completely under ected way we can say
just find us all the code that might be
similar so you're doing that as an
initial step but then you can focus in
and say I want to find everything
similar to this so you select an
expression and then you can find
everything similar to that particular
expression but let's go for the similar
code in the current buffer now there's a
question about what similar code means
of course there isn't a default
definition there isn't a a
black-and-white definition of what
similar code is it's parameterised on
the number of different dimensions I'm
going to because this is a small example
I'm going to say it can be one
expression or more it can have a tiny
number of tokens you can parametrize it
on the number of times that code appears
let's say let's just say to hear you can
parameterize it on how many different
how many ways it can be different
because what we're doing is looking for
similar code when things are different
when there are differences in two pieces
two instances they'll get replaced by a
variable how many variables do you want
to introduce well let's say four as a
maximum that's our default and then
finally some sort of similarity score
because this is small that measures the
size of the code the generalization of
all these these instances to the to the
instances themselves let's just say
point2
though i think the default value would
work here and oh it still this similar
code detection has finished and we are
told arm that we just move this down we
get a report of all the all the clothes
we found okay if you run this on a
largest project and we you might get 40
or 50 clothes because this is a tiny
file we're getting one but what you see
is a report that tells you where the
code occurs it tells you how its
parameterised in each case and it gives
you a report so I can click on these
this is you know this is the equivalent
in Emacs of a nice clickable list in
something a bit more 21st century so
that shows us where we get the arm where
we have our instances and then we can
replace these what we do is take the new
definition okay that is a bit clunky I
agree and we just stick it in here at
the end let's paste that in so now we
have this new we have a new function now
what we can do using our dsl we can let
go to refactoring general here we are
batch clone elimination so we've got
something that will help us eliminate
clones from oh yeah so let's save that
now the interesting some stuff is
happening in that in that buffer at the
bottom what it says first of all is
you've introduced the the common
abstraction for all these clones is
called new fun is of course what else
would it be called you can't work out
what it's going to be called but i'm
going to call it loop so it says do i
want to rename it yes i want to call it
loop ok so it's renamed that and now of
course it's introduced these new
variables and I'm prompted for renaming
all of those
and watch we call those that's a message
so let's call that message 1 of msg 10
what's the second variable that's there
that's a string so let's call that
string arm new variable three what's
that called where's that old thats a
process so let's call that let's call
that paid and oh what's new variable for
its another strength so let's call it
string to string two okay now it says
old you want to swap the parameters well
do wants what the parameters no I think
I'm happy with those but we might want
to change the order oh oh please answer
yes no right what we want to do now
let's say yes now what this is doing is
running through all the instances and
it's saying do you want to replace this
instance with the the new function but
we found so let's say yes for that and
what this is done as you can see that
it's replaced those two instances with
that call from the new function now what
was nice is that we've used the domain
specific language under there to put
together rename your functions renaming
of variables replacement of a function
body by a call to the function and put
that together into that single
refactoring called batch clone
elimination and so we've got that but if
we decided we didn't want it
oh no more history to 120 help right
well that's something funny happened
there but we could in principle replace
that with um I what happened there oh
never mind I don't know I got all those
dictum out there oh dear something is
from something peculiar has happened in
there but never mind we've got all these
dick too much okay but you can see
what's going on there with the armed
with a clone detection and replacement
let me get back to my talk and let me
finish so you can see here I've run
through precisely that we renamed the
function and the variables we didn't
reorder the variables oh add to that we
add to the export list and then fold it
against the definition so we did all
that you've seen the demo you can see we
didn't just have it's not simply a
script when we do arm when we use the
dsl we have to deal with for example arm
if something changes its name we have to
be able to access the new thing by the
old name so we have to track changing
names and positions we deal with
generating commands and not simply
specifying specifying commands we also
have to deal with the transaction
allottee of refactoring so for example
if I'm armed if I'm doing a sequence of
refactorings in some cases it doesn't
matter if one of those fails so for
example if replacing the body of a
function of a function an instance of a
function body by call to the function
fails that doesn't matter we just leave
the code as it is but there are other
situations where if we're trying to
rename a function and we can't rename
every instance then the whole
refactoring should fail because unless
you rename everything you will arm your
change of semantics of your program so
some composite refactorings should be
treated as a transaction others
shouldn't and we allow the user to to
control that so it's not simply
scripting its scripting
in a domain-specific language and you
can see for example in clone detection
we call the transaction anatomic
refactoring if you like we say at the
top level all of these things must pass
so we we must be able to rename the
function rename all the variables to do
all these but within replacing instances
of the clone if one of those fails it
doesn't matter we don't treat that as a
transaction so we've got that nice
control over non transaction this
particular part is non-transactional but
the whole thing is a transaction okay
and we get leverage out of embedding
this in Erlang so we have the embedded
dsl here for example we can use this
macro this allows us to use the old name
mfa for whatever that function is called
currently after some renaming we can
call user input this describes a
refactoring so the dsl stuff is pink but
we're using our land constructs within
that so we're using the fact that we've
embedded that dsl in Erlang to give us
the power there yep okay and I am NOT
going to talk about WS toolkit beyond
saying what it allows us to do is
automate a whole lot of stuff for doing
web services testing so we can use this
as a way of generating code and in fact
generating arm refactorings for evolving
that web services testing code I wanted
to say because um saver many thanks to
who kingly who did work on this with me
for a number of years she's now doing
all sorts of horrendous refactorings and
so on for a large telecoms company in
the UK but you know I'm very very
grateful indeed for all the work she's
put into this over the years and we're
very happy to have involvement and
collaborate with people this is where
you can this is our repository where you
can get
angular and some of the other things
we've been working on and I also want to
acknowledge support from these two
European projects so that's it okay
what's curious yeah what are you use two
parts so we use the the airline passer
so we've not written our own passer
because then you know with every time
you write something yourself you have to
maintain it and so that's a problem so
what we aim to do is recycle as much as
we could from the erlang the airline
toolchain now the disadvantage of that
is that you have to work around what
other people have done though the
airline plaster is very nicely
extensible so we can put things like
source code information source code
location information and so on into that
but if you work with your own parser
then you know you have complete control
over what you're doing but you have to
evolve it every time Erlang changes so
when maps come in you have to include
those you have to deal you have to
process macros in the same way so you
have that that sort of overhead so their
advantages and disadvantages okay thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
