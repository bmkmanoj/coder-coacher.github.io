today keynote ran a little bit long so
we're getting started late but should be
good for time so let's get started Who
am I I'm Ian Foster I'm the CTO and
co-founder of Orchestra do before
arbitrator actually worked for basho
helping to how hoping to build and sell
rioc but now I you know started a
company with a couple of other gentleman
called Orchestra I oh and orchestrate
that I oh we'll talk about a little bit
later but it's a service that basically
combines the best of all the no sequel
databases out there and exposes them is
a simple HTTP rest based service so that
there is ZERO software to install it
takes all of the effort out of out of
storing and creating data so yeah our
goal is to make starting according data
so easy you don't need databases it
sounds like a lofty goal but it's
certainly possible so what I'm going to
talk about today is talk a little bit
about why software becomes complex how
to counteract that complexity and
software talk a bit about the database
ecosystem and how the database ecosystem
has moved from kind of a place of
simplicity at least in terms of
simplicity in choice there was only one
choice now there's lots of choices and
how that complicates things on top of
that how the implied architecture is
necessary to run modern databases adds
complexity and how you know we can look
at soft waves with software to overcome
that sort of complexity so I want to
start off by i'm going to throw some
quotes into my presentation I
a good quote people have said much more
eloquently these idea than I will ever
be able to put them into words and
dextra is relatively eloquent he's a you
know everyone here I'm sure knows dextra
of course for detras algorithm but he
also invented semaphores and he was a
proponent of structured programming
which is really interesting because we
all do structured programs Lord XAR
really advocated for structured
programming it was a you know it was a
complete mask people were writing a lot
of things still in assembly languages or
in or in unstructured programming
languages with tons of go-to statements
he was really the first person to talk
about go to hell so anyway I just love
this quote simplicity is a great great
virtue but it requires hard work to
achieve it in education to appreciate it
and to make matters worse complexity
sells better I think this is really
interesting quote he he gave this in a
keynote speech he gave at the University
of Texas I think sometime in the 1970s
and it's still relevant to that and we
see complexity selling better and
enterprise software all the time in fact
we see certain companies that actually
think complexity is how value is added
or at least how they can encourage the
next sale they don't actually add value
to their to their you know the actual
abilities of their applications they
just add complexity whether it's
interface complexity or functional
complexity at the same time as
developers we very much fetishize
complexity so this image is of a Rube
Goldberg machine and I hope everyone is
familiar with Rube Goldberg machines but
the essential idea of a Rube Goldberg
machine is that you make you off you
skate a very simple task through a very
complex device and the reality is a lot
of our software reflects Rube Goldberg
machine
build these things and we don't quite
understand exactly how all the
connections work but were amazed that it
does some simple thing like retrieve our
data so I'm going to throw another
dextra quote out there just because I
can't help myself many a programmer
derives a major part of his professional
excitement from not quite understanding
what he's doing from the daring risks he
takes and from the struggle to find the
bugs he should not have introduced in
the first place basically what d'etre is
saying is that you know very often we
write a piece of code and we're just so
excited that it works that we you know
ignore the fact that we don't understand
why it works or how it works or how we
would improve it and a lot of code that
goes into production is simply the first
pass of code that works so we find
ourselves with these Goldberg machines
it's interesting i'm not going to read
this other quote i have here but
Nicholas worth the inventor of Pascal it
was actually an antagonist of detras in
fact Pascal could be argued to be the
opposite of a structured programming
language seem to identify exactly the
same process happening in software which
is that you know that people write
incomprehensible code very often and not
just that sometimes people rebel and
admiration of them really complex code
this is a sequel statement that someone
ruined a blog post on this is not a or
generated sequel statement someone
actually wrote this piece of code and
expected other people to have some idea
what it does from what I can tell when
I've taken a look at it it does
something in has something to do with
the property taxes I'm not sure where
and how it's calculating them with some
stored in a single table and they're
calculating property taxes in a sequel
statement that is completely
incomprehensible I'm this you know some
guy got his rocks off over this query
and two ends I've probably done the same
over equally complicated convoluted code
so that's you know complexity and
software is driven by two things by you
know vendors thinking that they add
value from complexity and from our
fetishization of complexity so I want to
shift gears a little bit and just talk
about a quiet revolution that's in
progress in in software and it's been
going on for almost 20 years now and
it's actually behind this revolution is
a simple economic force which I'm going
to talk about but basically the
revolution is that software developers
and software companies are doing less
work we're relying on software that we
haven't built to do a lot more and you
know there's really three components to
this revolution the first one was open
source software you know your Linux
really kicked off the revolution open
source software obviously canoe predates
Linux but I don't know that Stallman got
many converts until they have a
reasonable Colonel that actually works
the second component of this revolution
is actually the cloud is is virtual
hardware that you can go ahead and use
for you know very very little money
paper an hour switching your calls from
a from a capital structure to an
operating cost structure this is a big
deal in fact so much so that the next
thing that sits on top of it it's almost
like a layer of so cloud software was
built on top of open source and then we
have this thing being built on top of
clouds which are api's or
public services and these sit next to
clowns are on top of clouds the api's
I'm talking about or things like twilio
and SendGrid and all these nice API for
making it easy for us to do things that
we could write on our own but would be
really complex and time-consuming and it
may take us as long at a feature like
sending text messages as it is to write
the initial program to do whatever we
want to do and I think that well who
here is his familiar with product codes
I'm not sure anyone's going to be
familiar with him he is a Nobel Prize
winning or he was a Nobel Prize Bob a
Nobel Prize winner in economics he died
at 102 in September and he is actually
one of the most important economist's of
the 20th century yet very few people
talk about him he wrote this amazing
paper in 1937 called the nature of the
firm and what Ronald Coase did was he
studied why do corporations exist
because it's a bit of a conundrum but
why do firms exist why do any work why
does any organization exists because you
know economics is very much the study of
markets and winning model markets you
generally model individuals interacting
with each other individual agents
interacting with each other so why do
you have these units that are non
marketing these organizations that in
fact look very much like a socialist
economy one that doesn't involve money
one that just involves internal trade
for with no monetary exchange and he
tried to understand why use organization
exist and let me just read this quote
and then kind of summarize the simple
idea a firm will tend to expand until
the cost of organizing an extra
transaction within the firm become equal
to the cost of carrying out the same
transaction by means of exchange them on
the open market or the cost of
organizing another firm basically what
firms do is they optimize for
transactions that are more expensive to
perform on the open market so firms will
continue to expand until it becomes
cheaper to do that function elsewhere to
buy and to pay for that function with
someone else or to spit out another firm
to to do that same function so the
fundamental limits of how big
organizations are get it will get is
actually driven by economic property of
the cost of doing any marginal function
so this trend we're seeing of
open-source software cloud computing and
API is kind of revolutionising IT is all
about firms effectively outsourcing
functions they formerly did before
instead of building software or buying
hardware or creating services to use
internally companies are relying on
external ones now this may seem like a
very trivial insight in fact it did when
coast road is paper everyone went well
that's obvious well no one had written
no one had put it eloquently in fact
most interesting insights and the ones
that don't seem that interesting but you
haven't thought about before so again
I'm going to shift gears a bit and talk
about databases because I think
databases tie all three of these trans
together the revolution in databases is
very much type it open source software
and cloud cloud infrastructure so
databases back in 2005 we're like Model
T Fords when they were first released
which was you can have any color as you
like as long as it's black basically
there were a couple of databases out
there
Oracle who had Microsoft sequel to ever
you have the open source alternatives
but effectively they were all the same
they were relational databases with you
know various sequel derivatives but they
all did the same thing maybe there was
some specific feature that your
enterprise valued some reporting feature
but they were all very much the same
looking at the database market in 2013
we see something very different so I
actually went out and tried to count all
of the database is actually introduction
that weren't introductions seven years
ago and I came up with 25 this is a low
estimate because I think even just
seeing some of the databases that
LinkedIn I think has open source to
databases this year Facebook one so
those are obviously in production but 25
databases in production that didn't even
exist not a single line of code was
written for seven years ago yes these
years okay and Mark logic is actually a
bit older than seven years so okay
amnesia memcache berkeley DB yeah i
think actually if you read these squares
not all 25 of them actually i would say
that well amnesia has been in production
for more than seven years berkeley DB
has the others mostly not anyway doesn't
change the point i I'll substitute
amnesia with something else so I'm just
curious before we move on and talk died
a little bit more into these databases
how many people run a you know no sequel
database Kevin esha included even though
it existed before no sequel existed as a
term how many people here have a sequel
database in production I'm just curious
which databases people are using up is
anyone running to Sandra no real okay
mongodb a couple of people is anyone
running elasticsearch on one more and
then we'll move on I'm solar cloud or
just so we're now okay interesting
it seems this this conference that more
people raising their hands were react
than others i've been to not
surprisingly it's a very much functional
programming focus conference or
alternative programming languages
conference so excuse me um I kind of
want to lay out a bit take a second step
away from the core thesis I'm trying to
put forward and just look at the
database market and try and get an
understanding of what it looks like
right now how it's changed and we're
going to completely put aside relational
databases for right now at least for
relational query is I'm actually going
to include a couple of relational
databases around these core online three
types but we're not going to talk
directly about relational crates but
basically i'm going to divide the world
into five classes of queries and two
types of databases so the two types of
databases are scale up databases what i
mean by scale up databases or databases
that are built around a single server
model where to increase the size of up
the database you're going to need to
increase storage space or add more
memory whereas scale outfitters our
databases which to grow the size of the
data store or the number the amount of
throughput number of transactions
supported you scale up you add an
additional server so and then i'm going
to divide it into multiple different
types of grace so really the most
fundamental query type is key value in
fact um I forget who said it but
basically any any good database starts
the key value store it's I really can't
need any databases that don't have some
sort of key value layer at the base but
really in terms of key value databases
you have tons of options either scale up
or scale out and scale up you know
there's Berkeley DB which has been
around for a while you up here
couch jeebies mongodb s you can use
MySQL or or its actual storage engine as
a pure key value store in fact I think
they added key value API is to my sequel
so you can completely sidestep the
sequel interface if you want to and use
it as a pure key value store in terms of
scale out solutions you have me off
Cassandra you can throw a chase in their
facebooks my sequel thing probably could
fit there if you want to put MongoDB in
there you can but don't blame me when
you try scaling out okay so then we have
searched full text search type systems
scale up you have your solar and your
sphinxes scale out you have elastic
search solar cloud could be in there but
again I don't want to be blamed for
people's pain when they tried using
solar clouds so they don't put it in
there does anyone use solar cloud or
just solder just solder did you use
solar blood okay I'm told and I it's I
haven't tried it myself if everyone
who's used solar cloud has said that the
experience is terrible that it's
impossible to manage and I think the
elastic search team gets a lot of
business for people who are having solar
users who try to move to solar cloud and
find that it's an extremely painful
experience so they get a lot of new
customers that way that means said
there's some really cool stuff going on
in the solar project especially if you
want to engineer your own clustering
solution it's the clustering stuff that
stinks in solar cloud the actual
implementation of distributed queries is
just behind it's just actual cluster
management you have to throw new keeper
in there and it becomes a giant mess
anyway I'm now I'm actually going to
talk about some places where if you're
ambitious there's some market
opportunity is actually to start new
companies or new databases that still
haven't been filled so another core
online prototype is is geolocation
answering questions like what's near
this coordinate or what's you know
what's in the area that's
that these two polygons be the excuse me
the intersection of these two polygons
what's contained in that intersection or
what's exclusive to either one of them
those sorts of queries which are just
geo they're actually well they are they
are not just geographical but geometric
queries so in terms of scale up solution
the gold standard is post GIS you can
use MongoDB solar elastic search for
these geo queries but some they're
incredibly limited compared to post GI
house you can effectively ask questions
the question of what's near this point
with MongoDB or solar which is the
simplest of geo Correa's in fact i think
that there's sort of a curve of
disillusionment with geo as you dive
deeper into it because you find that
this simple queries actually don't
answer most of the interesting questions
they're great if you want to build a
really simple foursquare like thing or a
Yelp like thing but actually find very
quickly that those queries can't serve
things like um okay here's a point what
polygon and my inside of what what city
am I in what what's stative verb you
know what country on my name those
questions are actually not very well
served by any of the databases except
for post GIS and as a result it really
isn't a geo solution that scales out
very well that's a school feature it is
toasty is just as a no is an
extension on postgresql so then we have
our graph database in its or relation
databases these are databases that we
model relationships using vertexes and
directed edges neo4j is a really great
database if you're okay being on a
single server it can do a lot of things
very quickly because the entire data
sets in memory but that's the exact
limitation neo4j it's because
everything's a memory it's really fast
and you can do cool queries but if you
want to to on if you have a large data
set you're going to need to build some
scale absolution yourself there's
a interesting library called tighten
that I put in the scale out section that
sits on top of Cassandra or HBase and
allows you to scale out graph databases
the issue with Titan is I don't know
anyone running an introduction so yeah I
don't know that that I would recommend
that anyone put it run it for production
use cases the other side is that Titan
solves one class of graph problems
whereas if you're used to neo4j it
because it's in memory can kind of get
away with solving both classes of um
chief of graph questions both the local
graph search meaning you know here's a
vertex tell me what's within you know
three degrees you know please step out
word of this or you know simple local
graph queries really needs one type of
graph database whereas if you're trying
to ask questions like what's the
shortest path between these two vertexes
there's a whole different type of
database and if you're interested in why
those are different and why those that's
really complicated when it comes to
scale out databases I'll be happy to
talk with you afterwards it's a really
interesting problem someone wants to
take it on there's a lot of money in
that space because the neo guys don't
seem to be interested in either half of
that scale out thing I think simply
because they've engineered their
database to be the deal of graph but you
know you can't do that once you want to
scale out you have to focus on one class
of problems so the last type i'm going
to talk about are sort of time series
data bases or time oriented databases
obviously you can use mysql with your
primary key being a time stamp or any
relational database and that works
pretty well me trees are reasonable way
to model time series will not the best
something like HBase or some sort of
database that uses lsm trees is probably
going to be the best way to model that
sort of data because it sort of
naturally fits your sordid string tables
or really natural fit for time series
so took us a long time to get through
this slide and part of what I want to
communicate with it is that we've gotten
into the situation where who's heard of
the paradox of choice before this the
idea of the paradox of choice of that we
have a harder time making decisions when
we have more choice more choice makes it
very very difficult for us to decide
what the best thing is so choice is
brought complexity um in fact it's not
only the choice has brought complexity
inside users expectations or customers
expectations of what applications should
do have changed a lot of thats been
driven by mobile phones and by you know
multi-platform applications so we see
data architectures like clouds that has
for databases i if you're not familiar
with cloud cloud is a silly application
that tells you how good you are at using
Twitter basically and Facebook so but
they're using for databases not even
including all of the dupe batch stuff
they do to keep you your Klout score
just for their real time real time
queries and as a result they have a
pretty complicated architecture imager
is a service for serving lolpats and it
has arguably five or six databases they
have some strange extension 2h a
prophecy that does caching so I
concluded it but if really is five
databases but they have my databases for
serving images literally just images
lots and lots of locales so five
databases for a very simple service and
you know they've taken it upon
themselves to own this architecture to
own this complexity so I want to talk a
little bit about the idea of
distributing complexity who owns
complexity and I have a quote that I
think is really relevant it's from a
blog post that I have a linked
at the end of the presentation so here
it goes making something simpler is all
in the case of relocating relocating
complexity rather than eliminating it
from the user technology relationship
for example from the driver's
perspective a manual shift transmission
is more complex than an automatic
transmission but from an overall systems
perspective the automatic transmission
is equally or even more complex so the
point being is the difference between a
manual and an automatic transmission is
all about the user interface from the
perspective of the user an automatic
transmissions much simpler right there's
basically three modes Park reverse drive
of course you can add flex pay you can
have you know gate shifting or you can
go into first and force it into first
and second gear but really for most
users it's a much simpler interface than
a manual transmission but I know this
the author wrote that they're equally
complex and on that a transmission is
much more complicated anyone who knows
about transmissions or knows about all
automobiles there's that automatic
transmissions are much more complicated
to fill to maintain the point being is
that the complexity has been moved out
of the user interface and put into the
systems it's been pushed down away from
the user so I think Google is actually
the ultimate example of the relocation
of complexity google has the most simple
user interface one of the most simple
user interfaces ever conceived I mean
it's a text box as you type things into
and it gives you back relevant
information but at the same time Google
is also one of the most complex systems
ever devised they literally have over a
hundred thousand servers for just power
this tiny little user interface
distributed around the world with I
don't know actually how many database
that they have in their architecture
number of that lots of software it is
the ultimate distribution is simplicity
of interface versus complexity of
systems so I really like to think about
IT as having three different relevant
domains where complexity can be located
design systems and economics so design
is not just how it looks but how it
works to use a Johnny I vism systems is
what it's made of how that actually you
know how it actually powers that design
all of the hardware and software
necessary to make the thing actually
work and the economics is how it's paid
for pretty obvious so just to look at
these domains and ask ourselves you know
is this where complexity is located we
look at Google again obviously it's has
a very simple design but its systems are
incredibly complicated now the question
is how does that nomics fit into this
generally when you're thinking about IT
what you want is high degrees of
alignment between these domains so for
Google they actually have a high degree
of alignment between design and systems
they have a simple design powered by
very complex systems that tie into one
another very elegantly but their
economics are completely misaligned with
what they're building because their
economic self based around advertising
revenue I mean they have some alignment
they're serving advertisements in search
results but if you look at a company
like Amazon Amazon like the lips
specifically look at the case of AWS AWS
is a relatively simple design very
complex systems and then it's economics
all driven by economies of scale that
they that they get from that says those
systems themselves they actually get to
perform a bit of arbitrage and pricing
they can deliver to
you virtual machines cheaper than you
can actually pay for those physical
machines and maintain them yourselves
and that's because they have a high
degree alignment between all of those
domains we look at Twitter for example
they have one of the lowest degree of
alignment between all these spheres they
have a user interface that's you know
relatively simple it works very simply
but then the systems alignment is
actually pretty poor in Twitter's case
they they have underinvested in systems
which is why they had whale tails for
you know the first five years their
existence so what's interesting now what
we do want to you know look at is how do
we leverage systems from the design um
from a design perspective where does
that overlap and that is where ap is or
services come in that ap is or how we
expose our systems to that design
element to that functional user
interface element in terms of how to
expose the economic to the systems or
where that overlap comes in actually
kind of mentioned it with Amazon it's
actually in economies of scale generally
economies of scale or economies of scope
there are you know certain systems that
are actually more effectively built at
much larger scale and cloud computing is
driven by exactly that fact so api's
give us something that's cold that i
like to call leverage it's the concept
of leverage is simply when a complex
system has a simple interface it allows
us to leverage that complex system very
easily so on here's a quote from that
same blog post that I that I mentioned
before they talked about relocating
complexity and it's just as a note the
blog post is called the complexity of
simplicity by Chris Jordan you can
google for its and the link is in the
notes so good simplicity is complexity
disguise not complexity denied simple
idea
that like we said complexity can be
relocated but then you need to give
yourself some way to leverage that
complexity so let's talk a little bit
about some api's these fulcrums that
give us this leverage so who's here is
familiar with twilio twilio is a really
good service I really like it I've used
it quite a bit what it allows you to do
is use a simple HTTP rest api to send
text messages to make phone calls to
receive phone calls it's a really really
nice AP a-- hi now should you build a
system to interact with telephony
systems you would be building a very
very complex system but what truly Oh
does is they give you leverage they give
you this nice API that's simple I mean
sending a text message is as simple as
making a single HTTP request the same
goes for a telephone call um so I don't
know anyone's worked on this London were
in London so probably someone in the
room this work on payment processing or
in finance but I have no clue how
payment processing works and I don't
want to know this graph is or this chart
is supposed to represent something about
it but what's really great is we have an
API that allow us to leverage this
really complex systems that we don't
need to integrate with this complex
hellish nightmare um so you know we have
paypal stripe square which allows us to
simply have an interface that pass in a
credit card number in the case of stripe
over a REST API and the security code
name on the car and how much we want to
build someone and you're done that's it
it's that simple you don't even need to
worry about what's going on in the back
ends SendGrid is very similar to twilio
to focus on email i'm sure a number
of us here worked on on sending and
receiving emails and software it's
actually a really complex problem it
seems really simple on the surface but
sending emails is not all that simple so
now we get to the service that I work on
which is orchestrate and I don't know
why the animated gif is anything so
poorly what orchestrate does is it gives
you leverage over complex database
systems it says don't worry about the
database just worried about the query so
you have a nice simple interface lucene
queries and you get to leverage this
whole complex system I mean if you were
to build let's say this is actually a
graph of a you know large-scale
elasticsearch cluster the the idea being
that just in this chart they're
suggesting that you have what is it 20
storage nodes for masternodes 3 load
balancers and this doesn't even have
long aggregation or metrics I mean to
really maintain a good large scale
search cluster you're talking about 30
servers according to that here I mean
you can cut down on the storage node
point being you're still in the order of
20 servers it's a lot of complexity to
own that's a lot of different moving
parts you know it's starting to get a
bit rube goldberg ask again something
like Klout could very much get rid of
these for databases and instead just
focus I'm going to eat you out on a
point of leverage so um how long moving
up I'm guessing
eight minutes okay so I was thinking
about if we had time doing a live demo
but i think i will i'll hold off on that
but basically here comes the the sales
pitch orchestrate on Io is an HTTP rest
service that unifies the five most
common query types which we talked about
before when we started this this company
when we started orchestrated I oh we
actually spent about two months
analyzing for investors what really were
the querying types of our comment what
sort of databases most large-scale web
services and websites we're using and
we've got it narrowed down to actually
six query types so the one I'm not
including is is relational or sequel
queries but key-value full text search
graph time ordered events and
geolocation that's what orchestrate is
composed of you know what I think we
have a couple minutes to live down I
just want to show you just how simple
storing and querying data can be so give
me one second just to switch on display
mirroring
go all right
alright so this is the orchestrator bio
dashboard let's login we use Mozilla
persona or farm around for all because
we love services I don't know has anyone
written user registration I have no idea
what my password is so there we go all
logged in so this is the orchestra at
i/o dashboard and basically our goal in
orchestra is to make it so that from
going to sign up which is actually the
services in public beta so if you go to
our website and register you'll get an
invite the same day but basically we
want people to be able to go to the
website and get started for it I mean
obviously it's an HTTP rest api you can
use the client language of your choice
we have very nice if you I'd ops with
code examples in curl and go we're
adding Java and and and new Jade a soon
and I think someone's working on in our
life client point being pretty simple
API did it with good documentation so
you can get started quickly but we also
want users to be able to go and be able
to do do everything they can do with the
rest api from our dashboard so what
we've done is we've just created an
application applications a unit of
tenancy the equivalent of a database in
a in a you know party BMS or it's it's
the unit of isolation the unit of
tenancy so within an application we've
not members so we can have multiple
people working on it we can create a
revoke API keys and we can create
collections collections are like tables
in a relational database or buckets in
Rio or s3 so let's create a collection
called users
all right now obviously you can create
collections from the rest api directly
there's nothing here that you can't do
via the agrestic yacht so we can go
ahead and store data okay I'm going to
make a key cult in the name my name and
care how are we doing on time okay well
just quickly store an object great
simply by virtue of the fact that it's
stored we can now search for it we can
do any arbitrary we've seen query so
let's actually can do in age range query
so you could say age from 20 to 30 and
of course we get my name back and
obviously just by storing the data
orchestrations recognize the implicit
data types it's realized that the age is
an integer and it's in depth stood as an
integer it's indexed my name is a string
so we can do even things like regular
expression queries we could say anything
with
yeah and do something what'd I do wrong
how I should do period plus I'm doing
something wrong period plus that's a
good question I don't believe it is but
maybe it is well point is we could do
normal lucene queries like that works
you know what I realize what the problem
is I don't I don't want to get into it
but right now it's simple but it's not
worth it we only have a couple minutes
and i do want to answer questions see if
we can answer one question so that's
doesn't work a straight you can see we
have events and graph as well if you do
want to take a look at it i can give
whoever is interested in demo out in the
main hall or you can sign up and it's
pleasing get started with yep but the
question so the note make sense sure
it's a comment if i see that what's
missing from your whole idea actually is
that everything you mentioned make sense
for example I don't want to my way to
see the complexity on payment systems
and all that stuff but usually inside
the company you get a point that every
single bit of efficiency that you can
gather and it can be economical
efficiency actual matters so if a paypal
or stripe takes three or four percent of
transaction you may want to go down to
0.1 percent ah yeah that's that's true
but really so one of the things I didn't
post is you actually have to ask
yourself where does my organization
derive value and if it is in that part
if that's where you're going to hook
so that's where your margin is going to
come from then yeah absolutely you may
want to focus on building it yourself
but in most cases where your focus where
additional margin is created is by
improving your relationship with your
users it's not simply by exploiting back
and I agree at some point once you
exhausted that some at some point but
most companies don't reach it in fact if
you look at most organizations they're
incredibly dysfunctional and they have
huge efficiencies that can be gained
simply by better organization so there's
lots of I totally agree there there you
can get additional margin from saving
money I mean AWS can get too expensive
in fact if you have economies of scale
building your own cloud can actually be
cheaper or binder on servers so agreed
um it basically maybe just until you get
into that page that will help you so
basically what I'm saying here that if
basically before you get to that point
it's better to get started and to get
you to don't you don't go to market you
get into a market you get users and then
we get into this efficiency problem and
then you will search for on top of it if
you went to add some experience with
this in fact if anyone wants to talk
about this I can help you with it as
well as if you went to a VC today and a
venture capitalist and said I'm starting
a company I need two million dollars and
we're going to hire engineers and buy
servers they would say well I'm sorry
that we're not giving you money to buy
servers yeah we don't we don't want
companies that are going to have their
seed financing on on capital costs I'm
going out and buying server so you will
literally have a hard time getting
investment from traditional venture
capitalists if you if you are actually
buying servers or building payment
processing systems so yeah it's I
totally agree with you you
you should focus on on solving your user
problem initially you haven't talked
about it but I'm what's your plans with
your economic model on how you planning
to charge for this okay so have a
follow-up question which is do you plan
any form of kind of private cloud so
selling software rather than just
selling a service great questions first
question we will go public in late
January the pricing model should be
about what we're going to do is some
units of a million queries gets puts the
leads whatever you want um units of the
million for AIDS will be about ten
dollars so just as a note on one per
second for an entire month is about 2.5
million queries most applications fall
into that range of one off for a second
I know it sounds like nothing there's
very few applications and actually
averaged a thousand dollars per second
and even when you get into thousand ops
per second you're not talking about an
insane amount of money especially if
you're talking about a supported
database contract you're you're getting
into you know the 20k very quickly to
did thousands of ox per second in terms
of private cloud um we do intend to have
some sort of private cloud solution but
we don't intend orchestrating ever to be
a single tenant solution we would sell
it into a private cloud let's say if
you're you know Barclays or something
like that and you're building a private
cloud and you need a database subsystem
vector because right right now one of
the big problems with the private clouds
that I see out there is there literally
running databases on top of virtual
machines on those clouds and it's not a
solution that's going to work on on
general purpose clouds amazon very
focused on providing instance types that
work for databases most clouds out there
or not and so i think a lot of private
clouds are looking for something that
they can put on the side and say here's
a API to data storage so in that case we
interested but not you know we're not
going to sell this like box software
basically so really appreciate your time
great questions it actually helped me
tie up any presentation so thank you
thank you for your time hope hope I kept
you entertained at least thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
