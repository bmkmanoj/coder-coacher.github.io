in advance for speaking quickly if I
don't we might only just solve the
halting problem and that would be a
shame next yes ice there's number
affiliations up here one of them is
actually important I still actually work
for the White House I've been working
there for I mean gosh almost three years
now so it's it's been a journey I have
to say as of late and this comes with a
disclaimer so I'm required to put this
before every talk that I give which is
that this is a personal talk this talk
may not reflect the views of the
President or the administration what I
can tell you is that they used to
and if you want to know official White
House policy these days you can find out
in this cool site called Twitter all
right so with that out of the way let's
talk about the war on air so let's I
think we can all agree that air and code
is bad right we don't like air so
there's code for software which I think
most of us are used to dealing with and
we get errors in code for software
really awful things happen you know
Sophie get it wrong in the rocket the
rocket explodes that's bad and we get it
wrong and lots of other stuff you get
yeah vulnerabilities like heartbleed
which can lead to billions of dollars in
damage as a whole so covert here's a
good for software that's bad there's a
good for people is also bad in this case
I'm talking about genetic code it's just
another kind of code by the end of the
talk I hope you'll understand that it
has a syntax and semantics just like the
code that you and I typically write when
we're programming so you get errors and
code for people you get rare genetic
disorders you get predispositions for a
handful of diseases and you sometimes
get fact even oftentimes get stuff like
cancer these are all errors in genetic
code that lead to these things and I'm
going to argue that we can fix both
kinds of errors in code and to the
extent that I can draw a unifying theme
at all between these two kinds of error
fixing I would say that it's
approximation that we can use notions of
approximation to find ways to fix errors
in code for people and heirs in code for
software now they're very different
kinds of approximation but is still
approximation so the main idea is for
this talker as follows let's let's talk
about you know software briefly first
let's suppose that we could solve the
halting problem so if we could solve the
halting problem if we had some magic
function that told you whether or not
some program for some input halted or
loops forever
iri assert that you could wipe out the
vast majority of software's that are out
there today and well I'll go into some
detail about this in just a moment but
of course we can't solve the halting
problem so what we're gonna do instead
is approximate solutions to the halting
problem we're gonna use a technique
called abstract interpretation I'll walk
you to your specific technique called
abstract abstract machines that allows
you to get approximate the solution to
holding room or really approximate the
behavior of a program and the short
version of this if we're really were
just approximating the halting problem
the one way to see it is instead of
saying
yes it halts no it doesn't you have a
third option you can't you can say I
don't know because you can always say I
don't know and now the halting problem
or the approximate halting problem is
trivial to solve you can just return I
don't know all the time all right so
let's talk about people well so for
people you know we argue if we if we
look at their genetic code and we
isolate the errors is the cause of their
disease then we can also find an optimal
solution for them so ideal pill or
treatment that they can take that will
serve to correct for our count for that
genetic defect someday we'll be able to
go and do like live patching and that
some days not even that far away but for
right now we using even today's
technology we can use pharmaceuticals to
account for errors in genetic code so we
want as a function that goes from people
or their really their data into a pill
or a procedure that works for them and
of course this function is also in
computable but we can approximate this
as well and so instead of giving you
back a single pill you should take it'll
be a set of pills that might work for
you or potentially some experiments you
need to run that will get you closer to
finding out the pills you need to take
so let's talk about fixing software
first so let's just also agree upfront
that software is terrible
and you know what I mean by that it's
like when you look at like the state of
software today you know we don't really
have on our bills we have
vulnerabilities with their own brands
and brands and product lines even I mean
this is this is the state of software in
2017 it cost billions of dollars and we
just sort of go oh whatever that's fine
and you know pretty much everything is
hackable now and in fact I was even
surprised to learn that even restrooms
these days in information security but
if this surprises you all that really
means is that you've just never been to
Japan because I guarantee you you can
hack these toilets so why is it that
software is just so awful why is it so
terrible well you know there's there's
been some detailed analysis out there
about why software is awful you know so
ya see programmers so what's what are
some solutions to the problem to that
specific problem the fact that we keep
writing code and legacy languages like C
and writing all these terrible honor
abilities well what we need to do is we
need to engineer software and you know
that's interesting because there's this
field of study called software
engineering but I would argue that
software engineering is not really
engineering at all and I apologize to
probably the half of you in this room
that are software engineers so with that
in mind you know what why do I say that
well an engineer uses prediction if
you're a real engineer anyway use
predictive models and you know for
example if you're doing you know
anything classical engineering you have
like you know F equals MA and fro so
from from force you can go to
acceleration to acceleration you can go
to velocity from velocity you can go to
distance and now you can sort of predict
exactly how you know particles paths
will evolve and you know if you are you
know using this as an engineer you know
and say designing the targeting system
on a battleship you can use this to very
precisely predict the path of a
projectile if you're going after some
enemy battleship and that's that's
actually quite useful however if you're
if you're software engineer things don't
always work out quite so cleanly and a
good example I think a better analogy
even for software is if we look at how
we build bridges versus how we actually
engineer software today so and I'm
always reminded I was instantly reminded
when I was taking software engineering
as an undergrad of this Calvin and
Hobbes cartoon right here because you
know they're driving across a bridge and
Calvin asked his dad hey Dad how do they
know what the load limit on a bridge is
and his dad very smartly replies who his
dad is clearly a programmer says well
they just drive bigger and bigger trucks
across the bridge until it breaks then
they weigh the last truck and they
rebuild the bridge cuz that's how you
that's how you know one thing is okay
that's obviously not how we do it with
bridges but this is exactly how we do it
with software we just have tons of test
cases until we break our code yeah but
if you're an actual and you're building
a bridge of course you have statics and
dynamics you have Newtonian you tensile
strength models all kinds of to predict
how a bridge will behave under a
continuum of circumstances that you know
exactly what a bridge will do every time
something drives across it so can you
predict software can we take software
engineering and make any real
engineering can we apply the same
principles of prediction to the to our
field then we know whether we can do
this or not no we can't do this and
is Alan Turing who ruined it so he gave
us the only commandment of computer
science that you cannot decide the
halting behavior of a program because of
this all the fun stuff we'd like to do
about particular burger behavior also
becomes unsolvable what a bummer you
know so the way I like to think of it is
that you know whereas physicists have
black holes and event horizons beyond
which you cannot see computer science we
have loopholes you know and it's really
loops and recursion that drive the the
difficulty in reasoning about program
behavior these are the the things beyond
which we cannot reason automatically so
what can we do about this how do we
solve this problem
well we there's a several things we
could do as I mentioned earlier you know
we could use better languages we could
stop using C and C++ that would be great
you know we could we could move on from
this you know 1960s 70s technology onto
something at least ninety zero or
perhaps some vastly superior and ultra
universe all together but we just came
here I tears in the first place you know
that would be interesting okay and
actually in it part of my life as a
computer scientist which ended five
months ago I did some research for the
per for for DARPA where we actually sort
of took this as a theme and said can we
come up with better ways of doing
programs that we don't write errors in
the first place that was the theme of
crash so I could I could give a talk
about that but I'm not gonna give that
talk today or what we could do instead
is we could solve the halting problem
yeah so I think this is actually easier
so we'll just solve this and and what
we're really going to do is approximate
solutions to the halting problem and use
these as we would if as if we could
actually solve it and to do this what
we're gonna do is we're gonna play the
static analysis game so what I mean by
the static analysis game well I want you
to imagine or visualize the execution of
a program as a sequence through some
state space over time it's just state
state state state state all the way
through its execution so what we're
doing when we play the static analysis
game is we can't okay we obviously
cannot predict this trajectory exactly
that's solving the halting problem but
what we can do is put upper and lower
bounds on this path you know so we can
define sort of the region of the state
space that through which it might
traverse as it executes so then what we
can do is we can look at bad regions of
the state space you know places where
we're overflowing integers places where
we have buffer overflows to reference
signal pointers places where we have
malware and we can say okay well those
are the reasons we don't want our
program to ever go
and you know if you look at the bounds
we competed here it's not quite tight
enough to rule out malware and it's not
quite tight enough to rule out buffer
overflows but if we come up with a
tighter approximation of the trajectory
it actually is and now we could say they
look no matter how is program evolves it
doesn't go to the bad places
so we trust it this is the static
analysis game coming up with ever better
approximations of your Perkins behavior
without actually becoming in computable
or of course intractable you know if you
go deeply exponential that's no good
either so how do you play this game well
there's a general technique called
abstract interpretation developed by the
kudos back in the late 70s and I'm gonna
show you a particular way of doing
abstract interpretation called
abstracting abstract machines this is a
way of building a model of a program
behavior so you can essentially model
that trajectory or bound that trajectory
in some way so the the original
publication on this is from me and David
Einhorn seven years ago now oh my god
and it's an AI CFP but what I really
recommend if you want know more about
this is read the journal version which I
so lovingly put so much effort into but
nobody does read because what I did here
is I put all the math side by side with
transliterated Haskell code so it's an
executable paper you can just take stuff
out of this paper and run it directly in
Haskell and so now you can actually you
know follow along directly with
executable model of the paper so what's
the core idea behind app striking object
machines well you take your interpreter
for your language and you pass it
through this process called abstracting
abstract machines and at the other end
is not an interpreter but an
approximator and now this approximator
can predict for you how a program will
evolve so in this this is the scheme
requires this very specific structure to
the interpreter before you do it and the
structure is as follows you take your
program and you have to have some sort
of injection function that gets you into
the concrete state space for this
interpreter so you take your program
inject it into a state space then what
you do is you have a step function that
takes the state gives you another state
so now you have a model of execution for
your programs here's an example of a
particular step function this happens to
be for an abstracted version of dalvik
but I'm not gonna go into the details of
any particular semantics today I just
just want to show you that these things
exist so then what you do is you take
your program you inject it into your
initial concrete state and then you just
step step step
step-step that's her model of execution
for the input to abstract any abstract
machines now if you could actually do
this if you could just trace out all the
these states to which a program might
ever go
you could then ask is there a
vulnerability in any of these states and
if your program terminate it's great you
can answer this question very easily
well but if it doesn't like many
programs might then you know you there's
no way in advance of knowing exactly
what your programs gonna do you can't
just map out an infinite number of
states you can't just you can't just do
that so we have to do is we have to
abstract in some way so to abstract
and make this a company tractable
problem we're gonna approximate and
we're gonna do an affine an abstract
execution of this program in an
approximating state space now some
precision will be lost that's the price
you pay for getting around the halting
Braman alou's some precision to do this
we come up with an abstraction map that
takes us from the concrete state space
into this finite abstract approximating
state space and this this map is going
to be maintained under a new way of
executing the program so if we start off
in a correspondence with some concrete
say turn on check state and we take a
step in the concrete interpreter and
this approximating abstract interpreter
then this this abstraction relationship
is going to be maintained in some way so
that we know that no matter what path we
take through the concrete execution
we're always going to maintain this
correspondent have a representation and
the abstract rolled up there now if
you're being very nitpicky about this
it's not really a map it's actually a
composition of a map with some sort of
partial order because we can actually
have you know states that approximate
other states and we're allowed to
arbitrarily widen the the precision of a
state at any given point but that's
that's not a particularly important
detail so how do we do abstracting
object machines well it's it's a
multi-step process and the first step is
to diagnose the problem it's to figure
out why if you just take your program
and run it it might not stop and we've
sort of already talked about this if you
just have this machine that's running
there's a reason it may never terminate
any of these individual states it
actually could be unbounded if there's
an unlimited number of states you
through which you could traverse and if
you look inside the state or typical
state for most languages you'll find the
following four components you're gonna
have yeah an instruction you're on
you're gonna have the frame pointer or
some model the environment you're gonna
have the heap or the store or the in a
stack or the continue our current
continuation and three of these
components can be unbounded you could
have an infinite large heap and if you
large stack or
about a number of frame pointers so
that's that's the sort of the core
problem we have if we want to get down
to a finite state space these are the
three areas we have to attack because
that's the source of the unboundedness
that's what we have to break in order to
build an approximator so the key step is
step two which is to abstract or really
two finite eyes in some way we're going
to take that concrete state space and
make it finite so how do we do that well
I'm going to use a model of computation
build a CES K machine whose actually due
to fly sit and actually Dan Frieden
sitting right back there
so this is a model of computation that
they developed almost three decades ago
now and it's still valid actually for
modeling the vast majority pregnant we
just want to model today so you can take
almost any pregnant ladies and you can
model it semantics using a CES K machine
and there's four components here you
have a control component and an
environment component a store component
and a continuation component so I'll
step us through a CSK machine now a
little more detail and then we're gonna
figure out how to make each of these
components that are unbounded bounded so
the control component if you're dealing
with something like a function languages
and it's gonna be an expression it can
also be a statement if it's if it's not
a functional language the environment is
a map from variables to addresses so
this is sort of a two-phase lookup
machine you have to go from variable to
address then you go into the store to go
from address to value and then we have
the stack or the continuation and the
stack is an unbounded sequence of stack
frames so there there's multiple sources
when bad at is here addresses are
unbounded you know the number of stacks
is unbounded because we could keep
pushing frames forever
and of course values themselves are also
inbound because values include things
like integers there's an embedded number
of integers so we've to come up with
some way of approximating these three
components start with values so let's
assume in a very simple language that
all we have are integers and objects
well integers are pretty easy to
abstract we can find in ties these
relatively in a military straightforward
fashion well take all the energies and
we'll just smoosh them down so instead
of having you know about to negative
infinity positive if any will just have
negatives your own positive and then any
injur can be represented any abstract
ergy can be present as a combination of
essentially their their polarities and
once we have this we can model
arithmetic on this abstract version of
integers as well so we won't go into
detail into that just assume that you
could figure out the details on your own
so now what we're left with is
approximating objects and an object is a
is a pairing of a class
an environment or for dealing with a
functional language then what we're
really playing with here are closures
and a closure as a lambda paired with an
environment so the example kind of
approximating process applies here as
well and you know so we have a finite
number of classes for any given program
and then what we need to do is come up
with an approximation for environments
because what we're doing for field
lookup is we're going from the the field
name to an address for that for that
value so once we we're gonna assume
however that we're going to approximate
environments some other way so if we
assume that we have a bounded number of
environments and of course we've bounded
objects as well so now we have an
abstraction for values so we need to go
back to our whole state space and pick
out the next thing to finite eyes and in
this case that's going to be addresses
because if you have finite eyes
addresses then you've also finite sized
environments because the only thing that
environments depend on or addresses so
how do we find it eyes addresses well we
just declare them to be finite that's it
so we go from unbounded set now down to
some arbitrary finite set and we declare
that there is an abstraction from
concrete addresses to abstract addresses
and actually this this is probably one
of those interesting parts of the talk
because playing around with how you do
this abstraction how you partition up
your the division between concrete and
abstract dresses this determines the
complexity the speed the precision
everything about the analysis is driven
by this choice right here two decades of
research in static analysis could be
summarized as playing with this function
I'm gonna skip over that entirely so
we've got we now have a finite set of
addresses in the extreme case you can
use a singleton set you can have a
single abstract address it's not gonna
be very precise analysis but you'll get
an analysis so with that in mind as soon
as you have a finite set of addresses
values are gonna start merging because I
gonna start sharing addresses you know
you're gonna come to a point where
you're gonna do a malloc and some yeah
we're not using to see really and it's
gonna say oh that address is already in
use but you're gonna assign it anyway
and now two objects have to live at the
same location so that's why the range of
the store now expands to allow multiple
values to live at any given address in
this you now you can see where some of
the imprecision is coming from if you
look up that address now and say what
object are you says well maybe on this
one maybe on this one I don't know
anymore
and so that's where things start to get
imprecise when we find it sighs but all
this really leads at this point is
continuations to
to finalize so what we'll do is to say
well we'll do a little refactoring we'll
say well that this unbounded list of or
sequence of stack frames you can think
of it as a linked list of stack frames
so when we look at it this way we can
say well all we have to do now is cut
this will recursive not between
continuations continuations to do that
there's a technique and I was checking
certain machines called threading
something through the store so we're
gonna store allocate continuations
they're actually laying we desire
implementations and languages that do
this
so like SML and j uses heap-allocated
continuations it actually does that and
we're gonna essentially do this the
semantic equivalent thereof and you know
the reason we does this is we do this is
that it pushes the unboundedness of this
stack into the unboundedness of
addresses and so now as long as we can
find it has addresses we can also find
ties the stack in some way so to go back
to the semantics the little surgery we
have to do here is we put continuations
in the store and now addresses and
evaluations left side by side when you
want to look up the next stack frame
beneath something then you go ahead and
and look up its address and of course
now when you want to return to something
when you're actually looking at its
consideration you might return to
multiple continuations so you can get
you know confusion on return close this
is something that's just gonna happen
when you do static analysis all right or
might show you fix for that in a second
all right so now we've actually
finalized everything so now we have this
finite abstract state space through
which we can execute this approximator
and and figure out what these programs
are actually doing so we have an
abstracted abstract machine and that's
the essence of abstract answering
machines just go through this process
and then play it over for the semantics
so the semantics go from this through
the machine into something it looks like
this and again the specifics don't
matter for today the point is that
there's a process you follow a mental
discipline that you go through and the
state space and in the semantics for
returning this into an approximator so
you want to know a whole lot more about
this you can watch recording of Mitaka
game the corresponds to a blog post I
made which goes through how to build an
abstract interpreter following this
entire process for a very simple
register transfer language in about 80
minutes so I just live code the whole
thing right in front of you that steps
through everything I just talked about
so question now is let's assume that
I've just showed you how to solve the
halting problem to play the static
analysis game the question is can we win
it can we actually do something
meaningful with it and I would argue
that the answer is yes and I have some
proof that this is true through another
DARPA program I perseverant called a PAC
or automated program analysis for
cybersecurity and this was really
predicated on a terrible idea
not my terrible idea somebody else's
terrible idea so the idea was let's go
ahead and give every soldier in the US
military an Android device and let's let
them download like the drone strike app
that so they could call in drone strikes
or whatever they want
using their Android phone this is
obviously terrible idea to have like
this open app store with open apps and
and people anybody can submit whatever
they want so well they at least
recognize that that was a bad idea he
said okay well we this this could be bad
you know we could have people who are
leaking their locations to enemies
through these malicious applications and
stuff like this could happen so let's
let's not allow that let's have an app
auditor that magically figures out
what's safe and what's not and so good
apps come in they pass for the auditor
if it's valid after some sort of scan
you say okay you go in the App Store
you're safe you have no malware
then if some malicious app from some bad
actor goes in and we say no you're bad
you you're malicious you cannot go in
the App Store after you've been scanned
you go out so that's the idea that's
what this program is supposed to build
was you know a way of building this
auditor for good and bad apps so we said
we signed up to do that we're like yeah
let's go ahead and do that why not let's
see if we can figure out what's good and
what's bad and to do this program every
six months we had to compete in an
engagement with red team's where they
would throw apps at us we would play App
Store and we have to figure out what's
good what's not and we said it's bad we
also had to say and here's where the
malware is this is what's been hidden in
this code it's a six months in on a very
first engagement our accuracy and
determining what was friendly what was
not was 0% we it was like total failure
I remember going to that that p.i
meeting afterwards and looking at the
program manager who'd just given me all
this money to do this in a go you know
sometimes there's a difference between
the vision that you put in a research
proposal and the deliverable that you
end up with at the end of the day
and yeah and you know the the animated
gets placated him for at least six
months you know it's like no next time
it actually has to work so by the end of
this over a number of years we actually
got better and better and better at
doing this we've did a ton of research
and static analysis to make this
incredible tool for actually finding
malware in code and for the last two
engagements our accuracy was actually a
hundred percent you know we got
everything exactly right so I you know I
did this this to me was sort of some
empirical evidence that hey maybe we can
do this in practice maybe we can play
the game so well that you know for all
intents and purposes we can solve the
halting problem and you know you know
all this research that we did use some
of the key innovations if you really
want to know what it was you know one
thing we did is we broke away from using
finite state models of approximations to
push down systems so pushing systems are
still not yet Turing complete and so we
can so even though they have this
infinite configuration space you can
still compete lots of interesting things
about them statically so the key
intuition for how we did this is we took
the continuations out of the individual
states and we put stacked changes on the
edges to say that you're pushing a frame
popping a frame we're doing no static
change at all when you transition from
this state to this state and so we built
up graphs the finite graphs that look
like this essentially we have published
a number of papers that establish this
and then used it going forward we also
forget how to make these into these
approximate O's go really fast we host a
number of papers on optimizing
abstracting abstracted abstract machines
and today I think we can actually up
these things to be reasonably fast as a
result figured out how to analyze
parallel programs we also figured out
how to analyze burgers in parallel
including even on GPUs and we use some
other tricks too like like doing using
Sat solvers to speed up the computation
of these analyses as well so we did a
lot of tricks like that to make them go
pretty fast we also started layering
more interesting analyses on top of it
so that wasn't just building a model
program behavior it's also telling you
something about the program
- like computing information flow
analysis - saying you know it's not just
this kind of information it's such as
this information it's this kind of
information like this came from the
network where this came from this
sensitive data source and this is where
it flowed - and then we combined all
this together to do actual you know
principled malware detection by the end
so we have a follow-on project for this
another dumb program called stack we're
going after even richer kinds of bad
things richer kinds of vulnerabilities
so now we're not looking at just we're
looking at sort of the you know regions
of code that
themselves be malicious not just
individual points in the code and by
that you know we're really going after
things like side-channel attacks and
complexity attacks where malicious
inputs could lead to this exponential
explosion and in behavior so now we'll
analyze regions of code we'll summarize
them with things like recurrence
relations and these recurrence relations
solvers to say this region of code has
complexity like this and that that could
be expensive therefore there could be
one of these vulnerabilities right here
so that's what we're doing in this this
follow-on program and we're again it's
basically the same pattern got 0% on the
first engagement and we're moving up
from there so you know I think there is
hope that even things as challenging or
is difficult to reason about his
complexity attacks could fall under the
auspices of auditing under static
analyzers same for space attacks and
even side channels so in conclusion I
think at least for the halting problem
Alan Turing might wish to revise his
statement if you were around today he
might actually say well maybe maybe you
can solve the halting problem sometimes
in practice when it actually counts so
with that in mind let's move on to
cancer so what about people how do we
fix errors in people and I'm gonna argue
that we can and a lot of it is actually
thanks to this guy who really
kick-started this whole movement for
precision medicine in the US so he
launched this precision medicine
initiative three years ago and precision
medicine to me is all about fixing
errors in people at the level of genetic
code so what is precision medicine
actually and how do we fix these errors
well I would say it's really data-driven
medicine so if you're using data to
optimize the health care of an
individual patient you were doing
precision medicine and the piece of data
that everyone's super excited about
right now is the genome we're now
considering how do we do healthcare and
the context of knowing your genome if we
know the blueprint for you or your
cancer what more can we do that we
couldn't do when we didn't know that and
at the end of the day where we're trying
to do is deliver the right drug to the
right patient at the right time and that
was the mantra that Obama kept repeating
over and over you know working for him
that that's the essence of precision
medicine right drug to the right patient
right time so how do we cure cancer well
I'm gonna argue upfront the cancer is
not a disease cancer is in fact many
diseases and in particular it is many
rare diseases
so using reduction like a good computer
scientist I'm gonna say that we don't
really need to cure cancer but we really
have to do is cure rare diseases
and if we can cure your rare diseases
and we can cure cancer as well so first
recognizing that this is not a room
filled by all just let's do a little
biology 101
so to begin DNA is a char star yeah and
in the in this language we have four
letters an ATC and G these correspond to
the four nucleotides that make up you
know these you you know spiraling double
helix is that is your DNA so you've got
your DNA and you've got regions of your
diene that correspond to genes and it's
undergo a process called transcription
where these your DNA is transcribed into
another language called RNA which is a
you seasoned cheese and then RNA is
paired off after splicing which we're
not going to go into and these these
little you know three nucleotide
sequences called codons in each of these
three nucleotide sequences or codons is
then translated into an amino acid so
there's a translation process here you
do this for the entire RNA sequence and
then these amino acids which are linked
together fold into three-dimensional
space into a protein at this point is
used a number of modifications that
happen after the translation of the
protein that's which is why we call them
post translational modifications
sometimes you'll attach a sugar
sometimes you'll phosphorylate proteins
there's a whole bunch of things you can
do to a protein once it's been produced
but that right there that's that's like
basically all the biology now so now
you're biologists the other thing to
realize is that many proteins are
enzymes and you know enzymes actually
have a semantics to them so you know an
enzyme is something that turns a Xin to
B's sometimes it takes two things and
makes them one thing or many things that
makes them do it and into one thing
sometimes it goes the other way
sometimes you take one thing and make it
into many things and so the genome has a
syntax and it actually has a semantics
too so DNA itself is kind of an
instruction set we can even examine what
that instruction set looks like very
precisely so for example if we take this
sequence eight you know ATG GCC TGA we
can we can reinterpret this in terms of
a program first we break it apart into
into constituent codons and then we look
at what each of these codons is saying
telling you to do so ATG is saying to
get say e T DS always is how you start
its begin construction of a protein and
insert a methionine so methionine is
always the start instruction for
building
our team and then if you look at GCC
this is a relatively complex codon that
means compiled a C program or in reality
it means answer tonality so this is
insert alanine and then TGA is a codon
that means stop or in this end
construction of this protein so taken
all together this sequence really means
inserted methionine and certain alanine
and stop and eject that protein let it
fold and do its thing so now we can
understand what mutations do in the
context of this program so for example
if we take this program and we change it
into this program because we have a
mutation well now it's a different
program you know so instead of you know
inserting a methionine to that alanine
that alanine is now in aspartic acid and
maybe that changed what the protein
didn't maybe it didn't so because a lot
of mutations are benign they don't
actually change the behavior of a
protein there are large regions of most
proteins where you know there was
somewhat insensitive to the particular
amino acid there but there some regions
protein where they're very sensitive to
that specific amino acid it's a sin will
destroy function some will actually
increase function sometimes increasing
function is bad too and some will change
function entirely to something else
they'll make it do a completely new
thing that it couldn't it couldn't do
before at all but most of time I would
say when you get mutation you'll wipe
out the function in some way that's the
more the prep is probably the common
case so rare diseases that actually in
many cases are just a single mutation
driving the disease one mutation
somewhere the UNAM creates an entire
disease so I think the best way to
explain this is through my favorite
model organism which is the stick figure
some people like fruit flies I like
stick figures so in it with this the
reason I like stick figures is they only
have six genes so if you look at stick
figure and you look at the effect of a
mutation that decreases the effect of
the activity of gene C well it's gonna
do something to it in case in this case
you just learned that gene C is linked
to head size so we're doing for this for
your disease and stick figures is we're
looking for something that reverses the
effect of the loss of function and C and
hopefully if we find that find a drug
that does exactly that
then we want to go back to the our model
organism we see an increase in head size
at that point so that's that's the game
we play and even rare disease for humans
we find the defect in terms of the gene
and we say okay well let's undo that
effect you know if was a gain of
function let's find an inhibitor it's a
loss of function let's find an activator
and that's that sort of what we do so
the key thing you have to recognize now
is that cancer is multigenic
you know so with cancer you're never
fighting just one mutation you know
there's one mutation usually initially
maybe that was a tumor suppressor that
lent lead to a cascade of other
mutations but cancer is a pretty complex
beast and so you might have to target
multiple mutations at the same time and
find compensators for three different
genes all at once say or two or five and
then as soon as you found a compensators
for all of these yet another mutation
pops up and now you have to fight that
too so fighting cancer is like fighting
you know you know multiple diseases all
at once that's because tumors are
evolving when you're fighting cancer you
are fighting evolution itself that tumor
is fight against anything you do to it
to stay alive and just and so this I
think a space allowed me to explain why
cancer can be so difficult to treat so
if you start off with one population of
cancer cells and they evolve over time
you actually end up with lots of
different sub colonies there which have
entirely different cancer genomes
because they all continue to mutate now
if you apply a drug and to wipe out this
particular cancer it might be effective
against 99.9% of all those cells but
just by luck there might be some of
those cells because of how they mutated
that had in natural resistance to
whatever medication you applied so they
survive and now those things proliferate
and when they proliferate they get they
pass on to their descendants the
resistance the first medication you
tried so now if you try that same
medication again it doesn't work they
all know how to beat that by now because
that tiny little population that
survived it knew how to beat it just by
luck and now it survives that's a that's
why you're fighting evolution itself
when you're fighting cancer
so curing cancer really is like fighting
you know multiple monogenic diseases on
the fly because this this that's always
evolving against you you always have to
adapt it and fight against it so how
would cure monogenic disease well I
assert to do this we need an algorithm
an algorithm Maps us for mutations
ultimately into pills so I will sketch
out this algorithm for you very quickly
as a flowchart right here I'm not going
to go into a whole lot of detail on it I
will then dive in some cases and show
you exactly what this is doing or how we
do it so you know what this algorithm is
really branching Oz it's saying okay
well let's isolate the mutation let's
find what's really driving disease and
let's figure out is a gain-of-function
loss of function total loss of function
could change a function what happened
here and it's providing either things
you can do in terms of medications you
can take or
it's providing experiments you can run
that will highlight the next set of
things you need to do in order to figure
out what the pill you need to do is so
the question is will this algorithm that
I've just presented actually work can
you actually use this to find a pill for
any given mutation the answer is yes
question is then how do I know that I'm
a computer scientist I have a grade
school education biology why am I
telling you any of this well now I'll
tell you a personal story so this is my
son Bertrand he's almost 10 years old
today and you know when he was born we
had no idea what was wrong with him so
he was having seizures he had a severe
to ventilate a movement disorder and for
some reason a very curious lack of tears
and he could cry but you mostly he could
feel it but no tears would ever come out
of his eyes so he had this very strange
constellation of symptoms and and you
know this was our life you know for for
48 months it was furniture in front what
is going on with with Bertrand and in
the course of this I realized very
quickly that I needed to learn genetics
because this is a genetic disease so I
learned a lot of genetics and I realized
Barrett for that that we needed to use
genome sequencing to figure out what the
root cause of this disease was and so
that's what actually ultimately happened
with the trio sequencing on both parents
and Bertrand and from this we found out
that he had inherited two
loss-of-function mutations in a gene
called ng ly-one
we believe that this was the cause of
the disease and but along with this
diagnosis came some very interesting
news because this is by the way this was
like six or seven years ago this is very
cutting-edge at the time you couldn't do
this outside of a research project now
you can do this clinically but back then
this was research the researchers we
were working with said this is actually
the first case we've ever seen of this
disease if this is what it really is
it's the only case anywhere in the
medical literature so in many ways it's
an end of one and so questions well how
do you know that because you know we all
contain tons of mutations how do you
know that this is really the mutation
driving this disease well to do this you
have to do a really deep analysis of the
gene and it's actually can get quite
involved now we were lucky that this is
a research project and where there was
wicked isms are actually diving into the
cells here and figuring out if this is
really what was going on
so to understand you know the the
thought process for this you kinda have
to understand what ngl I want to angle I
want it's doing and anyway one is a gene
that encodes an enzyme
called in bikinis and lekha days is
responsible for D glycosylated
misfolding glycoproteins after they've
been wretched translated from the end of
other material into the cytosol
so obviously what's happening here is
we're missing a recycling enzyme and if
you take away a recycling enzyme you'd
expect to see an accumulation of trash
and there was some evidence that maybe
there was trash inside Bertrand cells
that maybe could be an explanation for
the cause of this disease but of course
this process you can't do this every
single time you see a tumor every single
time you see a patient you can't go to
you know deep fundamental science you
have to a different way of interpreting
the meanings of mutations because it
just doesn't scale and so we need to
work around and that's where this guy
comes in so President Obama announced
the precision medicine initiative almost
two years ago actually three years ago
now and it's what is doing is it's
laying the scientific foundation or
really building the rosetta stone for
the human genome and the way this works
is recruiting a million Americans and
ask them to donate their electronic
health records and their genomes to
science and to build a massive
scientific database so that we can start
to infer the relationships between genes
disease and environment so in some sense
we were building a genetic telescope and
what this telescope can then do is it
can peer into any region of the genome
and say you know if you have a mutation
here what is this doing to the health in
this cohort of a million Americans for
the people that have a mutation here
what is their health like compared to
everybody else so yeah this this this
database really will unlock the meaning
of all these mutations floating around
in your genome and tell you you know how
it contributes to disease or
predispositions to disease you know when
I finally got the way this actually
don't work so much on that I worked a
lot on that before I got to the White
House and when I got to the White House
I realize that the fastest route to
building that rosetta stone was actually
not for this new program but through
another program called the million
veterans program which had already
enrolled over half a million veterans to
do essentially the same thing and
veterans are for all intents and
purposes
mostly like the rest of us and so you
eat we can use their genomes as this
guide so the one thing they didn't have
was proper computation so I got or
helped pair up the the Veterans Affairs
with the depart of energy so we Q's
Department of Energy supercomputers or a
an unplugged cloud as it were in the end
to actually build a genomics research
environment which actually launches on
November 17th to allow anybody sort of
start running these queries over
this data set and say well what did one
of these mutations doing in terms of
human seen what are these genes doing in
the context of human disease but what
about Bertrand's mutation this database
didn't exist back then so how do we
figure it out for him so to do this I
read a blog post this was this was the
way I short-circuited the entire
interpretation process because my
reasoning was if another patience exists
with this that instantly may have the
same mutations in England one or similar
mutations there's one that immediately
means this is the root cause of this
disease so this is the blog post that I
wrote and it's really designed to do two
things so had to go viral
that's why the titles there that's why I
Liam Neeson's there could have been a
cat picture to probably work just as
well and then there's 5,000 words now
beneath this for search engine
optimization so that this thing would
rank highly in Google search results and
and all that so the crazy thing is it
actually worked so it did go viral
because y'all are pretty gullible but
and and sure enough it certainly started
ranking very highly for all the right
Google search terms that if a patient or
a parent were out there searching for
whatever their child had they would find
this page and they would find us what I
didn't expect is just how fast this
could happen for a brand new disease so
within two weeks sibling parent turkey
was already in touch with us through
their physician saying we have exactly
the same disease they had that they had
done sequencing and have his list
mutation they were going gosh I don't
know which of these is the cause so
anyway one was on that list and when
that doctor saw this blog post he goes
oh my god that's the disease that's what
this is and so that was the confirmation
that England one was the true culprit
for Bertrand so you know and what this
really did was you know because we start
finding people right away people start
showing up all over the world and it's
been five years now I think we have 60
some patients what it did to have this
community almost overnight was to really
wash away that dark night of uncertainty
you face when you only have one patient
and replaced it with a sunlight of
science and community and that community
is very active and United and actually
targeting the root cause this these in
terms of understanding but also finding
treatments and therapies that'll work
for it as well if you wanna know more
about this whole process there's an
article in The New Yorker that describes
this this this process of using social
media to find more patients it's a
process actually been repeated several
times over now and something that I help
other patients do so the question is can
you find a treatment now that you
understand the root cause of a disease
can you attack the root cause can you
find a pill that actually works so
through some investments in basic
science actually came to a much better
understanding of what was really
happening in Bertrand cells we know that
in the absence of this recycling enzyme
that trash starts to pile up
but this trash is piling up in a very
specific way
and I I predicted that it was actually
sequestering one particular metabolite
not metabolite is represented here Bly
this little blue square so this little
blue square happens to be called an
asset of leuco sameen
and you can if you google it you'll rise
very quickly you can buy it on Amazon
and for what should be three two
quantities or so I reasoned it costs
maybe 25 cents a day it is not
particularly expensive so then it's now
now it's like a Star Trek level ethical
dilemma do you give this to your child
because you can buy it on the Internet
so so I bought it on the Internet
and I took it myself just to make sure
it was safe and I didn't die I'm here
today to tell you that so that for me
was essentially FTA phase one safety
testing this was where I have to remind
you that although I'm a government I am
NOT the FDA and don't do this at home so
but it still wasn't clear if it was
ethical to give it to Bertrand but that
that was actually answered very quickly
by Bertrand himself he went to the
hospital with a very severe pneumonia
which he sometimes would get and came
very close to dying and I remember
sitting there at his bedside sleeping
there thinking you know if he died in
the hospital and I had never tried this
thing sitting on my shelf and it could
have made a difference for him there's
no way I can forgive myself as a parent
so once he pulls through
once he's healthy I'm gonna put him on
this compound we're gonna see what
happens so that's what I did once he was
out of the hospital I put him on this
compound and about three days after he
was on this compound and it just sort of
were no child at every crowded tear he
cried the first year of his life and the
same thing actually happens for all the
patients that go on this compound they
all start to cry tears so it was you
know you know yeah as a parent I think I
had the same reaction we all did when we
saw our child cry for the first time
which is I collected the tear I packed
it on dry sand I shipped it to lab in
California for analysis
and you know that that one small tear
from Virgin dove which he's cried many
more sins really ended up playing the
role of an ocean of science for the
disorders of hold that unlocked a lot of
the mechanism behind this disease and we
knew at that point okay we can hit this
thing because actually it does better
than just give him tears it also takes
away his night to has very strange
nighttime seizures and you know yeah so
you don't know what's gonna happen when
you something like this you don't know
what to look for but these were very
clear signatures that this was actually
working now your computer scientists
you're probably satisfied at that point
but when I give it talk like this to
biologists I always go well that's great
man I'm glad it works in people but
we're biologists what we want to know is
this as working flies and like well I
guess we could figure that out too so we
took some flies and we gave them this
disease and it's okay well what happens
well they die you have about a 17
percent survival rate once you give them
the fly version of this disease and then
we started feeding them this compound
and whoa their survival rate jumps to
like 80 percent in 80 90 % so okay
looks like it works in flies too and
sure so you can do a lot with flies you
can't do with people's we understand a
lot about what's happening from this
just from the Flies and in fact if your
viewer number three would just let some
issues go we will have a paper about
this out probably the next few months
that explains a lot of what's really
going on with this particular compound
and in general you know we won't okay so
how do we do this in general how do we
do this sort of again and again where we
say what's what's in different what's
what's accumulating what's in deficit
for disease how do we modify you know a
patient's diet or metabolism to account
for that well this is actually can get
somewhat computational so there's you
you can take these rules for metabolism
and you can look at them is almost like
rewrite rules in fact they're
essentially already rules about on
graphs you can model these in a language
like Kappa which is kind of like a
functional programming language accepted
syntax is terrible and you can then take
out a rule that represents a missing
enzyme for a genetic disorder then you
can say what happens to this new system
and so I've actually partnered up with
with will bird in the back and gene yang
at CMU and we are using this language to
model human diseases and what happens
when you take away a particular enzyme
so here's actually the very first
disease we ever modeled this is a peak a
disease called PKU so we could show that
when you take out this particular enzyme
you start getting an accumulation of
something which in this case happens to
be phenylalanine and you also get a
deficit of something which in this case
happens to be tired
and so now we know that for PKU or we
predict for PKU they you eliminate
phenylalanine from the diet and you
supplement tyrosine too to normalize we
could even simulate the effect of
administering and treatment too so the
question is what what happens now you
know I wanted to keep going and I
realized that I think we actually can I
said well let's let's go from you know
computer science deeper into biology and
medicine and and this is where I started
becoming less and less if we're
scientists and more and more biologists
so I actually got a grant funded to do
de novo therapeutics development for
England one deficiency partnering with
some medicinal chemists at the immersive
Utah which is my institution at the time
and the first thing we did was we built
a worm model of this disease because
it's what I realized about in biologists
they like to take other animals and just
give them human diseases it's like a
thing they do and so we took we took
planarian worms and we chose them for a
very specific reason we wanted us to
find something to address the really
awful developmental aspects of this
disease and they were that sauce about
planaria is that if you take a planarian
worm and you cut it in half what you get
is 2 planaria so they're very good for
studying developmental disorders because
they have this effect now the
interesting thing is if you take a
planarian worm and you cut it and you
give it angle i when deficiency in this
case we did it through a knockdown with
RNAi i and then you cut in half do you
know what you get what you get is the
one that's been cut in half so
completely loses as a disability to
rejoin it so we're like ok we've got
exactly the phenotype we're looking for
we want to try to reverse this phenotype
chemically or genetically so then what
we started doing was knocking out other
genes to see if knocking out other genes
would actually reverse this this loss of
regenerative phenotype and eventually we
actually found one actually through some
very educated guessing looking at the
literature we were able to very quickly
find another gene that through its
elimination seemed to reverse this
developmental phenotype so if you knock
out both in line 1 and n days these
worms actually start to regenerate again
and this is actually that you know it
surprises computer scientists but this
is done it doesn't at all surprise
biologists because biology is super
weird so it is literally the case that
missing two genes is better than missing
one gene that's what we're saying here
so I don't know in in we were sort of
understanding why this is true now but
in some ways we still don't really
understand why this happens but actually
in drug development do this all the time
they'll start randomly knocking out
other gene
ago well does this make a difference if
it does like okay well now we'll just
find an inhibitor for that and definite
kinetic explanation for why it seems to
make a difference and they don't care
they just want to find the inhibitor at
that point so we know at this point what
we need is an inhibitor for gene X which
is which is n days so to do this to find
the Scimitar I went from biology
medicine back to computer scientists are
back computer science and for this we
took a bacterial model of this other
this other protein in gays now because
there wasn't a crystal structure
available for the human version so we
take this which which is the back chill
version and we do use a process called
homology modeling to compute what we
think is the human version of the
crystal structure of NJ's and so we've
got that and then there's some pocket on
this molecule it's catalytic domain
where everything actually happens which
actually you know makes the reaction go
we have to find some small molecule that
is inverse and shape and charge to that
catalytic domain that is the
computational question we're trying to
answer so you can do a bunch of
simulations called backing simulations
and you can find molecules that fit
right in that domain and look like they
might be inhibitors or at least
interactors with with something like n
days so we looked at two and a thousand
compounds in silico 70 compounds came
out as potential inhibitors for n days
14 of them were already fda-approved so
we took those 14 to a lab we used mass
spectrometry to interrogate whether or
not they really were in Gaye's
inhibitors and we found out that one of
them actually was and that one turns out
to be prevacid so prevacid is like a
acid reflux medication now Bertrand
doesn't has that have acid reflux but it
doesn't matter because there's a weird
side effect to premise it that we just
discovered it's an N gays inhibitor yeah
so if you take prevacid you're
inhibiting n gays you didn't know that
and you didn't care but we care a lot
because this is how you actually disable
that gene which appears reverse the
phenotype for ny1 deficiency so if you
wanted more about this wrote and
published it recently in a paper and and
one thing I'll say here is even though I
spent you know 10 wonderful years in
computer science I think this is my
favorite paper of all time because this
this is this is a paper inside of your
science paper at all but this is the
paper that describes a viable treatment
for my son and then you know I remember
one was getting diagnosed five years ago
that the researchers like yeah and no
drug buddy will ever take an interest in
this except that the science has been so
thoroughly dearest that retro
and actually had the patient community
out to meet with them and say you know
we think we can take previs it and make
it super prevacid something you know a
thousand times stronger than prevacid so
that you don't have to take it at toxic
doses to get this effect and so what
we're doing now is we're taking the core
scaffold for prevacid actually all the
protons on my bitters of which purpose
it happens to be and modifying it and
making lots of small tweaks to see if
any of these actually give you a better
prevacid and we already up something
like sixty times more potent than
prevacid with or even are the best
proton pump here we found so far while
still inhibiting young gaze so we're on
the way towards the super prevacid
because right now you know it's it's
it's an inhibitor for engage but it's
it's not strong enough to inhibit it
fully at non-toxic quantities so he's on
it now he's getting some inhibition of
an gaze and we're definitely seeing some
benefit to him but we know we can do
much better we know we can build a new
drug based on this to do it to do it all
over so the question is you know will
this work again you know can we actually
repeat this process of finding you know
treatments for in light of individual
mutations and i reason are the answer
this is yes is that i got some really
unusual opportunities for which I am
truly super grateful so the first one
was the hardness will said hey we see
what you're doing with your son we'd
like to know if you could scale that
have further patients want if you come
join the faculty here so I began a
visiting professorship there almost
three years ago I'm still there today
and then the next year this guy said
once you come to my house and let's chat
so I get this call I go out there and so
bombing goes hey I heard what she did
for your son I'd like you to do that for
the rest the country and I go okay
anything you want obviously I mean you
don't say no to Obama so yeah that
started my engagement with the precision
medicine is ship this was actually
before I launched so I wrote some of the
founding white papers around how we're
gonna organize this thing what kind of
science we're gonna do and acted sort of
a I guess maybe an architect if you want
to call it that of this initiative early
on and then I actually saw I yeah I was
going after White House quite regularly
at that point and then actually just
joined the White House isn't official
and so actually before that actually
announced with President Obama the
launch of this new initiative to sort of
do a proof of concept for precision
medicine called patent are the patient
apparent precision medicine Alliance and
the whole idea behind this was we want
to CEO could we really do that whole
angle I one story again really quickly
for a number of other diseases so we
picked
I have diseases so can we find you know
viable clinical candidates for
treatments in just 12 months the reason
what 12 months was important was that
that was all the time that Obama had
left in office and that would that bound
it very naturally bounded the problem
the thing is we actually succeeded we
actually did that so I stitched together
this series of institutions and this
acted as essentially the processor to
execute that algorithm that I showed you
earlier this was the our computational
substrate for executing the algorithm
for precision medicine and yes I was
actually able to go back shortly before
he left off saying this is like three or
four days before he left and say yeah we
actually we did it you know we have
proven that precision medicine actually
works we can do this again because we've
done it now for some other diseases what
I will tell you is that I very carefully
picked those five diseases I didn't take
five diseases at random yeah so not
every diseases crate is created equal in
terms of its ability to find a treatment
however I'm finding that large regions
of the genome can be divided up
according their essentially their their
screen ability for drugs and so
depending on the gene you care about you
might actually have a pretty easy path
to finding a way of interacting with
that particular gene so the other thing
I realized very quickly is that been
throughout the past nine years really
that this is more about is all about a
lot more than just computation even
about a lot more than just science as
well because it's hard as it is to give
diagnosis and olymic precision medicine
although that's getting easier and
easier and as difficult it is to you
know find a therapy this new mountain
appears once you climb those two which
is actually getting it past the FDA it's
a regulatory approval is more
challenging even still so you know to
address this is something else I
encourage people to do is I've I've
actually gone I've spoken to the to
Congress in the Senate when I was a lot
to do these sorts of things and I urge
people always contact the legislators
and say you know the science is way
ahead of the regulation here we need
better policies for getting drug
approved drugs approved in things like
precision medicine and Rarity's it in
cancer because the patients need these
and we can we can find them for them now
so what's next well like I said I'm
actually still there at the White House
so I'm doing the best I can to argue for
precision medicine and science in
general that's been interesting
and I can't comment anymore so then I
got you know sort of the the offer of a
lifetime I didn't really see this coming
but but UAB the you guys from Alabama at
Birmingham said you know we would like
you to serve as director of this brand
new precision medicine Institute that
we're setting up and I said okay I mean
the amount of research so so basically
this offer as they said come run this
institute higher higher a faculty higher
professors you know yeah create a vision
for what clinical precision medicine is
and develop a research program that
enables that so that's that's what I
said yes and actually that's what I've
been doing since July so I'm now down
there at UAB as director of this
Institute and and seeing patients and
which is crazy because my PhD is still
in computer science and you know mapping
out a vision for how we deliver clinical
precision medicine so I've come up with
three focus areas obviously rare disease
is close to my heart so we definitely
have that as an emphasis but then
precision oncology you know because this
I think if we're gonna go after diseases
of the genome cancers the big one that's
the disease really we really need to hit
and then for the rest of us I'm offering
pharmacogenomics so this allows any of
you to use your genetics determine if
you have a sensitivity to a particular
medication or if for any particular
disease there's one medication that's
much better than another so to just you
so this this is the update I think the
last time I gave this I talk like this
was in Barcelona and I hadn't actually
started that job yet but now that I've
been there about five months I can tell
you some of the things I've been doing
so hailing rare diseases I'm partnered
with this this great guy here Bruce Korf
who already had an existing undiagnosed
diseases program there so if you have an
undiagnosed disease or know somebody
that does you can send them to us we
will sequence their genome we will try
to find the mutation driving their
disease once we find that cause we can
then use another company in Birmingham
called southern research which is
essentially disintermediated drug
development company and we can use
robots to test thousands or even
millions of compounds against their
cells or models of their cells or models
of their disease to see if anything
works for them so we have both you know
a diagnosis program and a therapeutics
program running side by side now at UAB
and to do this I'm booting up what I'm
calling the human screen-on project and
the way this works is we're coming up
with set abroad where we use a blast
he's some of which are actually
computational that gave us very high
coverage of our ability to modulate the
human genome and so what we're really
doing is were dividing up the human
genome
in two regions of behavior or types and
then say okay well this assay which is a
test from looking at what a particular
you sell our model system is doing can
interrogate the behavior of these genes
and you know sometimes you know two
assays will both work on the same gene
some accidently work on one gene and
then so what happens is you know patient
walks in the door we use sequencing to
find the gene that's misbehaving in them
we use this database then to find an
assay that can look at what that gene is
doing so we can study it in a dish and
then we can take that to a
high-throughput screening facility and
say do it does any drug now make a
difference for this particular gene so
that we can find a drug to give to a
particular patient and the patients are
actually showing up and we're actually
doing this kind of stuff so just give
you an example I've got a patient that
showed up on the second week I was there
with a mutation in Trk - now we knew
this was the cause because we found
nothing for other patients that had
mutations in this gene this patient I
should actually say was actually found
in the joint collaboration through
another Institute called HudsonAlpha
that's also in Alabama it's also using a
sequencing to give diagnoses to patients
that are undiagnosed and this is the
particular mutation we found so at the
Ford and 34th codon there was a
substitution of a tyrosine for a
cysteine that's this little patched
notation or definition that we use for
encoding mutations and it happens to
occur on a transmembrane domain so we
think it was causing loss of function
but maybe is doing gain of function so
question is how do you treat well we
have to do is instantiate the algorithm
for precision medicine that I showed you
earlier for this particular patient and
so the algorithm when we specialized it
now for this patient looks like this we
sequence which we did then we do
analysis is a gain of function is a loss
of function if it's a gain of function
we have to find an inhibitor it's a loss
of function we have to find an activator
and so what I do is directory this
Institute does that go across UAB or
outsid maybe if I have to and I map
people onto the phases of this algorithm
and say you're the one that's gonna do
this phase and so I found somebody to do
the the analysis of this gene and I only
know if it's a gain-of-function
I found somebody who could find the
inhibitor because it's actually gene
involved in cancer so there's cancer
companies developing hitters for it then
they found somebody else who is already
developed an activator for this team
because it's it needs to be activated in
a completely different disease so
whichever direction this analysis falls
out I've got something that I can offer
to this patient now the only thing I'm
waiting on is the IRB approval to take a
cheek swab from this patient so we can
do the analysis
that's the only bottle it's it's not the
science it's the regulation and IRB as
I'm learning can take forever to set up
so once we find an emitter an activator
we can do some additional chemistry to
optimize it potentially if we need to
and move on to a clinical trial for an N
of one I've got another patient that's
got epilepsy that we did a limited
sequencing and we found two variants of
uncertain significance and so now go
okay well which mutations really driving
this disease here yeah we've got to
figure out which one it is before we
come up with a kind of treatment it is
actually cool because we did some
computational modeling so the two genes
that popped up here were k c and v h
which is a potassium channel and our way
are three which is R and a nine receptor
and we said okay which of these is it so
to figure this out we did computational
modeling of these of these two
structures and zoomed in on our way our
three and founded that it looks like you
get some transient loss of function from
the mutation occurring here just by
looking at the effect on structure so by
looking at this effect on structure we
can say this is probably the cause of
this patient's epilepsy this is the gene
we have to target that's where we are
now so now we'll do potentially docking
stimulation see if there's any way to
interact with that particular mutation
so now what about cancer well I've got a
deputy director Eddie yang running our
precision oncology program and in the
one reason I loved Eddie is that we he
was already showing me his algorithms
for position oncology before I even
arrived at UAB so we've been developing
these algorithms making them more
complex so that we can go from patient
data or really your tumor data because
we sequence a tumor not just you and
figure out medications that precisely
counteract the effect of the mutations
and your tours so that's what we're
doing now and the great thing about
these that we've got two clinical trials
running and thing is we don't we don't
care what kind of cancer you have we
don't do just breast cancer or brain
cancer
we'll take any cancer so all cancer this
is now just mutations in a genome and
we're finding some interesting things
across all kinds of cancers so that
there are some mutations that show up
again and again and drive the vast
majority of cancers and what's what's
even more remarkable is that for 71
percent of patients that have walked in
the door in these trials we have found a
matching compound that at least in
theory will interact with the gene that
we need to for their particular cancer
now we'll know in about six months to a
year what this means in terms of
survival and outcomes more now through
these trials directly addressing the
root cause of cancer whereas
chemotherapy is more like carpet-bombing
with chemotherapy you're really trying
to kill the cancer faster than you
killing the patient that's the goal
they're here we're trying to go to the
root cause the cancer say this is the
mutation driving your cancer this is
this is this is a drug that interacts
with
or cause let's see if it works now for
patients that go treatment-resistant we
have a separate project right right now
we're doing it for leukemia and what
we'll do is we'll take patient blood and
we will screen it against the full FDA
approved library to see if there's
anything out there that will work with
your particular leukemia and in every
case so far we are finding something
that works so even patients that have
lost every other option there's
something we can do for them so what
about comedies what about most of us
because most of us don't have rabies
most of us don't have cancer
not yet anyway what about common
diseases well we're still gonna start
tackling these one by one and the first
one I've picked is actually depression
you know so depression is a very
widespread disease has an enormous you
know societal cost and human cost and
the thing is we can do a lot better than
currently do right now so right now if
you get depression you go on this trial
and error process or you try all these
different any depressants one after
they're hoping something will finally
work for you this can take years as a
therapeutic gotta sees what we can do
instead is we can look at the genes that
control metabolism of these
antidepressants we can say well you
should never take this drug because this
is really awful for you or you should
probably be on this one instead because
it's gonna work great
or probably should and for patients that
adhered the recommendations on the
stream protocol the remission rates are
up to 90 percent you know so 90 percent
experience broad relief from from
depression when we look at the you know
the genetic drivers of how you interact
with any depressants if you can stick
the protocol which is definitely a big
if and depression but you know this this
this is significant because that's not
the case when you don't have access to
this information when you try to treat
so I would say in conclusion as far as
the war on air goes that it's a
difficult war but it's one worth
fighting in both people and in software
and it's one that we can win and the
core theme here of course is
approximation we can approximate
solutions to the halting problem to
predict the behavior of software to find
the flaws that drive most of what's
plaguing us and software today with
people we can approximate you know
solutions to what will help them either
in the forms of the set of pills that
they should take or the procedures that
they should do or the set of experiments
they need to run in order to find their
treatment so with that I thank you but
if I have any time I'd be happy to take
your questions
some forms of cancer a cure not because
of the genetics but because of the
process of instantiate imagine etics
into cells how how do you tackle that so
how do you tackle what when you take the
genetics and you instantiate those into
cells and that process fails oh I see so
the question is you've analyzed the
patient you found a mutation and now you
need to build a cell culture of some
kind to analyze that so there's a number
of techniques that you typically use to
introduce a mutation into a cell culture
there's really new stuff like CRISPR
which you can use to make a cell model
and we right sometimes it fails
sometimes the interesting mutation and
now the cell dies well we don't often
encounter this case with people because
if it kills a cell it probably killed
the embryo and so in most cases you when
you introduce the genotype into some
cell line it usually doesn't die not not
right away at least and so usually you
get something now one thing one problem
you can have is that it might grow very
slowly so some some mutations do have
serious effects on cell growth so
there's a couple of workarounds for this
and one of the workarounds is cancer so
you can take a cancer cell line which
grows very well and you can take that in
the mutation to knock it in to that and
now you have a very rapidly
proliferating cell line for a disease
now is this the perfect model to study
well no because you're also studying
cancer at that point but in many cases
it's it's a workable model of the
disease so you can take a cancer line
and you can give it a second genetic
disease and now you have hopefully a
viable model at the cellular level if
that doesn't work for some reason you
can try to build an animal model people
to fly where I'm a fish a mouse
something like that and study that
instead
hi thanks um so yeah I thought to me
know it for my family with rare disease
but one of the problems that happens a
lot when you do that type of stuff
usually is a prime of chillings enzyme
because the folding is quite easy
something we don't understand that well
do you do younger the problem can be
like computer computation problem for
the folding of so question is all right
you found a mutation and you know this
mutation is gonna have some effect on
the folding of the protein right so do
you you know and protein folding is a
hard problem at least if you do it sort
of ab initio if you just take a sequence
and say give me the protein that's
really hard that's a very hard problem
and there are several ways to get around
this so like in the case of n days we
needed a structure for n days so we
started with a structure for bacterial
engage the sequences for that are pretty
close to each other and so we could just
tweak it again to this process called
homology modeling and get it to the
actual structure and you can do the same
thing if you have a structure for a
human protein and you've now introduced
mutation you can insert just that
mutation into the folded structure and
then you can you can you can modify that
you can also do x-ray crystallography
you can just forget computing it and say
well nature is the best computer we've
gotten let's just look at what it looks
like so you can do that sometimes
crystals but sometimes it's really hard
to crystallize a protein so you can't
really do that well now there's this
amazing new technique called cryo a.m.
where you could just look at the protein
you know so that's what we'll do now so
actually I'm starting collaborations to
use cryo a.m. to do variant
interpretation for real patients we're
instead trying to video computed or you
know you know do crystallography we'll
just look at it under a very powerful
microscope and say well what do you do
what is what is your actual structure
and so I I think did the the deeper
thing here with this question is that
yeah we're computer scientists and we
like to do everything with computation
and that was my bias five years ago
going in all this I mean I'm gonna do
everything with computation everything
and I realized very quickly that in many
cases the fastest computer we have is
nature that is way faster in some cases
to put a mutation in a worm and watching
what it does the worm then to try to
come up with this molecular dynamics
simulation that will somehow magically
figure out
the way back up to the cell what's
really going on that's hard so I've been
re-educated and well I love computation
and I always will
I'm willing to concede that in some
cases you just want to go to a lab and
do something and that's maybe the
fastest thing we can do and certainly
that is the case here thank you for a
wonderful talk wish you a lot of success
in the wars and especially the same the
first time in in your war of course your
first patient I was wondering how much
computer science research do you need in
your current research which progress in
computer science would help you that's a
great question so how much computer
science do I need for what I'm doing in
precision medicine well I think there's
two answers to that question and and the
first is that not a whole lot of Piell
just unfortunate given what I spent ten
years of my life doing but I think you
know assistance biology which is kind of
like PL turned into biology is actually
quite useful and we can we can do and so
like for CAPA is basically using
programming language techniques to make
reasonable predictions about what at
what's happening in a particular disease
within a cell so that's useful and that
is reusing some PL and I think it will
have some benefit I think deep learning
has a lot of promise when it comes to
when it comes to genomic precision
medicine you know for things like
variant interpretation I think if we
want to know what imitation is doing
it's probably something we can learn I
think toxicology you know of a small
molecule is something we can do deep
learning on that will broadly accelerate
the entire drug development process so
going forward I'm looking to deep
learning as a big hammer for us but more
than any particular kind of computer
science that I need for what I'm doing
what I really need are computer
scientists I think something happens
when you take a computer scientist and
you turn them into a biologist that
doesn't happen we need to take a
biologist and try to make them a
computer scientist you don't get the
same thing at the end of those two
processes and and unfortunately most the
time that's the direction you go as
biologists to crappy Python programmer
that's typically what happens and I'm
telling you all right now like there are
labs that are desperate for your
expertise you don't have to know a whole
lot of biology do it to do a heck of a
lot of good because
I mean most the code being written in
biology is just awful
and another people stream would ever
write it so you could say if you go to a
lab and say hey can I just volunteer for
a little while as a bunch partition they
will be they'll be extremely grateful
for your help and then you'll be
horrified for a little while and then
you'll do good things so everybody in
this room I think has the potential to
really help out biology just by
volunteering your time to some lab and
trying to solve some of their
computational problems and in many cases
they're not that hard
they're like basic programming things
that you make a huge difference to their
research the reason that they can't do
this systematically as they can't afford
us you know you know when you get a
research grant from the government to
hire a biologist you know that this
literally happens where if they paid the
market rate for a programmer then the
professor would be making far less than
the programmer and so many pies were
just like I'm not going to do that and
in fact NIH won't even allow it so they
but they they desperately need your
expertise they just can't afford it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
