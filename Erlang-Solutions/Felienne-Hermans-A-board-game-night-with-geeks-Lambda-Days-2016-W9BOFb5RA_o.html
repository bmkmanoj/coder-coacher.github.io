i'm assistant professor at Delft
University of Technology some of you
know me maybe by my spreadsheet fame
I've done some research on spreadsheets
quick summary I build something like and
units and resharper for excel but that
is not what this talk is about so if you
came here to listen to me talk about
spreadsheets that that's not what it's
about this talk is about mike is not
perfect yes and it's better this talk is
about my my very rich social life that
a1 they brought me to play the game
board game of cuarto so cuarto is a
board game it's a bit like four in a row
but normal four in a row the pieces have
two dimensions so they are white and
black sometimes they are yellow and rats
but they just have two properties that
distinguish them however in quarto as
you can see here a little bit the pieces
have four properties so they can be
white or black they can be round or
square they can be long or shorts and
they can have a dense like this one
advanced in the top or they don't have
it the basicness of the game is still
similar to four in a row as players you
have to get four in a row of one of the
properties so either for whites for
blacks for short ones or four right ones
sorry yeah so a line so it's a row or
column or diagonal but not in a northern
a square oh ok so that's not that's not
the variant that we played at least we
only had the ones with where Rosa where
rows and columns counted that's a nice
addition though I could I can fix that
probably in my coat so I played a few
games with my boyfriend but in all of
the games that we played either one of
us one so we started wondering after a
while could it be that this game ends in
a tie is is this a possibility so I
imagine that in normal people households
it would be something like this ah I
don't know I don't care the end however
of course if you live in a nerd whole
household like I
we were like let's figure this out we
shoved her game aside and we took our
outer laptops oh you thought okay let's
actually do some science let's let's see
if we can do this so an obvious thing
that you could do of course is you could
route forces if you look at the board
it's not that big it has set only 16
fields so you could think okay let's
prove force this but if you think about
this a little bit it's actually not that
pleasant so the first one you have 16
possibilities of course to put a piece
on the board and then 15 and 14 @ 0 and
this gets out of hand pretty quickly
this actually amounts to 16 faculty
which is that number that that's pretty
big and for each of the assignments so
if you have all the fields on the board
you have to make 160 checks because you
have to check all rows and all columns
and the diagonals and for each of them
you have to let those are 10 and for
each of them you have to make 16 checks
to see if if one of the properties is
the same so suppose you have this
machine here it has four core of course
of 2.6 gigahertz or theoretically you
could do 10 billion operations a second
that would still be 320,000 seconds
which is about 90 hours so that's a bit
long for a board game night thats that's
not the approach that we want and also
of course you would be pretty boring to
just write ten for loops leave your
machine in the in the table and go to
sleep that that would be a very short
talk so this problem is not actually yet
soft and then of course I remember it at
one point somewhere long ago I went to
university and they told me something
about how to address these types of
problems and I had a course called
automated reasoning that told me all
sorts of techniques how you can use
computer science to address these type
of problems exactly so I thought let's
let's use that let's use my knowledge
let's science the out of this we
will use SAT solving to see if this big
game can actually end in a time so the
idea of this problem transformation is
from
like this so instead of taking the
original problem and going right to the
solution we are taking our original
problem representing it in an
alternative way solve it in that
alternative world and then go back to
the solution so this might sound a
little bit abstract to you so let's look
at an example so what we could do for
example if we want to divide and number
78,000 974 if we want to divide that by
two we could die / to directly of course
we start here we do lots of steps and
then we get to a division by 2 this is a
possibility however what I could also do
is I could represent this problem in an
alternative way for example in binary
numbers and now if I have to divide a
number by two in the binary world who
knows how to super quickly do that yes
this bit shift so you just erase the
final zero and you've divided by two so
that's once you have your number in that
nice binary world some operations are
very easy and then of course there's one
more step if we want to have the answer
in a decimal world where we started we
have to transform it back this is
exactly what i'm going to do with the
quarto problem as well and take the
problem I represent it in something else
and I solve it there so what exactly is
that something else I take quartile and
I'm going to transform this into boolean
satisfiability because I know if I have
it in boolean satisfiability it will be
easier for me to solve it and I will
explain both these things why is easier
to solve and what exactly a
satisfiability I will get right through
that so what is satisfiability
satisfiability starts with boolean logic
so boolean logic is a language in which
you can express nicely the properties so
for example you could say do you want
coffee or tea and that looks like this
coffee or tea and those propositions can
be true or false so someone can say this
is true coffee or tea yes that's true
another proposition is something with n
do you want coffee
and t that looks like this coffee and
tea and that you can be false or true
and if it's false we put this little
sign before that's in negation not many
programming language this is an an
exclamation mark sometimes it's a tilde
put in boolean proposition you're right
this little hook you can do derivations
based on proposition so you can say so
you want coffee no no coffee based on
this we can actually conclude something
coffee or tea is true north coffee aunt
is true north coffee is true so we can
deduce tea from that and all these
images I didn't draw them they're
actually from this super wonderful
graphic novel book about the history of
Lovelace and Babbage so I can really
recommend reading it it's it's very
wonderful so once you have these
propositions you can do some calculation
that's exactly what satisfy abilities
the idea of satisfy abilities you have
such a boolean proposition P or not Q
and an essay t sulfur is going to find a
truth assignment so it's going to find
boolean values for those variables in
such a way that the whole proposition is
true so for P or not Q for example you
could say P is true and Q is false that
gnome Q is true so this is super true
true or true is very very true so the
good news is there are wonderful tools
for this I already imagined men mention
them s80 solvers are very quick at that
so how they work is you give them an
input some sort of proposition and they
tell you yes it's satisfiable or no it's
not satisfiable and typically they also
give you through design so they also say
yes it's satisfiable namely with these
values for all the variables the bad
news is it's not really simpler we
haven't made our problem simpler if you
know what it means this problem is still
NP hearts and if you don't know what
that means that means it's very very
very hard so we've not made our problem
secretly
simpler we've just represented it in a
way for which we know there are lots of
tools every year there is an essay to
solving competition with many academics
submits their programs and they compete
with each other and this is what
actually makes them better that there's
lots of research done into how they work
and later in my talk I will show you a
few of the tricks that makes it make
these sats over so efficient so the idea
is let's not forget about what we were
doing we were working on quarterly board
game so the idea is we're going to
express the whole state of the game how
exactly a toy looks like in bullion's
and then we can ask an sats over here's
how it all looks like find me one is
this possible so what we're going to do
is we're going to represent every field
in our board with four bullion's and
each of the bullion's you can probably
guess this is going to represent one of
the property so I'm going to express
whatever is on that field the piece that
will be on that field with four
variables for the four properties black
and white long and short square and
round and flat or a hole in the top so
if i have this assignment this is how
i'm going to define my variables we can
express at I like this there's no row or
column or diagonal or in your variance a
square where four properties are the
same so for all properties p for all
combinations as rose coleman diagonals
it cannot be the case that the stones in
s all have the same property so for
example that looks like this for
property 0 in the first row you're going
to say note this all these properties
are equal to each other one more thing
that I should also Express though is all
the stones on the field should be
different this is how cuarto set looks
like there are 16 pieces and they all
have different configurations it would
be not a real time if I would go to the
toy store buy a second set of quartile
and make a tie with pieces from two sets
or more sets so I have to express as
well that all of the stones should be
different
AKA no two stones may be the same so i
can do it like that for every
combination of two fields for example 0
0 and 0 1 they're not exactly the same
so it should not be the case that all
the four properties are the same because
if all the four properties are the same
those two pieces are the same and that
means I'm playing with two different
cuarto stones sets of course you can
imagine these are lots of rules they
look very simple in the slides but I
have to type them for all combinations
for all properties for all duo's or
fields of course I'm not going to type
all of this i'm going to write little
scripts that's going to generate the
input file for my SATs off i'm going to
generate the input file of course if i
use necesito ok so you can say the
problem is solved look at that we have a
nice little for loop we generate the
rules for the Rose the rules for the
columns the rules for the diagonals and
I also add the rules for not all is the
same so this generates all the rules and
I have all my inputs so you might be
wondering now of course I told you as
these offers are really quick you can
believe me but then how I expect some
skepticism from the audience how is this
actually better now that we have
converted or problem into s80 why is it
actually better so let's look a little
bit at how SATs offers work work on the
inside give them a proposition and and
then what what do they do so simply said
they just try all options as I said the
problem is np-hard so there's basically
nothing else you can do then try all
options that are there so how does
trying all options look like you start
for example for the proposition P or Q
and Nomar with 000 you put it in it's
your 01 sadly that's false and you
repeat it until you get a truth value
that is the basic idea however we're not
of course just going to trial and
profiles big LM with options because
then we're just doing the brute force
attack and we
already know that that is going to take
90 hours so there are some smarter
things at SI b SI te sulfur's do while
still as basic idea trying organs so
there's this one little trick that SATs
offers eight because it greatly reduces
state space what they do is called unit
resolution unit resolution is the idea
that if you have P or not Q and Q this
is equal sides fiable to pee just as
satisfiable if I can satisfy this then I
can also satisfy that so why is that if
you look at look at how this proposition
looks like it's p or q and q a p or
known q i'm 'soary thank you so for
something with an N in the middle to be
true both sides need to be true
otherwise you know we're failing anyway
so we know that this Q must be true
because it's in the top of an end if
that is true then this is false this
side also needs to be true because it's
something and something so that the only
solution we can still get is from the P
also to be true so Q is true must be
true that means norm you must be false
and that means we have to get the truth
value from P this is called unit
resolution and it can greatly reduce the
state space and of course this proof
that i just gave is as we professionals
call it a proof by hand waving but you
can actually prove this for the general
case so if you want to do some
interesting stuff in the next break you
can't prove to general case of unit
resolution and the last time I give this
dog actually someone tweeted me a proof
after the talk like you hand-wrote
approve on paper and sent me a picture
of it so I mean I'm expecting something
of Poland as well would be nice to go to
get a proof so how does unit resolution
actually look like on an SATA example
that might help you a little bit to get
a feel for it too so here is a boolean
proposition and I've written it down in
it's something like a special way so if
you look at it it looks exact
like the example I just showed you all
of these are ores and they're all
combines by ends this is how the SATs
offers use them too so that means it's
very easy to read it in this format on
every row we have to get a truth value
because all of them are connected by
ends so on every row something has to be
true or the whole exercise is going to
fail so how do we start as I said we
simply try all options so we start with
what we can we do just the first
variable that we have in the first row p
and let's say it's true why not so that
means p is true and then we know that
Norm p is false automatically that's
that's what we already know and now here
we can do unit resolution on the third
clause because non p or no mess has to
be true because it's one of those ends
connections sadly known tree has found
to be false so we have to get the truth
value have to get it from no less
because otherwise we fail so we're going
to say no mess must be true and then we
can propagate that value so we know that
then that as is false now unfortunately
we cannot do unit propagation anywhere
because there's no clause where
everything but one is false so we don't
know what to do we just go back fall
back to our original strategy of
triangle options so let's say Q is true
why not just the next one alphabetically
we say Q is true non Q is false and that
means again now we can do unit
resolution on the fourth Clause because
all these guys all these friends they're
all false so the only way we can still
save this almost sinking ship is to make
our true we have to do that otherwise we
feel so we make our true Dada and we
have a truth assignment wearing all of
the rows as you can see it visually now
why this is such a nice representation
on all of the rows we have a green dot
and that is our assignment so you can
see that we had four variables but only
two of them we had to do state space
exploration only after
that to pick a value because the other
ones were just derived so you can see
how this greatly reduce the state space
by not just trying all the options but
see if I try this then what are the
conclusions of that and then you don't
have to try any other options you don't
have to try for example different values
for s that those are options we didn't
have to even try because we could deduce
that so you could say if you're paying
paying attention or maybe if you've seen
things like this before yes but that was
a very nice example miss this was a
perfect state where nothing went wrong
what happens if things go wrong well
I'll show you what happens if while
doing you know resolution you run into a
problem so let's look at this we take
our same strategy we set P to true and
we set then all the non peace they will
be false so now we can do unit
resolution here on two and four however
that's of course come to result in a
conflict a problem because if we set
this as two false then that Ford Clause
is false or false which is very false
and that means the whole thing is not
going to work anymore because it's
something something something and false
and something else and that will never
be true so unfortunately we have run
into a conflict this is much false very
sad so what do we do now what we do is
we flip the last thing that we assigned
so not the ass that was derived the unit
resolution but the last chain the lost
choice we made which is the P we simply
say okay so something went wrong this P
is true is obviously not the good thing
to do so we just flip it we say P is
false let's try again let's start in
this new situation and then the rest
continues so that's what happens in it
conflict situation apart from unit
resolution there's one other super super
smart trick that s80 solvers use to make
the situation quicker and that is called
watches so what watches do is they make
the execution of unit resolution Quaker
if you go again to this statement it's
very easy to see where we can a unit
resolution because we only have four
variables and five cool lists of closes
so it's very easy but suppose and you
will see that later on I have not forgot
about my board game if we go to what I
generated for my bird game you'll see
that there are thousands of variables
and thousands of clauses and for more
realistic real life situations knows
this can be even longer thousands and
thousands of courses so you can imagine
that every run of your algorithm you're
going to have to check where can I the
unit resolution that gets expensive to
do that all the time and this is where
watches come in so reminder again we can
only use unit resolution if all of the
clauses but one are only signs if I have
red dots everywhere and one white dot
one variable that doesn't have a dolt
yes that's why I can do unit resolution
only in that situation as long as I have
to earn a signed variable I'm not going
to resolve anything because I don't know
where the story will end so suppose I
would have a system for each of the
clauses to point at two unassigned
variables I would know there's no way i
can do unit resolution if there are
still two unassigned variables I can
only do it if one variables and the
signs that is exactly what watches do so
what watches do is let's make them
purple dots and all of the clauses I
make two variables purple those are the
ones that I am watching the ones that
I'm looking at while they're still are
two watches I don't have to do anything
I know it has to inspect that close
because I wrong be unit resolution
possible so that is the watches they are
watching and assigned variables that's
what they do so we can just start by the
same strategy we start by exploring the
variables we just think the first two
variables why not so we just watch two
things not all the things great
optimization we just start with two
variables for clothes doesn't really
matter which ones we pick if that's not
possible like in these two two and four
I cannot pick two unassigned variables
because there are none well in that case
we know we can do unit resolution so we
do earth to Texas einman and that means
these two watches will have to move
because they are now assigned variables
so I move them in here and I move that
one there and then i can continue my
algorithm and the really these are now
two watches and they're really really
really smart thing is maybe you've
noticed if you were paying very close
attention this is what makes watches so
super brilliant not the fact that
they're watching two variables if we
have a conflict like we have now we have
a conflict again very sad much false we
can just remove the assignment as we did
before we flip p but we can leave the
watches where they are we don't have to
do anything to the watches if we
backtrack because by definition they are
watching unassigned variables and if
we're backtracking we're only changing
the value of variables that have already
been assigned to so if we backtrack and
you can imagine that in lots of clauses
and lots of variables it does happen a
lot that you run into a conflict we
don't have to update these watches so
that's a very efficient situation fewer
things we have to do in a conflict
situation the better now we only have to
switch swap assign variables so this is
a relatively new invention that really
helps improve the efficiency of s80
solvers so problem solved I've shown you
how I'm going to generate the input
files and I give you a little sneak peek
of how s80 solves work in the back so
that means our problem is solved now
right the talk should almost be over
because we have generated everything
however one more thing if you look at
these rules they don't really look like
the thing i just showed all the sot
solving example zone for one thing they
have equal signs
in the middle they have negations in the
top they don't look like everything when
it ends combines everything within or so
unfortunately our problem is not yet
soft we have to make sure that our input
Rose rules are generated in such a way
that they are the CNF form at
conjunctive normal form that's what i
just showed the s80 example zone so
that's we should have something like
that and that's not something like that
only CNF your format you're able to put
into an sats over so sadly we're still
not done we have to do a little bit more
so what i did is i wrote a little
library in f-sharp that in which i could
express the variables and all the rules
that will make it a lot easier for me to
quickly rewrite rewrite rules so i made
this a variable noughts and ends in an
or and true or false and i also made an
equality because as you saw in the rules
that i'm generating i also needs
inequality sign this property has to be
equal to that property and i didn't
include it in my little dsl i just said
if you write you can write equal but
then it would just generate a term for
you with an and or that makes it a bit
easier to do all the rewrite rules so
what i can do then the trick to get any
boolean satisfiability into c and f is
you apply lots of rules so for example
and a and true is equal to a these are
just basic boolean equivalencies rules
and then what we do is we use the Morgan
and distribution so the Morgan is taking
notes and removing them so if we have
not a it's a and have do if we have
notes on the outsides we push them in
because as you saw in the CNF form at
the notes only occurred right in front
of variables so we have to take all the
notes in them in the beginning and push
them all the way down to the variables
what we also cannot have
or in the beginning we can only have
ends in the beginning and the oars also
have to be in the belly of the
expression so we take distribution if
there are ours we push them in into an
end and this we repeat this process all
the way until nothing changes anymore
until we're at the fixed point situation
so if applied these rules over and over
again all the notes in the middle all
the oars in the middle if you repeat
that you will guarantee always end up
with something let's see enough this is
on get hurt by the way so if you ever
find yourself in a situation where you
have to do some boolean rewriting you
think it will also be at the final slide
you don't necessarily have to take a
picture now so if you want to use this
library then then you can do so you
don't have to do all this work yourself
for your favorite board game or other
situation you would need that so this is
how it actually looks like you can
define a nice term in the language that
is somewhat nice so you can say or notes
equal a B notes equal BC this is what it
makes of it because it already rewrites
the equals this is what it rewrites do
so it over already rewrite the equals I
don't know why I have this flight now ok
i will talk about this thin one other
thing that we still need it for the
input file is it cannot just eat CNF it
has to be in a very very special format
called d max so all the variables need
to be numbers and they have to have a
negation side before them so what I also
still needed to do is normalize it and
then print it into the specific string
format i will show you in a bit that sa
t solvers needs so they don't just eat
this they need this so the variables are
numbers and all these things are closest
as we just had them so every variable is
represented by a number if it's a
negation of a variable you put a minus
sign before it it has to start with P
tnf and then the number of variables and
the number of clauses and and here's the
even stranger thing every line has to
end with zero and a line break because
obviously a normal line break is not
going to cut it it has to be zero and
nana line break and it has to look
exactly like this or the SATs or force
won't do it so they're they're a little
bit like like divas like rock stars they
can solve NP hard problems really
quickly but they're not going to do a
little bit of string manipulation for
you so you have to feed it exactly right
to them or it won't work so what you can
do with my library is you can make
that's what it's called the d-max format
you can make the DMX format and it
nicely prints out exactly what you need
to feed into the solver so now our
problem is really almost so so I wrote
the c-sharp i transform the with F sharp
and this is now what I get so I go to
mini shots which is one of the SATs over
there there are lots of them it doesn't
really matter which one you pick they
all have their pros and cons so you go
to mini shots and you can input the
input file right direction look look at
me here I'm going it's a little video of
me typing there we go Toto Toto look at
look at how quick that was this is like
no video editing your vorse just because
it's so cool let me let me show you once
more it's so quick I mean if you if you
blink you missing ha ha so we're going
from 89 hours of brute forcing into just
a few seconds of calculation because of
all the tricks that I showed you that
make it so much quicker so I was like
yeah that was awesome yay for science
like that in really really cool so we're
almost there of course we're still
nothing yet I know how much time I still
have fifteen minutes so what we still
need to do of course we are now here we
have a solution in rs.80 world but not
yet in in a real-life setting so we
no it can end in a tie but how does it
look like and of course I wanted to see
it on the actual board because you never
know maybe you've made a mistake in
encoding or anything I want to see the
real thing so you can ask mini cell as
well to give you an assignment equally
quickly and then you get this like the
input formats the output format is
nicely readable for anyone with a heart
like it's nice for machine so this is
the whole assignment that all the
variables and if they have a minus
before them they're false and otherwise
they're true and actually this is all
false because these are almost real
variables i started my variables
somewhere at seven thousand and then you
still get all these variables so this is
the this the real assignment right here
so you see some are true and some are
false so by then I was a bit bored with
programming I didn't want to write a
partial that part of the input the
output back so I just took a sheet of
paper made a mapping of all my variables
and then you see da da it's a tie in
corto so you see all my variables i just
wrote them so this is how a tie looks
like of course the next question is how
many ties are there and what what do we
have to count rotations and mirroring
and so that's for a fern axe talk so as
I said all of this all of the this code
is on on github and in the meantime
after I make this slide I've actually
made a little parser that parses the
output back so what you can do now if
you go to the github pages you can
actually type some a nice term and then
you can say run it and then it runs it
and it parses you I'll be back so you
really get a true and B falls so that's
that's even nicer than then it's in my
advertising my slides so you might
wonder why am i listening to a talk on
board games for half an hour that is not
very useful so I will take another few
minutes to talk about a few real life
applications of situ sort of core board
games are real and life but more more
useful real application
so one of the things that you can also
use s80 solvers for that you're a bit
more likely to run into and your daily
job is you have to provide people in
groups so for example we have to divide
people in shift or students in groups or
sports groups over a sports roster so
sometimes often there are constraints as
well so I have these people &amp;amp; B wants to
be in a group with a and with E but not
with C&amp;amp;C and deal so it won't be well if
they go in a group together so what you
can do is you can give everyone a bit
suppose we want to have them in two
groups we just give them one bit each
each get one bit and then we can just
express make an assignment for the
bullion's in such a way that those guys
get the same bits but those guys do not
get the same bits and then you ask anna
cities offer to give you an assignment
and we'll make an assignment for you and
of course this you can also do it for
two bits or three bits if you need more
groups that that's really relatively
easy to express and it will be very very
quick and this easily generates two
planning and scheduling they're even
scientific papers really that use s80
solving efficiently to make basketball
playing roster so that there are real
applications and these type of things
are otherwise maybe you've written a
scheduling algorithm before they are
pretty hard to do manually because you
can run into those conflicts you have to
start swapping things so solvers are a
pretty good solution there another real
life example of sats whole thing is
testing and especially hardware testing
so suppose I have a specification robot
that takes a and B and it takes the
minimum and I say beers the
specification so it's 0 0 0 0 1 is 0 1 0
0 and 1 1 is 1 and i also have an
implementation robot that is if a is B
or an OB than a LSB is this a correct
implementation of that specification you
can use SATs hoping as well because you
can say for any given inputs I run it
through this one and
run it through that one and you can of
course do again all those
transformations on the rules inside them
and you can see if they're equal and
typically this is done over finite set
of inputs so you just take here all the
inputs I can get and for all of them
you're going to calculate if they do
exactly the same thing and this is
actually used in as i said in testing
specifically in hardware testing where
people test circuits circuits and they
want to know if they're exactly the same
so once you can express the boolean
logic of them you can calculate if
they're the same but it's also used for
DNA sequencing so there are properties
you can express a certain type of
molecule with and then you can calculate
if they are the same so that's more or
less everything I wanted to talk about
before we go to questions because I do
think we have some time I will summarize
my entire talk in one minute so if you
come game in late or if you were a bit
the suffering from post lunch sleepiness
this is your second chance to get all of
it and of course if you have been paying
attention the whole time this is optimal
preparation for question asking so I
wanted to know whether the board game of
cuarto could end in a tie you could do
this brute force but first of all that's
very slow and secondly that make a very
short boring talk so I decided to do
something more cool involving science I
use an sats over to fix it and I explain
to you a little bit how those things
work they use unit resolution and they
use watches to greatly speed up
execution I wrote a little librarian at
sharp that you can use to express such
william propositions and in the newer
version that's not online you can even
run mini shot in the back and get the
output parsed rightful in front of you I
still got the output in this horrible
format but I parson back myself and I
found indeed there is a time and there
are real life applications of si T as
well including scheduling matchmaking
testing and DNA sequencing that's it
that was my dog any questions yeah
well there are some properties of a
problem that I know that
that's a very good question so what are
properties of problems that you can map
to a safety solving it takes some
practice I guess if I see a problem I
think that's nice so mapping things two
integers that's often something that you
need you want to give you want to give
everything a number and then numbers or
bits or billions and then you're there
so if you can express something you can
give anything a number and the things
you want to express is this should not
be that then that's probably is but
there are a few nice books or you google
if you go to the websites of set s80
solvers you will see a few examples
which is probably the best way to get a
feel free to try it a bunch of times and
in addition to SATs offers there are
also things that are called constraint
solver and they're in the back that in
they sell do very similar things the
constraints covers can also do things
like this should be bigger than that so
you don't necessarily have to talk about
bits anymore you can just say I really
have to introduce this one has to be
bigger than that one and this one has to
be equal to do some of those two and
that's a little bit more high level and
sometimes easier to express your problem
and a constraint solver because you
don't have to do all the bits now all
them nearly greedy bit details mike is
this is actually 2 comments and just
repeating the comments would be hard
work for you so the first comment is
well hey I like the talk another nice
example of using a SAT solver is my
colleague Andy Gordon who's at Edinboro
but also works at Microsoft in Cambridge
came up with another nice application so
in types of sindh you often have
subtyping relations and they can just be
really complicated and he just wrote it
out the subtyping relation for what he
was doing as a logical formula and then
dumped it into a SAT solver and that
could tell you if you had subtypes and
so he took what had been a very hard
problem and made it easy and that there
were much more flexible solutions so
there's another nice example that's all
three lie and that was sort of the first
paper I saw using sat
for us that made me think oh this is an
important our youth Yeah right oh look
we can solve NP complete problems and
and this does it fast the other comment
was you talked about putting things in
conjunctive normal form and you did it
by repeated simplification another way
to put something in conjunctive normal
form as you can say oh well it's an
conjunction and each thing in the
conjunction is a disjunction and each
thing in the disjunction is a literal
it's either a variable or a negation of
a variable so you can represent it as a
list of lists of literals and then have
ways of combining those lists of lists
and you can say well or takes two lists
of lists and combines them to another
list of lists and so on so that's
another way of computing it which makes
nice use of things like folds and maps
or comprehension you should build that
in some you pull request I've already
done it it's an exercise for our first
year students at Edinburgh in Haskell so
if you look at the info NFP at the
University of Edinburgh it's the seventh
or eighth student exercise cool and I
won't send you the answer because that
all the students would get it I I think
I can figure it out myself yeah but it's
a fun exercise to do thanks what does
how long did the SAT solver actually
take was it really a fraction of the
center that was really life that there
was no editing at all so you just you
type it and gives you the answer right
away the only a couple of seconds no no
that was life there was really me a
screencast typing it took me longer to
type but obviously it didn't take me
longer to type the whole c sharp in the
library and it did take me long to type
the iMini shalt input then it ran that
is actually real true no no magic no
nothing up my sleeve did you violate
that the given answer is the valid state
of as a result of sequence of void steps
in the game because you encode the board
yes so that's a very good question so
the question is is it actually possible
to reach this time so I didn't
really explain how else the game works
it just works and you don't put your own
pieces your opponent picks apiece and
then you place the piece on the boards
so there are no other rules as to where
you can put it or what you can do in the
middle so a state that you can reach is
always possible however of course I
didn't do faby the pruning or something
so I might need the cooperation of my
partner of my opponents to actually get
in that state because maybe they have to
give me the right pieces but it is
possible to get there with just the
rules of the game because the rules art
of the game is just you get a piece and
you place it good question i've never
heard that one before it's a very good
question no i didn't manage to do it in
evening we didn't manage to reach the
reach the states in evening but the
rewrite rules i had then were actually
enough quite ugly bite on hack instead
of in a beautiful a sharp library
because that is sometimes it's nicer and
quicker to do ugly code and then
afterwards I felt okay would be this it
would be useful for a general case so
let's make a library that's also if you
go to github there are two separate
projects so there's a project that makes
a quarto assignments and there's a
separate project that is all the
rewriting so I thought it would just be
nice to have a library we can write in
human readable format and we get the
input for Mimi salt and then solve it so
that I totally did afterwards and also
the parsing back you saw that I was
writing on the piece of paper I didn't
do the parsing back then because i was
also somewhat fed up with it so that was
also afterwards although i think it's i
spent maybe three afternoons on it so i
got it for my colleagues who you sat
solvers that even things like
conversions can turn out to be surprised
and difficult so i was looking at your
code for converting to a conjunctive
normal form and if i understood it
correctly then you first of all replied
the distributive law and then de Morgan
and thence implications but the
distributive law duplicates part of the
formula so am i right particular in the
worst case that first step might blow it
up to exponential size this is very true
that's not just because of my code
that's a general property
that if you have boolean proposition
that's relatively simple if you can if
you convert it to CNF you can always do
that but it can greatly blow up so you
can get many repeated statements or just
statements that don't add a lot but this
is the way the conversion work so this
is very true you can end up with tnf
that's more optimal and you could of
course run through all your clothes to
see for which I don't do to see if you
have duplicates that will make it a bit
simpler because then you don't have to
do swapping on multiple but it is true
that's just a property of the conversion
to CNF but maybe the simplifications
that you showed some of your equivalence
has made the term smaller so maybe if
you apply those first then you might be
able to avoid the problem yeah well you
will never be able to avoid the problem
because it's an audience nothing okay
but in some cases yes that's very true i
could add some code in every step to see
if there's duplication if there are
things that are equal that i can that i
can remove to make the input a bit
quicker but yeah and that that would be
more work and the essence of there quick
anyway so they can deal with a few acura
closes that's true any more questions
yeah yeah so there are lots of different
ones that all use different tricks oh oh
I'm not going to go back to the slide
but with some of them also uses restarts
you saw any output while you didn't see
but any output it also says I did so
many restarts that's a trick as well
sometimes they have heuristics for well
there's so many true are there so many
Falls or I had so much conflicts in the
last few assignments probably I'm on the
wrong path so they just throw everything
away they restart and they try something
else that is another trick that
sometimes helps is not I didn't show it
because it's not like the order to a
trick of mathematical beauty it's more a
drink of Lester let's try again but
there are lots of tricks and also as I
said there's a yearly and annual
competition for this over so they
they're competing against each other and
all of them are using the same
tricks there's lots more to answer a
question there's lots more than that I
showed in his thought that you can if
you want to dive into it if you want to
participate in the competition then
there's lots to explore yeah so for that
and acid is over it's just bullion's but
if you use a constraint solver as i said
before then you can say well this has to
be bigger than that and then if it gives
multiple solutions from them you could
take the minimum or the maximum or
whatever whatever you want but I would
say if you're assigning people in groups
and you know that there's something that
cannot happen you probably changed
constraints before you go and transform
your problem you just say no you cannot
express that you want to be in that
group because that guy hates you he
doesn't want to be your friend give it
up yeah if you would put it if you put
something in an sts / that's not
solvable it would just say false false
okay so you have to do the
transformation than before are you
feeling for your wonderful talkin great
