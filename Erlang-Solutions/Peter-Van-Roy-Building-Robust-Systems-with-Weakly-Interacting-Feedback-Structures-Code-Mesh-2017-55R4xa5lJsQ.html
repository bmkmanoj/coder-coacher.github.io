programming paradigms although I could
say a lot if I wanted to today I'm going
to talk about building distributed
systems and about a programming pattern
that we found which is really nice and
it started in a project called self man
European project that I was coordinating
a few years ago I have a project now
called light-cone but this is not about
light-cone so so the idea is that big
systems are very complicated everybody
knows that it's very obvious and since
some years people have been trying to
make system self-managing so something
like an autonomic computing and the idea
is you want to use feedback loops it's
very obvious but one feedback loop is
very easy but how do you combine many
feedback loops so this is a kind of
pattern that we found though we call it
a feedback structure I'm going to
introduce it through lots of examples
biological systems computer systems that
work which are good examples and we'll
see the pattern and then I'll talk about
a bigger system which we developed in
South Lincoln scholars which is a large
self-managing transactional database the
key value store and how it's based on
five of these feedback structures
interacting and then now I will talk a
little bit about intelligent behavior
because that's a big thing now what's
deep learning and then I'll say where
we're going with this so we want to
build robust distributed systems so let
me define first of all so systems the
notion of a system is just a set of
components that are connected together
and they make a coherent whole so
there's a very general theory of
building systems which started actually
with the Norbert wieners work on
cybernetics in 1948 very nice book which
I recommend by the way so a distributed
system is a special case of a system a
set of computing nodes connected by
network it appears to its users a single
coherent system that's one way you can
define it and there's a very famous
initiative starting in 2001 called
autumn
computing probably everybody knows by
IBM by means of a loop called a MAPE
loop monitor analyze plan execute to
system simplify simple system management
so very nice loop but one loop is is
very few systems need many loops so how
do we combine feedbacks oops so that's
what I want to talk about so first let
me say just a little bit about the loops
so a feedback loop so this is my
primitive element a very simple thing so
I have a subsystem which could be any
kind of system it's monitored by
monitoring agent it has some agent that
calculates a corrective action to take
and an actuator actuate agent that does
things okay and this is all these are
all concurrent components sending
messages so it's very similar to the
Erlang style process communication so
this is a very natural kind of a
structure and the subsystem can itself
be hierarchical okay so feedback loops
are actually everywhere the more you
look the more you find them here's a
simple example where I have a human user
using a GUI where they have a keyboard
and a mouse and the application and the
display and this is a feedback loop okay
and then many other things our feedback
loop garbage collection is a feedback
loop the monitor waits until there's not
enough free memory it initiates the
garbage collection which then activates
which then runs the garbage collection
so it basically interacts with the
system and there's many many many other
feedback loops so but I'm not gonna
stick stay just and talk about feedback
loops okay
I want to say how we go beyond single
loops what are what is the natural
pattern when you go beyond it so
feedback loops are everywhere optimizing
systems based on feedback loops is
actually very well understood there's a
whole theory control theory for that
there's a famous famous book by
Hellerstein control a feedback loop
control of computing systems which is
very nice for optimizing one and at the
very end there's an advanced chapter
with
- oops okay but feedback loops is very
low-level thing you need very many and
I'll show many many examples so the
point is how do you connect them
together and also how do they relate to
the functionality of the system you want
to do so combining them that's what I
want to talk about here how to combine
them and how to connect them to the
system specification the system you want
to build okay so that's enough
philosophy now I'm going to show lots of
examples there's piles of examples so
here's the first example this is a hotel
lobby example so here we have a hotel
lobby and has air-conditioner so it has
a thermometer it has a thermostat and it
runs the air-conditioning if it gets too
warm and so on you know it keeps it nice
and cool you have this primitive
tribesman some savage guy who never
doesn't know about modern technology
walks in there it's kind of cold in
there so he basically says makes a fire
okay stoke the fire in the hub lobby and
so that's the second loop it feels cold
Stokes the fire okay and the hotel lobby
is the system where these two loops are
interacting so what happens so this is
an unstable situation it depends on the
strength of the air conditioner and the
the strength of the tribesmen in the
amount of wood he has so basically the
air conditioner is going to work harder
because there's a source of heat okay
it's gonna work harder so the tribesman
gets colder so he makes the fire bigger
so it's kind of an unstable situation
okay this is a unstable this example
comes from Norbert wieners book actually
it's taken directly from his book and
cybernetics so this is actually there's
a problem with this systems unstable so
how would you divide this how would you
do bugs such a system we have these two
feedback loops
how would you redesign this system so it
doesn't have this unsub instability
well this is a question that weiner asks
in his book he leaves the fix as
homework for the reader he doesn't
actually give the solution now in this
book okay
so so this was an interesting example so
I thought of a solution and if you think
you probably come up with a very similar
solution here's here's a solution for
this problem that tribesmen instead of
stoking a fire he simply adjusts the
thermostat huh there's a nice solution
right so this is the structure of the
new system so that first loop this
air-conditioning loop is the same stays
the same but the second loop instead of
interacting with this system
it interacts with the first loop okay
you see so this is actually in the
terminology of this kind of design it's
called management where one loop manages
or controls the other instead of stigma
gee stigma G is the term that's used
when two processes interact through the
environment which is the hotel lobby so
in this system stigma G was unstable and
this management structure is stable so
this is a solution I'm not sure if it's
dilution that winner was thinking about
but it's a reasonable solution except
that the transwoman basically has to
learn something he has to understand
that there's this little device on the
wall called the thermostat and they
doesn't have to do very much effort but
this actually is a stable solution so
one lesson you could get from this is to
use the system and don't bypass it so
the inner air conditioning loop is a
system don't try to force it to do
something don't bypass it but use it
okay so that's a lesson so that's one
example okay so you can see that this
kind of design is actually interesting
designing in terms of interacting loops
and actually TCP is using a similar
approach now you have an inner loop so
here's a subsystem which is the network
packets are sent to the network when the
acknowledgement is received you get an
acknowledge back so this is only one
side of it
this is the transmitting side and then
you have this sliding window winning
protocol which figures out which is the
next by next packet to send and so on so
that's an inner loop this inner loop is
actually controlled by an outer loop
which monitors the system throughput and
it does it modest modifies the outer
loop modifies the inner loop in some way
so there's congestion for example and
the way it does it is actually very
simple it changes the size of this
sliding window ok so TCP is actually a
similar approach to the hotel lobby ok
so you can see it's kind of interesting
to think in terms of feedback loops ok
ok that's one example let's do another
example let me connect this to our lens
approach to fault tolerance the
supervisor tree so most you know it so
I'm not going to go very much in detail
I just want to connect it to the
feedback loop approach so Erlang is the
language used for developing extremely
reliable software so you have a set of
running processes which have independent
memory spaces and they're basically all
concurrent and they send messages
asynchronously so the fault tolerance is
done at two different levels
there's a primitive failure detection by
linking which I explain in a minute on
top of each of these on top of these
processes you have supervisor processes
and a supervisor tree so supervisors can
be nested in a tree you also have a
stable storage to restore consistent
States when there's a crash so the
primitive failure detection so this is
very simple it's these are all processes
processes can be linked and if two
processes here are linked if one of them
fails the other is terminated so failure
is permanent crash fail or any kind of
problem is mapped to permanent crash so
this is very good it simplifies you
don't want to correct corrupted state
you just force the whole system to fail
or the subsystem to fail and the
processes have this supervisor bit if
it's zero we have this behavior all of
them they're linked once fail if it's
one so the blue one up there is the
supervisor it doesn't actually fail but
a message is sent to it
informing it that the other processes
have failed so this failure is actually
monitoring in a feedback loop and if we
go one step farther so here we have a
supervisor tree so this is the basic
beginning of many programming patterns
so there's books for example book by
Francesco Steven ASCII giving you all
kinds of programming patterns based on
this idea so each supervisor process
observes a set and there's can be an
supervisors and or supervisors and
supervisors are observed by a route
supervisors and I have a little story
about that when when Joe Armstrong was
doing his PhD in 2003 so eventually he
decided to get a PhD kth so I was
actually his thesis jury so I thought
this was very nice asked him a question
I said do you ever go beyond two levels
in this tree he said he couldn't think
of an example I don't know if ever you
need to go beyond two levels but anyway
you have a two level tree so each
internal node of this tree actually
corresponds to one feedback loop so the
supervisor it monitors and then it it
actually activates it does a corrective
action when it notices a failure okay so
that's Erlang let me give another
example very different thus absorption
architecture from Brooks from Rodney
Brooks from the 1980s I don't know if
you ever heard of this this was actually
an AI thing it's actually a very
interesting pattern for AI so a sub
sumption architecture is a way to
implement complex behaviors by
decomposing them into simpler behaviors
and one behavior can override the other
so you have a layered system okay a
lower layer does something it could be
override overridden by a the next layer
and so on so layers are priorities when
a layer acts it disables the lower
layers okay and they interact through
stigma G so which means that the layers
affect the actual system they they each
lay they don't actually communicate
directly to each other but indirectly
through the system that they are managed
so that's the theory here's an example
this comes from paper by Rotten groups
so here we have a robot it's actually an
interesting algorithm interesting
approach for control for the basic
control of robots for the low-level
control of robots and environment so the
basic behavior of this robot is it goes
forward there's a forward decision goes
forward the second layer is a direction
sensor every once in a while maybe it
has to turn okay so the turn decision is
made it disables the forward layer and
it turns the robot okay and the third
layer is an obstacle detector it comes
across something and it has to make some
kind of avoidance decision so it
disables the two lower layer and it does
some kind of an avoidance maneuver and
why I'm when the avoidance mover is done
it gets back to going forward or so it
there's something in a way Oh it walks
around and then it keeps going again
okay so this again is a system where you
have multiple feedback loops and
together they manage the behavior it's
very different from the hotel lobby
example because here they are they are
actually independent of each other it's
just that they're organized according to
priorities ok and it's actually a good
wave realistic for low level behavior
huh
so for example ants or cockroaches would
use something similar to this ok so
that's an example from AI now let's go
and do a more realistic example and this
example is the human respiratory system
in fact in the in a biological organisms
there's huge numbers of examples and you
can find and I have another example in
appendix slides that I won't get to but
you can look at so the human respiratory
system and as a set of feedback loops
how does it look like well here it is
so here I have the breathing apparatus
in the human body so the muscles the
lungs etc
how does this work there's actually four
loops the default behavior here is a
rhythmic breathing reflex it measures
the co2 in the blood carbon dioxide when
it gets to a certain level it triggers
the reflex and co2 creases the threshold
breathing reflex and you breathe and
this is automatic this is the default
behavior human respiratory system okay
now that's normal behavior things can go
wrong what if you're eating something
and it goes into the wrong direction it
goes into your lung an obstruction in
the Airways another loop is triggered
this inner loop
it's called Lera and go spasm it
basically temporarily seals off this
this the the connection of the air pipe
to the lung so that you can coughed or
whatever and get rid of the obstacle
okay but it's temporary it's basically
it works on different time scale than
the actual breathing it only blocks the
thing for a few seconds and then it
releases it again okay only on the
obstruction in the Airways so I can
reassure you if you start choking
because of something getting in the
wrong way and you fit you can't breathe
if you're choking don't worry it's
normal
just wait a few seconds and be able to
breathe again okay breathing system was
debugged by evolution over billions of
years it's very very reliable okay no
problems okay in general there's no
problem so don't worry about that that
works fine now other things can happen
that are more complicated I'm driving a
car and somehow I fall into a lake or
canal and the car starts sinking well I
don't want to have my breathing reflex
work when I'm submersed in water okay
so there's another component called
conscious control so the third loop
takes control so my brain figures out a
very sophisticated planning strategy
for me to get out of that car and back
onto the shore where there's air and in
the meantime I suppress my bleeding
reflex by conscious control okay so
that's this conscious control component
so usually it's not it's not active my
conscious control is usually it doesn't
care about breathing okay but in certain
cases it can take control whenever it
decides to take control it can take
control and all of the massive power of
a hundred billion neurons will compute
my best chance of saving my life okay so
that component is very very smart for
most people okay so but it's not
infinitely smart so what what still
things can go wrong okay now what
happens so let's say I'm I've had too
much to drink
and someone makes me a bet that I can
hold my breath for 15 minutes so I hold
my breath okay and I not going to I'm
gonna keep holding my breath until what
happens until I die or run out of oxygen
or whatever actually no the evolution
has taken care of that possibility as
well so what happens there's actually
several things that happen here there is
a point of the co2 threshold called the
breath hold break points that's a
medical term when this point is reached
the conscious control doesn't work the
reflex overrides the conscious control
and you will start breathing even if you
don't want to okay so when you really
really you say at some point some of you
have you have to breathe so it overrides
it after a certain point now a trained
athlete can go beyond this and can
actually fall unconscious while holding
his or her breath and then the final
loop comes into play which is the
failsafe this one the outermost loop
measures the oxygen in the blood when
the oxygen goes too low well the brain
just sort of stops working normally okay
so the person falls unconscious and the
conscious control loop basically falls
away and the normal breathing reflex
continues starts up again okay so this
is kind of a fail-safe the conscious
control which it's which can override
the breathing reflex can itself be
overridden by this feel safe okay
so this is how it works so how did I
determine this actually I got it from
from Wikipedia okay well no there's
actually some pretty good stuff there
there's an entry on drowning which
actually explains the whole structure I
have not seen it in a medical paper
although I think it's a very interesting
way to look at this system okay so let's
talk a little bit more about how the
design of this works so there's four
loops two inner loops breathing reflex
and there will spasm a loop controlling
the reflex which is the conscious
control and an outer loop which is the
failsafe okay holding the breath can
have two effects either the breath will
threshold is reached first and you
breathe no matter what you want or the
oxygen threshold is reached first and
you fall unconscious which causes you to
breathe again so don't worry holding
your breath as long as you can it's
there's no danger to your life
okay no problem so design rules so the
interesting one is the conscious control
block which is much much smarter all the
other blocks are very simple conscious
Patrol is very smart and I'll talk about
that in a minute this block is very
different from the others it's extremely
intelligent and it's sandwiched between
two simpler ones the breathing reflex
gives you abstraction the conscious
control does not have to know how to
move every single muscle in your lung
okay and there's also a protection
against instability the conscious
control is very powerful but because of
that power it may go whack
who knows what the conscious of control
is going to decide so there's actually
protection against that it's a powerful
problem solver but you have to hold it
in check
which the body does and you can look at
this structure as a state diagram so
each of these states here in this
diagram corresponds to a subset of the
loops in the feedback structure I just
showed you with all those loops at any
given point in time some of them are
active some of them are not active
inactive so you have different states so
normal breathing here is the normal case
one loop is active okay if you have an
obstruction in the Airways you go to
normal layer and go spasm or the the
breathe control where the two loops are
active and usually the conscious control
can can notice is that okay and goes
what's going on here and also becomes
active so there's usually a transfer to
the top one which is conscious lerigot
spasm okay but eventually it goes back
to normal breathing so this is another
way of looking at this feedback
structure okay so now you kind of see
how this therefore this system this kind
of systems are made okay so now we've
seen three or four examples if you count
the TCP so now let's let's try it in for
some kind of a design from this what do
these examples have in common so they
use a combination of feedback loops to
maintain a system property the desirable
hotel the lobby temperature fall
tolerant for exit for airline efficient
communication for TCP moving while
avoiding obstacles for the robot proper
breathing for human they're maintaining
a global property okay
so I give a name to this a combination
of feedback loops that together
maintains one global property I call
this a feedback structure okay so we're
not thinking in terms of single loops
anymore
in terms of feedback structures and
actually I have many many more examples
I'll show you a few more examples but
feedback structures seem to be a natural
element when you're building these
complex adaptive systems so if you want
to build an architecture actually you
can see then four steps the first top
one where you have concurrent components
that are sending messages to their
neighbors asynchronously this everybody
knows we have feedback loops which is
the next step
monitor corrector actuators okay they're
maintaining a local goal a feedback loop
maintains a local goal
part of the system an implementation
goal but then the next one here in
violet is the feedback structure here
now we're starting to think of the
specification we're maintaining a system
property with these loops that are
working together and the loops manage
each other they interact okay each loop
is not living by itself
a loop can disable another one they can
interact through stigma G so they really
are collaborating these loops and then
if you look at a bigger system bigger
system usually has to maintain several
properties not just one so each property
is maintained by a feedback structure
and then these feedback structures have
some connection to each other they will
have some interaction a weak interaction
because we each feedback structure is
using some of the resources of the
environment so by that fact it will have
some effect on the others but there can
also be explicit dependencies where the
feedback structure needs the
functionality provided by the other one
okay so that's a methodology now let me
talk about a bigger system a system
called scale eros Skyler's which we
built in the self mint project which is
basically a high-performance
transactional self-managing key value
store so this was built mainly by one of
the project partners which is the
chooser Institute in Berlin
and so this is actually coming out of
the self man project so this is in 2008
so you see the performance here nowadays
it's it's things performances are a
little bit better but this one actually
won a prize which is unfortunately hard
to read this is a plaque the AI Tripoli
International scalable computing
challenge in 2008 so they built a
scalable version of Wikipedia of a
Wikipedia back-end and entrance in this
context so they actually won a prize and
it's the Technical Committee on scalable
computing from I Triple E that gave this
prize so this diagram here shows the
different layers there's a peer-to-peer
layer or application layer a transaction
layer so you can see so there's a
basically a structured overlay network
you have data is replicated and
load-balanced over there and then you
have transactions using consensus for
maintaining strong consistency and there
wikipedia was built on top of that so
this is one way to look at the system
okay this is like a traditional way you
build the system in layers but with our
notion of feedback structure we can look
at the system in a very different way
kind of cross-cutting the layers so the
specification of scholars is actually a
conjunction of six properties so there's
one functional property which is called
s key value here which gives you
basically the the correct behavior of
the API and the key value operations
read write transaction cetera and
escolares is the overall specification
but then you have five other ones as
connect is the connectivity between the
nodes s route is the efficient routing s
load is a load balancing algorithm which
communicates to manage the load if
there's a hot hot point there's also a
replica management making sure that if
their node crashes that instead of four
you have only three applicants it main
recreates the fourth and then there's a
transaction management which was a
transaction manager which does a
to face commit in a consensus algorithm
between the the replicas so these five
pieces of the specification are each
maintained in the system depending on
what happens in the environment so
connectivity for example if a node
crashes it detects that it has to do
something so there's a feedback loop in
there doing something the routing is for
efficient routing so it creates fingers
I'll show in a minute so efficient
routing and again it has to adapt to
failed nodes and new nodes joining the
repla management also has to adapt when
replicas disappear and the transaction
manager has to do the operations of
transaction and then there's a load
balance so there's dependencies between
them so all of them depend on
connectivity if connectivity disappears
they all disappear but if transaction
disappears the rest still exists okay so
there's a dependency between the
functions so so you can do efficient
routing but maybe you don't have
replicas anymore and so there's this
dependencies between them so these five
feedback structures are living in the
same system they are in some sense
designed independently of each other ok
so this was how the human person who
designed this they designed them
independently starting from the more
primitive ones connectivity building up
to the transaction management and since
they're part of the same system they
will interact what weakly so you assume
that the interaction is going to be weak
ok
the load balancer for example will send
messages around the system and it's so
it adds itself a load to the system so
but you assume that it's a weak
interaction with the others so that's
your your basic assumption to build the
system that these feedback structures
are weakly interacting so when you build
a system like this the idea is to create
a set of feedback structures one for
each global property and then they're
dependent of course among each other and
they will be weakly interacting by the
very fact that they're part of the same
system ok so this is our
design approach so just to give a few
details about the low level so school
eros is based on a structured overlay
network so this is a very there's many
many variations of this and it's still
used today and there's two feedback
structures I want to show you here so
the blue nodes here are neighbor
connectivity so this is basically
managing connectivity even if notes fail
or new notes join each node knows
several neighbors not just one but some
number of neighbors so that it can
handle a certain number of failures
today this could be replaced for example
by a gossip we're using hybrid gossip
algorithm and light-cone to do similar
thing to manage connectivity and then
once you have connectivity you can
optimize so the fingers provide
efficient routing and they're added so
they give you exponential routing in the
structured overlay Network and it
doesn't really matter if they're
temporarily in any consistent State but
the feedback structure is always
converging towards an optimal State so
this what I'm showing you here has two
feedback structures this is just the
communication so I won't I won't go on
and discuss the other ones the replicas
and the transaction there's a reference
you can look at it if you want so some
performance numbers so these are from
2008 ok so don't compare them with 2017
but for those days it was not bad ok
throughput operations per second number
of nodes scales up pretty well ok the
the the notes managed to keep their work
pretty much independent of each other
okay so we scaled up to 32 actually for
the Wikipedia up to several hundred
notes in those days so that's scale Eris
and that's an example of a bigger
example of this design idea let me know
before finishing say a few things about
the actual components in these feedback
structures so the the weakly interacting
feedback structure approach so it's a
framework you design the feedback
structures
depending on each of the global
properties okay and a subset of the
structure will be active at any time but
you still have to design the components
themselves the the it doesn't solve all
the problems it's just the the the
top-level structure of your system and
sometimes you need intelligence you need
smartness in there and the framework
itself does not provide intelligence
okay it provides adaptiveness resilience
but it itself doesn't provide
intelligence if you want intelligence
you have to put in what I call smart
components some of the components in
some of the feedback structures have to
be smart and the conscious control in
the human respiratory system is an
example of a smart component okay so how
do i define a smart component well a
smart component is a component that
completely solves a problem in a small
part of the system operating space but
only in that part so for example a deep
learning algorithm can be extremely
smart when detecting images of birds
where it tells you what did the species
of bird but if you show it something
else like a cat has no idea what you're
doing okay
outside of the space they're very stupid
so they have to be managed by the rest
of the system by the rest of the
feedback structure okay
so smart components fit very naturally
in this kind of a structure and you
really need them so here's a picture of
a powerful machine a Porsche Carrera GT
why is it powerful well because it has a
3.6 liter Biturbo motor with 353
kilowatts 480 horsepower inside there
that's why it's powerful there's no
other reason so if you want your system
to be powerful you have to put in the
smart components okay so the feedback
structure will not solve all the
problems it just gives you an over a
structure like conscious control skill
RS uses uniform consensus you know paxos
craft does heavy lifting and sometimes
you need that heavy lifting Andy you
cannot get around it there's no
other way you need an algorithm which
has the power of praxis if you're
building a barge distributed system okay
alphago uses deep learning and Monte
Carlo tree search to beat the world
champion girl champion Google Search
this is an old one from the 90s it
calculates eigenvectors of the web link
matrix this is a fairly complex
calculation because the web link matrix
has several billion on the side so my
question then to you when you build a
system what is your smart component okay
your system to be smart you have to put
it in so there's many kinds of smart
components and intelligence is not one
thing
so the Turing test is kind of irrelevant
for this intelligence is many many
pieces human intelligence is one is the
strength of human telogen it's adapted
humans are always creating new new
feedback loops we've got millions of
them stuck in our brains but a recent
one here is deep learning algorithms
it's in my view deep learning is like a
tsunami it's coming you have to do it
you have to have deep learning
components in your system but other
components are also smart a compiler is
a smart component that we know very well
it's able to translate a human readable
program into an efficient execution
that's pretty smart okay especially
since programming languages are not
simple things and many libraries there's
still some kind of intelligence so that
consensus so smartness is in the eye of
the beholder and smart components are
things that we can we add to our systems
okay let me conclude now you've got sort
of an idea so it's hard to design big
systems so the idea is we look at
existing systems biological systems are
very nice
because evolution has debugged them over
a long time not perfect but they're
pretty good in the real world huh living
organisms do a pretty good job and and
this design pattern this kind of a
pattern kept kind of coming back good we
were very unsatisfied with the the
autonomic computing initiative because
they talk about single
feedback loops that doesn't help very
much it solves one small problem your
system we want to build systems so we
found this way of organizing it so the
feedback loops are basically working
together so you have weekly interacting
feedback structures and if you want
smartness you add complex or smart
components where you need okay so this
kind of a design approach so this was
started in the self mint project we are
still working on large scale distributed
computing it's actually not really a
solved problem yet as most people know
there's still a lot of unsolved things
there we're working on edge computing
and edge computing on the internet edge
is very interesting because the edge is
a very hostile environment it's very
dynamic their phones like to be offline
there's no power networks are not very
reliable so we want to do stuff there
also we start noticing the smart
components somehow deep learning is is
coming you could say winter is coming or
deep learning is coming ok also we're
doing large-scale evaluation we really
want to scale things up ok so that's all
I want to say I hope you think it's an
interesting pattern that feedback
structure it's an interesting way of
structuring large systems and that it'll
help you make systems that are more
robust so thank you very much
we have time for a couple of questions
any questions yes what do you what do
you think we've learned since Norbert
wieners book oh we learned a lot of
things although Wiener was very smart
the book has some very interesting
things but Wiener did not really have a
good idea of overall system structure he
was able to look at he was basically a
mathematician he he knew how to optimize
things like regulation feedback loop and
so on he didn't really know how to have
any general way of combining things but
it's part of a more general thing so in
computer science there's like a golden
decade from 64 to 70 for most of ideas
were coming in like closures lazy
execution was in their logic programming
relational database cetera but not
distributed systems distributed systems
came in much later it started in there
only really in the 80s when lamport's
Lamport clocks and Paxos and so on which
was like around 1990 and and it was a
mess until the early 2000s if you look
at distributed system textbooks in the
1990s like there's a book by Gerard tell
from 94 it's just a bunch of things
there's no general principle if you want
general principles you have to wait
until 19 inches book or Rashid Gehry and
Luis Rodriguez is from 2006-2007 where
everything is very carefully structured
in terms of layers in terms of what is
the system model what kind of partial
synchrony are you using so so I think to
answer very briefly we learned a lot
weiner only basically recognized the
problem okay he didn't have any general
solution but he has a very good nose for
recognize the problem he has very good
intuition so it's actually still worth
reading that book
hi thanks so you you present this
pattern the idea of feedback loop and
feedback structure do we have it so we
have this a book from cybernetics and do
we have a more recent book that would
propose some pattern pattern or
structure with the good IDs when you you
should probably not choose very question
there's not that much actually there are
some references there's references here
but some of them are better than others
so so there's a there's a police report
there's this one you can read which
basically explains what I just said but
there's an interesting book by Peter
Singer and his colleagues from 94 which
is basically a library of feedback
structures but in terms of human
organizations so if you look at the
title it looks like that one of these
generic no content management book sir
but don't be don't be deceived it's
really really good so I would recommend
it has a library of several dozen of
these and it explains how you avoid
problems like tragedy of the comments
and many other kinds of global system
problems so other things are I had a
master student here have a survey so
here you have several dozen systems that
are surveyed but still there's no real
general theory of general book said
there are bits and pieces we're still
waiting for like a textbook and that's
all questions we have time for thank you
very much Peter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
