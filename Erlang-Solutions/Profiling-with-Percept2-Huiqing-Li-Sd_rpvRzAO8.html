mitigate Oh is Professor seven Thompson
and from University of Kent is about
providing online programs on multi-core
systems in particular this is done in
the release project so i'm going to say
if it worse by the release and then i'm
going to talk about perceived which is a
profiling tool from the Erlang
distribution so we didn't start from
scratch instead we use percept which we
think is nice and try to make a nicer
and so we got a new version of passivity
which required percept too and i'm going
to show you a small case study with
using percept two parallel a component
of regular which is an refactoring to
have development so first multi-core as
you all know i'm sure you know an alan
has beauty support for module which
means if you have multiple machine and
you start on a note by default you're
going to get multiple schedulers and
which means you you're able to run
things in parallel and make your program
more effective so here is the release
project is a three-year project which
come in close number of universities
from from the UK from sweden grace and a
few companies and so the main idea of
this project is to build a scalable
version of this turbulent which actually
means we we build a new library which
allows you the distribution co Spader
and the main idea come out now so far
that the notion of as groups which means
scalable groups like glue group the urn
on global group and as groups allows you
to group nose into groups but unlike
clockwork which has to you had a group
groups into how to group nose into
petitions for those groups allow
you to allow the groove to be overlapped
so you can establish a hierarchical
structure so we're kind of investing way
or artist is to build tools to allow you
to make use of the multi-core systems
more effectively there is already a
number of tools from for tracing and
profiling are now for them god building
interests chasing it is very powerful
you don't have to change your program
you'd want to recompile just just start
and stop the tracing and then stop it
and this number tools build an officer
Lambert you increase the BGE top tt b
and four functions we have approved
approve and see probes around and also
have a percept with these folk art
concurrent programs and different from
the alum beauties you have the DJ's
which accomplished the latest long
distributions which is a dynamic Tracy
and some other tools and so here we what
we studied with percept and percept is
at the union may have tried a family
because his part of the Allen
distribution is for profiling concurrent
Allen programs it was mainly rated by
bie code at Dahlberg it is built on top
of the airline beauty in chase so we
make username cheese beef and some
functions like garner system profile and
i should say is not our unlive profiling
to is offline profiling to orbit means
you had to provide trace your program
running program to your program and then
get data and analyze the data that you
got profile information I mean you
replay your commutation and so
perceptive provides another function
intensive example has the histogram of
active process and any time during the
execution of the program you can you can
from a PID you can visit information
about a particular process such as start
time and time of parentage children
processes or time information surround
and you can also select a few
process that you are interested i
compared a rather bility and another
nice feature of upset is likely to zoom
in to a particular period of your excuse
you got more detailed data about that
time interval here is what you used and
you get if you use the profile patricio
program and the analyze the data and is
a start the web server and if ya
percentage web pages in difficult
web-based interface here and so what you
see here is a the horns and XY axiom as
is the tying and the y-axis is a number
of active processes which gave you the
Alfea about how many process are active
and any time of execution me activities
at the process vulnerable doesn't miss
running valid visas runnable and it's
not blocked here you can see a list of
processes and some some basic
information about ng porn name or parent
process of and you can you can select
the tix these processes and compare
their own ability like here you can see
and what a bottom part is yeah what time
the process is vulnerable and what time
the process is blocked and so this is
percept and and for us we start from
preserva t we try to make it more mccabe
idea provides more functionality and
make it more usable so we we extend
preserved in both functionality and also
scalability so and bottom is preserved
and tough wait we got we had added new
functionalities such as the schedule
information because we were walking on
water systems a motorist schedule is
there so we reveal the skeletal
scheduler utilization information
process communication the migration
process between round queues away as you
saw just the previous lies Purcell
doesn't distinguish run the ball around
if you see the green is it possible is
the process
neo is not Ronnie but vulnerable so with
percept too we distinguish ground water
running also we add function level
preventive mission so we create dynamic
hog context worker graphs for a full
process and also provides the ground
community at runtime a process of and
function and also added the basic
support for distribution and so on for
scalability and usability we as you saw
the previous one you got lung the flat
list of process there's no structure
there so we we created a scalable
process tree structure so the your web
page will blow up because of many too
many processes and we cut history web
pages the master and the more important
we try to parallel the analyzation
process of a sub 2 so it's so instead of
parallel allies one single fare will
allow procedure to analyze multiple
choice files in parallel so these are
the basic features we have added two
percent o together mix percept too so
now we're just going to talk you through
what percent looks like what
functionality are here in more detail
before okay before that I tell you how
to use percept too so don't mentor three
ways you can you can profile program if
the application is not big is it small
application and you know the engine
function of the bail application so you
can choose to profile the whole realm of
the application so here perceptive
profile you specify the file which is
going to store the twist data here and
the entry function of the application
and some options hey its options so you
can you don't have to prefer to
everything one go so you can choose to
choose a particular aspect of your
application for example you can choose
to just to check the process
vulnerability or you can choose the
schedule a summation of rounding message
passing I want to choose all of this
measuring just use the oil option which
covers all the options above it and it
also like to specify which module you
are interested 224 function profile a so
here you can if you want to generate
call graph you can sleep specialist
modules you want to chase for first back
here you can choose to register into a
single file but you can also use the rap
will meet with you create a collection
of trace files so you specify the base
file names and suffix and the size of
each piece fell and how many the maximum
juice is going to be great and this is
when you want to profile the whole
application run another way is if effect
if you have a very big application this
doesn't not possible to provide the
whole application you can just prefer a
time slice of your application so it
means you can start profiling while your
application is running and it'll stop it
when you think ok got enough data now
dynamically so you don't have to change
anything about your program just started
and stopped it another way if you like
you want to prefer a particular party of
application if you like like I used to
me the code and to insert these two
commands into your code and so you want
to prefer a particular part of the code
that could be used for as well this had
the commands for studying percept so
once you have run your application you
got the tryst data there so you you use
the percent to analyze to analyze your
data so again if you in this function
take a list of hours if you load the
file the twisted into a single file just
provide a messing of our name otherwise
you can provide an elaborate set to
analyze multiple files in parallel and
after an answer
Shin prosthetic create database story
all the Chiefs information night needed
and then you start web server and so you
can see what the the slides i showed you
before in the web interface so this
basically how you profile and lies and
visualize your data it's the commands
the here is an example this this is an i
show you how to visualize the result
this of your page is the same as
perceived as you look you see this
application run actually these things
did I was I got data by profiling
ephemeris dialyzer tool to check tab
check the kernal library so you can see
it's my laptop for schedulers and got
their lights actually creates nearly
5,000 processes and here you see the few
pixie amis and you quite suddenly
dialyzer Chris a lot of processes and
sundays goes down because most of those
processes are blocked is not they are
not active anymore and that's why you
see that the lower base here so this
then the over your part and you can hear
a button you can is a processes you can
if you'd at least if you select
schedulers are going to show the
utilization of schedulers which means
because the maximum scatter here is for
you see in what time and the schedule is
are fully utilized what time only part
of the scheduler active and so that give
yourselves and like one and why i fully
use the resources when not from using
three sources and another tab if you
look the top of this a few taps of there
so if you press the process tab you got
here this is
say the structured process tree so you
can you can click the plus sign to
expand eight or closet if you press the
minus sign so here we added more
information to the written percept want
is you can see the information about
round key changes and but if mention one
message send receive so the wrong code
changes tells you how many times x the
process migrated from one wrong key to
another piece sometimes coming lately
for some days the bottom one we migrated
about one more than 1,000 times the date
about my sis send receive the first
element into po ism the number of
messages sent or received the second and
is averaging average size of the message
sender is this you see I think he's in
pies so if I say is a spin boy if you
click plus sign you can go further down
here and here you may notice things here
because say this sample got nearly 5,000
processes if we put in a single one
table got huge tables is really hard to
navigate so what we did here is a way
here we look at the entry function for
process you may not notice quite a lot
process actually have the same parent
have the same engine functions
businesses are doing very similar job so
we don't have to in this case we there's
no need will list all of them here so we
only list for each this kind of process
which have the same energy function sin
pairing the only least one of those
Solis do this one and for the others we
comprised into one thing of learning
process but it doesn't mean you can't
get access to the information about
those in the process you feel if you
click on them to the dummy PID here you
can see which processes are hiding there
so all the P IDs and click over here so
you could if you click when one of the P
IDs or you may get you get the
information about this particular
process which in contains the
information included in this page also
such as and the parent children process
the time and the message passing here in
the privet page you see the total number
of migrations and this one it gives a
list of Megan here give use a macro view
history so it is in this case may seem a
great from rank you 122 than 21 and 24
Thor gave you it's a complete history of
migration and the bottom bit with this
from the orginal perceptual so it tells
you how much time this process been done
waiting and where and so here gives you
the total run time of this process and
as well back to this page at the bottom
you see a few links and buttons here and
if you press the pressed riesgraf he
desorption it also gives you the graph
representation of the process tree and
here again the way comprised will use
the compressed version is we don't
create a huge call graph and yo pas de
stijl you can see the structure of the
process tree and so all of these nodes
are capable so if you click one of the
nose I go to the information about this
particular process so another option is
a process communication and what we
because on this page what do you will
show you them if summer information
about message descent we see but doesn't
tell you which mess which process to
which process is no corresponding
between processes so if you press the
present communication communication
button we show the actual send
and between pressure from which process
to which process here you see mr. Groff
and the first two were on the label is
the number of times mason sent from the
from the process to target process and
the second is the average size of
message we have many many processes like
this case then is really likely than you
create huge go up here is really hard to
navigate it so we allow you to to
simplify it you specify in cosmos time
and you don't worry about those small
messages endings you only worry about
big message heavy communication between
process so you can specify a threshold
so the first is the minimum number of
sense the second is the average size of
the message and this allow you to
simplify the graph and 2 lucky 22 to
focus on those parts which you really
want to have a look so it is can't w we
increased the threshold and only show
those heavy message passing between
processes so this help you to focus on
the most really an you teasing part
there's another thing and in you can
days you take the process and the boxes
here you want to compare the run ability
and of course if there are too many
messes process you can you can choose to
ignore those hidden process or those
children places like these these tix but
in the example I think I take to all of
them so we want to compare the random
editor of those processes so what I get
here and if you if you press the the the
compare button and you see the run
ability of this process actually are
here I because I can't show the hollow
all the process but I got somewhere
oh here so you see it is all others
processes are listed here and but like
most most process doesn't take exit for
a long time but I spend the most time
waiting for an activation
sorry
and this is because if you want to talk
a previous one weeks because I dialyzer
it off tonight's the way how processed
our activities so only actives the
number of activities the process roughly
the same as a number of schedule a
logical scheduler so the reason so you'd
reduce the time processes spend down
waiting but runnable by now running so
save memory but you can also see some
other cases which are not so of night of
nights like this example you see the the
the orange part means the progress the
process is running but because there's
no sweets are available waiting waiting
and the green part means that the
process is actually running and the
white bathe me is the partners it's
blocked or waiting for me as it is so he
give you a clear picture see how much
times the processes and spend the press
time is spent on waiting running or
runnable it also allow you to see some
bad smells in your code with example in
this case you see one of the process is
really heavy loaded but other words
others not so this give you some idea
okay maybe I need to to reflect my code
to make the workload epitome process
more balanced and sometimes you can also
see a future like these illegal lost
pictures but really short lived okay
some of these are blank because it's
time is so strong so short we can't show
it but if it's not got very short time
but it may you may want to see what's he
doing our cause this process I executing
so so you can give you quality of
mission here and so a functional pro pro
funny so the reason I want to add
functional function providing to the
public post for example in this case I
see one of the process really have a
loaded I wanna see what code the
processor is executing so when how much
time is spent on functional particular
function so but preserved he doesn't
provide any and function information
that's why we added to the first to have
but they're quite a few function
profiling tool is already in earn alike
I proof proof carbon or see proof but
the thing is I proof gives very
competitive measure body nearly slow a
proof listen is ok but it doesn't give
enough information because I want to see
for example of the relation between
function calls but improve doesn't give
you this situation so we actually we
want to achieve something return a proof
and evil means i want to get enough
information format for my analysis but i
want to doesn't want to slow down my
system too much so that's why we added
this function to function on providing 2
to 4 sep two and the difference between
perceptive function profiling with
others so mainly the difference between
approved that is a perceptive doesn't
calculate own functions own excellent
i'm this close and you can induce days
if you profile every function call like
both within the application and with
your libraries but the perceptor allows
you to specify which module you want two
functions defined in which mode you want
to prefer so it doesn't go depends on
how many modules specify the only owned
in profile function differently those
modules it doesn't give you competitive
nature by the time spent on every
function in the function is around and
that's why we don't calculate the own
execution time but in a way is much
quicker it creates less twisty the
bodies is quick and i'll still give you
a quite useful mission here and also we
try to make faster by allow you to to
selectively twist processes which means
because it's quite often if you the same
process for a lot of children process
and these children was actually doing
very similar work
for Coke or perverse we don't want to
generate a cocker for every process
because it's very likely the co graph
has a very similar structure so we want
to only want to see a few of them and so
that's why we want to select it with
profiling those process which do a
similar job so at the moment this is
down by replacing the spool functions in
your code with the version provided by
percept too but it only need to replace
those poor functions but this video's
the choice D that's quite a lot because
um us only with depends on how many
similar process they are we we decrease
the chance that a particular process is
going to be profiled by the way still
and profile enough processes so for
example example this version which I
enabled the function profiling so
basically I'm profiling all of the fun
of the modules from the dialyzed
application but not the library
functions and you see some of the tea
ideas are highlighted here if it
appeared is highlighted means there is a
call graph generated for dead process
otherwise me there's no crock off you
can see on only only the gap between the
highlighted process getting bigger
because we do reduce the chance of
getting prevailed so if you press if
process is allowed to see it coker for
this Kate and you just click on this
pinhead link and then go to the the
press the information page about this
process and you can see there's a link
so call grow up in time for measure here
you just click this link and then we got
 off for this process and it is i
said is context-aware process because we
do not come
I it was nose with the silly function
name so means you can see actually the
core pass from this function to that
function for the parts are not combined
you can label it means how many times
that function is called and also the
bracket is how much time of the lifetime
of the process is spend on this function
call and so by looking as his co graph
also sorry in third date because in case
you create quite huge a call graph it
has simplified but by increase the
stretch hose and so by looking
discography you know where most in time
of the processes spend and if you want
if you want to investigate a particular
function if information you can click
the function the note here and give it
goes to the page like for this function
but the only thing I think sad it is
about the time how much actually not
percentage hung how long how much an x
the function is spending this function
so this then this is a functional
profiling an awesome feature we added
support for distribution miss you would
you can allows you to to Tracy multiple
nodes and allies those trees 51 together
and just shows you and then this co-op
show you so see the communication
between Putin knows so the x-axis is a
timed why is the next size of messages
so every dot is a graph shows and
message passing between two knows so
this is still quite basic stuff here so
these are most of the functionalities we
added to preserve the some other modes
like and also allows you to do sampling
profiler and also a world another
feature is if you click the function
names
note we connected to the actual code for
the alarm code so there are some odd
features added in the same time so next
about the scalability of a preserved the
original % was a sequential program so
you did you take them to aspire you
analyze than the Chiefs data one by one
and it's not very fast so we to make a
scalable we tried two things the first
instead of allies 12 is fair way we
paralyzed percept to analyze and
multiple choice files even though the
nun thing is and within the ala days of
a single trees fell we also tried to
pearl out it'll make you faster if when
you have will you analyze multiple
choice fell still the result is
comprised combined into one single
result they don't have multiple
databases to create a while single
database as what as you see before so
here a way we did the very simple test
using the bench our which is a another
tool from the release project this shows
the cough shows way I with with the
perilous version the scalability the
scalability of the Paris version with
hear God's five trees fails and total is
one point 360 the here's number is the
number of trees messages contending this
youthful so we've got quite nice ask you
up and so this part is scalability so as
I said we're adding more still adding
more features too perceptive and here is
a small kissteria shows you how to
attend make use of situations provide
advice / sep two so one can I took
wrangler Chris I 20 we have developers
so we know what's going on inside and
one function of regular is for Claudia
tection VCU you find the oblique Cody
your code base so it have it has a
a number of stages so first you have the
past files into a st after syntax tree
and then you have to flatten these those
sts into strings and then you can do a
stream level cim clone tection and then
you've got you got the cat datum clones
and then you your check head to make
sure there's no to get rid of those
false positives so here what you see
this is original version what if you
provide this is what i see the ave
opaque looks you can see most time
they're learning quite and small number
of two or three processes are running
with had secret show ok can you detect
variable renaming some people when they
cut and paste code they need to change
the variable name can you detect that
with regular yeah um yeah good but yes
yeah and when i go back to my code i can
fix that problem so here's the process
the nutrient if you compare the random
busy of the processes and you see here
because it's screen show one of the
process he doing most of the job is
today's capacity Meadows is spending a
lot of time but the other process are
heightened and lightly loaded and then
we generate some we prefer the functions
as well and dinner is some core graph
and if you look at the call graph of
this process the most important one and
here's associate in five version because
I use them so make a smaller and you
immediately kinds for the few places you
want to have a look so first here is the
Miss look this is like from the function
name you can see is a list compression
and expression and this one you got
least a 4h both of these take a lot of
time and another one this one is
requesting function call also takes a
lot of time so you
both the few places i can function which
takes most of time and if you look at
then you look at your code you see okay
can i holla parallel this part I can I
prove it and so now for example for this
list compression actually some cases
kinds can be quite simple you just do is
very simple transmission and and it's
done and so this is a chokehold
polystichum compression takes a list of
files and profess and it has the past
hash and denies the tasty and so very
easily we can change the least
compression to a parallel map so I hear
them and this library / lib is a library
I wrote myself so just for for
experiments but cause you can't read
your own as well and or you can use the
library's phone yeah yeah and another
case folder for this one list for each
the code is like it's also quite simple
you just take a list of the forms is a
maps to every function you're in Ireland
fell and and you actually putting
process every st of every function and
then what we change which into a
parallel version placed voyage but here
and nothing is the parallel because
sometimes you may not want to create the
too many processes less use that you saw
before this and if you got too many
process there may be some participants
too much time waiting runnable month but
there are not drowning and so here you
can't enjoy how many fun means hey you
can chop a long list of elements into
small list so here you can specify how
many processes i want to spoil here for
example can be the number from schedule
as well and then if you look at this
function which is a recursive function
call here a what takes it takes a list
of clogged harridans and allies everyone
played
and but it's little bit harder than the
simple ones Chris you can see and Jason
they said this dependence return the
consecutive trick question because the
locus of the num num plus one here
because use the data from the previous
recursion in that case if on the prolite
you have to somehow get rid of the
dependence so this for this case we
rightly rotator beta so CAD rate of
failure than we are able to use a
parallel for each this question
sometimes can't get hard about cause you
have to think about not only dependence
about also steady effect so the oddest
thing things but sometimes you can't
really do it easily and this is how we
we get off the dependence and and we use
up the parallel version or forage and so
so basically after three steps we kind
of and transformed the spiritual
connection to a parallel version and we
this is the graph and you'll run after
the paralyzation can see the wii
distributes work two more processes but
of course it's not the end of the
pattern of the day you can still do move
and you keep going and here you got the
perfect version and still with those
three factories we also get quite nice
and speed up and so this case da day and
we also have been doing some other work
this particular isn't a colleague and
Rob and about visualization of in about
a visualization and so as you see this
graph is for visualizing the with the
process migration between different cues
and also they wrote the size of rank use
so this this one was guide from
running an application on the 12 physic
call 24 logical schedules so within the
circle you see them the curve the lies
means that the migration of process from
one run queue to another and outside
circles the boss here it indicates the
size of the wrong team so the dark
column is and bigger size and light
economies and smallest monkey size if
you want to watch them the full and
visualization the video you can detect
link from Samos blog you can see the
animation and there so another end
visualization is for visualizing the
communication between Allah knows as I
mentioned earlier one of the idea from
release project is s groves and here I
shows you for overlapping and ice
grooves and this this and which lies so
see the communication between the nose
you can so basically you can see the
protein structure and also the
communication between nose so this is a
visualization work of doing yeah so
that's basically and what we have done
in recently we seen the contest on
release project he's a profiling tool
and and also we're very grateful for the
preserve team for us to allow us to
extend percept yeah so just as island
any questions can you put the slide
before the visualization place just one
before the visualization or than the one
before yeah oh this looks like you get
super perfect scalability yeah was that
possible I mean you had foreign yet you
have for schedule s and the speedup is
four and a half I okay this part I
wasn't quite sure why but this is an
magnify this is a as he's the same test
data we send a situation version but I
didn't try and with other other data but
this is a particular case I wasn't quite
sure why this goes up but he said I
would say I got its graphics in
potential just so pictures around the
application and many times and then
calculate how this estate and time so
Doris Grove Joe beats more slow mountain
in your tables and visualization part
about perceptive but be nice to have
registered named protesters where you
have beets if they have any of course
just for visual visualizing data your
paper stick has a registered name it
would be nice to see your natural name
instead of beat oh and right person
sometimes process on already stage yeah
if it's possible you like like this case
a weight basically we don't see any and
process names because no I think so you
have this species the process is
register than you show yeah okay this
yeah so I think isn't maybe not many
only you said I need a cut right for you
ok another one the IC recently from the
OTP you guys I I was looking but I
couldn't find the reference people are
complaining about web-based tools and
they're going towards wxwidgets why did
you choose web version and what are the
reasons for that it wasn't made to
choose the preset originals you do the
web database so that's why did intensity
is by the way we have some students
we're trying to improve html5 and
improve the interface but what do you
think is it better to do it on such
these kind of tools on on web or or WX
widgets or something desktop platform
I'm not quite familiar with only three
tutorials but it went because a link so
everything had the screenings like I
think yeah I think in some situations
it's actually easier to have something
that's portable on in the browser VX
widgets there are little quirks on the
different platforms so
more questions bring out your dead yes
there's another one ok so in the process
you yeah you see some again some time as
of the function calls yes so the
question is what are these diamonds is
its old time or time it's not on time
he's alone and it's a total time for
this function is there any possibility
to distinguish between runtime and wait
time and function call graph around time
and wait I'm you have it you can see how
much time it there's a suspend a garbage
collector you can see how much time you
spend on those Alexei here you got
assistance to spend time means the
process is not running it is a function
ism ok so for example I have some
function that can that contains also
also against her a call yeah and I need
to figure out if it is a all time of
this function all right style spanned
waiting for a similar message that's why
I'm ok so you know and I've proved it if
you both own time and total time but
certain because you have to profile all
the function calls but we just saw that
too expensive for us yep you don't need
here to profile any function on time
just process run time due to an
execution dysfunction and process in
social yes you have some you have some
it's this time like a bracket the time
is the time spent on this function call
but you want to really go to detail
within this function in case + % allow
you to specify which function or which
ma do you want to prevail and then you
can supply those function names and now
actually when i'm debugging performance
on a multi-threaded application i need
to understand two things so which
functions are taking a lot of cpu and we
sure they get a lot of weight time if
you had a complex system that have a lot
of multi-process interaction in this
graph it's complete it's really
essentially the wait time in the process
the information
I hear the bottom bidding shows how much
time the press the function spent a 1
keep waiting for you to put here
so in the list that you had all the
processes in the system yes yeah grab
something is there a way for sorting
them or I please yeah because if this is
like thousands of processes I know maybe
for not for this ok rock and maybe not
for this one ok and my god it's
impossible there's a mother PDC you can
see I'm sure you can't do you can saute
ok thank you then thank you who cooing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
