people in I expected someone architected
bachelor technologies have been there
for just about a year now and you know
innovation is a hobby of mine so I'll
tell you why according to the trade
press blogs Twitter and all the media
every company out there is innovative
every company describes itself as being
highly innovative doing lots of
innovation and every technology they
develop every product they develop is
described as being disruptive how many
of you have heard these terms over and
over and over again innovation and
disruption they're kind of overused kind
of cliches at this point so they have
well they haven't lost their meaning but
they're sort of in danger of losing
their actual meaning I've been a
developer for 28 years now and over my
years of doing that I was always
bothered by certain things I was
bothered by you know why I was building
this nice technology like korva for
example why something inferior would be
deemed better than something I thought
was technically superior why it would
win in the marketplace I was bothered by
managers not appreciating the ideas that
my colleagues and I would have four
products or product features and I was
bothered by just the arguments that
developers had on especially on Usenet
back in a day today on sites like Reddit
programming go read it where they're
arguing about technology arguing about
approaches and it just goes on and on
sometimes it gets kind of hateful almost
attack personal attacks and stuff like
that and I was always bothered by why
can they argue so much or we argue so
much have any of you ever been bothered
by any of this stuff
to the self-help group so let's use 2004
I was attending world wide web
conference in Budapest and the CEO of
the company I work for at that time was
those Iona technologies talk about I own
a little bit later but the CEO called me
up said to Steve I've some bad news your
job is no longer we don't have a job for
you anymore are plenty say we don't need
your job anymore I said well could you
at least let me go back to the States no
because I'm in Hungary I was just joking
of course but he said the good news is
we have a different job for you a
different job was head of innovation
like okay you know I've never done
anything like that before i'm not a
business person i'm not a product
manager i'm a developer but if that's
the job sounds interesting i'll try to
do it so what i thought was innovation
really turned out not to be what
innovation really is all about i spent
several years just learning what
innovation is and started to see how it
could answer some of these questions
that i had about you know why
technically inferior products can win
and things like that so I've given this
talk a couple times it's really aimed
developers who have these same kind of
questions developers trying it's not
about developers trying to start
companies I'm not going to tell you
about be seized or anything like that
I'm just really talking about innovation
the types of innovation the way it
happens and things that you could learn
for by knowing how actual innovation
works that's why in the title of the
talk it's as you absolutely need to know
this because it really changes your
perspective on development and product
development in particular and can make
you I think a better developer
understanding product lifecycles better
and stuff like that so talk about
technology adoption
we'll talk about hard drives how many of
you were developing back in 1975 just a
few as I I wasn't I was 12 whether 12
yrs old well back then you had these 14
inch drives and I've seen these things
because we were still in use when I did
start you know in the early 80s I was at
texas instruments and there were a lot
of mainframes and they had these big
disk packs and they had these 14-inch
you know metal blades and then basically
and you can see here that we have hard
disk capacity on the y-axis and 14 inch
drive technology you can see that it's
improving over time it's getting higher
capacity over time and the reason it's
getting that is due to sustaining
innovations it's called the sustaining
innovation sustaining innovation is the
improvement of a product along some axis
that's important to a customer the
performance is improving in some way
that's important to a customer and it's
pretty normal right this is the type of
stuff that we do pretty much on a daily
basis improving products and proving
systems improving technologies in ways
that the users of those things care
about so sustaining innovations have led
to overtime this 14 inch drive
technology getting better if we look at
the demand in the mainframe market for
capacity we can see that it's a little
less than what the actual capacity
increases were giving us the demand in
the mainframe market was you know
slightly less so customers are happy
they're getting what they need are
getting more than what they need in fact
all is well this new technology comes
along 8 inch hard drive you can see that
it has a much lower capacity than the
14-inch drive right and you can see that
it's also improve
over time due to sustaining innovations
well the ath dr wasn't really good
enough for the mainframe market because
they need a higher capacity so what's it
good for the mini computer market many
computers came along they didn't need
the same capacity that a mainframe
needed so the 8 inch drive fit perfectly
for the mini computer market you can see
that the mini computer demand for
capacity was lower than what the 8 inch
drives were delivering so customers are
happy there's a demand for mainframe
market you can see right up there i wish
i had a pointer or something or very
long arm but the technology for the 8
inch drive eventually crosses the demand
mine for what the mainframe users needed
down here you know back in the late 70s
the mainframe users are completely
ignoring this 8-inch drive as where the
mainframe disk manufacturers they look
at the 8 inch drive and say who cares
look at the capacity on that thing it's
crap right I can't use that but over
time it improves through sustaining
innovation it reaches the point in say
10 years later in the late 80s where it
actually does fit the demand in the
mainframe market and that is disruption
that's disruptive technology at that
point at that point customers could then
look at the 8 inch drives which were
more reliable cheaper and get their
demand satisfied by this technology so
why do you need a 14-inch drive anymore
I heard stories i don't know maybe some
of you guys who would use these can tell
me but I've heard stories from people
actually use the 14 inch drives that
sometimes they would break apart and the
disk would actually fly out of the
housing and embed itself in the wall who
wants a 14 inch metal disc flying at you
in your data center right so 8 inch
drive probably hurts less yeah at least
got that so when you hear someone talk
about disruption they use it today in a
way that's really a lot different than
what I just described these in a way
that's more like you know somebody has a
market and somebody else went into the
market as well like their competitors
but that's not really what disruption is
about if we continue to look through
time you know the five and a quarter
inch drive came out and again it's way
down here in terms of capacity compared
to the 8 inch drive the mini computer
market couldn't use a five and a quarter
inch drive to begin with but this new
market pc market personal computer
market could certainly use it and did
use it and you see that same kind of
curve of sustaining innovation taking
care of that market and then eventually
crossing over disrupting the 8 inch
drive market the manufacturers of these
14 inch drives 8 inch drives they didn't
really pay attention to these things
like i said earlier pier 14 inch drive
manufacturer or manufacturer 14 inch
drives i guess be more proper you're not
going to look at the 8 inch drive and
say look that's worse we should build
those right there's no point your
customers don't want it you built a 14
inch drive well until the danish drive
comes along and starts stealing our
customers then you go Oh what do I do
now I'm going to try to build an 8 inch
drive well you can't because you have an
practice building an 8 inch drive and
you out of business so these
manufacturers actually went out of
business 14-inch drive manufacturers
went out of business 8 inch drive
manufacturers
went out of business and you know you
could continue through three and a half
inch drives 1.8 inch drives etc and you
see this pattern as you look through
this market of hard disk drives see the
pattern over and over with people
missing these disruptions and their
business ends due to that it's not just
in the hard disk market or whatever
there's other industries that have the
same pattern how many of you have heard
this book how many of you have actually
read this book very few if you do
nothing else so you know what TL DR too
long didn't read how about t LDL too
long didn't listen if you do nothing
else today from this talk or get nothing
else from this talk you should go read
this book you will learn a tremendous
amount you'll learn all about what I
just described the use case I just
described comes from the book there's
also use cases about the excavator
industry same pattern and a couple of
more industries where the same pattern
happens over and over and the author of
this book is a guy named Clayton
Christensen he's at Harvard University
he's been looking at innovation for
years and years and this book was quite
a seminal piece of work because it put
this framework around you know
innovation how companies can use it how
innovation destroys companies how you
know you can win if you understand that
so if we run through this again this is
how how this all works so some
technology gains traction with some
customers I'm going to describe later
the types of customers that typically
would help but any technology start to
gain traction but we'll get into that
the sustaining innovations then allow
the technology to meet and continue to
meet
circum customer demands some new
technology comes along it's inferior to
the current technology but it's
targeting a different market segments
that comes along and the incumbents you
know the people producing the incumbent
technology they initially ignore this
technology because it's inferior it's
not in a market they're serving it's not
as good as the technology they have so
they just ignore it this inferior
technology moves it's called moving up
market it moves up market because it too
is going through this period of
sustaining innovation it's improving
along lines that customers care about
and the reason it moves up market is
it's when those lines cross it improves
enough to then go into another market
where it was initially not good enough
right it wasn't good enough it's
inferior but through sustaining
innovation becomes good enough and then
starts to serve the other market it
disrupts that market by becoming good
enough to serve there and the new
technology you know obviously has to be
kind of cheaper better etc because the
customers up there aren't going to adopt
it if it's worse than what they already
have the incumbent sees this process
happening and they just say you know I
don't really care because the the top
customers that I have in my market are
still buying my stuff and they're the
ones I really care about they pay top
dollar for what I give them so you know
what that lower end of the market it's
not profitable so I'm just going to let
the the new technology have that and I
will focus on this high end of my market
and that's where all the money is the
problem is that the disruption actually
continues it just keeps eating away at
the market and basically starts forcing
the incumbent into higher and higher
costs
a smaller segments of the customers they
still are very good paying customers but
there's fewer and fewer of them and then
eventually the incumbent says I got to
do something about this you know I'm
going to try to build whatever it is
this new technology is and typically
like I said earlier they can't do it
it's too late or they just aren't
equipped to build that technology and
think about a business the new
technology has disrupted their market
any questions about that did you
mentioning that they rarely do not like
to cannibalize themselves because that's
what they had to do yeah the point is
that these businesses don't cannibalize
themselves I'm going to talk about that
a little bit later but but that's that
is key so this is the innovators dilemma
you have success with some technology
whatever it is and you're making money
from it but some technology is going to
come along and kill your market it's
inevitable if your market has any value
someone wants a piece of that market as
well and you may not know what that
technology is but it's bound to happen
so what do you do do you pretend that
it's not going to happen or do you kind
of say hey this is going to happen I'm
going to make it happen I'm going to
cannibalize myself I'm going to destroy
my own market if you destroy your market
that's probably better than somebody
else destroying it so it's a tough call
right that's the dilemma I want to run
through some examples from my career
what I did is a kind of thought back to
the all the projects have been on and
thought about the reasons that they
succeeded or failed the reasons i
thought i should say the reasons i
thought initially that they succeeded or
failed when they occur
I went back to those now armed with this
knowledge and start thinking about these
projects and products and then realized
that knowing what I now knew about
innovation and how markets work that the
reasons I thought things failed or
succeeded were completely off because I
thought about it in terms of technology
I thought about it in terms of you know
we used this programming language versus
that one and so it was better quality
and it doesn't usually work that way you
know doesn't matter so how many of you
have heard of Apollo computer huh that's
more than usual of course everyone's
heard of Sun Microsystems yeah i was at
palo computer from c 1987 until nineteen
eighty nine they invented the
engineering work station so the mini
computer came along the personal
computer had come along the engineering
work station was kind of in between
those two it was a very powerful machine
for its time but it was typically a
desktop or kind of SAT to the side of
your desk but it was a very powerful
computer meant for single user the
technology that pollow had was
unbelievable i think there's things
apollo did back in the 80s that still
have not been equaled in the technology
we have today the networking was amazing
I considered my desk in Massachusetts
and access file systems on machines up
in New Hampshire that were 60 miles away
as if you know I mean obviously there's
some latency there but there was no
weird kind of mounting there was no need
to think about the fact that that thing
was up there was just a unified final
system across the network there were
customers like Boeing that did all their
kind of airplane designs in using Apollo
computers i was at texas instruments
before Apollo and everything we did I
was working in chips was a hardware guy
to start with all the chip design that
we did was either done on a propriety
great Texas Instruments system or on
Apollo the verification of chips was
done on mainframes but then they start
to move down to the Apollo systems all
right so very powerful customers very
rich customers Apollo had a pretty good
market son started kind of at the lower
end of the workstation market once
Apollo was gone by the way they tried to
revise history and say that they
invented the engineering work station
but I was there and I can tell you they
did but they what they did is they used
a standard technologies that Berkeley
UNIX they had tcp/ip which was you know
a standard at that point but was only
then becoming deployed widely whereas
Apollo had proprietary technologies they
had their own operating system based on
the ideas and multics they had their own
network was a token ring network no
Ethernet easing that kind of came later
but the technology that son had was
inferior and even the looks of their
machines were you know they just didn't
look very good I Apollo's were really
cool looking son boxes or disk these
little things you know what could you do
with one of those but some start
targeting these kind of lower end
customers in the workstation market that
rule really weren't profitable to Apollo
Apollo had a big installation at
University of Michigan but I don't know
that they were real big in colleges
universities where a son was really
widely used in that area for example I
was going to make a slide that explained
all this stuff but I just said son
disrupted Apollo the story basically
goes that as son kind of came into the
low end of the market they took out
customers and Apollo was forced to move
higher and higher up the value chain
focusing on their top customers and
seeding the market 22 son basically
saying well you can have those customers
anyway we don't make any money from them
and but sons technology kept improving
and proving at the same time though the
industry was starting to
build you know more networked systems
and they needed standards for doing that
tcp/ip was coming along and people are
using it the internet was growing and
some had that Apollo didn't so when you
went to buy system you went to Sun and
just plugged it in and kind of worked it
worked with whatever else you have kind
of but with Apollo you had no chance of
that because it was proprietary not
working Apollo tried to react finally
they put in their own low-end kind of
workstations still look better than the
Sun boxes but looks aren't everything
right they were mildly successful but it
was too late in 1989 hewlett-packard
bought Apollo for their technology not
for keeping their product lines alive
they really wanted the people in the
technology and within just a couple of
years I think Apollo was pretty much
people still used it for another decade
or so but they were pretty much done
there is one thing left of Apollo that
maybe you don't know about but everyone
writes URLs every day and you windows
users use these I think they're called
UNC path names those slashes / / that's
how you that was the roof of the Apollo
file system so if you wanted to reach a
file like i said i was in massachusetts
up in New Hampshire I need to know
machine name up there i would say / /
machine name / foo / bar I was talking
to tim berners-lee one time and I
mentioned I worked out Apollo but he
said you worked at Palo that was great
stuff I had pollos and that's where the
/ / came from in URLs so the the
backslash backslash in Microsoft was due
to an Apollo fellow going to join
Microsoft around well I guess about the
time Apollo was was purchased by HP and
he went in and started working on things
that later became like
yeah but the full pathname like this but
there-there DCE support and all that
kind of stuff so that's pretty much that
and some photos on the web i think are
all that's left of apollo another
example from my career was Orbix verses
or because this gets into korba i worked
for Iona and poor VIX was the product of
ion technologies Iona was one of the
maybe the most successful Irish software
companies and Orbix was this enterprise
grade or object request broker and it
was expensive you know this was kind of
before the days of open-source really
taking root as it has done today but
then along comes this company called
object-oriented concepts OC and they had
an orc called orbit asst which is kind
of a cool name it was an open source or
so by this time this is like the late
90s you know open source was taking root
of course Erlang was open source 1998
and orcas was inferior to Orbix
initially it didn't have as many
features it didn't have all the bells
and whistles that are Iona's most
demanding customers needed it was free
for non-commercial use and there was a
small license fee for commercial use now
this is you know obviously you could
think Josie was going to disrupt Iona I
see it coming Corvo was fairly popular
back then that's around the time i
published my book i actually co-wrote
the book with a guy who later worked at
OVO see a lot of people wanted to use
especially in academia I wanted to use
korva but they didn't want to go with
licensed product from us they couldn't
afford it you know basically couldn't
afford to do that so orbach is really
appealed to them and they started using
it of course they wanted all features
that other users had so auriga's started
to improve and you know you can see
where or bcuz could take
and you know disrupt the market but what
happened was I ona yeah we noticed that
OC was coming along and starting to take
away the lower end of the market and
what we did is we bought OC and what we
did next was extremely important which
is why it's underlined we just left it
alone we see keep doing what you're
doing leave the engineers in place we've
you know basically give them product
managers and give them a market you know
that low end of the market that you
address so well well keep doing that and
both orbs continue in parallel and we
were getting profits from both ends of
the market and that's unusual so this is
a success story when we talked about
cannibalizing your own market that's a
good example of semi Cadillac
cannibalizing your own market you know
bringing something else in because it's
kind of a threat you break you can you
make your enemies closer right bring
your enemy in now your friend and you
have both ends of the market there's
this concept of over serving you have
these sustaining innovations that are
improving your technologies and products
I guess the point where you have so many
features and things that your customers
just don't need it all and that's those
customers become right for helping
disruption to take place because they're
looking at what you have or staying
young paying for all this stuff in this
thing but i only need this much what if
there's something else around that only
has this much and they start to look at
these you know so-called inferior
products that you know don't have all
those features so you think of digital
cameras and smartphones of cameras
initially unite have your digital camera
and your phone and someone sticks a
camera in the phone and take a picture
and go off junk I don't like that but
you know that improves over time and it
kind of disrupts the digital camera
market now there's still digital cameras
obviously but they tend to be high-end
address
those high-end customers willing to pay
for that that technology but most people
are served quite well with the camera on
the phone they're over served by the
digital camera another thing to think
about is non-consumption co2 markets x
and y and you could have a disruptive
technology that's eventually going to
take over market x but it starts in
market y it addresses the fact that
there are people that are not using the
technology and market x they're just not
consuming that technology so it gets a
start in a market where the initial
technology isn't taking place or isn't
taking root it then moves up market
eventually through sustaining
innovations and takes over another
market and we saw that earlier with the
disk drive so those two concepts of over
serving and non-consumption are
important when you start thinking about
innovation and sustaining versus
disruption another example from my
career this is what I work on now is a
at that show we have the react database
which is a no sequel database and so you
think of relational databases versus no
sequel database of course relational
databases are very popular very capable
they're not really going to go away
anytime soon they've been used for years
and years and years and they provide
certain guarantees for data storage and
know what they really do I know you
dropped it I'm not lying I think those
of you who use these these databases
know that some of them are quite
expensive you know not only the database
itself but the support you pay and all
that kind of stuff no sequel databases
on the other hand are really about
choice but the relational model gives
you certain range of freedom but there's
a lot of applications out there that
just can't work with a relational model
and no sequel models give them the
choices they need not only in terms of
modeling their data but
in terms of scalability availability
trade-offs the no sequel systems also
tend to be a lot less expensive so is no
sequel disrupting the relational market
well in May of 2011 a year ago Oracle
published a white paper that was
entitled debunking the no sequel myth in
October you couldn't get that paper
anymore because Oracle had added no
sequel features to their product and a
new product line of no sequel database
basically they took a product they had
and sort of added some features and then
repurposed it to become a no sequel
database that's typically a sign that
some sort of disruption is taking place
think of a beachhead you're going to
land in a market you're going to take
over and debate that market so some of
the beachheads that no sequel currently
has they're being used in applications
where the relational model doesn't fit
so that's non-consumption someone's not
using relational there a target for no
sequel the low end customers don't need
all the bells and whistles especially
the price tag of these high-end
relational systems so they turn to no
sequel and they make it work and then
like I said these relational ma products
are reacting by sticking no sequel
features and are trying to anyway
sticking no sequel features into their
databases obviously no sequel systems
will continue to advance you could think
of them as inferior if you're a
relational programmer a sequel guy right
you you look at something like Rihanna
go whoa that doesn't do what I need
that's that's no good you think of it as
inferior but these inferior systems as
we've seen all along disk drives and
steam shovels and every other industry
they get better and better so there
could be disruption that occurs at that
point i'll talk about technology
adoption lifecycle how many of you have
seen this kind of graph before it's not
too surprising i mean
basically you have some technology that
starts out with well I guess one user
would be the hopefully the person that
developed it and it increases over time
and then eventually you know kind of
wayne's you can categorize the users
along this timeline start on the far end
there with innovators these are people
who look for new technologies is looking
to take advantage of new technologies
they want to gain the upper hand and get
maybe a first mover advantage which is
very real using a technology to solve
some problem that currently isn't solved
very well these are the kind of people
that are the disruptors basically then
you have early adopters they're like the
innovators but these people are a lot
more you know they're going to really
make things happen you know the
innovators maybe tend to be the kinds of
people that go oh look something shiny
and they'll go play with it and say this
is great but then five minutes later
they're on to something new where the
early adopters are really more pragmatic
they're going to look at it and go yeah
I could really make use of this then you
have this majority in the middle the
early majority are a little bit more
willing to take a risk than the late
majority but they're the ones that
really make or break a technology you
know the technology or product is going
to be successful it's the ones in the
middle that are going to make that
happen obviously that's when the product
is being most used in its lifetime so
those are the people are going to give
you money basically and then you have
laggards people that are risk averse
they don't want to use the technology
until it's been proven and all the bugs
are worked out and they're looking for
support they're looking for kind of
hand-holding anything breaks they're
going to be on the phone with you and
you know it has to work it's a different
way of looking at this though which is
dividing it into these different markets
earlier
mainstream market and legacy market but
there's this thing called the chasm how
many of you have heard of crossing the
chasm the guy named Geoffrey Moore did
some studies that showed that this
between the early market in the
mainstream market is this chasm that
companies fall into technologies fall
into because getting from those early
adopters to the mainstream market is
really really difficult that's where
innovation is real hard and so companies
fail at that point I'll talk a little
bit about that going forward here how
many of you are managers okay pension
manager that's okay you've made it the I
want to talk about the role of
management with respect to innovation so
in your manager your job is to foster
this product you know kind of it's
almost like a child you're raising the
product and bringing it up and hoping to
make it succeed and doing things take
care of it and nurture it and there are
some really good managers out there that
do this very well they're doing all the
right things and I'm not talking about
just like a line manager or a middle
manager it goes from executives all the
way up and down the chain they're doing
all the right stuff but the company or
the product still fails well how can
that be you're doing all the right stuff
and things fail it doesn't make sense
managers are really in pursuit of profit
right if the products is a success then
customers like it because they're buying
it they're paying you for it and you're
keeping them happy through sustaining
innovations you're doing all the right
stuff and your customers say hey I need
this feature and you go off and build it
and they're happy and the way the
manager
rewarded is you know by making the
product success successful leading to
profits but the problem is that when you
focus on that product like that you're
just leaving the door open for something
else come along and disrupt your market
you're not paying attention all right
you're paying attention you're doing all
the right stuff for your product but
you're not doing all the right stuff
necessarily for your company protect
against disruption you actually as we
mentioned earlier might disrupt your own
market you might develop another
technology but replaces the one you work
on but typically managers aren't
rewarded for doing that right if the
Prophet gets bigger your rewards get
bigger if you're going to go to your
superiors say hey I know we're really
doing well on this product but we need
to watch for disruption so I'm going to
now start working on this other product
that doesn't make as much money and good
with that what do you think they're
going to say probably and not so much
cute right yeah they try to shoot your
death note so Geoffrey Moore had a quote
on Twitter hmm few months ago as soon as
management mentality overwhelmed
leadership mentality the pull of the
past begins he has a new book called
escape velocity you're trying to escape
the past right if you're going to be
innovative if you're going to make sure
that your markets aren't disrupted by
somebody else stealing your customers
you have to be leaders you can't be you
know managers you can't be shepherds of
these existing products you have to be
looking at new things you have to keep
your eyes open and look for these things
that are coming from all directions that
might disrupt your market and be able to
react to those another way of putting
what Geoffrey Moore says is came from
someone named Linden sharp on Twitter
that I just saw the other day IT
managers putting the no in innovate
it's just like I said if you went to
someone said I'm going to work on this
lower end product that's Noble you know
it's inferior to what we are building
now they'd say are insane but it's
actually what you have to do the
solution is really really difficult
organizations have to be able to
cannibalize themselves they have to be
able to disrupt their own markets they
have to be able to nurture multiple
technologies at different points along
that life cycle curve all at the same
time you have to have things that are
down at the innovators level working
with innovation our innovative customers
you have to have things in the middle
that are appealing for the mainstream
market you have to have things at the
end of the market the laggards are using
because that's that's cash cow territory
right you don't have to do much to those
products you've already worked out all
the bugs and stuff they're not really
asking for new features they just want
stability and they pay a lot of money
for that stability so when you can get a
product into that last part of the
technology adoption lifecycle you can
make a lot of money there's companies
out there like computer associates that
make all their money they just buy old
products and just keep them running and
they just rake in the dough so having
products all along the life cycle is
what every company has to do but very
few actually pull that off so that
innovation part you have to know your
customer you have to know your customer
like better than they know themselves
you have to work with some iterate
rapidly with them you have to not be
afraid to fail failures teach you things
you have to be able to try something if
it fails move try again a different way
we talked like Mike this morning was
talking about scrum and agile and that
kind of stuff that stuff that really is
important it's not that you have to
follow a given
that comes from this book and it's step
3 4 5 you know you want to be agile in
the general sense because if you're
trying to innovate you have to be able
to move and shift as your market has
different demands and you might try
something and it fails you shift a
little bit try something else that may
succeed if you're not agile enough to do
that then you'll definitely not succeed
we can look at these these different
categories of Technology adopters that
we had on the earlier slide the
innovators up to the laggards and when I
was thinking again about those problems
that as a developer I didn't quite
understand why they would occur you know
things like why a poorer technology
could possibly win in the market I also
start thinking about you know like I
mentioned earlier why did developers
aren't you so much over these things and
it finally kind of dawned on me that
usually what those arguments are are
let's say an early adopter is arguing
with someone from the early majority
they just have a different perspective
on the technology they're never going to
agree because they have this different
kind of context for how they're going to
use that technology they have a
different risk-taking level right so you
can get someone arguing for say Erlang
early and that's the best thing ever I
mean for me I used to be fat and ugly
and now I'm just ugly because of early
right if I said that to someone who's
maybe in the laggard category they say
no no no it has to be Java has to be
Java right you have these arguments all
the time I'm sure and this is another
way of looking at why those arguments
might take place but knowing about these
categories you might start asking
yourself certain questions you know what
type is your CEO your company what type
is your manager or their manager are
they laggards are they innovators are
they somewhere in the middle it becomes
important to know that that's your
culture that's the root of the culture
what types are you and your teammates
that becomes very important are you
going to be an innovative team are you
going to be a team that takes care of a
product both are important right the
organization has to have things along
the curve so maybe teams up here in the
innovation area have to be different
than teams in the laggard area and you
have to get the right people together to
make those teams work and what customer
you know your customers what type are
living you have to know that because
you're trying to address them in a given
market place if you got some lagging
technology that you try to push on some
innovation the innovator customers it's
just not going to work give I guess two
important lessons there's lots and lots
of lessons you can take away from all
this and you know 45 minutes or whatever
it is to talk about this stuff is
difficult so I hope you you've learned
something about innovation while giving
the top but there's a couple things I'd
like you to go away with not only should
you read the innovators dilemma but you
should know where the technology that
you work on sits on a curve and you
should know where the people that you
work with including your customers sit
on that curve knowing that stuff you'll
you'll be much better equipped to think
about how features should go into your
product what kind of features you might
be able to better see disruptive
technologies coming along that might
displace your product I think if you
knew these lessons if you use these
lessons you could be a better judge of
any project that you might want to join
any product you might want to work on
any team that you might want to join in
any job opportunity that you're kind of
looking at because you can evaluate the
organization you can evaluate their
products knowing this stuff it's not
just about technology is it cool or not
or is it you know good great technology
versus oh that's inferior technology if
you want to succeed you have to know
this stuff these are some of the books
that
can help you learn about this and you
know if you had to read one the
innovators dilemma is a really good one
this one down here the myths of
innovation is another good one I think
for developers to read because the
author has roots and development but any
book by Geoffrey Moore he has a number
of books crossing the chasm is a really
good one and there's a whole line of
like the top row there is all based on
innovators dilemma innovators solution
and a series of books the innovators DNA
is a relatively recent one i think it's
about a year old and it's about what it
takes to actually be an innovator my
time is up any questions or yes where do
I see react and basher Lana curve well I
talked about that in that no sequel
versus relational part of the socket so
I see that no sequel kind of
technologies in general I think are
doing a bit of disruption in the
relational market primarily because they
give choices that relational models
don't give you we have customers with
react that are doing extremely high
scale types of systems that just
wouldn't work under a relational model
and the availability things that they
need you know the availability
guarantees just wouldn't be very hard to
do with a different technology so I
think react and some of its brethren you
know other no sequel databases are
starting to serve customers that are
either over served or not consuming
relational technology it's alton
anything else
my prediction on the future of oracle
relational is not going away it's you
know it's too important to many
businesses it still has use cases I
think what happens is that I think over
time we just didn't have the choice and
it was relational or nothing we had
berkeley DB that was widely used tool is
widely used but oracle bought that
that's a very similar move to what my
own ax did was OC looking at that lowend
disruptor and just buying it to take it
out but it's still available and
everything so I think they'll continue
to be fine yeah it was another yes
that's a good question so question is
how does sustaining innovation with
respect to the technology adoption
lifecycle curve you know how does that
work because products obviously have
sustaining innovations applied to them
new features are put in old features are
dropped as you move along the curve so
there's a couple ways of looking at that
it's definitely true that sustaining
innovations carry you along that curve
because like to cross the chasm you have
to give the features needed by those
early majority customers to make them
want to adopt your product or technology
so you basically work with customers you
find some customer base some market that
is interested in what you're building
you work with them to build the feature
so sustaining innovations give them the
features they need hopefully across the
chasm more features appeal to the
majority when it comes to dropping old
features that's just typically kind of
customers learning about their own
domain in a way right they figure out
like oh you know I asked for this
feature early on but I don't really need
it or you might notice you know we put
this feature in early on that we thought
would apply to these people and it does
so we're going to drop it or maybe some
other smaller technology comes along not
a disruptive technology but some better
way of doing that feature comes along so
you might use that instead but those are
still sustaining innovations and as you
move along that curve you can think that
curve is applying to a given market but
you could take that same product and
bring it to another curve it's the same
curve but it's in another market and it
then becomes potentially disruptive in
that market in this market it might be
the leader but over here it could be
some new technology and on a different
place of the curve thank
