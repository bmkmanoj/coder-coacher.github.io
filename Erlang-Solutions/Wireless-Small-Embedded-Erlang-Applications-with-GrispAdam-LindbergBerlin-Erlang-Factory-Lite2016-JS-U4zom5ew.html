system that we've developed for building
invented applications so first a bit of
a back problem in the stereo why we go
into this in the first place so we have
a product called hybrid work which is
for clashing of the ecu's so basically
hardware components for our cars being
special Hardware protocols and stuff and
so this system can be used for washing
equipment for manufacturing or flashing
big stock different work for example in
a production line or something like this
so this system is built on a in
Australian 3 pc motherboard which runs
freebsd android and then have these
gateways which properties years and they
have a date with all proper purples
these Runaways google artists and then
we talk to them
USB so basically the Gateway to hardware
these other protocols and then it goes
through you speeds with our own side of
this previously and there's a lot of
those gateways because also once
actually faced over 200 and all these
many of the central managing our table
in this previous so while this club part
is the earlier and the right part is in
C we can look at this operating system
of reusing and see maybe it's a good fit
for our might as well because tomorrow I
don't have the better it's easier to
work with it's more high-level language
and we don't have to drill down so what
is our tix so it's a hardware time
operating system and we reduce operating
system here in quotes because it's
actually a executed that you built into
your application so let's say our
program let's take c program for state
your shilling in our tongues as the
library's a compile everything into one
executable and you can put this
executable when you move
into it from harbor so it's a very
minimal equation system it supports like
really really know us compartments my
first inning with strong 12 megahertz
folks so it's very tiny but it doesn't
really fit her life so it's also
important for us these characteristics
but it's very efficient in switching
friends so it's possible that switching
which is used for like an implement
hosseini i watch past it's really easy
for early to witness bowl it has some
other men navy Isis model which were
useful for hours but for us at 46 is
interesting and this kind of concept in
general this is actually nowadays often
also called human kernels so it's
basically move directly into your
software is it whole operating system
and use provide the minimal amount of
compatibility so as I said before there
is ecfs context switching but this
system doesn't have any processes so
process and a trail
you know the difference a process is a
managed memory activity running in an
operating system and a thread is a
concurrent separate activity inside a
process which shares the memory with the
process so if you start up in a normal
basis and if you start up two processes
they can only talk to each other while
pipes are so we didn't reach their
memory but the thread inside a process
for a bunch of friends dating share
memory so our times only supports my
process because this is one exit that
one executable that stars on program but
it does support threads which means
there's like no virtual memory there's
the river protection everything happens
inside this one memory space but this is
useful because its goal is just one one
program director hardware in our case
government circles the drone zone
basically all 32 bit architectures can
be 11 to 16 bitten and also permit stuff
and it has SME support as well as though
and this hard work we're currently
building a greater 14 but there are
force mobile processors that support
more course Omega systems so so as I
said in this hydrophobic
running on the gateways but it's a good
fit for a minute and maybe we can then
combine our line with our thumbs to give
you an executable that boot so hungry
hardware but actually once our line
directly on unfair method which would be
really so we've been working with this
and the idea is basically that have your
current code running inside the early
and justice in any other it mean when
any other machine or operating system
and the early one time runs your honor
code and we have these drivers and then
talk POSIX to the operating system and
this in this case would be implemented
by Artemis these POSIX calls you can
stay Casey application next to this if
you want if you manage to link
everything into this one executable so
if all this compiles can you test it
works it's the other secret in there as
well and we also support basically it
also supports this is a negative drivers
so normally when you use these indents
in the neck so with those were operating
system those are separate files that you
know internally and that's because these
operating system you support dynamic
linking in your library's runtime and
operating system manages this proof but
in our case we are only allowed to do
static linking since it's just one big
executable so the difference here is
that if you want
poor drivers they have to be linked into
the application itself at compile time
instead of our terms also allows you to
personal network so implements a really
small tcp/ip stack but you have some
choices in our terms so you can actually
use up to be us three different sites
and one of them is different or freebies
the tcp/ip stack as well to get some
nice bigger choices there and this this
listen link and driver is sterilized
because you actually get very low low
access to your partner because this if
your icy cold or whatever the talks
directly to the hardware is nothing in
between like you're literally alone with
the early medium and the C code inside
the video obtained if or something and
talk directly to the hardware and you
know when they're like being will be
preempted because there's no other
processes running on this operating
system there if there is an interrupt
coming from harder you know when we'll
begin Carolyn in this context directly
so it's easier to do soft or even maybe
some hard with I'm stuff for this so
we've been using this intercept up
nicole wash rexroth which is a
subscriber wash and their project where
the art transport controllers and smart
conveyor belts so these boxes here with
cables they are actually are are
reported runs early with Artemis
directly on the partner so here's a demo
video basically showing so we have a
demo system built up and everything that
moved in here is controlled by a network
oregon's it's about 15 boxes you can see
them like there is blue cables going
with here there and then there's garlic
box connected to this since the devil
conveyor belt some sensor detection four
digits and moving parts because some are
tiny schmick's for example to ski work
Poland's you go massage and all this is
controlled so the idea here is we've
done this we know how it works we've
proven the phone
we like working with Ireland for
embedded systems so our goal is to give
this back to the community so all this
limited experience of course is matter
when the source also stuff put it in
tolerance a gay person is to put this
but it's a very steep learning curve
working with embedded systems in the
first place and also working with Aurra
innovative systems and possible client
interfering elbow this driver stuff so
we want to do something work and also we
can support a lot of different platforms
for example the universe restaurant eyes
eaglebones big awards or the stuff or
are we no horse community so supporting
the bigger ones like respiratory people
must make so much sense because they're
actually very powerful by Feliz new
ground in them samurai and you don't we
need to get the bike low level access to
the harbor or
performance cows and Arduino another
smaller things they are way too tiny so
we noted are like in there anyway so our
kind of enables to find the sweet spot
in between where have a sufficiently
large event system that fits early but
also has lots of great connectors for
working with and that assistance i'm
doing like Internet of Things robotics
and such so we want to design partner
platform together with the tools drivers
software that you need to get started
developing applications is so our goal
is to create this platform where you can
do a better development with darling in
anything so this is the board that we've
developed it's more the word this one
here this size so the current iteration
current development size and it has a
papal arm CPU cortex and seven it's kind
of largest mobile our logo arm that can
get nowadays 32 bit cpu with some nice
stuff on top quite a few when
floating-point you
Laura things I'll go with the bit more
details later maybe you notice that like
there's no easier than this so we
thought okay let's put something nicer
like a white guy because in the end when
you will like in other things or maybe
snow robotics fire drill or something
it's kind of nice I wireless and it's
way more hassle to get Wi-Fi on top of
existing Harper that doesn't have Wi-Fi
that that way around so we do support of
course money in an ethernet adapter but
the white rice there from the get-go so
you can start building wireless
applications and yes a SD card slot and
this is first we remove your system from
clubbing application the membrane war is
only 300 kW so we also protest around on
top 64 megabytes because it's abuse
process and this is plenty of space for
every application these boxes are shown
you earlier with the conveyor belt they
also have the same on the wrong man
there we never even really like in close
to the middle also there's Patek space
maybe
anything pilot this of course it depends
on what you use it for what kind of
application you build but 64 megabytes
is is a note for Parliament anyway
there's a USB power connector so you can
charge it while your laptop or an
external battery pack something like
this and this also has a game kinda
bugger by a serial console and it has 0
also as well for the whole board and
there is also a specialized of jtag
debugger connector the lower left there
just about the circle here if you want
to do hardware so user interface wise
through skype switches uses so I can put
the phone off address is recorded Jane
thanks all the six on there and for you
sir output we support units I resolution
display 21 pieces sorry to be RGB LEDs
signal control them he was seeing a
possible relation recipient is your
stuff for different status thank you so
next we have one of our connectors so on
the top here we have a team one
connectors and it's a standard by digit
and plus regulate components you can buy
and do stick them into these small
submitting an interface with indirectly
and I'll show support examples
positional point so these ports we have
two GPIO port here in the top we have
one new art port here and then we have
to SB high horse so one normal Skyport
suspense and a five gpio general-purpose
aisle but its serial nations you can
change things up and have to be more
things to this and we have a extended
SBIR porch which has by
double set of connectors with interrupts
as well so you can have a device that
sense you interrupt and then you can go
and fetch more devices we also does one
wire effector on this which is kind of
also is another serial pro quo I will
explain later wearing also who have more
orange types of sensors so it had a
school board there is a recent problem
here my regional stuff so this is it and
the cpu as i said before it's a 32-bit
ARM Cortex and seven and it does support
these mean extensions but you need a
drivers will go for this we're looking
into making friends but
or something so it uses from her trainer
megahertz I say be able built-in yeah
and the goal is that most of these
things should be easy access for I mean
this is true for the whole project that
you want to give people the tools in
urban to avoid having to drop in to see
on the students really really fancy
memory so there is flash memory to
kilobytes or tomato is this is used for
the bootloader which coincidentally is
also filled with artists and so this is
here static on leadership and then as my
strong seven for fear it is first and
then we put this st round shape 64
megabytes we have the micro SD slots for
system and then mostly chrome for
storing persistence of like some
configuration or something you want to
stay on what r during ebooks or power
outages
so the thing I awesome is right back
connectors on the top so it's a
composting 20 lines actually the driver
support for this is all speculation so
this is basically it's a one
configurable wave function that are
great and that will basically switch
them on and off it's on specified
interval so one example of using this is
for example driving or controlling some
leads so if you own if you have an RGB
that you want to you can normally show
like seven floors or turn it off but
with this one with what's prenylation
then told RGB channels with a
dynamically get the whole core spectrum
easy as this is very useful products
circles under local code system we have
the switches on the board of the
Penguins sits almost any can read and
we're register from the board and you
have the recent burglary case everything
goes bad precious so all the switch is
the stuff that everything else who gets
we're a noise to make it simple then we
have the SPI and nice Percy interfaces
so its serial interface to save some
islands iOS so the semi only has a
limited number of things and if you want
to go anymore things to this you need
something like zero interface to change
things send Nina's wires spi usually us
for buyers and it's a master slave from
the pool with mustard robbinsdale input
and most people's makeup defines two
ways and there is also a plot line that
determines when data goes in and out so
ships have specifications of when they
are reading and writing and then you
have to basically sink to that talk and
figure out when you should read or write
from all of these components and there
is also a shape select line that you can
use to change even more ships on the
same line and then use this to drive
bishops it's to read and write on
sailing then resize kursi and this is a
bus protocol and it has two lines so its
data and the top line and then also
power round of course you always have
our ground and this is also a
master-slave protocol even think about
this one instead as address
clients so you can send eight the
packets to one of the clients or one of
the slaves on this time and they move
able to pick it out from the wire
basically and all this is usually for
more local stuff like stuff that's close
to the paw report because reliability
over longer distances is not so good if
you have disturbed the structure will
align or always to the violence topics
and that's where the does one wire comes
in so it's cool because it only needs
one wire and wrong is wrong that's West
Oakland where as a power and date that
goes over the same wire basically and so
we knew said they'd our power or or even
actually take power from the data and
then you have usually a capacitor on the
device that stores power like if the
data rate is low again then each power
button area is high and then to do
there's no it's available implementation
and it's similar twice per seat but it's
much longer distance another range
because it has like built-in checksums
and some other things for for dating you
have a 64-bit tiny for every component
and it's a worldwide unique I need kind
of like uuid or mac address or something
like this so as you have a component
that you know the the 64-bit way you can
address stuff is wire which means it
have one of these for civics are not a
couple of temperature sensors in a room
or in a house or something like this you
know you can identify which one is which
what time is there is also a seductive
device discovery you can see which
devices are on the line and you can
match them to your specifications or
figure out which one is which ID sinful
factors for the way for the Delaware
stuff it's usually this one that's kinda
like the old style plastic transistor
size and frequency and this is most of
the stuff is where temperature sensors
or other climate sensors then there is
an ipod advice which is the one where is
kind of inside
global and you can use it for access
control and stuff like this Sookie folks
there are devices that have like memory
and some simple graphic primitives on
chip in the device and restore my stuff
cryptographically secure so it's used
for authentication and security systems
but most of it is usually
climate-related some temperature simple
measurement sensors here are some
examples for peanuts so this can go
through a couple thing the first one is
a magnetic comment combustible so you
can choose direction the board or
wherever you have this component then we
have a to impaired motor driver for
powering motors and together with this
one a 44 standard or so if RC servo
connector so it's super light pulse
width modulation for
like angles or power a different
alignment stuff so if you're building
control this will be useful for making
buildings and stuff then this one is a
genius departure it's kind of a full
security yes I don't know all the
features but it's very nice and comes
with lots of eps rating stuff and you
have a 3-axis accelerometer and a three
axis gyro so using these two presenting
two drones devastation or movement
detection or anything else direct
physical orientation and these are just
examples so
so as I said before there's like 80 plus
different quantity available components
and it's an easy way if use this is a
way to get started working with sensors
and chase r you can stuff because it's
even need to either if you only want me
to build anything everything is just one
of a kind of and it's good as them to
doing more complex hardware designs that
you made late able to print tomorrow but
in this case you just payroll so it's
easy to provide reverse pretties 11 you
have with their standards and that in
here is that we provide new level c
drivers and then my little drivers for
the various peoples in her life so we
implement standard interfaces in c and
those you can also use in have your own
vectors just want to use my people
that's that's not supported out of the
box and then we will Tyler the driver's
permit for as well so those are all
sixes so I'm going to travel here
basically showing affordable so we don't
have our line running on this get the
conspirators those heineken Tartars for
this for this Harbor so this demo is
coming
rooting artemis on it so this first boot
here just blinks reset as you can see I
boots and then it tries to figure out
something to do then it's flaming red
because i don't have an SD card prove it
so i'm using a sample application that
produces the lens so this one will RGB
cycle the net that's all it does it but
it's very fast you see it starts
blinking LEDs almost immediately after
the reset button is pressed then we have
one which uses the SD card a bit more so
this is another sample application it
also used lights up the LED blink it or
anything this time but this one is
useful to demo the serial connection
we know if the slice
this is a good size for sure to make it
larger so you can talk to this serial
devices and you can just green to do
this and in this case and also setting
of all right to get the right input
always go see garbage and this will drop
into
so this is the boot process and this
isn't like that were looted and fully
running and that's about like a second
time and with our language currently
about 34 seconds we can also customize
this so we haven't spent so much time
variant this drops into a very simple
shell the markets implements kind of
tiny has some different built-in
commands that looks like an image here
but it's really and this this is this
particular bill this image that we would
now has SD card support so you can see
this media folder here in the new
partition if I would show you the other
one demo with our doing that you would
just see them an atc because it doesn't
have any SD card driver it's the boots
from the SD card because the bootloader
who supports building it but the
application itself which contains the
shell cannot do it because there's no
driver this image here has this driver
on which means we can do at the SD card
so it's this one amnesty and there's no
Auto completion or anything
because they're super simple show that
you get with markings so yeah there's a
Mack truck on there and then there is
the / which is actually built partly
image so the early theme was also be
this bin file basically and then when
you put our logo to this you would put
it next here on the domestic are so you
put the relic release with all the pin
code and everything you need to load any
other false you need and this will be
the early medium this bin file which
will boot up rowing and then find your
own recent startup and danny is also
that when you run around or basically
when we when you have our menu they're
like we know how to get with Artemis we
don't provide this shell here but we
will provide the earlier shows actually
we put directly into an erection and our
life as my LS and stuff the memory has
more features to just make it more
functional because this shell won't
exist once already compiled get items so
so to make this even more if it started
as a formal to provide basically
including the bottle of this is well not
use open source important stuff for the
best so we want to have river plugins
for creating new risk products folks for
building our lines Ithaca Lincoln if
support drivers so if useful to build
with your application or let's say
you're happy with the drivers that comes
out of the box that we provide you're
basically good to go back and do a bar
being creative project are not coded
there while the release and then push it
to the SD card together with the build
or the environment of employed but if
you want to have ifs or poor drivers
myself for Solomon we link them into the
ER nvm executable self because there is
no dynamic loading of libraries here and
then we have to basically build support
for this as well cooling side so we aim
to have a or actually pulling
down the road to peace force code
putting in earlier if drivers thinking
everything and then building a whole new
binary executable that again then push
has been fun interesting hard to get a
bit around so this is the way you get
own C code into this project and you can
do this pretty smooth arise so if it
finds a little preteen because it's
pretty easy to actually static a
magnificence of
in them and we want these things to be
as easy as possible when we develop
hardware or whether you guys want to
develop on this board because there
should be able my deep or secret stuff
get to know more things you have to try
out this you just work out of the rules
and because we build this ourselves that
we support is hardware it's hopefully
easier than having to maintain like a
project like this for many different
platforms by the raspberry pi or making
orders of certain Taylor a bit course
sorry i missed fusion of course the goal
is to cluster these things as well so we
have Wi-Fi and we want to make our
industry or the regular to build or
Wi-Fi of course it's just a network so
there are some ongoing projects together
there's one of them is to increase the
number of nodes that you realistically
have a distribution right now or Vegas
kind of us our network mesh network so
ever know you had will exponentially add
load to the system or network load to
the system and we also make it want to
make it easier to have different types
of our distribution connections like
encrypted connections so if you're
running this on your own Wi-Fi it's of
course a pretty safe or as safe as you
make it but if you want to run it in
public Wi-Fi or how the device which you
connect to the Wi-Fi network that exists
it would be nice to have some encryption
so let's say about three of these boards
put the minute
when you connect them to this whole to
Wi-Fi it would be nice if those big
words could talk encrypted with each
other so people can sniff into those
connections there is also a infinite
people from the internet as well as
Wi-Fi and one woman we have posted bbmd
the relative work man 13 didn't run more
marcos so there are 14 is program
trellis next to your man Commissioner
you can actually see it if you start up
another partial machine that will always
be the backgrounds of EPMD running and
this takes care of things like if you
connect to a ghost with our life
disputed early and there is two virtual
machines running with different openings
on this ghost being in these the one
that takes care of finding the right
while you give it the host name of the
course of minus and this is the C
program so it doesn't run next to their
language lon con artists around the
support because of one process so we had
a product early we wrote this
you're early instead and this code
accepted by both teams is under the
frictional normal umbrella and this is
needed because we want product we want
to have EPMD running on these nodes so
we have to add vesa re-application
inside our enemy units at the outside
and it's also needed to go sweetie we
want to switch distribution semantics
later having different types of channels
we won't be able to Google inside the
zucchinis it's easier and this has the
capability of adding a corporal Smith so
this is commit so we want to make easy
to deploy these things applications we
are using the beam virtual machine the
revolution so actually anything language
to be used for developing embedded
applications will not support every
language out of the box with to link
because it's limited by our effort of
time but we of course happy to take
contributions maybe there will be
rappers and other languages are
interfacing with the enemy device that
will develop and so on and so nice
tooling for Alexei or mix just get in
touch if your workman's of an address
yeah in this use the presentation and we
have a maybe naciste where we will
announce when the warts are basically
ready so the goal is that they should be
kind of accessible in locals on the
current crisis already rose but the more
free workers behalf of bursting over the
price will be and we are also willing to
give up words if you are a student or a
teacher an institution project so if you
send the product descriptions off to
last week and then send your cup of
freeboard consider is a raffle that we
have running go to the risk web page and
if you sign up before saturday or a
little saturday ballistics you can take
part in one of ten words who give out
for free please do this and that's it
any questions
below it's really fast and how many he
wants can even make the one ball so it's
fine i think five nectars out of the box
this different ones but CPC is also
support SBI ni square c you can change
even more of them our chain even more of
them coming tables but i don't know if
there's any upper limit to this in the
protocols themselves i don't know the
details there but technically I mean if
there is say outer limit in the address
space or in the wiring it out before the
source breaks down that's on Plymouth
and that also does power to run all
those things but it's definitely more
than the ones that are here because you
can't achieve and then there is the ice
per se as well as already one that was
on where is called I like this kind of
stuff I understand that for industrial
musicians musicians you have
requirements do you plan to use this for
your master project sorry this something
that is really early stage so I wouldn't
say like in developed is completely to
replace all of our industrial stuff
because they also have other
requirements as well but it could either
be useful as a prototyping board or
maybe if you stick this in an enclosure
may provide input output bits can also
be used for this so like power wise as
your voice is totally powerful enough to
do things like this Isaac's goes like we
want to make it easy generic for people
to use to build embedded systems
wireless hardware stuff think of the
things and of course then it will be
useful for us as well maybe it's only is
Renee the present but the case is still
good right so you might have to drop
down into special operations otherwise
that's so if you said like you want to
devote something between a ver doing
the study should be whether the growth
requires this case but it's more
expensive do plan to make it less
expensive or what adventures I can save
implanted but obviously the more people
quiet the secret movie on the one hand
and on the other hand we are like so it
rest we have a contractor to build
sackful hardware and they have their
limits and i'll pay price things so
we're trying to get it as cheap as
possible to go list it should be
obviously ideally free whether that will
never happen but guess he was possible
right so it's will not do anything it's
not that we're not earning money of this
we respond to sell it that sell costs
and then provide the deploys are also
people can build things that's the goal
and whatever like the target price would
hit the end or if we may be launched now
with couple of boards like a thousand or
something like or they get cheaper i
agree no but the goal is to make the
streets yes i understand but why do
people who wanted to choose this board
do not reply to this and so it's the i
would say like the main or even this TV
connectors
like the little harbor access to
different connectors and you can let me
play these P modes and stuff like this
and it's a bit more work to do that on a
Raspberry Pi are being born and also we
have if you don't do anything especially
also linux we have to find drivers here
able to provide everything else is
already within so that's these ease of
use any other purposes yes two
dimensions distribution
yes so I mean this is Wi-Fi or internet
if you plug it in and of course you get
the network access so like early
distribution zone one type of network
traffic right this can access internet
on this Wi-Fi lecture on providing of
cabling of course go where everyone
commenting it or you can use I can web
interface of this cover port of Aden
access from anywhere you mentioned
drones a couple of times yes you have
you already play around with dr scopes
and stuff listen if you have enough
speed and Lolita C to maybe even really
flight stabilization so we having
builded roll with it we have a couple of
the P months or are lots of time to test
with such but haven't we intercepted we
use case scenarios the only thing i
guess a right now is I don't see
anything obviously in the way for that
so basic until eleven water access
there's no rating system in between or
other processes so it should be very
predictable and three hundred mega
nurses yeah enough speed for most
hydrogen I don't know how how much early
was never the restaurant perhaps did a
demo running very many
and crushing something and thrown with
state so I don't know how much earlier
was running later on but then if you
search for employer loves drawing didn't
do something having in parallel so much
smaller about my relation like the
avatar an overhang something learning is
software have already
more like hard with also system occurs
yes have you found facing the nerves
project at all not at the moment I
haven't looked that it's so much
actually a little harder they're
targeting how are doing that stuff so
maybe there is some kind of
cross-pollination there that will be
introduced either like they provide any
eyes that they can use or we think I
said they have support over to see
at the station not a planet anymore
questions and
the mission complete portraits in Adams
so I'm wrong but have stood propel the
way that you use the quadratic through
the decoupled be seek out of the driver
a crash yes wouldn't them can that would
of course break in this case she's able
to use it if you have existing drivers
there's differences between myths and
for traversing regards to different
behaviors so maybe one or the other
personal reasons or your existing seen
home is easier to build a support rather
than we paddle board off but of course
you lose this be complete that you have
a little operating system because it
will have several nurses may be
something that starts an external threat
inside this memory space and then maybe
CC a new one
other visits
I not I don't know actually uh I don't
think so often books I'm not sure
exactly how the population is working
here with our everyone I think in theory
if our land supports kind of our online
we could support it as well but if
nothing else then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
