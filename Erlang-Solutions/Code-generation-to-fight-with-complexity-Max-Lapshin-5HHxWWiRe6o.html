is our international so I already eat in
English so hello my name is Max Levchin
I'm author of early video video
streaming server but there will be
nothing today about video I will speak
about father topic it is a stock
exchange trading and I will speak about
my experience in use in infrastructure
connection to stock exchanges so it is
about Alba trading there is a protocol
well known well known about it will now
and among albert raiders to connect the
stock exchanges it is called fix or a
fast or so currently we're speaking
about fix protocol it is it is interest
just standard are widely adopted but or
in it is very complicated and I was
picked up today about what problems I
have met in implementing this protocol
so it is it is about how to connect from
the application to a stock exchange it
is a it is semi binary protocol by
saying same in binary I mean that it is
possible to read it in a TCP dump but it
has some binary binary non readable
symbols and when I have when I have to
implement a stock exchange a robot I
have found that there was no air link
implementational that was open source it
and in fact there was only only one
implementation that it was possible to
buy but guys haven't replied so I had to
implement fixed or protocol connector by
myself and what is what is this fixed
how does it look like it is AK value
least well and are integer with
interview with integers so all keys are
in our numbers and they are asking coded
was so as possible to read them but to
read them in in plain text down but
there but they did but they are they
divided just buy buy buy it with with a
decimal one so so it is possible to read
but it is what it is about it but it is
very complicated to parse it so this fix
is a has through has all three levels it
is transport so you need to connect by
tcp and it is it is described by fix you
cannot transfer fix by HTTP or some
other protocols at it describes packet
packet level so fix the sig figs tells
you when when packet or will affect
achatz charts and when whenever you
finished and it describes business level
so the specification for fix protocol
describes all possible business level
messages that you can send by this
protocol how are in it is very big big
big specification more than more than
100 of different messages that you can
send by this fix protocol and we have
died had a very very big big demand for
for speed I need to spend not more than
10 microseconds for parsing because 10
min 10 microseconds is already a big big
number of time that for parsing this
protocol or 11 message and so on so when
we went when week when we receive fixed
message we translate it to probe least
but it is a problem because it is a prob
least I very on it is very it is not
convenient to use prob lists in your
code you can't use probably drop list in
in in function clause in case so you
even always to work with prop list yet
really it's very inconvenient so code is
we work with the records in code and we
need to translate these protists to
records and make it fast fast and
convenient
and speaking about figs are there is an
XML a description there is not only
specification there is a big big XML
file as you can download from from from
internet and these fix this XML
describes our goal syntax and semantics
levels I will describe I will explain
later what it means so what is the
problem problem is that a fix is a very
big is a protocol with a very big
specification and no one needs the whole
specification and no broker implements
the whole fixed specification never and
we need only small subset of this
specification and so we want we want
some how to make a parcel that takes
this binary fix protocol and translate
it to two records that are convenient to
us and you can you can know that we can
understand that there is some some
impedance there is a difference between
fixed business logic and our business
logic so we want so we want to find the
easiest way to to make to make parcel
provide make bar subpoena to make such
parser that you can raise that generates
output convenient to us so what are the
ways to go to talk to go the first way
is enterprise or Java guys like this so
what it means it means that there is no
problem you just take this XML you just
you create objects with with hundreds of
fields with a big amount of methods and
then you create some abstract singleton
factories that let's create your objects
out of fixed objects and you create a
large logic of the basic gluco to
translate a fixed business level to your
business to your business level and it
is impossible to use an everyone because
of because it's very inconvenient and
because of large size of fragrance I
mean that if you if you create records
from fix messages or in a very damp way
you will get you will get records with
more than 100 fields if you try to
modify this record you will get a
very big amount of copy rubbing data and
code that will work with records with
100 fields is a bad code so it was not
my way head Hawk wave is is what many
people was both men many people use they
just write a simple part of fix to that
subset of fix that their broker provides
so they just say oh my broker give me
three with three types of fixed messages
I will not I will not think about other
other fix protocol I will just implement
these through these these three messages
and it's okay so what is the problem in
this way when broker had raw burger adds
new and noon fix messages you have to
write more and more at hawk code and
it's it is in fact i'm too lazy to
repeat this code again and again because
because there is some with some some
kind of code that is similar to
different types at types of messages but
well but when it but we need to
understand that many peers are have box
for example many bloggers have their own
software that implements fix in their
own way of course with bugs and problems
and we need to do some how to work
around these books but in fact I don't
like this way because I am too lazy to
cook the based code so what was the
right way I that I've chose I wanted to
to all our automate these parts
regeneration from these big symbol and
make this code reusable for other people
and in fact there are there are some
people that are interested that are
already interested interested in my fix
implementation and I hope their number
will increase so I wanted to design
system that can fit in different
businesses this so this fixed parser
that provides a very complicated
messages must must must be must provide
such messages in such records such data
types that are convenient for directly
using business coach and I don't want to
write it by hands at once that I wanted
to make it make it very simple and how
to generate a of the parser so I so I
chose the way by making configurable
code generation what it means I take
Excel
downloaded from in the internet on a fix
protocol or and then I reduce amount of
messages and their size according to my
config file for example my broker
provide me give me about five different
fixed messages with the width with with
with several several names not number of
fields it is much it is many times mmm
small small amount of things they just
described in protocol it is in full
specification but I don't need it so I
so I right config we're aware as say
what what exactly a number of meadow
what exactly feels I need not messages
high and eat then I generate errors
headers and parcels so what what does it
mean when I generate headers it means
that i that i right only those only
those of records that i need messages
and fill them only with those fields
that i need but a rocker can all can
always send those fix fix fields that
are that are not described by me that I
don't that I don't over there with it I
wasn't waiting for so I always add to
any record some some field where I just
put our and use it and use it unknown
unknown case and what what do I get what
do I get by this generation I can I know
the types are the types of records or
these records and one of all fields at
the great time so i can i can check them
a four day later i can say that this
field is in integer and this field is a
the sound summer or shrink or something
else
and it is no one at any rate time before
compile time for example there is a new
order single message in fix protocol
which which can be sent to broker to
make an allure driver or the request but
by default in Fix button in fig
specification there are more than 60
different fields it is very complicated
because they wanted to describe all
there were all the opposite of all
possible business logic that can be in
between client and broker but I eat only
six fields not not not more because my
broker can't implemented haven't
implemented every everything so where I
translated to a very simple and useful
useful structure record it usable in
arilinn and also I change I change
underscores to our unconvinced fixed
fixed naming to underscore that it is
possible to use an airline
now what about the Parsons they also are
generated and there are two or two kinds
of parcels that I need in fix protocol
one is syntax parser by my syntax
partial I mean that I needs to translate
this this binary protocol with with
integer K with integer names of kids of
keys to a long types and back
and also we don't we don't we we must
not forget about syntax sugar for
example there is a key named a site so
do i wants to buy stock where i want to
sell stock and i need to send a 0 or 1
it is very inconvenient it's impossible
to remember what does it mean 1 1 of 0
so we need to translate such fields to
two atoms buy and sell and this syntax
parser doesn't depend on on thick
because we must we must parse any
possible fix a field that will come to
us from broker because rocker can change
the ethics implementation in any time
and we must not much much rely on any
subset we must parse everything that
will come to us and it's the diplomat
not a problem and this is exactly those
part that can be excited too that can be
made in C in fact there is some part or
written in C ladies how to auto
generated it is very convenient and it
is very fast because I'm sorry but
parsing this thing in airlock especially
beanery split is very very slow it's
about ten times slower than making pars
friend see
and this syntax parcel give us give us
prop least we can do this with this
probly stev thing we want and it's
important that it is prop list because
it is a ordered k value a value list and
then we we meet semantic parser semantic
parser is the most interesting thing
because we must somehow translate this
prop list to our business business to
records that i use it in our business
logic and it must throw away some
unusual information for example every
fixed message track it keeps it a
checksum we don't need it in our
business business code throw it away
because it's useful that it is useless
data and here we must handle a group of
fields group of phil's is a very cryptic
and and very bad part of fix protocol
because you need because fixed message
is just a plain he ever released that
must be created into a very complicated
object that can handle such sub-objects
lists of sub-objects so this group of
fields are very very complicated to bars
and and it is especially complicated
because of brokers bugs I haven't yet
met Roger spots but some people I'm
meeting them it's very it's a problem
and this semantic parcel is generated by
also by config I right into my config
file only those only those data and only
those messages i wanted to i want to
parse and it reduces the number of the
amount of code and make it work faster
but yet i had god I had to write some ad
hoc code written by my hands for my case
to keep the flexibility because brokers
sometimes sends some some data in other
way that are not by protocol not by
specification
so how how does this semantic bar sir
looks like each better Minds type of
message by first by first key value key
key key key value pair there is region
message type and then it it takes their
8th grades are the proper record and you
must understand that by saying it
creates proper records I mean that there
is a region in generated Errol pile so I
can rage real Errol file.txt it is txt
file it is not abstract form it is just
txt file legit that is committed into
each each repository and I can check it
by like I can I can view it each Cree
and other is related there is written
that we create a new single order
structure and then then I hit them this
part of a process the less the rest of
crop lists and this processor also is
out to auto generated by our examined
about our config according to our config
because if we if you need known record
field for example I say that I need to
feel I need field named limit amount in
my single orders structure so the reason
there is a record healed named amount
and when we when when we need when we
want when we meet key from fix them and
our name at amount so we put it into the
proper proper place in this records and
all these all these are all these set
elements our calls are generated into
their old file so in fact the most
import the most important most important
generated function is filled index that
that tells us on which place of Records
can we find the required required field
this is a very complicated code that
could be much much simpler if there were
frames in ere long so when when when OTP
team will implement their frames it is
embedded hash hash tables in inner
lunker as a dedicated type
I will I will throw away everything this
and it will it to be very very simpler
but now we can we need to make such
completely what complicated thing and so
what what what can i watch what do I
forget what have I got from this from
this world I can provide a simple and
usable code and it is very important
that I can you buy the chicken the
chicken which is auto-generated aryl
file which is named fix-it parser
Harrell and understand watches edition
which which is written there good or bad
I can profile it I can run some
benchmarks I can see a syntax errors in
it and it is much better than to use use
our generation with abstract syntax tree
all fixed data types I used in my
business logic directly I just include
this is auto-generated header in all of
my Enola oh my business logic and use
these fields directly it is very
convenient because if I need to add some
some additional field which is not used
in figs I just added to config and I can
use this field for example there is no
filter named our ad in order but i can
edit i can add adjust for me and it will
not it will not be just filled from from
broker results and the main idea of my
my topic was a tomb was that it is very
competitive very cruel to make a such
complicated thing rated parcel but it
must be configurable because if you just
if you just translate their that beep
specification to do some code you will
receive a very very inconvenient big
structures which are which which does
not which cannot be used directly in the
business code and you will need to make
a glue code that translate those
protocol data types to your to your data
types and I have made it have made a
code so that i can use them directly and
if it really works
okay so this is this is all now what do
you think about adopted word for fix ml
or it will be another puzzle um I
haven't looked at it so I can see you
anything about it there are many
protocol them are there are many other
protocols that broker can can can give
you for example our hours talk at the
RTS give you some plaza to connector or
some or fast connector so I can't say
about them but i think that i will which
I will deal somehow way I will need to
meet fix fix Amell this for how do you
think about anything to the sugar that
can sue transform do matching our
records and prop list well you are
speaking about Errol Sonja's for example
okay so question is that there are some
ways to simplify handling prop list in
your business in your code because
currently you can't make a bunch of put
a prop least get value into the function
close now I haven't thought about it and
I I don't think that I want to use it I
really hope that OTP team will bring
frames and will make all this all this
horror unusual not not not required do
you think it's really I think yes
because they have created codon that now
they only they are only discussing a
syntax so one here or one year and a
half and I think that it will be that
they will find some good way to to
introduce frames into air link
but the tied it at
you can make if it cuts a recorder this
district English update it with ok so it
may be non-destructive updates just
copying it's ok for me but the problem
is that you can't use prob least in
keene function clothes in function
clothes and this is why we have to use
records records have their limitations
records are not what updated records are
it is very it is very complicated it is
very big it's very bad to use big
records and so we need to reduce them I
have shown how how have I ever reduced
the size of records that I have to deal
with and and I can use this records in
pattern and pattern matching and it's ok
but yes we can't use probably seen
pattern matching if we if we can if we
could I wouldn't write this everything
this so I but I had to write it and so I
I Connolly I don't use any and assist in
any a sixteenth of sugar butter but so I
don't use it
I don't rely on it max are cut the flesh
typically record of night that we gots a
new shipment
okay question question was okay how can
i let's get your mind a record field
type on the compilation in fact I just
remind them if or compilation I didn't
mind them on generation there is a big
XML description oh and there is a there
is a field data type there is int or or
dictionary or string and I can use this
information to make hints in our my auto
generated or a header of my head apart
geocode open source it is partial open
sourced because I won't open source the
previous version currently problem is
that it is a widely de ville it is
developed developed and it is embedded
into my into my mainstream code so it's
very it's rather complicated to to to to
to make me to split commits so sometimes
I update the public it is each other on
my github it helps / mark levin there is
a fix implementation but it is a bit
outdated and sometimes I I just updated
with the new commits and it's possible
to use it
max mara wants it simple question why
you use prob least of all I don't back
right if you write simple message it's
better maybe it's faster why I don't use
why I don't use my by using a prop list
at all by using this some kind of
representation some kind of human
readable presentation if I don't park
into the it field so something on ice
maybe it's fast Idaho just just as you
know there is a problem that a fixed
message is not a plane is not is not a
plane k value ish it is a hash is a play
is the K value a representation of a big
and complicated object for example if we
receive a market data structure there
are two different fields a bid ask her
and they are filled with with different
objects sighs datos is sized amount size
amount and so it is impossible to use to
it will be impossible to to make to use
this as a as any binary representation
access career 1,000 years of exotic
temperatures currently I used in Rachel
I used my generator only 464 dot 4 which
is used by my broker but again it is not
it is not hard coded we can use the same
the same extent made of the same
structure for different for a different
other version versions of fix for
example if you go if your broker uses a
42 so you can just take another examine
you ready to other fields I know that
they incompatible especially fix five
but I think it will not not a problem
I with the cross
this is this is what what what my speech
was about your needs to our to generate
different parcels for different
different ways of use
yes different different configs so if
you if you if you need this code and
your broker gives you only fix for dot 2
so change config and out again rate this
code what we're good old children apiece
unless you the first name is all nestled
between static int experience ascribe
hype yes I have checked five it is
really slow also slowed because slowness
is not in hype slow Anna sees in
Vietnamese is in binary split if we just
take a binary split and then we repeat
this code in C there are about four or
eight times difference in speed just
play it just split regency that produces
you some sub binaries is much faster
than binary split I don't know why I
haven't looked inside inside the beanery
split code maybe it is some pattern
generation take the text time or
something else but I must understand
that I swear when I also when I produced
bar sir auto generated password I make
something like a state machine so it if
it it should be really fast for example
I make all the generation all the all
the number of parsing in see it is also
many many times faster than a long list
to integer so this is really this really
works faster and problem is not in high
problem is is in string string string
handling in early so in fact if he I
think if you will use any other language
or even C++ with some generic parser you
will also give you will also receive bed
where bill paid results
so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
