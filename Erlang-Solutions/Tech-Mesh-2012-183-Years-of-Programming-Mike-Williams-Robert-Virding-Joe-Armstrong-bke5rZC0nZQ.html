advantages over traditional languages
for example programs in such languages
are considerably shorter than the
equivalent programs in imperative
languages here for example is a program
in seeds and here is the equivalent
program in airline hello hello Joe hello
Mike hello Joe and I'll make a call to
Robert
hello Mike hello Thomas hello Mike well
first of all I like to say thank you
very much for inviting us this
conference we are honored to be here but
the last time that Joe myself and Robert
the other way around gave this talk it
gave a talk was in fact that movie I
think that's the last time we're
actually giving the talk together was it
all we have been practicing since then
then we've made some mistakes but sir
hey I was asked to give a title for this
talk some time ago and I talked to Joe
and I said what can we just say how long
we've been programming and we tried to
work that out when you came to 183 years
that God combined programming experience
was here we all are the end the first
thing to notice is the functional
programming has a weird effect on the
color ones hair that we noted that
yesterday in the keynote as far as
Haskell was concerned that the authors
of Haskell is hair has also changed
color during the time I think it must be
something to do with programming and but
here we all are I like that picture
myself it's the price of this is
nowadays but I don't mind the other
thing was that when I said 183 years i
think we don't think slightly wrong I
think we I did that power ages instead
if I did
so this is actually that i've been
working at about 4 45 years i could go
on talking about paper tape of the whole
concert punch cards and all the rest of
it but i won't bore you with that this
isn't number years yes it's 122 years
which i still think it's a fairly
impressive total but after that saw some
fundamental error and specification i
hope you trust us that we can actually
write code I thought they'd tell you a
bit about the history and why did the
airline happen though what was it all
about well years and years ago or not
years ago about 1978 the first XE
telephone exchange was introduced you
all have used Araxes and exited 80
California changes even though you don't
know it in fact the hold of the BT
network is based on them nowadays
although they've actually been phased
out it requires an enormous effort to
write the software for these exchanges
in fact that so nowadays the effort
seems fairly small when it started I
think we're about 100 people writing
code and nowadays for a 3g or 4g system
we actually come sort of sailor didn't
close to a thousand people so the
situation hasn't actually got any better
but in the day said we started their
writing code telephone exchanges in the
weird language called plex it took a
large effort to do that and we were
asked since your computer science people
we thought we would computer science
people the definition what can be
dishonest was there wasn't very sort of
very specific they sort of said can you
introduce me to make this easier I think
they thought that we would actually do
something to make Plex easier to make
the program various attend easier we
misinterpreted what they said and said
that we would actually do something
different well basically we had to make
something we did exactly the same as
their eggs in 10 and on the this side
picture you here you can see a sort of
schematic diagram of what it was for
start the masses thousands of
transactions at the same time as you can
imagine any telephone exchange you have
thousands of transactions and the
transactions as such a fairly small that
when programming these things they found
that in the previous version of the
first exchange which is controlled by
software narratives call a ke there's
enormous amount of pointer errors and
rebounds errors and that sort of thing
which is a sort of what you get with
this sort of programming so that he was
actually very clever they introduced
something in the middle which you see is
called the reference memory and this is
a very fine-grained mm you so you're
actually doing so bounds checking and a
reporter checking in hardware which is i
don't think i've ever seen that than
anywhere else maybe it's been done
anywhere else but uh there are no why
part is the other thing you can do
because you've got the hardware between
yourself here on the memory you can
actually move things around it's like
you're sort of a hardware control
garbage collection and compacta fire
tonight and although we didn't know what
garbage collection was then I suppose
you can rearrange my arm using all sorts
of things the other thing is of course a
telephone exchange you can't take it
down I mean people like to film the 111
112 numbers or the 999 numbers of
whatever the emergency numbers at any
time you can't sort of say sorry we've
taken the exchange down for maintenance
so being able to change code at runtime
without stopping in exchange was
actually vitalized is still viable if
you have hundreds of programmers program
these affiliate comes also modular
system you have a system where various
people can write different parts here
independently from each other and you
have to be able to handle the different
parts separately the other thing of
course is that in the days when this
sort of system has been made the major
faults we had were actually in hardware
we had
errors and this sort of things we had to
be able to recover from that solera of
course there were software errors as
well and you can't stop a telephone
exchange working because you hit the bug
you have to recover for it in some sort
of way recovery and telephony is
actually very easy because you just met
Bob call and hope that people can remain
the call so the job we got let's do the
same thing as in a HC but please can you
use conventional processes making your
own processes no special purpose
hardware is very expensive could you
please use some sort of standard
operating system I think they probably
at that time thought we were going to
try and use some IBM systems but we all
hated IBM so we didn't choose them so we
we discipline UNIX another problem we
had is the processes were weak and the
idea that you could actually get more
capacity by putting more processes into
the problem was something which came
along and they said well could you make
it scalable could you if we don't have
enough power could you please just add a
few more processes so we get power an
interesting thing about this is that all
these requirements are sort of obvious
requirements forces of the world we have
today that we ended up doing this sort
of thing and that for example the
grounds for scalability just fits very
well with clunky we with them multi-core
processors I'm time processing so
there's lots of things work happened at
the time actually guided us in the right
direction I don't think we knew that
multi calls were about to turn up but
that's how they did and they're
significantly the last thing was that we
were asked to make development efforts
significantly easier in other words do
with five people instead of a hundred
the important thing here to realize is
is that hardware changes the way we
think that I'm sure that a lot of
uniform I mean maybe none of you are old
enough can remember to overlay
processing in in ms-dos we've sort of
swapped in I had pieces of code to get
things working that that sort of
processing will you actually program
things is very much determined by how
much memory you've got and the data that
you always online changes the way you
think that we now have a network that we
have faster cpu which changes the way
you think we can do things more
efficiently than we used to used to do
before we can have large a software
mobility that you can actually move
around changes the way we actually
program and if the hardware doesn't
change the software doesn't change I
mean the way we most people program not
really talking about people sitting in
this room but if you look at the world
in general the way moopy program it
hasn't really changed significantly
since the 80s with still people are
still using see they're still using C++
or the seal using Java and languages
like that it hasn't actually
significantly changed so hard when that
didn't change very much until about two
thousand and four with multi-core
stirred turned up I think Joe this is
your was I think a Tory doing such a
nice job I'd remotely yeah yes right so
the title of the talk was 118 three
years of experience was then downgraded
20 22 years and so towards the end of
the talk it Phyllis kind of sum up
what's happened during this period we've
been programming and so one of the feces
I have and to try to make sense of it is
that if the hardware doesn't change the
programming language I'll going to
change much because ok the way we
described is using that
I might change but the fundamental
changes are going to be caused by scale
changes in hardware and I could to look
at those scale changes because to see
what happens and basically between I
reckon you know the mid-eighties to
about 2000 to Hardware didn't really
change that much okay the clock rates
got faster and we got more memory but
the skilled 100 machines they didn't
become parallel they didn't become
distributed we signaled we still had
signal systems and since then we've seen
things like mobility we've seen things
like being always online and they are
enablers of the cloud and things like
that the cloud wouldn't be a possibility
if you didn't have if you weren't always
connected to the network so that I mean
the cloud follows being always connected
to the to the network so thought to look
at some of those changes as we go along
and so I'm going to go back to about
nineteen eighty and this was this was
the state of the world when we started
solving the sort of problems and I was
talking about we had a machine as a tree
megahertz clock that's 11 750 well now I
machines about a three gigahertz clock
that's a factor of a thousand that we
had four megabytes of memory what a
machine today we'll have four gigabytes
of memory so that's a factor of
thousands so and they will disagree with
me I reckon this this little thing I
have in my pocket is 15 million times
more powerful but we're happy but it
will certainly be it's a thousand times
fast it's a thousand-dollar Scott you
turn a thousand times more memory so the
machine we develop airline on there's a
thousand times more powerful this so if
you think this is a week computer forget
it's a jolly fast Joe Torre thought I'm
actually figured out what we and i will
put these in tenebris pockets and we'll
be able to communicate up to a gigabit
per second in a few years and we'll put
a terabyte of memory in them and we'll
have a petabyte of memory in the mid
within 20 years we have to ask what are
we going to do with these things that's
quite exciting and
so let's go back to nineteen eighty-four
this was the problem i'm not going to
read out all of those things but it's a
long list of what we wanted to achieve
it was written in a paper by donna decos
our boss he wrote this paper in two
thousand i'm not sure if it's a sort of
reconstruction of what we did i had an
audience is like available you know we
knew what we were doing at the time i'm
not so sure we did know what we do at
times we certainly knew we we wanted to
distribute things over lots of computers
i didn't really know how to do this and
we wanted fault tolerance and these kind
of I mean if anybody does anybody have
computers that they want to change the
code while there you know without taking
out of service it's up any what you want
to do that right just does anybody
worried a fair system to have a service
no does anybody does anybody want to
have millions of people does anybody
want to distribute their application
where the long list of those if you if
if you're interested in any of those
points and want to do that today well
that's what we were interested in in
around about nineteen eighty-four 1985
so we started looking at those problems
and then why are we looking at them
because we move we were working for
telecom company and we heard the
hardware that could do this so people
haven't had hardware that was connected
together until about 2004-2005 the
people didn't start becoming interested
in distributed programming as a
practical thing until they had it in
their households when you first got your
adsl or your permanent linked line at
home they gave you make a bit per second
you know then improvise distributed
programmers and then things like
bittorrent appear and people started
sharing files and the Wikipedia appeared
WikiLeaks and all these kind of things
appeared because the technology had
enabled it we have that technology in
about nineteen eighty-four eighty-five
so we had a bit of a head start on the
people who discovered that a few years
ago okay so that that's really why I
think airing is kind of well positioned
because we've been looking at
time and so we'll chat them kind of
reality you know we worked in an
industrial environment as opposed to an
academic environment so we weren't
really interested in kind of inventing
new science or or doing anything one
level in a scientific sense but we were
interested in stealing ideas from
academics and things are trying to shove
them into products and this good lady
accession erdlings and she was project
manager I guess you'd call it off a
project but wanted to make new telephone
exchange and this is back in then 1986 i
made this slide for ICF p.m. rosary main
conference just show that the sort of
timeline and we've kind of divided into
things that happen that these are things
you have to do in order to make a
programming language you see okay feel
if an academic you perhaps looking at
the theory type theory or something like
that but if you want to get something
out and you want to get users you have
to participate in a lot of different
things you've got to do academic things
you know make it work but infinitely
obviously said it works um but you've
also got to do a bit of marketing and
try and sell the idea to people and you
know we have on occasion hundreds and
hundreds of sort of presentation what
airline is inside Erickson just to be
told bugger off never work you go so how
did it go well they told us to bugger
off so did you actually throw us out
typically so you go back in six months
ago I go through an outfitter optimism
is yes a good measure of optimism this
is kind of start flocking new technology
and they say
bugger off you think that you just go
back six months my love in love good
thing to do and then during this time
but we're also change technology quite a
lot because how we implemented things
back in mid eighties change we started
off with prologue as an implementation
language and then change we'll talk
about that later and then at the same
time we're always doing this thing with
users and with products and I think
that's interacted very helpful so this
was reality for us in about nineteen
eighty-five this is an MD 110 and that
was the first hardware that we got to
control and Robert said hardware is
funny I mean it doesn't it breaks your
fear your nice theories if it doesn't
work on the hardware your theories were
wrong it's a reality check and so this
was where theory met practice and this
woman share to no delaying I think we're
trying to make we're trying to program
this thing in a better way the New
Kingdom bethought so we set up at the
target and basically we decided okay we
knew how to program it and we would go
ahead and write us off that they write
software we would improve their like so
that the performance went up we reckoned
we had react Lear take them two years to
make the product and it would take us to
about two years three years and it would
take us to three years to improve the
performance of airline
the point where we could ship it as a
product this actually did become a
product and were sold to the European
Parliament still probably controls all
the selected here DX which politicians
use to talk to each other and well so
Chester Attic had this a first version
of a line we trashed and wanted a way of
describing telephony and I suppose you
could say to start with airline with the
domain-specific language for describing
telephony and we had to make it
attractive to share of course it can be
the cause of telephony problem it very
similar to other problems it's not just
telephony I mean thousands of people go
change on the fly that's a
characteristic of many problems although
we can realize it at the time Ashton
wanted to program it like this because
she had something look like this is if
these are fishbone diagrams and Ashton
wanted to program in fishbone diagrams
though she called him fishbone diagrams
you can't see that loaded up and that's
that sir that's a fishbone diagram from
about 1983 or something that's it
domain-specific language for describing
telephony and it says if you're waiting
for this is a unique all if you work on
n that's on hook and h is a hold button
and if you're in a call and you do
something you want a new corn and become
connected these things are these are
events these estates or processes
actually and that got turned into that
for those of you who know prologue it
will recognize as prologue using
definitely cloth grammars and that is
pretty much isomorphic to that and that
became that that's modern LA and was a
transition between that and that in
about 19 what do you want active on
something like that and so that okay so
start it off like that
I came that that became a
domain-specific language that became
that this implemented this is the
earliest that I going to find and it's
1988 sort of all the other ones are lost
in the mists of time and just so that
time actually took four days to rewrite
everything so wasn't was very big sister
okay and I was like this sir they ran at
240 and if it's the second I say 500 for
the second round 245 influences per
second and are and this was a major
rewrite and after the major rewriting
went to two hundred eighty three
instances per second and took four days
to implement and that stage Robert read
my prologue and said can I fiddle with
it a bit I think Robert should do tell
what happened then why I me fiddling is
rewriting everything so yes everybody
you know just one thing from the film
I've asked 3 i'm the only one actually
does any work they're just sitting there
talking with each other i'm the one who
actually fixes the bug yeah so we were
coming on I only wrote the interpreter
and Joe rewrote my interpret we did that
a couple times backwards and forwards
and it got better one interesting thing
here which is that the pipe stuff that
was something we added in which we
thought would help them solve their
problem and it didn't and it was a big
complicated mess there which we thought
they could use and they came back and
said no we can't use it because we've
got the problem wrong so we had to
remove it after us when we removed
rafters anyway that happened a couple of
times put things in there which we
thought would help solve their problem
and it did gave up doing solutions there
any way things are going quite well and
we thought trying to make the product of
which they could use eventually if they
would then they want to build
and a couple of things you have to do
for make a product need documentation
near the community when he performance
you need things like courses I don't
have a good slide for courses but at
this time when when Alan got going we
were basically doing everything so if
giving courses not just giving
presentations to Eric support giving
courses in our linked bits of Eric's as
well while we're developing so we've had
a long history of making courses and of
course yet you need documentation right
and here is the original documentation
for the a line system this is not the
code this is this is running the system
so we did have documentation for the
whole thing like that was he that was
very nice this is from a very early a
line user conference I don't know
exactly which year it is but must be
early 90 someone around this weather had
a line user conferences and in this
stage they were pure lyrics and things
because howling didn't exist outside
errors so we sat in a room there we use
that room for many years to hold the
user conferences exact the same thing
you came more and more people as time
went on eventually we pulled it so this
is a very so we did have a community
going on we had conferences once he had
a was in November it's a very bad
month to visit Stockholm if you're
coming to stop thank God we moved into
this year we had performance and the
performance was well foot backwards and
forwards performance was pretty bad I
think we up JoJo's figures from 280 to
about 400 productions per second using
prologue interpreter but it was pretty
bad stuff so we had to the best way of
getting past this with doing our own
virtual machine only our own
implementation as there before we
running on top of prologue which was
very nice for developing the systems you
have a lot of tools have all built-in
functionality in the system you can just
use straight off but it also means
there's some things you can't do because
you're limited to what the underlying
system provides
for you so performance was one of them
and another thing that we could fiddle
with the semantics what was going on we
had much better control over what we
could do with the system amongst other
things code change okay now now we were
actually in charge of loading code not
leaving it to the prologue system so we
could actually work with no change this
is when having multiple versions the
code came into the system because we
just couldn't do it we could play with
our isolation and we can look at the
problem of having a real time garbage
collector so these are things we can
attack and how I did it well we did a
bytecode interpreter that was the first
version it was a god inspiration from
the Pascal the machine and from the
warren abstract machine for prologue
that's what read the documentation for
those who've got a lot of ideas for how
they worked and tried to read exactly
something we'll try to do the same same
thing yeah we went from poor too much
better anyway so this is a basic history
for very quick history of when we were
doing things and about the speed we had
right so we had the original
interpreters they were developed in the
green would be used in the red for doing
problem the Strand implementation was
one we experimented with now strand is a
concurrent logic language so concurrent
logic languages they look like prologue
but they do everything concurrently
they're extremely concurrently so from
their point of view our line is very big
heavy processes everything there is it
with the reduction and we need to
experiment with that of compiling our
line down into stranded because there
was a commercial standing implementation
that went quite well we couldn't do
everything we wanted we didn't get it
get as much speed as we hope to get and
we didn't have all the control we needed
of the system so even while that was
working we started implementing jam jams
down to josé abstract machine that was
Joe
in my attack using up a long time then
they became another came another machine
which eventually became the beam I can't
remember what Bob done first Colin he
called the pogroms even before they
called the beam had he had another name
I can remember yeah yeah but before that
called something else out of it anyway
Bob down was I work in the lab and he
was working compiling a line down it to
see and then running the code through
the c compiler which went well was
reasonably fast actually the downside
was the population took a long time
because i think the whole a whole module
became one c function it took a long
time to compiler to compile that and it
also generated a lot of code so the code
explosion and we found that the group
were using it they could not use it they
like the speed but it was just too much
code for their memory they didn't have
the memory to fit all in so it became a
thread and interpreted as well which is
based off the same technologies today
yeah so improving it we had the
experiments we did par log well that's
another parallel logic language I like
parallel logical languages I think it
fun we did strand with your own vm and
the compiler an emulator and prologue
well if we the first version the
emulator was written in Prolog and we're
doing about 35 reductions on top of the
circumstance I wasn't a direct improved
think went a bit but we did started
doing in C and Mike well sorry Joe
started implementing it in writing a see
virtual machine or virtual machine
written in C and Joe was is haha yes a
four-time programmer no no not easy will
you were aware i agree with those
targets and he's you see co didn't look
quite like see and what might go Mike
took one look at that and said yes it's
the worst program ever and let move go a
bit me do it so we ended up so Joe wrote
to compiler microwave the virtual
machine and I did the libraries so a lot
of things you'll see in the language
people love to hate it's my fault ok so
you until jam I don't you have you
talked Joe you talked Jarius jam is Jose
abstract machine and as I said the
Giroud the compiler he first heard the
compiler in prologue and he then wrote
an airline version though you had to
boot stuff to compile all the way and it
was boosted by a prologue that he was
also responsible the architecture and
getting things right that we went
through a number of iterations I
remember the first time was a register
machine we made and then we went to a
sort of a more like a Fourth Reich
machine with a sort of thrown into the
ISIS something's on fire that the vm is
not my cv the the vm is written in c and
i thought i knew how to programs here
now states have been programming unix
for a number of years and i thought i
was really quite a good seed program
could see hackett until you actually
rust start writing a virtual machine and
then you realize life is different that
the number of casts and pointers and
manipulations and masking of tags and
it's just strange thing that you you if
you start using the c compiler those
things you don't really realize we using
the Sunseeker pile of that stage and of
course because it's about good
interpreted the whole main loop is a
switch on the bite which switches to the
right instruction i discovered by
peering at the source code there was no
way of stopping that than that compiler
doing a bounced check on the hors Asajj
check on the bite to check the bike
wasn't larger than 255 so i had to write
a little assembly language had a little
hackett orc which managed the object
code to get rid of the the check and
that made the whole machine suddenly got
fifteen percent faster weird things you
love so so that if you really want them
to a program see write a vm are pretty
better than s season that was there that
the vm is a bytecode to say did say the
vm at this stage was 32 bits long
because machines
32 bids I had 8-bit tank incidentally if
you use a 68,000 original 68,000 those a
24-bit machine it didn't actually have
to do any operations from pell pointers
to mask away the the highest bite it did
automatically in the hardware but that's
the sort of thing you discovered by
mistake 24 bits data it's all changed
nowadays and the thing we realized is
legion line process had his own separate
stack and heap which he still does today
garbage collection has done / process
and persons processes were fairly small
but gave a fairly fairly good real
timeless to the garbage collection
processes across can not on mica garbage
collection stack and heap could vary in
size and you lose a lot of efficiency
and actually checking for sizes when you
put things on the heaters of expand heap
contract the heat first version was on
the backs 11 750 was I think Joe already
mentioned it actually had eight
megabytes memory not fourth origin and
it had about 300 megabytes of disc golf
ages about a digital machines if nike we
run 34.1 unix on it we were regarded by
the computer departments of Erickson was
great traitors because we were using new
UNIX and they were sort of very heavily
into IBM machines and the day we weren't
allowed to put our machine into their
data center so we had to put it in our
own little private air conditioning room
with a lock on the door so they wouldn't
people with the evilness of digital and
UNIX wouldn't spread to the rest of the
company
first version was on the vaccine went to
sundry 68k processor later went over the
spark processes first product was the
one that Joe mentioned mobility server
it was that a porta to vxworks be
exposing a horse horrid operating system
I've ever seen that I won't go into
details about wires for it but I can
explain those who shamelessly afterwards
another thing which happened in the
state stages that clacker class
wikström came in and he was one
actually implemented most of the young
distribution he also implemented airline
term storage the ad system which is
actually the basis of been easier not
comes back to y minus 0 is actually
important the database and I spread
within Erickson we had other products at
this stage for various reasons which I
want going two hours going into
management that landed up in position
being the chief architect for system
called a and X which was Erickson's
first adsl system we haven't be very
successful neuronics and selling adsl
systems mainly because we've had to buy
the modem chips from
separate external companies and they
charge the submersible bunch if we could
make a profit out of it the HD 301 ATM
switch is the another problem which came
out you've all used them some of you
probably use now XD 301 today but
without knowing it because the action
basis of BT's telecom network bit is
long distance network and if you use
their short hair who's actually is you
use the smartphone to sort of a look at
the web page today who's the man yeah
well you almost certainly have used the
STS mmm e which is the basis of ericsson
ericsson it's forty-five percent of the
market in mobile data and you've used an
ase involved without knowing it so these
things are spread all over the world and
a very large the in all these products
the jam was replaced by the beam which
is bogdan's along ND Bogdan left
ericsson and the guy called beyond
Gustafson took over so it's now be on
sale an abstract machine and it's
replaced the jamming all products I
think that maybe for historical reasons
there are some mobility service we still
use it and I've lost the code
unfortunately it disappeared which is
probably a good thing because I don't
have to maintain it Robert did is
something which you know that talk to
him about that if he did very deserving
engine which was I think use reference
county didn't you well the two versions
with different I was experimenting with
garbage collection various garbage
collection schemes to have a central
heap and still have real-time garbage
collection so into two versions that the
actual virtual machine is to basically
the same technology so the first one was
a was a bytecode interpreter and the
second one was a threaded machine but I
was fiddling with different carpet
collection schemes do that
it actually gave unfortunate gave a lot
less than I hoped once you mentioned
beginning us fault handling and failure
handling you have to remember that in
this world there are two different
answers one of these a false fault is a
bug in the code something goes wrong I'm
not going to say how things go wrong but
so they always hardware failure and
these are fundamentally different
because false the exception normal
exception handling mechanisms are in
most languages a crap because you cannot
actually handle a fault in the same
contest as when things go wrong with
those things you've corrupted your data
you don't know what's wrong so you have
to handle a fault in a different context
and that's the basis of their hair
lengths fault handling and they it's the
same world basically like failing at me
accepting any links failure handling if
your hardware fails you cannot rectify a
hardware which is failed in the past
which is failed for obvious reasons now
the whole idea of an era hanley actually
comes from a very ancient technology
which happened in ericsson the idea of
relay based telephone exchange it had a
sea wire and the cy was part of the
equipment which controlled all the
relays it was connected to minus 48
volts and connected to all the relays
which did anything useful if anything
dreadful happened in the telephone
exchange a little relay contact opened
and broke the sea wire and this caused
all the sort of equipment connected to
that telephone call to fail so the sea
wire was the idea about how you actually
get failure to work if you couldn't have
a transaction you want something to kill
all the transactions and this was the
idea which came into
like the idea of linked processes I made
a mistake that I'm a process is linked
when I implemented themselves there is a
jewel direction favorite link to BB was
also linked to a nowadays there's a new
mum to cook and local monitor which does
it turn correctly so the idea is you
have a subgroup of processes which are a
part of a transaction if one of them
fails before the fault is propagated to
all the other processes everything fails
and except for one or two super simple
processes which actually stand there can
collect catch the failure and do
something about it and I said I'll get
back two min easier this is what I've
seen primary reason for having been
easier at this stage was that these
processes are too large akata processors
for everything the idea is you should
have a database which was stable a
replicated or open those real-time
databases every time we go to a stable
state in the system you burned the data
in the database and the database on the
basis recovery if a transaction failed
you've got went to the database got out
what is the steady state to return to
the steady state I'm an easier actually
on the the concept of using venezia as I
steady state to a for recovery is to
hold one of the bread principles of
Erickson's off sorry we're very
important lock aware lang say
if you're a failure mechanism STM isn't
it yeah only before they were invented
it a few things you may not have thought
about I wrote this slide on the plane on
the way though because as few things
people say dynamic typing horrible kind
of that it actually makes debugging a
lot easier because not assume that you
keep a lot of symbolic information in
runtime and one of the things that
happens when things crash an airline
yourself things go wrong it out on your
to bogus you can actually investigate
the system to see what happened always
look at any data term and find out what
it is I think that Rick yes they was
talking about values and knowing about
parties the lowest it was actually in
spectabile because you can get out the
names of atoms you can get other names
of a function as you fight if something
crashes you know exactly which function
is crashed and what the data input data
was it also makes marshaling your data
for inter machine communication easy run
time because you've done a lovely typed
you can actually pack everything down to
a bite independent format and send data
across a network to another machine and
you don't actually have to specify what
the protocol is I think that breaks one
of the principles for it Chris talking
about yesterday and being able to change
code in the fly is also something which
you don't really think about that in
normal computing for your back to see
you have a sort of a you have you think
about things you write a program you
compile the program and you get a
segmentation error you say Oh bother you
and then you have to rebuild the system
go all the way around that cycle every
time that you go to relive this if that
takes time it can take you 10 minutes in
a sort of a small system it can take a
whole day in a very large system the
fact that they you can actually just
reload a code in a running system when
something's gone wrong and changed the
code correct false or even if you write
like but the equivalent of an iron
format of printf in its or so to find
out to get my data at if you want to
makes debugging awful lot easier and
then often I've thought about another
thing which is had not thought about me
Erickson is that airline is the
distribution is transparent individual
Lakota to be send a message to another
processor no processing the average bit
of code doesn't actually know on what
processor what cpu the process is
running we just fine away a message a
way to it and they offered goes so
having completely transparent
distribution is actually important
selective message reception a lot of
finite state machines have a lot of
states being able to say what messages
you're able to get in which state
actually reduces the complex of your
state across message may matrix and can
actually half the size of code one of my
unfortunate jobs before I left their
eggs would be managing a unit which made
software for base stations where we were
using a product I like being here now
left our expense it wasn't like that a
commercial rose don't use this it's
horrible it creates an awful mess that
it's a because the way it works day in
any state you can receive any message
which means that one of the most common
errors we had was that unexpected
message was received in this state and
there was no handle afraid which caused
system to crash another reflection I had
is that you can implement synchronous
inter-process communication on top of
asynchronous communication the reverse
is almost impossible so if you want to
do something do it asynchronously and
then you can make it synchronous you
want some too by having handshaking
backwards and forwards don't try and
sort of that do something synchronous
like they didn't either with or divorce
and then having to put some messenger
tasks and all the rest we get it right
that's horrible idea I think that was my
bit no this is where we are now in 1992
and I think that it's now Joe's bit i
think because he's going to tell you
what was it for this bitter comorbid i
think i think it's robbers bitchesss
might be oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yes my
bit well yeah from about 92 yeah rapid
but we were into rapid prototyping and
doing stuff as well to this is me doing
serious work it death might look quite
look out but it was I can't remember
which was very funny well we're
controlling a train and a telephone
extreme okay yes that is our telephone
exchange oh that's great I definitely
will trade shouting Wilson okay pretty
sure yeah we're going to show a line
there and say what you like about the md
110 is not doesn't really look very
flashing to look at night I think
there's a small red light that goes on
when you turn it on that's about it and
no blinking lights no nothing so we
thought we need something better to show
to demonstrate a line and so what better
have a model train with trains running
and the system being controlled by Alec
so we I went out and bought a train set
which could be
work computer it Roberts a training
system well as roberts training system
well yes yeah for anything and I reckon
ATC system so i could run trains aren't
you could be good plan where you want to
train to go you could book that they
could reserve path something like this
and block other things changes which is
automatically it was failsafe because if
something went wrong it just shut
everything down and stopped all the
trains so there no collisions for so
that was actually real work and
prototyping that i think i did probably
did a bit more than was expected it
actually works i have not been able to
find a photograph of the actual system
we showed at that show so we're running
another colleague of mine he did a
graphical interface so you could show on
the screen you can see where the trains
were there going around the tracking of
the practices well person can control it
we had a definite implement it very
simple very simple BSL before we knew
they were called dsl's where you can
define all these train tracks and how to
run so you could program up sequences of
events running through these things are
on the train we could run those was a
lot of fun actually we actually use that
in the course it coupled the courses in
our like so you have an exercise move
the train from one point to another
point and stop it when it gets thicker
so you had to set the other surface
which you'd have to get us I read the
senses and things like this port they
like that that's fun anyway yeah so not
otherwise in 92 95 nothing much happened
what this means is yes a lot of things
actually happened we were doing a lot of
implementing an hour lying and putting
in new features and making the system
better and getting you to work but in
our relations the company nothing much
happened there were a few products going
on we were more or less at war with
parts of Ericsson which we won oh he did
we did we were right and yeah but that
was enough to be calm and peaceful until
in 95 a big project for the AIX en was
canceled and a xen was it was
title in 88 to build the next system
after the AFC and we originally asked to
join that project I think we're there
for about six months before we decided
we didn't want to be there anymore and
we left and we were more less of war
with them but they died that was
interesting those things happened then
we're about here now in our timeline and
yeah this is also interesting I mean yes
but I Wars up the top there also our
extensive marketing they're quite funny
if you look at those different ways we
were thinking how found your cell a line
in this case to the company so we try to
call me a functional and declarative
which didn't mean anything to anyone so
basically useless we came to hide the
language so we should we wouldn't try to
solve a language and try to sell the
system implementation or very fast rapid
rapid implementation or things like this
we've got about time to market
interoperability and stuff like this and
motor really worked very well pages is
we've got two standard languages
following the standard which caters this
was the earliest and quite different
almost l96 the HD 301 project will start
that was very good for us and verbs and
actually because as mike said this
action was a program worked succeeded
and it was what made from leftovers the
ACN so it was a very funny project
because it could have some quite good
people there but never really got
anywhere this one they got some good
people they make something out of it and
we were working too well we work working
on the HD 301 project of course people
working making the Allen system better
up so they could use it and depend on
this was also about this time that the
OTP will AGP was that was developed I
mean we had libraries and things like
this before when love the philosophy
ratp we'll talk
95 96 wasn't that joke don't go around
there the OTP group was formed a group
in in areas that was formed to try and
market in the support a leg still within
Erickson I think 96 was the year that
the first are one version came came out
for that that also met that we at the
lab didn't have to do all this work up
till this time we've been to all the
support in the calling everything for
apart from them in addition to
developing the actual language assistant
at 96 98 well again nothing really much
happens in the sense that things keep on
going we're developing the system that
come new products XD one against was
developed 301 and works and all this
type of thing it's a great success and
its market is still in use today can BTW
so you're probably using without knowing
it there's trouble with a success right
so there's a bit of trouble with success
you should be careful what happened at
it creston he tells me up to speed up a
bit okay walls clean up a bit so we got
to here we have two here and this decide
with some this is very embarrassing
because this do you remember i was at
if's I cfp and I'd stop the slide at
that point deliberately because what had
happened actually it was ailing have
been banned inside Ericsson and we
didn't want to tell anybody outside
Arison because here we're trying to
spread it outside air isn't but
internally it's been banned and we
thought if the people outside Eric C
knew that it was found inside Erickson
they might lose faith you see so so a
rather embarrassing position of sort of
just forgetting to tell people outside
their exceeded it was banned that caused
all sorts of band inside Erickson not
banned outsider it's banned in ericsson
radio for new projects but there were
any the old projects so they had to
carry on and that caused a lot of stuff
to happen you know these nothing much
happens dot dot dot well banning stuff
was actually the best thing that ever
happened to early because a lot of stuff
happened so not the captain for four or
five months
after it with band and then guess what
or where I became open source and when
it became open source stuff started very
quickly because four days after it
became open source most of the airline
people just sort of accidentally left
the company in formed a new company and
that was the days of blue tail and then
then things become fragmented and I'm
not going to tell you it then it just
gets so confusing that we don't know
what's happening because I talked to a
consultant once he said if ubound
something if you've got to got something
another heavy fist comes down flat and
it's Blatter's and the seeds go out and
they start growing by themselves so this
is a period of great confusion so I'm
gonna hop so ten years like 10 years
after the pan well there's a whole load
of books is a whole loading and how
these are where these I don't know where
they've come from I hadn't Tracy iambic
luke and I could trace the start of it's
sort of DNA it's like Guttenberg you
know the Gutenberg's it took eight years
for a you know what seven years for an
apprenticeship and then a number seven
years you had to serve not 14 years you
were allowed to leave in the middle ages
and then after 14 years he split off in
uniform so it's about seven-year sort of
cycle that the lab splattered and it
became Bluto Bluto was in existence for
about four years and then it we've got
caught up and things happened and it
kind of split mainly into Taylor from
klarna I'm you Clara in its own right I
come from the 400th what was i five
hundred people that just have to add a
hundred every time I give a talk and and
then go Francesco's a student of mine
you know and sort of doing his master as
it can and oh what he's gone off and
formed a consultancy company and then
it's formed an alliance with fasho and
there's something lots of other company
I haven't a clue where they come from or
how they
article where these relationships are
and it's all gone daft so now time to
reflect what what's happened in this
period well clock rates went like that
they shot up by it's a log scale until
2002 chips sort of copy grew bigger and
bigger and you couldn't get across the
entire chip in one clock cycles oh dear
speed of light hits you in the face they
become parallel and memory sort of went
up shot up like that and so we got some
hardware and software and on the
software scale I mean Phil's told you
about about her age and curry and you
know in 1879 phrase was sort of telling
you how to program but clock speed 100
megahertz you know Harry came along and
clock speeds were still 0 &amp;amp; 0 megabytes
of memory and then well about the 1980s
you know we've got 1.6 1.6 meg that's
come out pretty damn fast megabytes of
memory came and then wrap out sort of
2000 2004 you getting getting megabytes
of memory you're getting GPRS you're
getting multi-course coming in 2004 and
gigabytes of ram you've got 4g you could
do gigabytes per second of it if you
look at this heck of a lot of stuff has
happened in the last three or four years
and it enormous amount of stuff
absolutely amazingly it can do a gigabit
per second in the air you can buy a 3
terabyte disk for you know 100 quid or
something like that you will get a
terabyte of flash memory in your phone
within five years the disk manufactured
if they wanted to could give you a
petabyte of memory in there in your disk
on your desktop 400 grid today but
they're not going to do so they're going
to dribble it out every two years you'll
buy another disk and it will be twice
the capacity they could do it tomorrow
if they wanted to we have to ask
ourselves the question what are we going
to do is all this stuff well I reckon
this is it this is software like an
iceberg okay and for a long time we've
been looking at the stuff at the top so
this is this is a kind of this is what C
is too
you know see at the top you've got
efficiency and under the water you've
got fault tolerance distribution memory
usage garbage collection latency dis to
go all these sort of horrible thing
these are all the things that cost you
money to basing decisions on the thing
at the top it's absolutely crazy so what
we tried to do is kind of move the bar
down try and make some of these things
like fault tolerance of distribution
ring concurrency and since I've got my
not efficient efficiency still down here
but we start we'll try to solve all the
problems that you have when you're
building systems and systems aren't
haven't got anything to do with
efficiency they have to do with
isolation authorities capabilities
that's what we try to do and I think we
were successful in doing so because we
addressed as problem thirst in
roundabout 1985's and figured out how to
buy by 1990 we knew how to do that
because we didn't have the hardware to
do all the multi-course came along 14
years later and then they were like oh
we've been waiting for that to happen
and now we can use that's great so multi
God's kind of cool because we just write
our program and you know I was in
meeting some guys use you Tyler a 64
processor 64 core processor and they've
run an errand program and he went 33
times faster and the managers are going
ah dear this isn't very good why isn't
it going 64 times faster and I said well
are you pleased that it's going 33 times
faster or are you sad but it's not going
64 times faster and they said what was
small we wanted to go 64 I said how how
much faster is a C++ project going what
is going 1 times faster cuz we come
apparently so
so anybody here running C++ you're
trying to paralyze oh good luck so I'm
not being asked about it see you much
right so tomorrow can have a million
cause we'll have 2020 world million call
computers I mean the released research
probably figuring out how do premises it
will happen will have terabytes of
memory in our phones well I gigabits per
second in the mobile networks and we
have a hundred billion connected devices
as ubiquitous networking and today well
Mike's already 70 you know people think
elling isn't used that much but we are
if you doing data of things if you've
got a smartphone if you connect it up to
the networks today that if you used a 3g
there would be a forty percent chance
that it was all set up by airline if you
4G which hasn't really reached written
yet there's a sixty percent chance
because we got sixty percent of the
world market there and it selling that
setting up all those courts it selling
this cut in the part of the system which
has to be thought tolerant and it's been
working fine for years and so this is a
conference about new languages and we
have new hardware and we have new
problems so that's why we're here and I
hope you're enjoying it and I think I'll
in there because I run over time you
have time for questions well not one or
two one two
Oh No ok but well thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
