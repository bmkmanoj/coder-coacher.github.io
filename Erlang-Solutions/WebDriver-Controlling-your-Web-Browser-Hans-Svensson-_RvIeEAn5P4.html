these
what I haven't been doing recently I
have small confession to make a long
time ago this is all forgiven and
forgotten now I think I actually built a
major web system that were actually used
by lots of people and I built it in PHP
that's good technology I would I would
have wouldn't have done otherwise back
then I didn't know anything else that
just worked well but it was so painfully
Monday in to test you every time you
build something you had to start your
browse or fill out lots of forms and set
you up into a situation where you could
actually test the feature you just added
so it wasn't really well tested I
basically relied on on users telling me
okay this thing is broken can you please
fix it since then I know better but it's
a confession i have to make and to
quickly show you the situation I was in
if we skip to a system and this is an
example for those who visited Alex's
tutorial this this this week he also
talked about the same system this is
double I guess all of you know about
doodle and where you can schedule your
your meetings and end events and this is
double it's an open-source clone of that
which you can run on your local machines
if you want to and I picked that as a
little demonstration case for for this
and imagine you are developing this and
you want to test it and you have added a
feature so the first thing you have to
do is you have to actually create a new
poll in in your system and it you need
to get it give it a title title of pole
and we create a normal pole
and we need to have a few options
and now imagine you have to do this many
times I got tired doing once and so of
course i would like to automate that and
being a quick check user and the nailing
you sir i would i would really like to
do that from from from within our line
so there i have i have my my pole
created so if i go back i can see I have
my my pole here which is several options
Oh basic but as a matter of fact this is
something we often often end up doing
and instead it would be really nice if I
could do something like like this doing
nothing hey doing demos already started
I that's why you shouldn't test your
demonstrations so I'm creating a ball
I'm filling out the forms and there have
my pole I can I can go on I can start
playing with it and I can do my test
from there I can I can script so this is
what I wanted to achieve and I would
come back to more exactly what we'll do
but i will turn to the presentation and
but that's the thing i'm trying to
trying to create give me my slides
please thanks so but before that i will
tell you briefly Who am I why am I here
Rick and said I was started back in 2003
just after i did this web system by the
way and i started my PhD and it was
highly theoretical I was proving program
correctness and I happened to stumble
upon a line and actually by by
coincidence Tomas had written a piece of
software which had the right size and
the right complexity and the right
number of bugs
and I took that took the park studied it
for three years and broke my faces about
it however something that constantly bit
me during those years was that reality
is a problem and very lot there are lots
of lots and lots of nice theoretical
papers describing algorithms and every
time you type to take one of these
papers and implement the algorithm
there's always something in your real
situation that doesn't match the paper
so no matter how proven correct the
algorithm is your implementation of it
is has bugs and is basically no way
around it so I realized that you need
actually to to test your things as one
and eventually I got my PhD and my first
thing I did after getting my PhD was to
get involved in the protest project and
it was all about testing so no more fear
improving we did a little bit of model
checking in that at that testing we
managed to fit that in somehow but now
if you're improving at all and after a
while i also got entangled with with the
guys at cubic so after a few years I
decided I let's give it a try so I'm now
working full time for cubic I've done so
for a year and a half and and just
recently nine months ago and we started
the second generation of the protest
project called prowess and and prowess
is it's a European Union funded project
and it's about testing web services and
the previous protest project was more in
general how do you test systems this is
about web services and web systems and
so then we got a new challenge and we
want to do all of this in in quick check
and we want to write our normal
properties in quake check but how can we
interact with the router or with with
the web service and the way we thought
we would like to do that would
preferably be through a web browser
because that's how a normal user would
interact
with the with the same system and and it
seemed pretty stupid to start doing all
of that from from scratch shall we we
try to look around i had as i said
before very limited experience with web
testing and web systems I built that web
system back in 2003 and then I handed it
over and I haven't really been in that
business sense but we ended up finding
selenium and I guess anyone who has been
doing any web testing know about this
framework and it's all about automating
browsers which sounds great because
that's exactly what we want to do as
well and and they also say what you do
with that automation that's entirely up
to you you can you can automate your
browser be it for test or four for
boring administrative stuff up to you
whom selenium is nothing well it's great
tool and but it's nothing magic the
thing you can do with it is you can
create scripts and you can run them much
like the script I just just ran and show
you and its strength is that it's
supposed supports a very wide range of
different browsers operating systems
programming languages etc so you can you
can run your tests in your favorite
browser more or less and their support
for Chrome Internet Explorer Oprah
Firefox and there's partial support for
quite a few other browsers as well the
Mongo safari and you can run it on your
own your favorite operating system given
that one of your favorite or given that
your favorite operating system is in
that list but if it's not you might have
other problems and you can use and very
neat plug into Firefox to actually
record your your script as well you can
you can use it as a in the old days a
tape recorder you press record and you
go through a session in your browser and
you can record that and after what you
can play it back so if you have the
mundane tasks like I had to create the
pole I would be a perfect candidate for
automation by just recording how do you
create the pole and then you can play it
back as many times did you like and
there are language bindings for C sharp
Java Python Ruby and also some portion
support for pearl and PHP and it is
really widely used to create web unit
tests and also maybe even more for for
creating large regression testing suits
for checking you can run to make sure
that you haven't destroyed anything when
develop your systems and selenium
recently or at least the year and a half
ago I think came out in version 2 and
the big change in version 2 was that
they have introduced the webdriver API
and before they had more tightly coupled
technique where they had a driver for
each browser but now they instead tried
to interface with each browsers native
support for driving that browser and and
the good thing with this is that the
browser you're interacting with can be
either in the local or remote so you can
create large grids of test cases if you
want to and the whole web web right
where API is just quite a compact object
oriented API i will show you a little
bit about how it looks and and again
there is a wide support for for browsers
and there are a few languages
implementing native drivers with this as
well and fortunately no one thought
about a line here so what do you do in
this case when your your preferred
language is not in such a list you look
into the technology and see how can I do
this myself and in this case we're we're
off at a good pace because and the
webdriver drivers all communicate using
a restful api over HTTP and Jason I know
Clark I had some comments about those
but in this case it this is this is
is where it's perfect it's as you say
we're doing driving this simplistically
and it's fairly well described as well
so no problems in this case in total the
the protocol and supports around 80
different commands 80 different ways of
controlling different aspects of of your
browser and you can open and close new
new windows and tabs depending on what
the browser settings are you can resize
the windows set the position of them you
can maximize them and we can also
interact with all the elements of the of
the web pages you can find them click
them send data to them read their values
back you can submit forms whatnot and
you have access to the normal navigation
of a browser you can go back and forward
refresh you can navigate to a specific
URL and you can get back also the whole
the whole page source of the of the page
you want and you can set the time as you
need you can send you can actually mr.
landslide you can also send pieces of
JavaScript which you want to have
executed on in that browser on that
pitch and you can get the result back
and you can get and set and delete all
your cookies so pretty much at least
Brighton envision I need to do with with
the web browser and so I went around
with a bit of help from my legs as well
to implement this in our line and I'm a
bit sad to say the implementation was
not very challenging it's a restful api
there's 80 commands I needed to program
those 80 comments but that was more
boring than challenging and the
implementation in full consists of four
four different modules and one little
module to the webdriver cap which
handles the capabilities of a browser so
when you start a webdriver session you
can you can tell it I want the browser
with this character
characteristics and and the main thing
you can give it is you can give the name
of the browser you would like to so if
you want to have a chrome browser you
say i want the browser name chrome
browser and on the second layer we have
the the webdriver wire protocol this is
a purely functional implementation of
the wire protocol each function in there
is one command you have to provide it
with all the parameters its needs and it
would return you the result from from
executing this command in the browser
and as i will show you shortly this gets
quickly verbose fellows room so we also
wrote a little wrapper module just
wrapping it up in a gem server and show
you that you can don't need to keep all
the data around and and can come
conveniently and convert some some types
for you all of this is based on Jason
and some of these functions is easy to
send your raw integers or or strings
into and we needed a JSON library
without any major research I picked the
JSON library written by Tony garnet and
it's open source and you can get here
and there are other Jason language that
would have worked just as well we are
not doing any fancy JSON marshalling so
it's anything would do and I didn't want
to write it myself this would be a very
typical or maybe not so typical because
you wouldn't interact with this in this
way but if you were to interact with it
using the raw protocol this is what it
would like to look like so if we look at
the top here and we have we want to get
the status of our webdriver API we need
to send it some options the first
parameter of all the all the functions
in this in this API takes the first
argument is a record containing all the
options we have for this this command in
this case we only need one option namely
where is the webdriver
server we are talking to you and we get
back some sort of a structure describing
the status and the version we are
running on the server and next thing is
the important thing we want to start
sessions and starting a session means
basically starting a browser which you
can interact with again the only only
options we need is where is the server
which we want to talk to and we also
need to describe what sort of browser do
we want to have and in the webdriver
capabilities module there are default
instances of of the some of the major
main processors yep yep yep yep that's
intentional and it automatically
converts between binaries and and drinks
and the JSON library uses binaries for
all the strings and after forgetting
about writing it as a binary few times I
made it except both yeah maybe you
should get your head right rather than
being lazy but I don't know now so yes
as you as you see you get the you get
the session ID back here and that's the
identification string you need to pass
on to all successive commands and
identifying this session saying that
this is the browser I want to interact
with and then finally we have oh yeah
sorry the second thing I you also get
back the capabilities of the browser you
you actually got so up here you can
decide to describe what capabilities
you'd like and here is what you actually
got and so in this case we've got
something where you can you can fiddle
with ssl certificates if you want to but
you can't directly connect to the
browser and it's a Chrome browser
no that's all built into the chrome
driver which is the server side of this
and so I just identify I start that
server somewhere on my machine or
remotely and it has to run a report then
it's just the normal no no it has a
separate channel and that's all
automatically set up within it and
finally I also show you how you can
actually navigate to a URL and here you
see this gets a bit tricky you need to
pass in both the URL of the server and
the session so this is obviously we need
to need to wrap this in something
because this is not something what to do
now we can navigate to page you just
give the patient here you see I did
remember to to put it in a binary it
might even be that these parameters you
actually have to write the API is a bit
fuzzy still that's a lot of typing and
you would only do that once and then you
would look at the wrapper instead and we
do basically the same thing here we
start a session the first thing we give
to it is a name which we will then use
to identify this session instead of
having this long binary or but long
string to identify it and we still need
to tell it words the service located but
we only need to tell it once and again
we to tell us what browser do we need
and we get back okay and a page which is
a bit of a giveaway that's how we
wrapped it of course we create a gen
server and so that's where it's residing
and then we can start interacting with
it we set the URL using the name and the
page and then we can start interacting
with that page by finding elements
sending values here I'm navigating to
Google and try to search for a line user
conference
I kept forgetting the exact dates of the
conference I have searched for this more
than once and then we can also submit
that form and it will if you get back
the page try to laughter doing that you
see that we've actually been searching
something and still that's bit of typing
and I I ambition that would you start
using this for real you would build
further utility libraries on top of this
where you would compose a couple of
these operations into into larger larger
units but we stopped at this level for
for now at least and this is all on
github I put it there monday I think and
after having hacked furiously over the
weekend to get it finished I got
sidetracked a few times with the other
project it's not the very fancy project
there is make file but it doesn't do
much more than compiling your stuff and
gather it in a directory if you want to
install it in your airline environment
you need to copy that that library
yourself into your Allen lip and it's
all waste under the MIT license so
you're free to do whatever you would
like with it if you like it if you find
some problems and you fix them I would
be really glad if you contributed them
back but you absolutely don't have to so
that's a bit what I've been doing now
that's the main announcements but now I
would like to spend a few more minutes
to talk about what can we do with this
it's all nice that we can script our
browsers but we already had the selenium
selenium language to do that and the
selenium IDE to do that so of course our
Anglet lace is to be able to write the
quickcheck types of tests for your web
services and then interact with them
using this library and and I'm not sure
everyone has heard about quick trick but
quick trick is a testing tool
all regionally developed by John use and
Carson at Chalmers and it's about
property based testing so instead of
writing concrete test cases for for your
systems you write properties and from
those properties the properties will
describe how your system works and that
property will also act as an Oracle test
Oracle so you can create many different
tests from that property and random and
check that the the outcome is the
expected one and the key thing here is
that it's all random but it's controlled
the randomness is controlled by
describing quite carefully how you would
like to generate your your random values
and it also does shrinking and so
whenever you start generating random
things it's a good you have a good
chance of generating something that's
fairly big before you you find your find
your errors so there is likely to be a
bit of noise in your in your in your
test cases and we try to shrink that
away before presenting the user with the
final test case that your your software
fails and quick check is implemented in
in many languages originally it was in
Haskell but since then I've seen
implementations in C and Java and Scala
and I think there's something in Python
as well but we do a line so we have a
quick check implementation in a line
which has expanded quite a lot from the
original ideas we the main perhaps the
main extension is the possibility to do
a finite state machine testing and but
we've also done additions like the user
level scheduler pulse where you can use
to find race conditions and we can do
some symbolic test case generation
lately we've been adding support for
mocking and you can mock directly from
from your from your mobile you can moxie
and I erlang and more or less
automatically
this is not the mopping framework stand
alone but it's together with the tests
it works pretty nicely and we have
support for for interfacing directly to
Z code so we can you can also test your
C code and we have just labels added
some composable components where you can
write state machines as components which
you can later that compose so of course
my first use of quick check and and
webdriver together was to test that
implementation i just presented so I did
write something of course I tested with
with quick check and so to do that I
inserted the the normal data generators
I needed and I created a few web pages
which I knew the content off so that you
could navigate to pages and you can find
elements of those pages and you know
whether that data was there or not and I
built a little a little state for my my
browser and my pages in order to know
exactly what each command was was
supposed to do and then all i do is i
generate a long sequence of webdriver
commands and I execute them and I see
that the browser doesn't crash doesn't
hang that the server doesn't hang and
that this replies I get back or are they
expected once during this I had hit
quite a few quirks in my implementation
in the tests in the server-side
implementations in the Lego to be part
of the things and also no may know and I
were no problems in the browsers plus a
the barristers themselves for the best
behaved components of this and and it's
also of course I'm possible to play back
counter example if you have sequence of
these webdriver commands you can tell a
quick check to run this sequence again
and you will see
in the browser exactly what's happening
when it's when it's get stuck and I did
my tests running running Linux I used
chrome firefox and htmlunit HML unit is
a headless headless browser so it's
there for for this kind of testing its
implemented in Java you you can it is a
browser but you can't see the page so
you test the Dom tree and everything yes
and not too much oh yeah yeah no that
don't be another candidate I guess to do
the same thing yes and it's very
convenient when you run your tests
because starting a browser takes
hundreds of milliseconds and running a
test in headless browser takes
milliseconds so you can run hundred
times the more tests really and you can
do other things while you run your tests
that that's also quite good when you
start running these sorts of tests
there's windows popping all over your
your screen which makes the computer you
unusable for anything else during the
tests so but that's easily solved this
by a second computer but you can do that
as well and i will use the drivers which
for current two weeks ago just noted the
numbers down here and and as i said i
did find some problems here and there
and i will i will quickly show you a few
of them because it's a bit interesting
to see my main question nowadays
whenever I see a specification which
this wire protocol is and whenever I see
you specification I my first question is
how hard can it be to follow a
specification and the general answer is
it is very hard no one manages and in
this case this is this is almost funny
because the selenium guys and they are
now talking about standardizing web
browser api which you see is doing a
standardization task on this
and the standard is more or less their
implementation so they've described
their implementation but they got it
wrong in the specification they say
whenever you create a session you return
a 303 see other HTTP response but they
don't they return a 302 redirect
response instead okay the net result is
the same you're going to fetch that page
but if they intended to return three or
two why what's real three in the
specification and in this case I even
think that the specification was written
after the code so yeah get it right and
second problem the previous problem was
in in the selenium server this is in the
chrome driver which is the Chrome's
standalone version of the same thing
everyone familiar with the HTTP RFC
knows that the header fields they are
not case sensitive the chromedriver guys
doesn't know about that and they were
told about it two years ago in a bug
report it's the third bug report of that
project they now have a couple of
thousands but they didn't really care so
it's still there and took me an hour to
figure out what what's wrong it worked
with selenium and sent the same thing to
chrome and they they just barked at me
mm and then I ran into a problem in
within inside the island OPP and I use
htpc request because I don't do anything
fancy really I thought and but it turned
out that the the ultimate automatic
redirection was broken again the the
standard is pretty clear on what you
should do whenever you get a request on
that which response is a three or 3g our
see other you should really do a get on
that URL you get back
but in the case of a 303 and the
combination with the post something went
wrong and we fixed it and sent the patch
it was included in our 16 and but that
just exposed a problem with how the
redirection link was computed so I had
to revert back to my my fixed version
anyway and next problem i ran into and
whenever you use the chrome driver if
you maximize your window twice it has
arguably it's not the very constructive
thing to do and if the window is already
maximized it won't be bigger by
maximizing it again but it's the typical
thing that that quick chick would try
it's the typical thing that developers
gets wrong so it's a quite a good
showcase for that I will quickly show
you what this looks like in in where did
my window go here so if i run this test
i have a model of this and i will see if
we can find the problem oh I hit it
immediately and that was maybe not what
I intended but ok I have my property and
I'm now creating lots of sequences and I
have postconditions checking that the
return values are the intended ones in
this case since the backend server
actually hangs I get in get a timeout
well you see in between the flashing
windows and this is what I said about
popping windows up now it's not very
easy to do anything with your computer
right now it's time to get a coffee and
when you get back you you re-run the
last trunk counterexample you will see
exactly what the porter problem is and
we generated a sequence of 16 different
commands here and
now trying to take away everything
that's not really crucial it should be
done soon I think we need a demo mode
for quick check where you know how it
drinks yep there it is perfect i just
talked long enough and it's done and so
eventually it shrinks down to what you
could expect you start the session in
this case we use selenium and chrome you
maximize the window and your maximized
again and you get a time so the solution
is easy just don't do it and it is even
the case that in the new version they've
just started they've just release the
beta version of chrome driver too and
they've actually nice to fix this there
so that's bug report a actually read and
and this just showing how i fix this in
my model i added a precondition saying
that okay if i've already maximized the
window don't try to do it again if I'm
running with chrome and selenium so and
yes as I said it this is all fixed in in
chrome priority still then chromedriver
to also has their problems this is
another of those no saint Esther would
ever test this if you open a window and
you open the second window your focus
back on the first window and try to take
a screenshot and that fails if you close
the other window in the background do
nothing it's okay to take the screenshot
if you focus back to the first window
it's okay to take the screenshot if you
kill the first window and take a
screenshot of the second one it's also k
yep this one this problem in chrome
driver I've reported this one yes
and yeah yeah I should tell them and I
just finished this a couple of days ago
I haven't really had time to market it
but that would be a good idea that mean
they would need to buy a quick shake
license as well so it's a good marketing
anything absolutely right there were
some other problems as well mostly
things which were not implemented in one
of them boring one some of the browsers
didn't support all of the options and so
how do we envision actually using this
and we what we want to do is to write
the stand ovals standard the way we
usually write tests with state machines
sequences of commands to two different
systems and we want to do the same to
use the same technology for web services
because it's working and so we built
this this library and we msi said we
envisioned to build more utility
libraries on top of it too to make some
things even simpler to search for a
certain kind of of elements to fill out
forms automatically and and that kind of
things and we also have had some ideas
alex has been prototyping to integrate
this with the selenium ID such that you
can record your test cases and translate
them directly to e unit tests if you
want to build a line test suite for for
something which if you have been doing
your web system in a line it's nice to
also have some some tests which you can
run as part of your normal normal test
suite which includes actually firing up
a browser and and during the protest
project we have some interesting
interesting research going on where we
try to derive state machines so writing
that quick check state machine is a bit
of work and you need to think a bit but
we do some research on trying to
generate the state machine or at least a
skeleton of the state machine or at
least the first version of that state
machine automatically from your from
unit tests and
I'm looking forward to actually test
this more thoroughly on on this I'm not
really convinced it's going to work
great but it might give you something
you can start from saving you from from
doing that first bit of of of
prototyping so that's what we what we
hope to do and I think that's more or
less what I had to have to tell you and
if you want to play with it this is the
this is the place and as I said it's
yours to do whatever you like with but
if you use it and find some problems
with it please let me know it would be
fun to to integrate that back into to
actually have this improving to
something what we can that we can
actually use so that be I'll be awesome
thanks wait thank you very much do we
have any questions Stewart or nests
really excellent stuff I think it will
be extremely useful one question you
used an API towards some server they
have mmm selenium has a part of their
the selenium server has this API so you
can place so have you looked into
replacing that server and go straight to
the browser interfaces or is it that
would mean doing different stuff for
different browsers and that sounds okay
so different integrations yeah so this
is yeah I like this it's one interface
to all the browsers I mean that would be
at awesome that will challenge for you
that would be a challenge you would
probably make it more efficient but I'd
not sure it worth the time because they
they they bend it down and they quickly
they are they're progressing quite
rapidly there's a new browser version
every six-week nowadays and keeping up
with that would be I would be hard so
it's it's better to let someone else do
it
so I got two questions so number one so
what's your opinion on the selenium
stuff is it good or is it bad I think
it's good because they they've done as I
said they would it works for many
different things and I'm moving forward
and it's alive its alive yeah it's very
much alive they've supported when the
Firefox version 20 whatever it was 21 I
say Martha they support for days later
or so so question number two so what's
your quick plan here is it to go forward
and actually make a product that I mean
so my company we we have exactly these
needs we have a web application and we
need to test it so would we be a typical
customer I hope so we will we have the
problem is we have no experience with
testing web services with quick check we
don't know what techniques we should use
but we need this in order to start
experimenting okay so let's try cut give
us a couple of months and we will we'll
have an answer okay first customer is it
possible with this too there might be a
limitation in the webdriver to test with
multiple browsers simultaneously I think
you may have mentioned that so you can
have chrome IE and firefox running the
tests at the same time so that no that
would not be a problem I for the demo I
limited this to one with session at the
time but you can have many sessions and
each session can pick your its own
browser so because I mean obviously in
web development you sort of have this
matrix of Chrome Firefox ie multiple
versions of each makes you want to pull
your hair out and number do a front-end
development again yeah but let's I can
quickly show you this my generator for
the moment I've put zero on all the
browsers I didn't want in this case but
normally when i run my test the first
thing that quick quick check selects is
which browser and which driver to use so
I when I'm running this test suite I'm
randomly picking your browser so
I'm running all of them to have any more
questions as far as I understood
webdriver is free open source and yep
quick check is not know and from from
the test from the driver I see that
you're using pretty much standard two
quick check which is equivalent to
proper statham any quirks I have to know
I mean is that is there a limitation so
I can't use it with proper I don't think
I didn't notice i have no idea I'd never
use proper so what do okay I'll just
look at it ya know anybody else all
