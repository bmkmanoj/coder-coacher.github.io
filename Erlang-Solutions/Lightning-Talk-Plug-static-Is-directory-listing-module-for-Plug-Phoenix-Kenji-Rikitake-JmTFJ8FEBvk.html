try to although I'm criticized for the
native speakers which they are speaking
of more than 200 will permit us that's a
that's a complete waiver for me so I'm
gonna talk to slow down okay hi I'm Ken
G this is me in front of Pier 45 and
what I'm going to talk about is a
directory listing something like this
this is a your screen and I really want
to have this an elixir with plug and the
Phoenix but the problem is I found
nothing nothing in the web nothing in
the Google and nothing in there extra
form so I try to manage to make a new
module Phoenix uses prop static and prog
static can't handle the static at those
static directory it's for it's obvious
and but one thing different is that prac
static does not handle directory
wristing so and the plug has a very
simple pipeline structure if if it can't
do anything it just roll it just rose or
the connection to the next prop module
and that is very convenient because if
the file is not found control is
transferred to the next book so adding a
module listing the right directory looks
promising to realize this so if you
don't find it you gotta invent it anyway
so writing from but writing from the
code from scratch is very hard because
just showing the directory content so
directory stuff is actually very
complicated you got first get direct
listing here pick up the salt algorithms
identifier from get query parameter get
far out abuse and show them and keep
them chief - Chosin - Chosin salt
algorithm in the URL so that you can
switch the salt direction or by time by
filename or whatever so result
I mean I may actually made up my own
plot mojo mostly copied from Prague vlog
static well what I do is that exactly
what I'm saying that first I put the
Prague static in front beat so that the
static file will be served first and
next if it isn't a file it will analyze
the past and show the directory listing
instead so this is what you get and no
icons but the reason why I didn't put
icons because serving them require the
own directory folder icons this screen
still looks like yours and I like it
very much and I appreciate use people
give the BSD license for this so on
there's not no license conflict with the
Apache 2 license of plug so these are
promised at us you can get in on a hex
or the source code on github so thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
