fun and profit first a little bit about
myself my name is Renee which is also my
handle on the social media mostly github
and Twitter I spell it with a triple r
in the beginning which you can easiest
Lee remember if you try to read it out
loud in pirate voice three times in a
row like most of you I'm a coda by trade
and for the last 15 years I've been
working for a company called neo Polly
we once were Java shop who then got
interested in Ruby and today we're a
ruby shop who is getting interested in
this little language called Alexia we
make games and we use these languages to
provide customized gaming experiences
for the world's leading brands like
coca-cola panini and the German
Bundesliga the usual pluck if that
proposition sounds anything like
interesting to you then by all means
feel free to talk to me now in the
future or visit us on the interwebs now
next to working on the services we
provide for our customers I've always
been fascinated by building tools to
make our jobs at neo Polly easier and
this pet peeve of mine also carried over
him to my open source work we've got
with regards to Alexia I started
building tools just a few weeks after
discovering the language at the time I
was already running a small service
called inch CI which let's you evaluate
your inline code documentation you can
put your project in and it tells you
where to improve your docs this was
originally designed for Ruby and in 2014
i added a client for alexia which was
the first language additionally to Ruby
that it could evaluate then in 2015 I
really wanted to get into Phoenix so I
called up the usual suspects and the
elixir community and together we set out
to build a tool where alchemists of all
skill levels could present what they had
created new projects blog posts or
version update
to their hex packages after a few weeks
of work alexia status calm went live and
finally in late 2015 early 2016 I built
the code analysis tool that I'm going to
talk about today by the way all of these
are open source so you can go to the
respective URLs look at the services and
if you want to know how how the sausage
is made so to speak you can find a link
to the github repositories right there
so let's start with a little excursion
about code analysis so that we're all on
the same page here what a static
analysis it is basically the analysis of
code by just looking at it the opposite
would be to run the code and look at it
while it is running using static
analysis we can find out all kinds of
interesting things like unused variables
or somehow not properly formatted
modules but there are of course limits
for example we can't make any meaningful
performance benchmarks while just
looking at the code but let's look at
some code now here we have a function
called run API call which takes two
parameters list and mode and mode has a
default value of new maybe without even
knowing it every one of you has already
used static analysis because the
compiler warnings are a result of this
kind of analysis and if we compile this
code we would probably get two warnings
for example if we always provide the
second parameter mode when we call our
function we would get a warning that the
default arguments in line 11 are
actually never used and we see in line
12 that our variable options is
initialized but never used and the
compiler has us covered here so how do
we analyze code like this we can do this
by converting the code we have written
into what's called an abstract syntax
tree or a st for short in alexia most
code translate into a triplet a three
element to
of operation meta information and
arguments we can see how this works by
looking at a trivial example the sum of
two numbers here the operation is plus
the meta element contains the MP the
information not relevant for the codes
execution such as line numbers and the
arguments to the plus operation or the
last element of the tableau which is one
and two so you have to think of this
from the inside out in a way you always
have to think of the operation first and
this becomes even more apparent in a
slightly more complex example when we
pipe the number 42 into the inspect
function what we get is a bit more
complex but follows the same simple
route we get a triplet for the pipe
operation we get the two arguments which
are the left and right of the pipe 42
and the inspect call and the inspect
call is an operation of its own so it
also gets to be a triplet and you can
see how the operation is always the
first element of this 3 element to pool
and the argument arguments are always
the lost getting started with this in
the elixir is extremely easy because the
standard library provides a function to
convert a string into an AST or into
quoted form as it's called and with this
we can build code analysis tools in fact
there are lots of static analysis tools
out there using this kind of analysis
there's probably one for every popular
language in Ruby we have robocop and
patent we have Piland JavaScript there's
es 'land amongst others so we do we have
something like this in alexia turns out
we do dogma is a project started with
the intent to bring rubber crop to Alex
here it is still in development and has
lots of contributors including myself
basically most of these tools have
similar features and look quite similar
from the outside
this is what Dogma looks like it is
basically what you would expect we are
infecting 78 files the tool finds over
six hundred arrows and lists them every
one of the shown arrows corresponds to
basically rule in a style guide which
doc modifies the code against for
example we have an error for comments
which are not formatted right arrows
about functions which take too many
parameters and some errors about some
lines exceeding the length of 80
characters now I can imagine that you're
already getting a bit impatient it's
like Jesus he's talking for nearly 10
minutes and he's telling me everything
is already sorted out so what is the
problem here the problem has to lot to
do with the fact that today's developer
tools are mostly used in a very
technocratic fashion where there is
success and failure there's one and the
zero either two things you're totally
wrong or you're one hundred percent
right you either get shouted at a praise
there is no middle ground except there
should be the problem of this talk has a
lot to do with the question where do we
stand in Alexis development both in
terms of the language but even more in
terms of community it's about Alexis
recent rise from totally unknown to
still definitely unknown but mentioned
in hushed tones we're an extremely young
community and we can still shape how we
want to interact with each other and
what the overarching motive should be so
I ask myself what if I were young
programmer who just discovered alexia
who had read all the tutorials the
Phoenix guides the great books I would
have written my first non-trivial
program and finally decided to write
some code analysis on this to see how
can I could improve my code what's this
newcomer experience like with the
existing tooling and I'm exaggerating
here for the
matic purposes it's like getting yelled
at each line basically says you're just
raw as a part-time teacher I thought
maybe we can do this differently maybe I
can create a prototype of something
that's more of a tool for learning
rather than a tool for approval and
coincidentally josee tweeted something
around that time that really resonated
with me maybe you're wrong is enough for
talented singers and developers it is
really far from enough for the majority
of us we need guidance and I thought yes
that's exactly what I was thinking about
so the rest of this talk I'd like to
take you on a journey to see how that
prototype became crato let's create a
tool that gives guidance a cool a tool
which mentis people and to do this the
first thing that I want to address is
issues are not created equal it's not
one long in different lists let me show
you with some code let let's get back to
this example from before but this time
we will ignore the problems the compiler
already has pointed out but there are
till still two issues here both of which
will also be identified by the existing
tooling the first one is in line 11
where the function name breaks the
convention to write all function names
and snake case rather than chem okays
the second issue is on line 13 where the
variable list is piped into I or expect
this is potentially a leftover from a
debugging session it clutters standard
out and the expection can also be very
slow depending on what kind of data the
list variable contains so by their
nature these are not similar issues the
first one is about conventional code
familiarity and readability the second
one has real implications on the
execution of my program now I wanted to
create a tool that could not only
differentiate between the two
also tell me why there is an issue in
the first place to be able to do that we
need to categorize the issues our tool
finds and for this we basically have to
come up with some useful categories and
here are the five that I came up with
readability issues basically thinks not
affecting the program execution all
logical reasoning more or less just
things annoying to read software design
a category for structural and planning
related things like dublicate code alias
usage or simply to do comments
refactoring opportunities where the code
we wrote is correct and works but past
experiences teacher that we could make
it easier to understand and much more
maintainable and then there's
consistency checks you know how wars
have been fought over the question
whether to use soft tabs or hard taps to
indent code with credo you don't have to
choose sides but rather adhere to a
consistent style throughout your code
and all is good and finally we have
warnings which are issues that actually
impact our application at runtime at the
chord who I owe inspect was an example
of this great but now that we have all
these categories I still think that even
within a singer category not all issues
are exactly created equal let me again
show you with some code here we have a
module with to module attributes github
base URL and get up sample URL there are
two issues here in lines two and three
the problem in line two is that the
module attribute name is once again not
written and snake case but rather in
camel case and the problem in line three
is that it exceeds a maximum character
limit typically 78 or 80 characters and
these two issues are not created equal
although they are in the same category
for me the first one is a potential
issue well the second one is
well maybe so i think these issues just
have different priorities for me and
that is exactly what we need next two
categories issues need to be prioritized
these priorities can be simple numerical
values with higher numbers indicating a
higher priority so when we detect a list
of issues we can order that list by its
priority values what you see here are
all the priority values we found during
analysis and the gray bars next to the
numbers show how many issues there are
with any given priority and this is just
for illustration purposes the issues we
discussed up until allah would be in
here somewhere and surprisingly the
warning about io inspect is one of the
high priority issues the function name
written in camel case is there as well
as the issue where a line exceeded the
maximum character limit now we can cut
this list to decide which issues are
important enough to show up in a regular
report for example all issues with a
positive priority and this will exclude
all issues with a negative priority from
this report we can see how one of the
readability issues just dropped out of
the regular analysis and this is by
design since you can choose each checks
priority in the configuration and this
way the regular report only shows your
priority issues but of course sometimes
we want to get the full picture and that
is where the strict report comes into
play the strict report includes all
issues the only exception being issues
which are marked with priority minus 100
which is a magic number so we're done
with the fundamentals each issue has a
category and a priority and we can build
richer analysis based on those two
dimensions before showing you the
finished project I'd like to take one
last detour to highlight my favorite
check category consistency checks
I mentioned before that there is a check
which determines whether you are using
soft tops or hot tubs in your project it
will ensure that those are used
consistency and there is no more need
for flame wars but I'd like to show you
two more examples let's take this double
it's it's at Apple with three elements a
one a string and true and you can write
this temple in two ways firstly you can
write it without spaces inside the
braces or you can ride it with spaces
inside the braces and the point is that
the only personal preference it simply
does not matter as long as you apply it
consistently throughout the whole code
base cradle will not care because it's
your choice but we don't have to stop
here we can go beyond cosmetics and look
at naming patterns in Alexia we can find
define exception modules which are
basically the equivalent of runtime
exception classes in other languages we
see two examples here bait bat HTTP
header and user request error and now
several style guides advise you to
choose error as a consistent suffix for
the name of these modules but why not
lame them exception in the end
especially since the macro is called def
exception so we could have bad head HTTP
header exception and user request
exception I even discovered open source
projects which did not use consistent
suffixes but rather prefix invalid HTTP
header and invalid user request the
point being this should be fine only if
there is no consistent prefix or suffix
no common naming scheme for these
exception modules then the consistency
check will fail and this is why I like
consistency checks instead of enforcing
an outside standard you look at existing
code and derive this practiced standard
from that with this we can now finally
talk about the command line interface
and how to use cradle first you have to
add creator as a dependency to your
mixed configuration then you call mixed
steps get and you can run it by typing
mix crate oh and this is what it looks
like and you can clearly see the
different categories with their distinct
colors you can also see that only the
top priority issues for each category
are shown and out of them only the top
three so you get a nice report and the
the terminal is not cluttered with 600
issues you can of course tweak this
report to your liking you can say i want
to see all issues at once you can say i
don't want them by category but rather
by on by file name you can use the
strict mode we talked about where also
the low priority issues will be
displayed and you can have both report
where you also see the code which it
talks about or complains about but I
think screenshots rarely do any software
justice you really have to experience
this experience this yourself with your
own use case to decide whether or not
this is useful for you so I just want to
highlight one more nice feature for each
of the issues you also see a fire name
colon the line number colon the column
the location for the issue and you can
copy paste that location behind the
Creator command and when you do that it
gives you an explanation about that
specific issue so it tells you where the
issue originated what category and
priority it is which the the code in
question that it complains about and it
tells you why it matters it says in this
case modules should have a module dog
tag and why it matters every module
should contain comprehensive
documentation many times
or two in plain English it's explaining
why the module exist will suffice
documenting your train of thought this
way will help both your co-workers and
your future self so it tries to teach
you something and explain the reasoning
behind it and even better in this case
it also teaches you how to opt out
because later it says in some cases
however you might not want to document
things about a module sings since elixir
prefers explicitness / implicit behavior
you should tag these modules with module
dog falls to make it clear that there is
no intention and documenting it so it
really tries to teach you something so
where do we go from here there are a lot
of small and not so small aspects of
credo that I could not really fit into
this talk and I want to name a few the
explanations I just showed you well with
over 40 checks cradle is the most
expensive code analysis tool for elixir
and these explanations i just presented
are really the bread and butter of the
learning experience of the understanding
and i think we can still improve those
actually there is currently an open
issue and get up making a great
suggestion how to modify both a check
antics explanations so i think this is
really an area where we can use some
work and value contributions very much
there is a complementary style guide for
creator which follows a less dogmatic
approach than other guides like all sty
guides it shows you a preferred way how
you could or should do things but it
also shows up a valid approaches you can
apply which are also all recognized by
cradle we do have editor support for
emacs through flightcheck and somebody
already built an item editor plugin i
don't think there is one for sublime
text yet but if anyone wants to do that
just ping me on github there is a
configuration mechanism so you can
configure cradle on a per project basis
and you can configure which files it
should run against and
files to exclude and which pair which
check takes which special parameters etc
but we also have something for the cases
where you say okay there is this check
and I think that's probably a good thing
to have but in this one case i would
like to ignore the issue that comes up
and for this we have introduced the lint
attribute which works a bit like the doc
attribute where you can say doc falls to
say this should not be documented and
with lint you can say this function
should not be limited or this function
should not run for this particular check
in this one case which you should use
rarely and with the upcoming release
odot for custom checks are finally
coming so this way you can define your
own in company checks and run them
alongside kratos standard checks
utilizing all of kratos analysis
framework and this is part of a larger
attempt to create more than code
analysis tool box rather than a classic
code linter the goal has always been to
combine teaching and learning and user
experience and interface design so we
can have a professional to that give
straight results but still treats you as
a human being so to give you my final
thoughts it's true that elixir is still
definitely unknown but mentioned in
hushed tones and I think we're doing a
pretty good job of onboarding new
developers with all the tutorials all
the Phoenix guides all the fantastic
books and with credo I'm hoping to make
a small contribution to this sentiment
of openness in our little community
that's it
so let's have some Q&amp;amp;A
you know so it tries to derive the most
common human namings naming scheme for
example so that's I think the the one
you're referring to so it collects all
your exception module names it tries to
find a pattern which is also why it it's
just valid after it found I think three
or five of those so it can say I have a
chance of having a majority use and then
it's basically what you implied so it
just says this one does not follow the
thing you seem to be doing
and like there's nothing correctness in
the code so the question is what you
mean with correctness of code because as
far as my understanding goes and I'm a
self-taught programmer so I sometimes I
feel a bit inferior to read a computer
scientist but we have a compiler in
alexia so if there's something really
incorrect I would trust that their
compiler errors or compiler warnings I
would also suggest to everybody that you
use makes compiler warnings as arrows
because that keeps your code really
clean and nice there are some things in
a cradle that I did not present which go
for example in the refactoring space
when you have a check wave heaven unless
just like in Ruby and then you make
unless and an else block then it
complains because it says okay you have
unless condition else and that block
gets executed when the condition is not
not mad and it tells you things about
that and these we can derive really
easily so i don't know if that answers
your question we also have a some checks
where you for example map a list and
then that is neither saved into a
variable nor returned and because it's
immutable that mapping is just lost then
it will warn you about that so it sits
in the middle ground between something
that's incorrect but also something
something that really relate to to your
programs execution maintainability the
code at large beyond cosmetics
maybe we can talk afterwards in more
detail so that's interesting you're
talking about a Phoenix project and I
really thought some tools have that I
think Robocop has railed specific um
checks and I also think maybe we can
have a special configuration that you
run on Phoenix projects because it
already can take a different
configuration so you could make one
configuration the set in your project
that says this is a default and then you
could have one that follows different
routes and we could simply configure
things differently for Phoenix projects
so the short answer would have been yes
there is something plans
so there there are none no plans at this
point I I see what you're getting at and
that's definitely something I would want
to concern myself with past 10 so there
is a road map actually on github how
Creator wants to get to 1 dot 0 because
my my past open source project mostly
they reached version 0.7 and that was
basically wondered oh so for create oh I
have published how I think the road map
21 rato should work but things like that
are not yet in there which does not mean
if somebody has ideas that I would not
change the road map so it changed three
times already because of input from the
outside where people brought up issues
literally on get up made an issue we
started discussing and then we came up
with a viable solution so maybe we too
could just talk afterwards again and get
into more detail
so you mean like an auto correct mode
that's a bit hairy because so I could
imagine that so I would not want to
stand here and say that is never going
to happen like the late Steve Jobs said
iPods with videos on them will never
happen and one year later we got them
but you would have to correct the ast
and then transform that back into code
which is super easy but then you would
keep the kind of idiosyncratic
formatting the programmer has applied in
the first place so your code would
change dramatically with auto correct so
it's possible but we will have to see if
we can find a way to make it to make the
basically the diff between the two
versions as small as possible
yes so I really think that the camel
case naming would be something where we
could offer it but I'm a bit resistant
to to implement that just because it's
easy and then everybody will demand it
for more complex cases as well but it's
also something that we will happen the
probably will have in the future so can
i order something to eat at around one
o'clock
not yet but that's also one thing that
there i will make a promise one day
Kreator were also concerned with type
annotations but it's also not yet in the
in the plan for one dot zero because i
actually want to deliver 10 this year
and next to so most of you maintaining
packages and open source project in
general know how our unglamorous it is
so you have you have a day job your
family you're always steal away one or
two hours from weekends and possibly
time with your spouse just to fix that
back or get that next release out so the
priority really is to make a really
working packages to fix all the issues
I've really seen an uptake in issues
which are reported which is really great
so we can have 10 which just works works
as expected and then we type annotations
definitely alright so this is the this
will be shameful because i haven't
successfully used dialyzer yet so yes
and I I tried it and i'm not sure if it
was me or so or all the tool i was i had
like an hour and i tried it out because
Joseph Cain had written about it in his
blog serious learning Alexia and I did
not get it to work but it's probably
because like I said I'm not a real
computer scientist don't
exactly kids without eyes of war see me
they booked my phone and give party
and I think there's actually a lot of
value in that because what i did not get
into in the actual talk was how I was
also Empire inspired by really good
error messages around elixir around
actor Phoenix Elm the M compiler is
amazing and telling you what you did
wrong and how to fix it and there I see
an opportunity for the whole community
or even for my work inside my own
company that I try to make error
messages as meaningful as possible
because actually okay something went
wrong and all not all is in vain because
you actually have an opportunity to talk
to a person when you write an error
message so
so I might consider that you could
submit an github issue oh my god there's
also an issue which says on if you have
a behavior in the module that it checks
if all those functions are defined and
that's also something I i think yes
that's a very viable concern
