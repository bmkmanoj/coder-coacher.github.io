we have been working on an optimization
algorithm in arilinn and we made efforts
to paralyze it and scale it up so in the
next couple of minutes we would like to
tell you about the result of our work
first we'll start with the description
of the algorithm that we used its
different documentations will present
our scanning results and the issues that
we encounter during that and they'll
look we'll end up with some conclusions
and potential advising so our algar is
called ms it means an evolutionary
multi-agent system and it's in it is an
intersection of multi-agent systems and
evolutionary algorithms for those of you
who are not familiar with multi-agent
systems these are modeling interactions
between autonomous beings called agents
which are performing some computation
synchronously they have their own aims
and knowledge so the data is
decentralized and there is no global
control agents can message each other
and communicate using messages as for
the evolutionary algorithms this is the
general schema of a virtually algar it's
the class of algorithms which is
inspired by phenomena occurring in the
nature and it basically consists of
constant array directions on a
population and updates to the population
which composes of the evaluation of
fitness of the agents then selecting
some subpopulation of the agents which
skirt from some action and then putting
them back to the pole in some way as I
said Emma's engine optimization
algorithm it can be used for solving
hard problems like scheduling for
example job-shop problem that auto news
agents represent hypothetical solutions
and the fitness value is how composed
the solution is in the practical problem
the competition is decentralized so
therefore it is easily paralyzed able
and how it works it's basically a one
iteration here this explained every red
circle is representing an agent which
can choose one of four actions right
depth migration reproduction and fi
involves two agents which which compared
their fitness values and the stronger
one drains some energy from their weaker
one so it becomes more powerful and can
reproduce more often a depth removes an
agent from the population Pole and
migration moves an agent to another
population and a reproduction takes two
agents and mixes them to be some
offspring and then put them back to the
population pool and tennis uses a
concept of islands which are independent
instances of the same algorithm running
on we are in different instances running
the same computation but with different
data so agent kind agents can also move
between these populations using
migration and this concept helps
avoiding lockout getting stuck in the
local optima and paralyze Reggie so we
managed to develop four different
implementations of the aforementioned
algorithm all of them share the same
basic logic however they have a
different architecture and therefore
they scale a little bit differently so
the first one is a sequential version it
does not scale everything happens in
just one process and we use it mainly as
a reference point for all the other
implementations we have a coarse-grained
infinite ation which we like to call hit
written in this one every single island
is a separate process and the islands
communicate with each other through
message
passing we have a fine-grained
implementation where every single agent
is a separate process and finally we
also have an implementation also course
grade but this time using the scale
library I don't think we need to talk a
lot about scale because we had already
few presentations about it but it's a
basically it's a tool which enables the
programmer to easily paralyze his code
without worrying about all the
implementation details this is the
architecture of the core screen versions
so as I said each island is a separate
process which is completely isolated one
from another evolution happens in each
of those islands separately and if there
is a need for migration so we need to
transfer one agent from an island to
another we use message passing to do
this if although in the scale in this
kind of limitation we use ETFs tables
however it's just an implementation
detail so this is an extract from the
scale bass implementations then we have
this is most of the main workflow or our
program so those little skeletons with
second pipe and feedback atoms as you
can see these are the patterns that we
use a programmer is expected just to
provide a particular functions i
included only the one example function
shuffle one at the top so these function
and I should capture the basic logic
behind the program and then you can put
those functions into the skeletons and
create more complex structures so in
this example you have the pipe variable
and this variable represents one
iteration of the program that we have
been explaining and then we put the
whole pipe variable which as you can see
quite complex and we put it into the
feedback skeleton which makes it loop
then we put it inside the map skeleton
which makes it parallel and we don't
have to worry about starting processes
and stuff and finally this is the
fine-grained implementation that I've
been talking about so here every single
agent is a separate process and
there is no global knowledge in the
system therefore we need some way for
the ages to communicate and interact
with each other and this is why we
introduce arenas those rectangles these
are appropriate arenas so the idea is
that when an agent decides to perform a
particular action say he wants to
reproduce he sends a message to the
reproduction arena and the airiness get
messages from all all the agents from
holding virtual machine conserved from
all we all the agents in a particular
Island today arena that and they match
the edges with each other and they
didn't then perform the interaction
therefore agents don't have to know
about all the other agent on the other
they just won't need to know the
addresses of the arenas so let's talk
about scaling the testing function that
we use either is the rasputin function
with the formula from you you can see on
the slide and also you can see the graph
of the rescue function in two dimensions
this is multimodal it has many local
Optima so it is hard to optimize and
also i'm good for benchmarking purposes
we used the rational function with 100
dimensions and 64 islands animals the
testing with a structure was a problem
the academic computer center here at agh
university we use one single node with
64 64 cards so there is a belief that if
you have an airline program and you ran
from n course it should run n times
faster than on a single core but it's
not completely true from our experience
up to paint course the paralyzation is
achieved quite quite easily but when we
try to add more course we run into
problems it will describe now so this is
the first graph of our results it's like
drug speed up we dragged out to the
number of course and I don't know if you
see the Legos but the the most calendar
one is the hybrid model and it's not
close to linear which is the red dotted
line and the other models are
as you can see our are not scalable at
all after 16 curves or even I'd curves
so it was pretty bad let's we should
keep in mind that it is not a typical
around use case and usually the task
with Ireland is to administrate to
manage or communicate some components
not to perform some computation using
the most cpu power available so we
checked in on to several different
different things different approaches
and the tool that we gave us the best
results was scnt it's a toll that
another slot contention and lock
contention happens when a thread cat
tries to fret acquires some resource and
then under threat try to try to acquire
the same resource but and and it's
suspended and this told measures the
number of these collisions and regions
their job and so these are the results
that we got after using this l CNT tool
for our fine-grained model on the left
hand side i hope you can see the names
of the rocks that occurred most
frequently you also have the number of
trials in the number of collisions that
occurred and how much time it took and
also appropriate percentage and as you
can see the make ref lock was the most
significant one in most of the runs
maker croc is a lot that it comes up
when you need a globally unique
identifier and you have to call the
maker function and the other locks or
it's the time of day lock this one has
occurred when you when you need to
update time or set a timer around q
locke is connected to putting a process
into a particular run queue of a
scheduler and a pix lock is a general
lock of a process which protects it
several of these fields so the megadrop
was the most harmful one for us
we realize that if you want to make the
application scale we have to get rid of
it so thanks to our of health from Lucas
Larson that we got who is one of the
developers behind the virtual machine we
we managed to narrow down and locate
which particular lines of code are
responsible for this lock and it turns
out that we have quite a few gen server
processes and I in our application these
are the arenas that men should be about
and we used to communicate with these
arenas agents use the function which gen
server call which is supposed to be used
for a synchronous communication and it
turns out that this function depends
heavily on the maker function so when we
use it extensively we it turned out that
the lock was also occur very frequently
so we decided we have to substitute it
with the chancery casts it's a another
function but supposed to use mostly for
a synchronous communication below you
have the code or what we finally what it
looks like more like more or less after
the change and then we around the LC to
LC NT tool once again and these are the
results as you can see most of the other
lock are still locks are still there
however we managed to get rid of this
microphone which is good and another
major enhancement that we introduced it
was to have a new lover before we had a
longer that you have written ourselves
which didn't really perform very well
and we decided to substitute it with an
open library code examiner which is
available on github it's open and we
have quite a good experience with it
especially considering the feedback that
we got from the developers behind it and
one of the main reasons that we chose
this particular this particular
libraries that we wanted to get rid of
the maybe don't get rid of but
significantly reduce the time of day off
our previous logo depended on it
extensively and we were hoping that
examiner will will improve the situation
and generally you had a good experience
with this with this tool or we had big
one major challenge
push to monitor fitness in the minimum
fitness value in the system because
there is no global knowledge as we said
and we have many agents all over the
virtual machine and we want to find the
one with a minimum fitness value so we
had few times for that one was to use
the built-in histogram industry makes a
meter which didn't work for us very well
so we decided to write one ourselves
with the ETS tables and this also didn't
did it go very well and we ended up
using NYX and when we introduce myths
then the application finally started to
scale somehow so here on this chart I
hope you can see on the y-axis in of the
number of reproductions per second this
is a just a performance measure you can
think of it as a number of algorithm
iterations per second and the orange
line represents the other in performance
after those two changes that i told you
about so the performance increased and
it finally started scale so apart from
these changes in all of the models were
so into this one change in specifically
for the scale by skull base model as you
may know the data when sending when you
send a message in airline between
processes the data is copied in this
message and there is an exception for
regular binaries so scale is creating a
data stream process biggest processing
stream and this is a lot of processes a
lot of messages so it's quite expensive
and we changed our representation of an
agent from a list of floats to a binary
and it was a quite big improvement so
this is the graph of reproductions per
second with regard to the number of
course and the orange line is the
version that uses binaries and this is
an only changed it was switched between
this these two models so these are the
final results we can see that the
coarse-grained model hybrid model is now
close to linear and the other models
also improved significantly we can
notice that maybe the coarse-grained
model was a better fit for our case so
to sum up scaling around vertically is
is quite not very easy if you face a
similar task in the future you can try
some of these dips most of them were
explained earlier but you should also
keep your vm updated the development
behind the vm is is ongoing and we also
observed an improvement just by
switching the vm if you're in trouble
can also ask other people in their own
community reach out to them for example
on the airline KFC channel we're going
to fit it from this also we recommended
and we'll also will try to help you
there is some mean we also open source
this all software so if you would like
to give it a try well yeah the arenas
itself there were Jen servers there were
the behavior of virgin service so we we
were either could send a message
normally as with a bank in erlanger we
could use a gin server cast and Jennifer
kesse worked perfectly fine so we got
rid of this lock so it was completely ok
yeah all right
so why did you get a lot of time of day
Oh with the previous one with the
previous logger you mean oh so the our
previous logger worked he had to check
after almost every iteration he had to
call the function airlink now which uses
the time of day lock to check if it's an
appropriate time to send a message to
the logger so it depended heavily on
this and yeah and that's why the law
comes up very frequently so thank you
very much ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
