going to talk about this and some other
new things that we've been doing with
quick check but I want to start off by
asking everybody a question who here
really really loves testing okay that's
actually more than i usually get so for
most people testing it's it's not really
the thing you look forward to doing in
the morning it's rob more mature that
you have to get done so i want to think
a little bit about why that is why is
testing hard well suppose you're testing
some code and you've got let's say n
features to test you going to write
maybe three or four tests / feature
right that's called a realistic and
that's okay that's a linear amount of
work no problem but we all know that you
won't find all of your bugs if you do
that because some bugs only appear when
you test two features together some kind
of feature interaction so let's suppose
you want to test for all of those
possible bugs well now you'd have to
write a quadratic number of test cases
that doesn't sound so good and actually
you won't find all of your bugs if you
do that either because some bugs only
appear when three or more features
interact so who are we going to write a
cubic number of test cases for all
triples of features this is start is
really sound like a lot of work and it
doesn't even stop there so this is the
problem with testing you can't test
everything when are you going to stop
what's the answer simple don't write
tests
generate them and that is what quick
check does quick check has quite a long
history it dates back to nineteen ninety
nine when Coon class and that I came up
with the first version for Haskell in
2006 now then Thomas arts and i founded
cubic and to market an airline version
and since then we've added lots and lots
of extensions and we found lots and lots
of cool bugs all with variations on
random testing that's what the dice are
for so I'm going to start off by doing a
very simple example of quick check
testing and I want you to think back to
your first or second year data
structures course I know it was a long
time ago but nevertheless i'm just going
to use an example from that because it's
it's simple i'm going to test some code
for implementing binary trees ordered
binary trees so i'm going to represent
them in Erlang as either relief that's
just Madame or a node with two subtrees
and that's going to be a to pool with a
no tag and then a left subtree the value
in the node and the right subtree and
here are a couple of functions that I
want to provide on my trees to list just
converts the tree into an ordered list a
leaf is mapped to the empty list a node
you make a list out of by making lists
from the sub trees and concatenate them
together and here's the member function
very straightforward if you want to test
whether something as a member of a leaf
well it's not otherwise you compare the
thing you're looking up with the value
in the node and then if it's less than
you go to the left subtree if it's equal
where you found it and if it's greater
you go to the right very easy ok so
imagine we're testing these two
functions of course you could write some
test cases but I don't want to do that
what I'm going to do instead is show you
how we test it with quick check instead
of writing one or more test cases we
write a general property here's how the
property for testing these functions
might look so it's an airline function
definition the property of member says
not for any particular test case
but for all test cases with X that's the
value we're going to look up and T
that's the tree we're going to look in
so for all X and T that are generated by
that generator there and I'm going to
use an natural number and as test data
and a tree then it must be the case that
the equation on the next line it holds
so what I'm using here is I'm using the
lists member function as a model to
predict how the trees member function
should behave and I can do that because
luckily I have a function to convert a
tree to a list so I'm just going to
check that the answer that the tree
member function gives me is the same
answer as I would get if i convert the
tree to a list and then ask whether the
element is a member of the list okay so
I'm actually going to test this in front
of you let me run some tests and to do
that darn i was i'm going to have to
change my screen mode
come on yes so and so
okay good so here's the airline shell
I'll just compile my trees module you
can see that yes and now I'll call quick
check giving it that property as an
argument so this is what we do with
quick check we define the property as a
function and then we pass it to quick
check for testing and what do you know a
test fails and when a test fails what
quick check does is it shows us the
failing test case so here this line is a
randomly generated test case that failed
as you can see it's fairly long the next
thing quick check does is it tries to
shrink the test case to a simpler one so
that we have something simple to debug
we see that happening here where it says
shrinking and down here we have a case
we tested with a one was a member of
this tree and quick checks as false is
not equal to true that is the trees
member function return false the list
one returned true so that builds are
different and the test failed and if I
test this several times see you can see
that the random test case the quick
check first finds can be quite
complicated but after shrinking it down
we have a very simple one actually
they're always the same size they just
have two nodes in the tree so that's
good okay so how do I fix the bug well
I'm going to use the window shelter this
you may not have seen this technique
before I don't know if you can even read
that but I'm going to copy trees fixed
dollar over trees not Earl
okay did that work back to our lang let
me recompile my code and now rerun the
tests and now every one of those dots is
a passing tests so we can see lots and
lots of random tests are passing so
probably my code works now back to the
slides so what do we seen well we've
seen that quick check could find failing
test cases very easily and we've also
seen the shrinking which is tremendously
important when you're using random
testing like this random test cases
usually are much larger than they need
to be to provoke a failure usually you
get a random test case with a lot of
noise in it and just a few key elements
that provoke the failure random tests
contain a lot of noise because that is
their purpose but when you want to debug
a failure you don't want to see it you
want to see a test case that just
contains as much as as needed to cause
the code to fail we think of that as the
signal and the shrinking process
extracts the signal from the noise that
it's critical critically important okay
so now you've seen me find and fix a bug
but wait a minute what was the example
that failed you remember I bet you don't
I certainly don't so this is what are
the downsides of testing in this manner
that you don't have a permanent record
of your test cases so and if I wanted to
keep that test case and you know put it
into a regression sweet I would have to
have thought of that a few minutes ago
and I can't even be a hundred percent
sure that I fixed the bug maybe I was
just lucky the first time when click
check found it well okay you saw me
being lucky in that case repeatedly but
maybe I'm just being unlucky now how do
I know that the test case that failed
before is even being generated
so in reality when we run quick check on
real code we often don't find bugs well
at least after the code starts working
better we don't find bugs as quickly as
I showed you sometimes we run quick
check overnight and it may take hours to
find and shrink failing test case well
you don't want to just throw those away
this is where quick check CI comes in
now I wanted to show you a demo of quick
check CI at this point but you know what
it's a website and after playing with
the network a little bit I thought no
this is just unwise so no demo but a
virtual demo so bear with me here here
we are this is what quick check CI looks
like you just enter quick check CI com
into your browser and you come to this
page and there's a welcome message which
I'm sure nobody reads but then you can
click register your project which takes
you hear this comes to the project
registration page with a lot of
instructions which we know nobody reads
but right down at the bottom there's a
place where you can enter let's just
expand that zoom in a little bit there's
a place where you can enter a project
URL and these URLs must always be github
projects so if you have a github project
and you want to try this out just go
ahead so I enter the project URL there
and then click on register project and
we come here to the quick shake VI page
for this project this project has not
yet been built fine please cue a build
how do I do that look there's a button
to build Press that and after a motor to
we come here so this is what you see
when you run tests in quick jci up at
the top here we have a timeline with a
lot of doctors and every dot is a build
so that red circle there that tells us
that we've done one build and it's red
because the tests failed and then below
that we see more detail about which
tests failed and at this level we see a
list of modules there's only one module
in this project it's so simple and I can
see that test failed in the module trees
and then we can just drill down into
this let's click on trees and we see the
properties that i wrote i actually wrote
two properties I only showed you the
prop member prop ordered says that when
you convert a tree to a list you get an
ordered list so that just checks the
invariant on trees and that one passed
its green but prop member failed before
I look at the failing tests I want to
show you the coverage tool that we've
got you can see on each of these tabs
you can look at modules properties or
whatever but also coverage so let me
look at the coverage of the properties
for this module look I have a hundred
percent test coverage isn't that great
and if i click on trees then we come to
the coverage information so we've built
our own coverage tool which we think is
rather nice i'm sure most of you have
used cover that comes together with a
delay but that does have some
limitations some of which we've
addressed here so one of the nice things
here is that instead of needing to look
at the left hand side to see whether you
have a zero executions of a line or a
positive number here coverage is
color-coded so the green code has been
covered in the tests and what's more how
dark the shade of green is lets you see
visually which code has been tested a
lot and which code has been tested
little up at the top there there's a
scroll bar that you can scroll through
the file with and you can see where the
heavily tested code is and where the
less heavily tested code is and then if
you hover over a line here then you can
see okay prop ordered that's the
property I showed you that was called
once to create the property for testing
but it was passed a quick check if I
move the mouse down
this ordered predicate that was that was
called a hundred times and we can even
see that in two lists if I scroll down a
bit the first Clause was called 1200
times and the second Clause was used 960
x so you get very very detailed
information you can even see that it was
called 500 times from the prop ordered
tests and 435 times from the prop member
test so you can see which property
tested each line of code and you can
also see which parts within a line were
executed so that you get very fine-grain
information from the tool which we like
okay let's go back to the test results
so if I come back here this shows me the
properties and we see that Prop member
failed and if i click on prop member
then we see not one but a number of
failing tests and now if you like you
can look through those and you see on
the web page what the the test data was
so you can compare and see is there a
pattern but let's go to the first of
those tests and fix the problem okay so
if I open that now we come to a page
that shows the quick check out put just
as you saw when I ran the test in the
airline shell okay so now we can see I
was looking for the value 1 in this tree
containing a minus one of the one so i
could start look at my code and trying
to debug it but let me show you a neat
trick do you see there's a coverage
entry for this single test that'll show
me the coverage of just this test case
let's click on that oh this test case
only covered forty-four percent of the
code that's good I know the bug must be
in the covered code so let's look at the
file here it is and scroll down okay now
remember this is the coverage of a
failed test so red is good
and green is bad which claws and the
member function do you think is buggy
well obviously this one I know you
probably can't read that here's what it
says it says if x is greater than Y X is
what we're looking for why is the value
in the node if x is greater than look in
the left subtree it should be the right
subtree of course so that was my bug
okay so suppose I make this fix and I go
back to the interface and I rug q
another build what happens well we come
here you can see the second build has
appeared in the line of dots but it's
still red the test still failed did I
make any progress let's click down to
the properties prop member still fails
oh but now a bunch of examples have
passed so this is kind of nice one of
the things that can be a bit depressing
when you're using quick check is that
you run quick check it finds a bug you
fix it you're on quick check it says
here's a bug so you can't see that you
may progress but here we can all of
those test cases the quickcheck
previously found now pass but the second
one still fails so let's have a look at
that one
that's another tree with two nodes I'm
going to pull the same trick and look at
the coverage yeah forty-four percent
here's the coverage of the member
function look the other Clause is wrong
I am nothing if not consistent so I made
the same mistake they said well the
opposite mistake here so i need to
replace that by l and if i do that then
q another build this time tests go turn
green okay so um it's okay with we click
in we can see both properties past and
now all the test cases past let's just
look at the coverage that we've got now
now that all the tests are passing oh
dear it's only ninety seven point five
percent i had a hundred percent coverage
before what's gone wrong we have a look
at it oh look at the top there's one
piece of uncovered code that little red
bar where is it it's here inside a
shrink I'm not going to explain this in
detail but shrink lets us define code
that is only used to shrink failing
tests so if you don't have any failing
tests you're not going to use the code
that's why that's not covered okay so
now we've seen quick check see I in
action at least virtually and what does
it do for us well it builds a regression
test suite automatically that's nice for
two reasons it lets us see exactly which
tests we've managed to fix so we can see
what progress we're making and it also
if a test is hard to find so it's rarely
generated then it gets saved and it's
gets rerun in every future build unless
you disable it you can disable test if
you want but by default we now save rare
tests
and so errors that were hard to find we
keep testing for and the other nice
thing is that you get this coverage
information in a lot of depth you can
see at a glance what you have tested
because of this shading that we use you
can also see what you tested heavily and
what you test it lightly and since a
part of using quick check is tuning your
test case distribution so that you test
all your code well then that's very
useful information for doing that tuning
and finally as i showed you coverage
actually can help you find bugs it's not
just for producing a percentage to tell
your manager okay so how am i doing for
time all right i also want to show you
some more interesting testing more
interesting example state machine
testing which is fundamental to a lot of
the real testing that we do with quick
check but I'm again going to use a very
simple example the process registry so
I'm going to test two operations the
register operation and the unregister
operation but my test cases are also
going to need to contain cause to a
spawn function so that I have some pits
to register and quite often I need to
add some operations to my test cases
just as I have test data to test the
ones i really want to test this born
function is something I've written
myself it just spawns a zombie process
that can be registered and unregistered
okay so what what's different between
testing the process registry and testing
that little trees module the difference
is that these functions change the state
of the registry and I have to take that
into account in my tests now you may
also be wondering is the process
registry buggy well of course not I'm
not looking for bugs in the process
registry if I found one well that would
be brilliant but it's been around for so
long that I'm sure it works perfectly
fine what I'm going to do is I'm going
to reverse engineer the preconditions so
register and unregister they raise
exception sometimes there's a way you're
supposed to call them and I'm
figure out what that way is so I'm using
quick check isn't kind of program
understanding tool here so the way that
we test operations that manipulate state
like this is with a state machine model
our test cases are going to be sequences
of calls to the API derp if you wanted
to test the process registry of course
you're going to need to make a sequence
of calls but we also model the state of
the registry and we do that by defining
a state transition function on the model
for every operation so we're going to
neat we're going to know at each point
in the state what the contents of the
registry ought to be and then we write
post conditions that check that the API
calls returned correct results and then
when a test fails what are the things
that shrinking is going to do is it's
going to figure out which of these api
calls we're not needed to provoke the
failure so that we just get a short test
case that reveals what the problem is ok
I'm going to model the registry state
how will I do that I'm going to use a
record with two fields a list of page
and what I call a list of regs so the
page that's just going to record which
processes are spawned and need that so I
know what I can pass to register and the
second one just record which processes
should be registered it's a list of
pairs of names and pits ok so my state
transition functions in the model are
going to add things to paid when I do a
spawn and add things to regs when I do a
register remove them when I do an
unregister so with this model I can
write a very simple specification of
register is what it looks like we've got
a precondition first of all so it's
defined by a number of callback
functions that characterize different
aspects of registers behavior the first
one says don't even try to call register
unless you have some pits of course you
you can't the second one tells quick
check how to generate arguments for
calls to register it says well the
arguments to register
are a randomly generated name and one of
the elements of the list of bids now we
always define a wrapper function so this
is how do I perform a register well I
call the airline register function of
course in this case the wrapper function
is very trivial usually there's
something more interesting for a rapper
to do and then finally down here I've
got my state transition function which
says how does the model state change
when I register a name the pit and the
answer is we changed the list of regs by
adding to the end of it the list a pair
of the name of the pit now I know you're
looking at this code and you're thinking
handy just re-implemented register you
know isn't this just what register does
anyway so i thought i would show you the
code of register well not all of it but
here is this is what register does and
this and this and this and this so it's
a bit it has to work in you know SMP
with shared memory it's tricky see code
register is doing complicated stuff the
model is much much simpler than the
implementation and that again is
something that we usually find us the
case okay so let's test it so I've just
built a really simple model that just
basically says it's got the spec of
register it's got corresponding specs
for spawn and unregister let's see what
happens once again I can't demo because
of the network but I can show you what
would happen so if I q a build now I've
cute the first build not surprisingly my
tests fail otherwise it wouldn't be much
of a demo so let's have a look I've got
one property the registry property which
basically says that the implementation
agrees with the model and if we look at
that we can see that we found two
different inconsistencies between the
model and the code now here it's going
to be more interesting to look at the
output there's a little plus sign there
I don't know if you can see it
if I click on the plus that I can see
what the quick check output was for each
of these tests so let's do that and the
first one just calls unregister to
unregister process a and that raises an
exception well why does it raise an
exception because I hadn't registered
process a of course so I try to
unregister a name that was not
registered and you can't do that or if
you get an exception if you do if you
look at the other example it's here well
this one does is it spawns are paid and
then it registers it twice with the name
a so two registrations with the same
name and the second call raises an
exception you're not allowed to register
a name that is already registered so
let's fix these I'll do the unregistered
one first here's how I specified
unregister it says the arguments are
just a random name and the wrapper
function just calls erlangen register
there's no precondition I shouldn't call
unregister unless the name is in the
registry so what I need to add is a
precondition function that says you can
call unregister in a model state s if
the name that you're going to unregister
is a key member of that list of pairs in
the model state okay so I'm just saying
don't call unregister unless the name is
in the registry so if I add this
function to my quick check code and
rerun the tests then we come to here oh
the second build is also read of course
that I haven't fixed the second bug but
if we open up the registry and go back
to the examples we can see that now that
first example has turned green now the
output I made the font a little bigger
here the output extends beyond the end
of the slide but what it says there is
okay test cakes excluded by precondition
so I have saved the test case
and I'm still going to run it but I'm
checking that my precondition now says
this is a bad test case so in other
words it doesn't matter that it fails
you can also see that we've now got
three examples here so the second one we
looked at before but there's a third one
that has appeared another problem what
is that you can also see that there's a
little caret sign beside it what does
that caret sign mean well let's click on
it so if we do that then that line
expands into one example which we'll
look at in the moment and a list of
similar examples so quick check has
found a number of failing tests but it's
classified them as similar there's one
that it shows us and then there's others
that you can look at if you really want
to what the examples say well the first
one spawns are paid registers it with
the name be then calls unregister that
worked and then it calls unregister
again and that raise an exception well
why because it's no longer in the
registry of course but let's look at the
similar examples if we look at the
second one that's pretty similar isn't
it except that we use the name see
instead of the name be can you guess
what the third similar example is we use
d I look quite sure what happened to a
we probably just haven't generated it
yet it'll turn up so you can see that
being shown all three of these examples
it would be too much information but
we're able to recognize similarity and
just show you one so what's the problem
here the problem is by precondition look
I wrote a precondition that says you
can't call unregister unless the name is
registered so how come quick check
thought it was okay to run that test
case where I called unregister twice
well the answer is I haven't told quick
check in the model that unregister
actually removes
the name from the registry so I need to
add a model state transition function
for unregister as well and if I do that
and I rebuilt my tests now all of those
additional tests pass ok so there's one
remaining and this one was the one where
I registered the same Lane twice and so
if we look at the specification of
register I've only got one precondition
here and it says you can call register
if you have some pigs but I need to add
one that says you can only call register
if the name is not already in the
registry so if I add that and rerun my
tests oh look the red test turn green
did you see that but another red test
appeared so i can see that i fixed the
test case that i previously had but now
quick check has found another test case
but still fail so my fix was not
complete and this is also something that
we see quite often when we use quick
check so if i look at this this new
failing test this is what it does it
spawns a process and then it registers
the process twice with different names
well you know what youre not allowed to
register the same process twice even
with different names I don't really
understand why not I mean what's wrong
with that but at any rate the built-in
air land registry does not allow it and
so the precondition that I wrote wasn't
strong enough i just said the name must
not be registered i also need to say and
the pit must not be registered it's just
a second line so if i add that
and cue another build now the bill turns
green all my tests pass so that's a
simple example of testing using state
machines so these state machine models
they're a very convenient way to specify
the behavior of stateful systems and
quick check has a wide variety of
different kinds of state machine models
because for most of the software that we
test state machines of one sort or
another what we need and they're
absolutely fundamental we've seen quick
chek CI gathering a variety of
interesting test cases only one go and
grouping them sensibly I think this is
really useful as well so then you're not
overwhelmed by a lot of morass of
similar test cases you just see the
essentially different ones presented now
I know you're going to be thinking what
is all this reverse engineering of
specifications right that's not
realistic we're really looking for bugs
in code of course before you start
testing you know the specification of
your code don't you if you'll believe
that you believe anything right so so
what is a specification usually it's
just essentially code that has not been
tested why on earth should it be right
and so in practice we always find that
there's a combination of reverse
engineering what the specification
should be you know documentation is a
never correct and B never complete so
there's always an aspect of that and
then the rest of the time you usually
find finding and correcting bugs in the
code not for the process registry
because it's so well tested but in
general you've had a mixture of these
two things so really what quick check is
doing is comparing two different
descriptions of what the code should do
the implementation and the specification
and when you find an inconsistency then
you have to decide where the fault is
okay I've shown you using quick check
and quick check see I on really tiny
examples and you might wonder does this
scale so I want to just tell you a
little bit about the largest quick check
project that we've done so far in in
recent years and that was testing some
outer side code for volvo cars so we all
know that cards contain a lot of
software nowadays 50 to 100 processes
and outer sara is a standard
architecture for that software it
specifies all kinds of stuff but a part
of it is the basic software which you
can think of as like the operating
system that should run on these nodes
and this diagram shows what that
operating system should contain i should
say there isn't just one implementation
of outer size there are lots of
completing suppliers and the car
industry has agreed on a standard so
that a manufacturer like volvo cars can
combine components from different
suppliers without worrying that they
won't be able to talk to each other
that's the advantage of a standard right
when things are standardized you just
put them together and things just work
well not always and val was experience
was that basically when you put the fur
card together to begin with it never
works so that's why they paid us to
develop acceptance tests for the basic
software so what does this stuff contain
well over on the right there there is an
ethernet stack that's something you'll
recognize so four of those things are
protocol stacks can the second vertical
column there is the protocol stack for
the canvas a very commonly used network
for communicating between processors and
cars Lin and flex flex ray or other
network protocols the comm service is on
the top provide routing the Diagnostics
that's the thing that records the fault
code so when you take your car for a
service they say oh ha your third
cylinder didn't fire three months ago or
whatever so all of those white boxes are
padded
opponents what are the colored boxes
inside those are the modules that make
up those components and outer Tsar has a
PDF describing what each of those
modules should do and just so you
understand the scale of this one colored
box here will have a specification that
is several hundred pages of PDF so we
took all this stuff and we wrote three
thousand where we read three thousand
pages of Altus our specifications and we
turn those into twenty thousand lines of
quick check code that's only about six
lines of code per page that's pretty
good information density we tested about
a million lines of c code from six
different suppliers and we found more
than 200 problems of which more than 100
could be classified as problems in the
standard you know you could have a
requirement that said one thing then a
paragraph afterwards explaining it that
said something different so just because
something is called a standard it
doesn't make it right and there had been
some attempts to develop test code for
outer saw previously we were able to
compare with one of those and we found
that our code was ten times shorter and
tests more so we were very very pleased
with this and you know you ought to ask
does this approach scale yes it scales
the last thing I want to do is just show
you what our two new ideas that came out
of doing this project so one thing that
we all know of course is that where you
have some code that you're testing it's
likely to have more than one bug in it
and the way that we have worked with
quick check in the past is we would run
quick check and we would find a bug what
do we do next well fix the bug of course
and then we'd use quick check and find
another bug and then fix that one and so
on and quick check works very well in
this manner if you're doing a kind of
test-driven development but before you
fix the bug there's a strong chance
every time you run quick check it'll
show you the same bug but if you think
about it we're testing randomly however
many bugs you've got one bug is going to
be most probable and that's the one that
quick check will almost always find
first so that means that you really
can't do any more until you fix that bug
it's good discipline but when we were
doing this Volvo project we didn't even
have the source code of the code we were
testing so this fixing it this was done
by the customer or one of the suppliers
of the code so that meant we had to
report the bug to the customer so what's
this now this is a test report I can
tell you if you're supposed to send a
test report to a customer and they get
it and they say what you stop testing
after you found one bug they're not very
impressed so we had to do something
about that but I explained usually what
we would do is fix the bug and then
quick check will show us the next one we
couldn't do that so what did we do unfix
the spec of course we have spent a lot
of time writing quick check models for
buggy implementations of outer SAR so
that we could go further and find the
next bug and as you can imagine that is
rather tedious work and a bit
unsatisfying as well because well in a
way where we're helping to diagnose the
problem for the vendor because we're
pinning down exactly what their code
does wrong but that wasn't what they
were paying is for so a new thing that
we have come up with we're just calling
more bugs and this is something that
fits really nicely with the approach of
quick shake CI what we do is when we
find the first bug then we generalize it
we compute a bug signature from the bugs
that we've already found and then we can
steer quick checks generation so we
don't generate that bug anymore this is
really great because it means once we
a few bugs we know these parts don't
work well we don't waste testing effort
trying to test those parts of the code
anymore we can focus testing on the
areas that we don't yet know or buggy
and more bugs automates that completely
it's not in quick chat see I yet but it
will be and in practice this was a
really big win so previously we'd find
one bug in one run a quick check now we
can leave it running overnight and we
come back and there might be 20 bucks
found in one go writing these test
reports on each of these components it
could be a week's work now it's a few
hours work that's roi so as well another
of the fun things that we were able to
do partly as a result of all of this you
want to try it out you can take any
github project and register it with
quick check CI and we'll we'll build it
and run your properties there is an
example under harm Spence ons github
account which shows you what you have to
do to make quidsi I run your code and if
you want to play then I have an example
of a very simple key value store you can
just clone that guess what it's buggy
and you can experience what it's like to
do quick trick driven debugging it's
great fun so that's it quick check in
