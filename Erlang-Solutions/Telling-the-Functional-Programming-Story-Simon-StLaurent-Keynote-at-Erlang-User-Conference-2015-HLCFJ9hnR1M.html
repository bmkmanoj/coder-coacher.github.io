there about 15 years I'd like to talk
about telling the functional programming
story from a slightly different
perspective you all are functional
programmers you breathe this air this is
your show you know these things I am an
erlang addict as well I don't always
breathe this air the same way but I'm
happy to be here the problem with Erlang
is that once you've used or lying it's
really hard to take the claims of any
other programming language seriously
it's not that they don't do what they
say they'll do it's that Erlang's basic
architecture lets you do things easily
that feel like painful forced
horribleness in other languages and
every time I go to do something in
another language I'll confess up front
that I mostly work in JavaScript you
know I look at the way that the system
i'm using is architected and i say if i
only had my events and if i only had my
messages in my processes instead of my
events this could all go much more
smoothly the choices the the balancing
acts that airline took on the discipline
that are lying provides they're just
there isn't anything that beats Erlang's
core model of messaging among cleanly
separated processes I maybe someday we
will find something that does it better
but for now i'm happy to say that are
lying as the champion and i am addicted
to it i'm a part-timer lying tour guide
i wrote two books well i wrote one and
wrote half of the other one I wrote
introducing or lying because I ran into
this wonderful language and thought that
more people should be able to approach
it it's it's a complicated challenge
explaining a language that is so simple
in so many ways yet doesn't meet
expectations that programmers have
absorbed from other environments
personally I was corrupted very early on
by Apple soft basic and 6502 assembler
and various forms of tying yourself into
after that I spent a few years in the
orthodox classical however you want to
call it object-oriented world I was
really excited about Java finally this
was going to solve all the problems that
I had I now described myself as a job of
refugee the less said about that the
better at the same time though my work
the job that I was actually doing was
rarely programming I have you know
programmed for for a living at times I
most recently wrote an iphone
application a few years ago but most of
the time what I do is I tell stories I I
tell stories myself i right i'm also
addicted to writing fortunately I've
stayed away from the cigarettes by there
are too many things that are easily
addictive worse than that I not only
write myself but I encourage other
people to write I look for people who
want to tell a story and try to find
ways to help them tell that story I
specifically have been looking for
stories that help people solve technical
problems it would be fun to edit
something else but I haven't gotten
there yet there's a lot more to this as
you'll see than just finding people
letting them right and putting their
stuff on the presses it would be fun to
do that but well it is fun to do that
but there's just a lot more going on at
every step of this conversation and that
conversation affects this larger airline
conversation the way that we tell that
story brings people in pushes people
away helps people out sometimes leaves
them very confused we can definitely
keep going and do better with this so
this isn't really a quiz this is just
something to think about but who said
this generally the craft of programming
is the factoring of a set of
requirements into a set of functions and
data structures I like that definition
it it sums up a lot of the ways that I
look at the world it's simple
it's clean so stepping back this is the
world that I live in when i first
started at o'reilly in 2001 my job was
to craft print books which were going to
be these beautiful objects that people
could put on their desks to intimidate
their managers I mean no we put a lot of
effort and do every page of every
O'Reilly book to make sure that it was
the right subject the right voice the
right telling a lot of polishing all the
way along to make these things that we
would then sell however shortly after I
arrived at o'reilly they started selling
a lot less well and as you can tell the
trend has continued I should talk a
little bit about this data this is North
American data from nielsen bookscan
O'Reilly has its own contraption for
sucking in book sales data and
presenting it to the world I'll talk a
little bit more about its imperfections
but the main thing to know for here is
that this is North American print data
and so it's not everything it's not
complete it's just kind of the most
useful indicator that we've found yet so
that's tech book sales that includes
everything from Microsoft Word the
missing manual to everything you wanted
to know about assembly language 22
Erlang programming book sells
unfortunately you can see at the
beginning of that there was a fairly
steep drop we sort of tell two stories
about that one is that the dot-com bust
happened the beginning of that chart is
2003 so this is actually a bit after
the.com bust had had set in but that was
still being felt throughout the world
the other is the internet happened and
it's not just that the internet appeared
you know it's been around a long time
the web has been taking speed for a long
time it's that in the early part of the
2000s ironically during this dot-com
bust phase that really hit critical mass
I you know your google search to find my
obscure error message suddenly worked it
made a lot less sense to go out and buy
something just to to find one glitch I
remember when I was doing a lot of work
with microsoft access this is painful to
admit I I went out and I bought a book
for fifty dollars because it had two
pages out of 800 pages that solved my
problem that was fifty dollars that i
would not have spent had google existed
at the time that i was using it that
programming section does not include
javascript i just want to include that
so you can get a sense of what that
looks like it starts out badly but then
there's this javascript renaissance here
there's a giant spike on the end of that
that i think is worth noting wiley and
John Duquette figured out how to make
books that were beautiful that people
wanted to buy on web subjects so that
gigantic spike is the initial release of
JavaScript and jQuery and as we'll see
spikes tell us a lot of stories so
javascript book sales right now are
about 1500 units per week in print in
North America functional programming
book sales right now are about 200 units
per week in print in North America and
the curve looks very very different you
can see at the beginning there just
weren't a lot of sales I hate to say it
I don't think that first airline book
actually shows up in this data i I don't
know i'll have to go do some more
research i tried to buy a copy of it at
one point but was amazed by how
expensive that one had become so if you
have that hold on to it it's a good
investment there's a bright future there
so every time you see a spike on this
chart i went through and double-checked
this they correspond to specific books
that is the launch of a book that's
taking off for usually its initial
release sometimes books take a little
while to hit the spike but usually that
jump is within a few weeks of the book
becoming available so the first of those
spikes is practical common
which a press had a nice hit with there
had been an endless line of people
telling O'Reilly that we should publish
on Lisp and why don't you have a list
book and we hadn't gotten to it a press
got there first this sold very nicely as
you'll see it's in some of the best
seller list but list programming hasn't
become a giant sales space the next one
is the second or lying book joe
armstrong's programming Erlang which
rocketed up the charts in 2007 2008 we c
programming and scala make its debut and
this one just continues to sell 2008
real-world Haskell the title that had
people inside O'Reilly very nervous real
world Haskell it turns out it was the
right title and people really liked it
so it's it's it's sometimes it's good to
take a risk on these things Francesco
joins the list here at june 2009 with
airline programming you weren't i guess
we were still scared at the time i don't
know I've never done real-world
JavaScript either so we'll see learn you
a haskell for great good my favorite
grammar in a book title ever and then
more recently functional programming in
Scala in September 2014 not to be
confused with programming in Scala there
seemed to be a limited number of book
title choices in the world either you
can do something goofy and fun or you
choose three words and that's all you
have okay so back to my quote the person
who said this granted IBM a license to
use his code for evil there are not a
lot of people who've had that privilege
so I wanted to look at how this market
has changed over the last 12 years the
data that I'm working with goes back to
2003 obviously functional programming
goes back to the the mists of time at
least in the computing world but over
time we've seen things
shift and I should also note you know
you saw that initial curve so the the
first few years of this these best
sellers are bestsellers among their
peers but they aren't actually selling
that fantastically well so ANSI Common
Lisp which I believe is a textbook from
Pearson was doing well the first couple
of years you see Haskell you see Lisp
you see scheme pop up a few times
there's an odd thing in our data with a
little schemer is not considered a
functional programming book which is
obviously crazy but we'll fix that I
think that's in there someplace to at
least I got my copy in 2006 the next
year you start seeing Erlang pop up and
so programming or lang congratulations
Joe had the leading was the leading
title in the functional programming
space in 2007 in 2008 you start seeing
other topics creep into the mix you
still have Lisbon Haskell but you also
start seeing F sharp Scala appears in
2009 but programming or lying and Erlang
programming you know stay really strong
in this in this period closure appears
in 2010 there is another real world
there's a function real world functional
programming with F sharp and C sharp I
guess it's not so it must be the real
world things change more recently though
so you see Scala really starting to
dominate their largely that's the one
book programming in Scala that's done
really consistently well there's still
Haskell Lisp closure learn you some
Erlang for great good makes its debut in
2013 gives us another title with some
excellent grammar and and then in 2014
we're back to Haskell and scallop in
2015 so far less than half the year in
we are at five out of six of the
best-selling functional programming
language books being on Scala some are
new some are old but Scala is clearly
the place to be in functional
programming publishing now there's
another part of the functional
programming publishing world that I
should talk about that really hasn't
been in that data so far you saw a
little bit of it at the beginning but
functional programming is not just
something that people working in
functional programming languages do I
had the privilege of editing a book
which has made functional programming
mainstream for a vast group of people
and it was written by the person who
said that quote if you ever get the
chance to talk to Douglas Crockford
about Erlang it's a wonderful
conversation I highly encourage it but
he made his mark in functional
programming in JavaScript that wasn't
what he sold the book as JavaScript the
good parts does not say functional
programming in JavaScript it was kind of
a well we'll tell it this way and see
what happens kind of story the message
of that book in what's percolated in the
eight years since it appeared is shifted
the entire JavaScript universe well not
the entire universe probably most almost
all of the leading edge of that universe
and probably half of the people beyond
that from what had been a traditional
object manipulation language which by
the way you could create objects in if
you felt like doing things in a weird
way to a functional programming language
which just happens to manipulate a bunch
of objects most infamously the Dom but
the whole structure of the language has
changed because of this one message I
won't say it's because of this one book
I think it probably would have happened
even if Doug hadn't written this but it
definitely made a difference over time
and so if we look at javascript the good
parts and it sells it has that you know
beautiful initial spike it kind of drops
it kind of comes back it's selling about
a hundred and fifty units a week right
now and remember that I said that the
functional programming category is a
whole function books on functional
programming languages
about 200 units a week so there's
definitely a disconnect between
functional programming and functional
programming languages when we look at
the publishing world to put it a little
more starkly I just compared numbers
inside O'Reilly so this does not include
Joe's book but it does include my book
and Francesco's one book JavaScript the
good parts has sold approximately ten
times the total number of units of
everything O'Reilly has ever done in
Erlang that as you'll see is not
necessarily the right calculation
because successful books are outliers
but it tells you a big story about how
functional programming is reaching
different groups of people before we get
too depressed about the book scan data I
should talk a little bit about its
limitations and there are many many
limitations first of all its North
American sources mostly the US and
Canada it's print books but it's not
direct sales of print books if you do me
a big favor and order books directly
from O'Reilly those numbers don't show
up in the book scan data the same if you
order from the progs or Manning or
anything like that the publishers know
those sales happened and we like them
but they don't tell the outside world
that hey these books got sold ebook
cells are the gigantic missing piece and
they're working on that piece but if you
want a really complicated conversation
talk about tracking ebook sales across
vendors who don't trust each other or
like each other or any of that more
specifically to the point i looked at my
own books i feel pretty comfortable
talking about numbers for things that
i've done and for introducing erlang
seventy eight percent of sales of that
book lifetime that's in units are
electronic so there's only twenty
percent of that books reach that's even
visible in book skin and of that a small
portion actually turns up for
introducing a lick sir it's even more
severe it's eighty-two percent some of
that has to do with introduced
seeing elixir is a more recent book in
the early release is only electronic and
things like that but but basically
you're seeing you're seeing a very small
sliver of what the world actually is
when you look at book skin and the other
important thing to remember is we talked
about tech publishing and we
historically came from books but there's
much more going on from O'Reilly
definition of publishing what we're
doing here is a publishing event because
we have speakers who are sharing
knowledge and talking and telling these
stories we don't usually say that we're
publishing a conference we say that
we're putting on a conference but the
rest of the conversation is pretty much
that it's a publishing story when I
looked at introducing a lick sir which
is a more severe case because it's more
recent and and it's in an age when
Barnes and Noble is not likely to carry
such books for instance out of even the
print sales only one-sixth of the print
sales for this book that O'Reilly
registers are registered in book skin
and also combining that with the crazy
eighty-two percent electronic and you
end up with you know 134th of all sales
show up in book skin so you don't need
to get too nervous about the book scan
data at the same time you know is there
a booming elixir universe I just got
this great package last week for Manning
I gotta lick sir in action are things
just taking off are they growing maybe
but as you look at the book scan data
and you compare it to other sources when
a book is hot what a book is really
really selling it's going out through
all of those print sources the books can
registers so the more popular a book is
odds are good the books can data is more
accurate for it it is possible that
there is a wonderful underground economy
in erlang books and that Dave Thomas and
Manning and a bunch of other folks are
getting spectacularly wealthy
I want them to tell me about it but I
think we're all pretty much in the same
boat where these things are doing well
we're happy with them but they aren't
spiking they aren't surging they aren't
taking off so I'd like to talk a little
bit about where what this means for what
I do and how that affects you so I come
from the land of publishing my first job
out of college was at kinkos copies
which I described as my time in
manufacturing I try to be involved in
every aspect of publishing possible
working at Kinkos was completely easy
compared to what the early printers had
to do I didn't have to set type I didn't
have to think about you know getting the
ink right there were these Xerox guys
who'd come and fix the toner of things
broke the speed and efficiency of that
belt and flashing light compared to the
the manual press 30 600 pages a day was
awesome in 1500 1600 that was great i
can do like thirty six hundred copies on
my laser printer at home in under an
hour now i'm pretty sure the setup was
complicated the production process was
pretty astounding like I I think about
we think about the printing presses the
innovation when you think about what had
to go into crafting the type when you
think about what had to go into just
creating a process that could keep track
of all of those pages of paper without
misplacing them losing them folding them
a printer space was not just you know
the box with the printing press it was
the warehouse in which all of that stuff
got stored as they were making the books
and then binding them and then once
you've made this wonderful object you
have to get it in the world and yes
there were printers and this was totally
common for a while who sold directly
from their offices but over time this
distribution network appeared bookstores
appeared people who knew how to get you
books sort of got it started and then it
grew so at this point
the the printing part has gotten much
simpler but all of that inventory and
distribution is still exciting that
biases a lot of things in publishing to
be certain ways we are technologically
determined by our means of production
that sounds terribly Marxist or
something but anyway we have these tools
using these tools shapes the way that we
work so the classic story of writing a
book is somebody sits down and writes
the book the editor looks through it
make sure that everything is good and
then you're off to the presses and it's
great except that it's not really that
way it is a build process where the
builders are involved constantly there
you can automate some pieces of this but
human input is everywhere in the system
it is the main constraining factor on
what we can do even beyond the magic of
printing technology documents I spent a
lot of time in XML when I first came to
a Riley I was supposed to be the XML guy
I think we all know how well that lasted
but documents may be this tiny amount of
information relatively speaking if you
you know picture cyberspace is this
giant architectural construction
documents are a few cottages off on the
corner they are still deeply intricate
they are really complicated to get right
if you think of them as kind of the
miniatures of the data world where every
detail has to be just right that's the
nature of the craft there is even once
you've sorted out your document
structure O'Reilly has a bunch of
document structures we know document
structure really probably too well the
structure isn't enough you can have this
beautiful tightly built thing but if it
doesn't reach a human audience it
doesn't make any difference at all and
connecting to the audience
is a blend of psychology of writing of
knowing what the audience wants there
was a time in the early days when people
wanted information about computers so
badly that even bad information was
better than no information I have fun
going back through some like 60s and 70s
stuff which were kind of the first
reaching zuv of computing stories to the
world but at this point the audience is
pretty demanding they expect a lot of
things that we've made them used to
we've told people that you will have
explanations that will help you solve
these problems they will be in English
or whatever language in a form that you
can digest and possibly even enjoy the
best tech books actually are enjoyable
it's it's hard to describe that to some
folks but it does happen that way the
other amazing thing about this is that
every project is different I have a few
authors i love these authors they send
me stuff they already know what our
expectations are they meet those
expectations from the beginning and i
can just follow this right proof print
cycle it happens maybe one in a hundred
times and even then there's always a
twist because that's just the way it is
if they got it all right we probably did
something different our process changes
every week or two not drastically it's
mostly an evolution but when I think
about how we created books with
frame-maker when I first got to o'reilly
and i think about how we now print most
of our books using HTML and CSS to
generate pdfs and i look at how we got
there we had some wonderful accidental
moments where i did a book on unicode
and we couldn't get some of the
characters to print so we had to come up
with an alternative printing process or
PDF generating process and that led to
this which led to this other thing more
recently i have an author who has
decided that he wants to write books
like he does in software and so he's
creating it in github which makes great
sense but it's not just that he's
writing it in github Kyle Simpson who's
writing you don't know Jas wants us to
edit in github so I got to be the lucky
person to tell his author his editor you
know you've spent 20 years editing in a
corner in the dark just talking with the
author do you think you could do it in
public this time will that make
everybody happy and so far it has it
works but suddenly you're going from a
quiet conversation to doing these things
in front of the whole world and all of
that publishing culture has told us over
the past centuries that you only release
it when you know it's good so coming out
with something that's uncooked and then
having a conversation about how it's
uncooked is about as uncomfortable of
process as you can get oh so okay I'll
get my discomfort out here um the other
important piece of this is that I have a
gambling addiction now this doesn't mean
that I go to the tables and play I don't
if I if I go to a gambling venue ice I
have like a twenty dollar limit and if
it lasts an hour that's great I just
know I'm going to lose it that's just
the way the world is but publishing
books is a lot like playing roulette you
are looking at a topic you are looking
at an author you are putting a bet down
on the table and then spinning the wheel
and seeing what happens you can sign a
contract with the world's greatest
author and lightning strikes and they're
not your author anymore you can choose a
topic that seems like a complete
guaranteed wonderful hit at the start of
the process and by the time the book
comes out even if it comes out quickly
it's yesterday's news and nobody cares
the way that we deal with this is by
creating a list of books rather than a
single book and in tech books this is
somewhat easier my first job in
publishing proper not at Kinkos
was at a New York publishing house that
had a computer book division and the
reason they had a computer book division
was that computer books for all their
ups and downs felt like a more stable
thing than fiction and reference and all
the other work that they did when you
publish a fiction book it's almost
always going to lose money that's just
the way it is you're going to put this
investment into creating this wonderful
story that somebody will read but not
enough people will read because the cost
of the investment is so gigantic that
sales have to be big to make up for it
the way that fiction publishing works is
that you expect the vast majority of
your list to lose money or maybe barely
break even the stark number that I heard
was ninety percent of your list is not
going to make it there'll be about five
percent of your list five to seven
percent of your list that does really
really well they make it makes money
it's enough that you could you know
imagine doing this for a living things
are good but the way that the publishing
house survives and keeps that you know
other ninety percent in print is that
the top three to five percent and
increasingly it's more like one percent
of books bring in vast vast quantities
of money you made that investment it's
taking off Stephen King is doing great
Harry Potter is selling like crazy why
can't everything be like Stephen King
and Harry Potter there's a classic story
about investors who bought their way
into Hollywood and they were going to
fix Hollywood because they knew what the
problems where it was obvious when you
looked at the balance sheet you look at
a studio and eighty percent of their
films are losing money just bloodbath
and twenty percent are making money so
the obvious answer is stop doing those
eighty percent they're not making you
any money and the only answer to this is
fine which part is the twenty percent we
don't we don't know until we get there
that's just the challenge of it so it
makes life it makes life complicated and
exciting and when you get a hit it's
that that gamblers rush of oh I gotta go
do more of the
um what other things actually that
buffers it a bit when you when you play
roulette and you put down a bet when the
wheel stops your you're done you don't
you know there's no back list in
roulette I you can't say I bet on 23
last time that it came up this time pay
me in publishing we have a back list and
this is what provides stability this is
what allows there to be an industry is
that there are still people buying Harry
Potter books there are still people
buying books that came out 30 years ago
five years ago they're still valuable
they're still needed in tech books it's
a little bit harder because things go
out of date though I'm still looking for
that first relying book publishers love
stability in certain ways so if you can
reuse that investment that you put in up
front all that type setting all that
editing when I worked at this publishing
house they talked about sending plates
from place to place because the plates
were already set in making revisions to
those plates and you could do it but why
would you want to even though it was
electronic it was still this giant
struggle because you were putting things
on these massive machines that had their
own requirements beyond give me a PDF
now I mentioned that fiction publishers
have it hard because so much of their
list loses money the good news for the
fiction publishers is that there are not
a lot of revisions and fiction
publishing you go back and you fix typos
every now and then authors want to do
some kind of crazy second edition but it
doesn't happen very often usually it's
once and done you publish it in
hardcover if you're lucky somebody will
want to publish it in paperback and
they'll just buy your plates and give
you money and this is this is wonderful
tech publishers have a different kind of
stability now it's great if you can
publish a book and it lasts for 10 or 15
years that that does that does happen
sometimes in tech books frequently it
happens with textbooks at least they're
they're more stable they're more
abstract and they can keep going I think
the design patterns book is you know
just perpetual
the emotion tech publishers like a
different kind of stability though
because it's great if people keep buying
the book in smaller quantities over time
it's even better if every two years or
so there's this predictable wave of
people buying a new and updated edition
we can't manipulate this the way that
textbook publishers do where they have a
new addition every year or two to keep
the used book sales down that's bad news
but the paradise used to be microsoft
windows because we would go from windows
95 the windows 98 2 i've forgotten my
windows versions anyway you could take a
book and you can update it it was still
mostly the same structure was still
mostly the same content you had to redo
all the screenshots fine you had to add
some new content fine but you know half
the people who bought your previous
edition if they liked it would buy it
again and then you'd get a new audience
of people who wanted the latest and
greatest it had never seen your book
before so you just had this regular
train of flowing purchases that made
life really happy unfortunately the
windows machine is kind of broken down
the Mac machine does sell books windows
I mean not windows mac OS 10 the missing
manual was one of O'Reilly's biggest
best sellers when it first came out but
we've gone to this kind of continuous
cycle of software that doesn't have the
same I've got to install the new latest
and greatest unless maybe you're talking
about people who watch WWDC keynote
compulsively even worse on the open
source side my favorite side you have
projects like rails or node or all of
the software around them where stuff is
changing weekly the version numbers are
not always distinctive I was working on
learning rails at one point I think it
was between 3.2 24 and 3.2 26 and all of
my code broke in the entire book it was
a very bad day but at least it happened
before the book had gone to the printers
and that that kind of pain makes it very
hard to figure out how best to publish
for these spaces the the usefulness of a
book in the tech field is really
directly linked to how tightly it tracks
the current version of whatever is
happening now sometimes publishers can
still publish useless I love the title
of this pata physics a useless guide I
would I would love to do things like
that it's MIT press I mean it's got to
be a tech book right but if there's a
market somebody will find it fortunately
for mit press this book will probably
last much longer than most of the books
on publishing now I talked before about
how it's not just print anymore
eighty-two percent of introducing elixir
is electronic it gets a little more
complicated than that because i was
using units for that calculation and a
lot of the world that's reading books
these days is not actually reading
ebooks delivered as PDFs or kindle mobi
files or something else that comes in a
specific unit they're buying
subscriptions they're getting access to
an entire library of stuff that
publishers have created in the case of
the one up here which is Safari you're
not just getting a Riley content you're
getting content from Pearson and from
lots of other publishers my apologies
that top graphic is about a closure demo
so we'll just pretend that didn't happen
but as we reached this point where
people are constantly searching they
constantly need the newest the latest
and greatest it becomes easier to have a
library that you can search that's
specifically for your computer problems
rather than just going to Google putting
in random error messages and hoping you
can filter through the noise so we're
seeing a change in models at the same
time that we're seeing the print model
decay so publishing and programming or
cousins in some ways I don't want you to
leave here thinking that publishing is
really weird that those Gutenberg people
got things really strange and why would
you do that
we have a lot of things that we do the
same both publishing and programming
have a lot of upfront work to get to the
point where something is useful there's
a mix of standard pieces and custom
pieces scale is wonderful when you have
it well in programming scale can create
some other issues too but publishing
depends on scale programming can thrive
at scale testing we haven't figured out
how to automate our proof reading yet we
don't really have unit tests for
paragraphs we can dream about it we do
it differently and the revision problem
as I mentioned it's it's not just that
numbering additions and numbering code
is hard we just things change change
change is complicated but publishing is
really different from programming in
some other ways I would love to stand up
here and tell you all about our agile
publishing model there are some agile
publishing models they're much easier to
do when you're a smaller organization
especially when you are a single author
doing your own stuff and have control
over the whole process but historically
this printing printing press model has
made publishing about as waterfall a
process as you can get you want
everything done right before it releases
you want a clear path to the release
it's changed over the last few years but
for a very long time the sales team had
to know about what was going to be
delivered six months to a year in
advance which meant that you would get
the nanyo scripts and you would have to
sit on it for a long time because you
had to build up your sales story to give
this thing any kind of a chance in the
bookstores it's hard for me to imagine
these days but it definitely has been
the story publishing can be lured into
new spaces I think the the prides
demonstrated with rails and then again
publishing Joe's or lying book that
pioneering can be really fruitful
O'Reilly has pioneered a lot of things a
lot of times but it's difficult to be a
pioneer when you have this very large
structure that you're you're working to
maintain so we know who our audience
usually is we try to find new and
exciting things that fit that audience
as much as I would love to publish pada
physics a useless guide I think if that
came out with an o'reilly cover people
would just be confused every now and
then you can push into new frontiers and
you can catalyze I brought up JavaScript
the good parts earlier not just because
of its sales figures but because that
book changed the conversation Joe's book
changed the conversation these things
can happen and they do happen because of
books it just doesn't happen often
enough or reliably enough that we can
look at a proposal and say this thing is
going to change the conversation we
should do that there's there's a lot of
risk in that we are moving towards more
iterative iterative models you've
probably seen early releases Manning has
meeps the prag have their own I
mentioned the editing live on github
story we are trying to find ways to show
more of what's going on to people
earlier instead of that classic sit on
it for six months will sell sells it to
bookstores model but it's it's still
nothing resembling an iterative
programming process a lot of people look
at tech books and thank great
documentation sometimes they're right
about this missing manuals are
documentation that's just the nature of
them we started publishing them because
people stop putting documentation in the
box but in publishing the explanation is
the product it's not a side effect we
talked about side effects being these
dangerous things in programming and
publishing when you are creating those
books they are what you are creating
it's not something that happens to be
created through comments that were in
your code it's not something that just
well we needed it so we stuck it in
documentation is typically a lot more
about the what then the why you got
you've already bought this thing so why
would we need to tell you why you need
it although those little flyers they
include these days feel very why they
just don't tell you much
and the other hassle here is that when
you are actually selling a book rather
than providing documentation it makes a
big difference in the willingness of
customers to buy it with documentation
models you can sometimes at least assume
that a hundred percent of the people who
have the product have the documentation
if the documentation is free online this
is really pretty easy but when you're
selling a book you start looking at more
like three to five percent of people
will buy it on a really really good day
more typically it's like one percent so
there are two reasons people buy these
things they need to work in a specific
tech ecosystem so they need to know how
to make these things work that's why I
was buying microsoft access books
they've also sometimes heard the X is
going to be the next cool thing and they
want to explore one of my favorite
things about the rails publishing world
was that the the big gold rush in rails
publishing took place before rails was
commonly adopted at the point when rails
was commonly adopted people would stop
buying books I guess because they
already had a library from before the
the rails book sold the people who were
exploring and who are trying to find
something new and different its a mix
these things can happen different ways
and the best reason is when both of
these are true so not only is it the new
and cool thing but they're also using it
there's this really happy sort of early
adopter moment which can drive sales
beautifully it's it's hard to get there
it's all about timing and getting things
really just right but when it works it
works so this sounds like there are a
lot of constraints on publishing and
there are and sometimes those
constraints aren't so good for the
technologies that publishers are trying
to cover I can't get a book out on this
new cool thing because I have these
issues fortunately for that tech has
kind of taken things into its own hands
so technology is less and less dependent
on people like me I'm glad to be here on
stage I hope you all keep buying books
it's it makes the world better in many
ways but you don't need a publisher to
publish
anymore you can in a sense published by
answering a question on Stack Overflow
you can publish by posting a video of
yourself talking you can self publish a
book I really enjoyed the Erlang and
anger in particular and I especially
love its use of that fallout shelter
symbol and the other one I have here is
you can publish by giving a talk not
every subject needs a book there are a
lot of subjects that fit beautifully in
one hour talks and half hour talks that
people will be really excited to come in
here but they will not imagined in their
wildest dreams buying a 200 page book on
the same subject so in the early
universe specifically you know we have
this room full of people hopefully
you've all bought at least one book on
Erlang sometime in your lifetime but
there are a lot more people out there
and we're trying to find ways to reach
them so we think of Erlang is looking
something like this this gorgeous City
it's lit up at night you know those
towers or our data structures and
there's communication networks between
them it reflects beautifully in the
water the clouds are just there for a
little bit of extra excitement somehow
this picture is named cyber city night
it just seems perfect I don't know what
city it actually is except that it's
clearly not Stockholm Hong Kong ok
excellent so we think of that it's you
know this modern beautiful almost
sculptural thing people who are just
arriving in Erlang people who are
picking up my introducing book they
think erlang looks more like this and to
be fair this is actually better than it
looks to a lot of people because I've
been to those buildings and they're full
of useful tools and people to explain
how to use them so we all know that our
lang is cool no question I've already
said I'm addicted i think it has
stronger architecture than anything else
out there but telling the story of
erling is awesome and telling the story
of why you personally need
relying is very different some of that's
hard to do in a publishing world what
you're talking to a broad audience
because everybody has different needs
but there are some things that I keep
finding happen over and over so people
who come into Erlang have heard about
the cool they want to see how this works
and none of the tools that they're used
to work okay they still have the command
line they still have the web they still
have some basic things but if you spent
the last 15 years and an IDE it can be
kind of a shock to find your way around
around her leg it's even more
complicated because Erlang does so much
so well itself that when you go to
deploy airline you're frequently not
using the same setups that people are
using for other kinds of projects now as
infrastructure has gotten a little more
abstracted is there are things like
docker this is actually getting a little
bit easier than it used to be but it's
still kind of a strange initiation for
for newcomers to Erlang and there was a
while I would go to these talks they'd
be you know half an hour on how to build
a blog in rails in five minutes the five
minute demo followed by 25 minutes of
what happened there really was that
really all just a security flaw that's
letting you do that well some days these
talks were everywhere and i would go to
them and the rooms were packed there was
a rails talk like this at an xml
conference where I thought you know
we'll see this thing it's not going to
fly and the room was packed and as
annoying as those demos were as
repetitive as they became they reached
an audience showed them something simple
and brought them in it worked and we
have a lot of people who have since
built much more than blog software as a
result so thank you all for being here
it's great to have people at shows like
this one you're going to learn a lot but
there are a lot more people out there
who could really use Erlang I suspect
that even if we just looked around
stockholm we could double this size of
this room and there are many many many
more out there
so what I'd like to see happen is you
know find more stories talk about
smaller steps I love that we have that
we have react that we have RabbitMQ chef
Heroku all of these people are using
Erlang those are not stories that I can
walk up to somebody who's working on
enterprise software and say well you
know these guys are using it obviously
it'll fit your needs among other things
the response I've had a few times as
well I like react but I use it from Java
there's there's no problem there's
nothing in react that requires me to use
Erlang so can I just you know let it
stay in its own little box and not
bother me and that's staying in its own
little boxes is not that unusual
technology is not technology adoption is
not usually a flying leap it can be a
flying leap if you're a startup it makes
sense for it to be a flying leap
sometimes because you see something in
technology that other people aren't
using yet an array I can get there first
and I can do this cool thing with it
however for a lot of us who are using
existing setups who have to integrate
with different networks with different
expectations if you think about
enterprise adoption in particular is
probably the best model of this you'll
have experiments sometimes you'll have
skunkworks experiments those are my
favorites but it's not just as simple as
going up and saying yes we're using
microsoft net today but we're doing this
new thing over here and i think that
should all be Erlang or you know I just
don't like our mail system can we just
rip that whole thing out and replace it
with this elixir thing I'm writing it
just somehow doesn't go over very well I
I don't know so last year at Erlang
factory San Francisco Dave Thomas and
Jose ethylene gave a fantastic talk
about barriers to people coming into
Erlang and the need to lower some of
those barriers and I was sitting there
the whole time cheering because you know
the books that I write the the nature of
the work that I do is all about bringing
in new people
and then I started listening to the
folks around me I started watching
Twitter and I realized that maybe I was
in the wrong place the simplest one was
i use Erlang as a filter when I'm hiring
for smart because if people haven't
actually worked in Erlang they're
probably not very smart I mean no not
necessarily but if people do work in
Erlang they probably got to be super
geniuses right because who could get
through all of these barriers and if
they got through those barriers they're
the ones for me there were also some
people who are like well Erlang solves
all of these big problems why would you
ever want to build something small in it
why would we why would we stop the
machinery to make it easier to build
things that were you know more
approachable and my favorite one which
is not just an erlang thing I've heard
this a bunch of different times is I
don't want other people to know about
this i'm getting paid really well if
more people come in they'll be
competition it'll be terrible so you
know they've we've built this cozy niche
or at least some people think we have
the problem is this is a perfect
strategy for keeping the space small we
need to find a balance between we can do
all of these cool things and be cool
people and welcoming new people in to
keep things alive to keep things growing
to keep things moving so a few
experiments I've seen that have worked I
think one of my favorite experiments is
a tunes for Erlang and there's also one
for a lick sir this sort of happened by
accident I wrote introducing Erlang and
my friend David eisenberg is a community
college professor and the way that he
learns things is by writing exercises
for them and solving them so he makes
himself explain them to learn it I kinda
do the same thing with writing but this
is way more way more amazing the
exercises that he gave me were half
again as large as the book so that
wasn't going to work so we made it a
separate thing we made it available for
free someone I think her length factory
had something to do with this realize
that this was a good way to get training
out in the world and so different
meetups started
working their way through the eight
Sood's and bringing people together I
went down to New York I saw one of these
live and in the flesh they were doing
some great things with github to share
their code and then in person talking
about it working it's working through it
when we did introducing elixir David
also did an aids for elixir he's now
working out at a tooth's foreclosure
script I'm hoping this model has legs so
the last thing I want to talk about in
this space is other functional languages
at the beginning when we looked at those
sales figures I kept talking about
Haskell Lisp I even mentioned JavaScript
how how should we work with these how
should we learn from these are we
competing are we cooperating are we
shooting at each other sometimes it
really feels like we're shooting at each
other so i'll start with probably the
easiest case sorry there's so much text
on these slides hopefully these will be
useful to people reading them afterwards
elixir is probably the easiest case
because it still is in a lot of ways
Erlang it's taking all the Erlang
infrastructure newcomers to elixir
probably get that same shock that
newcomers to Erlang have but they've
done a few things very differently first
obviously the syntax looks different
some of the purposes the language are
different I feel a little odd about
being able to assign new new values to
an existing variable but it seems to be
working but the bigger thing that's
different is jose's approach from the
beginning has been to include newcomers
it's one thing to say we can answer your
questions on our mailing list go ahead
and fire them and we'll answer them it's
another to really seek more detail on
okay this bugs you what can we do to
make this better how can we make this
whole thing change it was a weird
privilege to be in the ER lying I'm
going to be in the elixir mailing lists
at the beginning of the project when
everything was really that wide open but
Jose has really kept this level of
interest in the outside world at a fever
pitch and
I've not seen anyone else do that I was
delighted when I opened that elixir an
action package to see Sasha burek
talking about how this is the nicest and
friendliest developer community he's
ever seen I kind of marvel that Jose
came from rails because that was not the
case in rails he's clearly working on
creating something very different and I
think it works so even if you're not
using a lick sir even if you have no
interest in it takes some time to look
at the community and how that can fit
with what we're doing Scala everything
is scala right five out of six best
sellers Scala is a lesson I think about
ubiquity the Java Virtual Machine is
everywhere there are infinite libraries
there are infinite enterprises already
using it they made choices about the
language that seemed more familiar to
Java people I can look at scala and my
even though it raises all of my java
questioning issues I can read Scala
fairly well because it connects to that
Java background i had i don't think i
would enjoy scala at all if I hadn't had
a Java background but it's not so hard I
have a question here about whether Scala
adoption is changing trigger is changing
Java one of my colleagues was like
that's a dumb question of course it is
lambdas are in Java because there's now
this competition so they have to have
these things and that's kind of an
amazing feedback cycle to see you
they're actually doing something
different using somebody elses tools and
that's somebody else who in this case is
Oracle which seems even stranger is is
learning from what these other people
are doing and changing their language to
reflect that the last question I have
here is scholars momentum I see Scala
growing and growing and growing I'm not
sure whether it will hit some boundaries
that I haven't figured out the last one
and the one of these it seems most to
get under the skin of ER lying people is
go despite the cute gopher I think
that's the gopher it's kind of like the
Gopher from Caddyshack and we are Bill
Murray trying to chase it go breaks all
the rules that Erlang's said it has none
virtues that Erlang set up as virtues it
doesn't worry about clean process
separation it's not all about messaging
it shares data really and at the same
time it makes a lot of the same promises
that Erlang does and the a lot of the
initial response I've seen from airline
people was kind of the allergic reaction
that's not possible that doesn't work
that way and in some ways the Erlang
folks are right but at the same time
it's such a change from what people were
used to doing in Python or in Ruby or in
whatever that go maybe a lesson about
being better enough and that it can
offer just enough change to a world to
make things possible that weren't
possible without opening the whole
horizon to everything magical that
Erlang does so I'm hoping that we can
learn from all of these things I'm not
going to suggest that all of these
languages are angels playing instruments
but we should listen to the different
instruments and the harmonies that
they're producing there are people
actually mixing all of these things up
in a variety of environments and I'm
hoping that as we try to figure out how
to make Airline go we can be listening
not just to the people coming into
Erlang but to the people who've gone
other directions so i hope this keeps
growing this isn't quite as awesome a
slide as Francesco's mashup of all of
those covers I didn't go for non-english
books in particular that's the Erlang
side this is the current elixir side as
I know it my included elixir sips there
because I think we're going to see more
and more video coming in and replacing a
lot of what books have been doing sorry
to throw that in is a and a talk throw
away but and so to close we know Erlang
has superpowers this is an amazing
language this is an amazing environment
and ecosystem that lets you do things
that just were hard before but you have
superpowers too so go out talk to people
if you want to write a book that's
that's possible if you want to write
articles that's great if you can be up
on stage all the better find ways to
share the
great stuff that you're doing and you'll
make life better for all of us thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
