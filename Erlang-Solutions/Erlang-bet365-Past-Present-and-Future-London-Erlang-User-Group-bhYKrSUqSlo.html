first of how many people who are
actually using how many people kind of
just interested in using their life you
actually using I mean anger if you're
using if you're thinking of using
curling if you've never used employee
just interested to find out where it's
being used with your hand up okay so
much as good people who know a lot about
airline ask another question
Oh in addition to that how many of you
are interested in want bet365 overdoing
is that okay so I feel that me I'm mad
I'm acting you're committed
so I thank you I actually wouldn't leave
our detail inside 365 the remit of the
R&amp;amp;D team and veterans life is to
basically learn a start-up within a much
larger organization so my team and I
have a very small part in this job is to
look at interesting step change
technologies Sigma that can be applied
for business find out if there's
anything useful about them and then work
a path to adoption so when it's very
exciting job we get to play with partner
with lots of stuff but we've also very
much into building doses and then
transitioning them so practical
the other systems so one bit of
background about that we spoke now if I
missed the memo the signal so that any
web to talk about earth back what happen
anymore but some make this types a
really interesting company and it's it's
one of these companies has gone through
what you could almost turn kind of by
hyper growth from very humble beginnings
in that in stoke-on-trent in in a porta
cabin that's probably a little bit more
classy than that one over there we were
about to in the next couple weeks moved
to our new very custom filter those
offices so from a standing start to
thirty four billion pounds worth of
transactions being processed in 13 years
or so is quite a journey and really one
of the things that I want to talk about
is how we got there was a company and
how Berlin is helped us move to that
level before kind of kind of business
growth and you know I can't stress
enough that the rapid growth of the
business creates and lots of interesting
constraints and lots of interesting
problems and on a business and you know
I would like to try to as we go through
the talk highlight how Erlang has kind
of helped in those different areas so a
well so yeah as well as just to give you
an idea of how about how well the
business is going as well as those new
Bosch offices they were also obvious in
Manchester where we're hoping to get
another sentence or so yeah so
developers so if you are interested in
that career bet365 you can google bet365
careers or you know have a chat with me
first of all I hope you say that we use
a lot of Erlang gets FF 365 we also use
a lot of other tools we have very much a
vital the vibe job mentality so you know
we use go job dotnet vb.net you know we
use a whole range of different setting
jeez only two mostly using kind of like
our our middleware kind of systems so
you ask yourself why why did we decide
to to start using their learning and the
truth of the matter is this that's um we
have lots and lots of suitable problems
earlier I was talking about the fact
that the company has grown absolutely
massively and we got to a stage whereby
we had a culture of being a very
pragmatic about our tools and we built
systems that scales to a certain level
and then our customer base started to
overwhelm the scalability of a core
systems that we yet we physically
actually added and so we managed to
loads of problems with what I've learned
to call the scale innovation by lemma
and what I mean by that is is that as a
company our culture is all about
customer assignments and it's about
interaction with online platform so
consequently to drive that engagement of
customers you want to be very fast to
market and once if you have to get
systems out the door really quickly and
you want to be able to see where to move
at the speed of a startup however weak
basically how we're carrying on this
really really big infrastructure were
starting to slow us down and I said
before this infrastructure just wasn't
scaling for us so we were looking for a
step change we were looking for
technologies out there that allow us to
keep this culture of innovation going
but also be able to innovate now
anything to keep very very busy very
very dynamic kind of a kind of industry
and so you know for us one of the things
that we look for in any technology is
reliability you know if some of the
features that we have on our website you
know people are you see a big big
festive financial interest in the
platform being up we've got platforms
like cashed out whereby people can close
bets out early if if there's any kind of
downtime on those different
forms then you know we can run into all
kinds of fancy trouble very quickly
so in summary why because we had
problems with you know getting things
done quickly at scale and we also had
underlies data verticals with some of
the more traditional kind of sequel
based tools that we were using on
platforms so you know I sake you know
I'm getting dinner we were using it lots
and it's been successful but I'll be the
first to say that getting our line into
a large established company is not a not
an easy easy exercise and so I'm going
to spend a little bit of time going
through you know the different steps we
went through to see where to adopt it
now obviously our company is very
different from any other company so stay
even 100% advice following our path but
maybe if you're interested in playing
for angle interested in adopting a new
company you might learn something from
some other pitfalls and kind of things
that we we had so what's the first
problem with adopting a girl and the
first woman I've got to here like back
when we started doing it was knowing
about their life I've been a committee
job list for many many years and when we
started our that our land journey I
wasn't in daily at the R&amp;amp;D team and and
so consequently I never came across it
and so there's one person in our
organization who was who basically kind
of started the own and both going and
that was our when he was our CTO at the
time was here at Martin Davis and I
think implicitly he'd been looking at
the growth of the company and he was
worried that and we were going to start
letting in to scale those problems so
Martin is that he's very hands-on CTO
he's very technically savvy he's very
good at you know spending his hours
outside the office and learning new
stuff and he came across Ellen and I
remember at the time I was a team leader
working for one of Martin's projects in
each aspects we started kind of talking
about their leg and
mr. Langan kind of saying that we really
should be looking at this and I've got
to MIT because I was a committee jabra
stuff never really heard about it I kind
of sat there and to be fair I ignored
him for a long period of time and no no
no no bad way but you know it's like
you've got your day-to-day work to do
you've got you know things that need to
go out the door you don't necessarily
have a time to where to look at anything
else anyway oh you know good thank you
and so I remember I was on a holiday and
I was a Center Parcs and they show you
something about like my background I
know that sucks and my daughter and my
wife decided that it'd be weird if I get
to make some nice boxes so I fought to
my size so they went up for making text
boxes I was nest boxes even I was alone
in the in the room so to speak back in
the garage or whatever it is and I
thought oh okay you know that's been
sort of you know some that self go for
it what's the worst that can physically
happen so I did a bit of googling by
honor Lang and whoa I saw this really
really scary stuff and she posed why did
have been Miranda at university but I
spent a lot of time at university quite
drunk and so this just seems completely
alien prologue like syntax I passed an
exam on Prolog once God you know I
thought to myself well I've invested a
couple of hours no this is that is
definitely absolutely not for me I
haven't got a clue what's going on up
you know just speak to to what
physically I know so then Martin decided
and I think we've got this response from
a lot of people inside of the company
well I hope they were quite an R&amp;amp;D team
and so if we create an R&amp;amp;D team then I
can officially tell people so you're
actually start looking at this surface
technology and and luckily I managed to
get into the R&amp;amp;D team don't know how to
intervene I've been quite dismissive
some of the things that sir that Martin
had been insane and our first task when
we joined or when we start the undie
team where I was an RV engineer at the
time that was basically to where to
start evaluating so first of all people
got to find our landing point not spread
of making that long run
ran ran will install the up there is it
normally takes a very strong very senior
personality someone who is you know
willing to go the extra mile to actually
even find the platform especially we
were pre kind of whatsapp and stuff like
that there's a bit more buzz about it
but typically going from finding it is
very difficult you found their line
you've got to go off and and convince
people to work to actually try it so
when we creates the R&amp;amp;D team the first
thing we did was look up a project to do
with our persistence so our push systems
are very interesting and basically you
know online bookmaker our biggest
markets are in play and what that means
is people don't tend to bet on the full
time outcome of an event anymore they
bet on you know who's gonna score the
next dog who's gonna fall over and X
he's gonna win the expendable in order
to do that we have a trading team who
are setting all the odds
I mean ideas we need to disseminate that
information outside our customers as
fast as humanly possible because there
was any latency inside of those those
updates then but um customer received
all in a bet on that that the Matthews
moved on them the better is no longer
valid so we've got a really really big
pub/sub system which we stopped eclis
was written in Java called a called a
publisher and what we were to have to do
is try and we implement this in early
and physically see how it how it goes so
convincing people to try it what Martin
did was he basically went through the
back door and he basically made the team
specialists to actually kind of whom had
time and space to where to try it out
and not a lot of companies have that
kind of
you know freedom or ability to to do
that so we found a suitable project and
we basically decided that what we do is
we've implemented exactly the same as
the Java based system
first we knew what the api's were we set
about learning a girl and you know we
spent a lot of time kind of performance
tuning and eventually they assumed we
had a PFC that was a lot slower than the
Java one and so you know we started a
bit upset about it we started talking to
some of the other teams and they went
well kind of told you so but and again
one of the things that are common things
Pilipinas we persevered we persevered
and we learnt a lot more about their
land and we engage different solutions
and they gave us some specialist help
and stuff like that and eventually we
had a system which was about five or six
times faster and more scalable than of
our java based system and you know that
was basically because we went for a
period of learning and we learned an
awful lot about how to buy the motor
starts the mechanism are going to later
kind of distributed systems and stuff
like that and so at that point in time
we had this publisher PSA it looked
really promising one of the other things
that was really cool about it is that
bits of it failed but the entire thing
didn't stop working and it for a company
like us where availability is really
really important that kind of led to
between instructors we were always
training different markets and we're
doing different things and we want to
move really quickly and so you imagine
flows of data through the business it's
very hard to manifest loads of data to
be correct all the time and so if you
have a system then when you get some
duct entity type in the wire and just
die horribly there's not going to be
very good and so what it means is if
you're absolutely paranoid about your
entire system crashing juice and data
you've gotta be really careful and
absent releasing everything to assistant
well here's suddenly the system or you
get goat cheese and stuff like that I
get little bit the supper site would
fail little bits we've done with going
on but ultimately the whole thing worked
yep
working it kept on flowing birth flowing
through so once we had built our little
POC we then started going round company
and kind of shouting about it and I'm a
big athlete also slightly faster than
the faster than the job on that one of
some friends maybe some enemies as well
but no one likes to read to be told
everything they've been working on for
years and years there's a bit of a
different way of doing it so we like
what we saw
PFC worked really well and so once we
had built that we went to the next level
of evolution so we found earlier we've
done a project you had a core competency
or people getting a favor technology
like that but in fact forces fight world
nothing is any good and this actually
makes the power to to production you
know you can all the theories you can
sit there and on paper this thing is
absolutely fantastic but if it doesn't
pick to production okay it's worth for
absolutely nothing
now this is where sometimes some of the
people dynamic starts coming in because
you go through a journey you think okay
I've got one person company he's
interested early he struggles to get
five people and R&amp;amp;D team interested they
know that and then the next stage is
that you need to get well those five
people need to maintain those interests
you need to get ten people involved you
need to get the operations team involved
in the to get absolutely everyone else
involved and you've got a POC which on
paper looks share though expected in the
existing system no part of them I would
say ultimately will take that code black
introduction and where you go but one of
the things about adopting
software this is that need to bring
people along with you and the very worst
thing that you can do if you need to
bring people um is force something
across them so again one of the big
things that I would say if you're
adopting your magnets you've got to let
the teams go on the same journey that
you've got to to get to the point where
you actually comfortable with her life
and so what we did it was we've got this
Jesse
absolutely fantastic go save the company
Oh to money what we're gonna do is have
been at the other teams go fetch only be
implemented again and so we then app to
de Condillac as consultant for some of
the ESL people to say
okay here's our POC we loved our POC
it's awesome but the right thing to do
was to allow the dev teams to where to
go through that stage of engagement
again to get their hands dirty to Peter
oh man and then slow when you start to
leather leather to actually learn
someone for very subtle things not I'm
trying to go through some of the things
I think there's something about their
limb which makes for such a powerful
platform later on in the in the talk but
you know don't be too hasty in the
adoption cycle would be my my big
beautiful advice if you're in a big
company if you need to need to get other
people involved so about four to six to
seven months after our lunch a start
some in the mists of time so I think you
know hon percent working on those time
scales we had our first Erlang publisher
based system out in out in production we
had a different team in outsider island
dealer supporting it and running yet it
didn't fall over everything really good
but having one systematic reduction in a
company where we've got you know six
hundred people in in technology so to
speak does not make a sustainable
ecosystem you really need to have
multiple tools and systems which are by
using it so the next job once we once
we've got our first system out was you
know what other budgets do we have you
know what other things can make use of
this technology and and what we needed
to do is we needed to get enough systems
using earlier to be able to keep a core
development team physically actually
busy and so that is the next stage of
involvement so starts off small it gets
a little bit more interesting and you
can see it's just like these layers of
an onion getting bigger and bigger and
bigger and so the next thing was
critical mass and hopefully I'm going to
talk about why it can be difficult to
where to get critical mass when you all
when you're using airline so basically
the biggest problem with early at least
fear of change fear of failure fear of
doing the wrong thing and that fear
manifests itself in many different ways
a it looks a bit strange to start with
and if you're in a very development
focused organization where you've got to
stick to time scales you suddenly make
it something that doesn't look quite the
same as what you used to something
there's a physical there's a there's a
bit of a fear that that people have
fears about their careers you know I
think personally that the UK job market
sucks
certain extent you know it's getting a
little bit better but everyone is
obsessed for how many years experience
you've got in this technology or can you
do a JB's or you know penny you know can
you do all this kind of stuff we're not
really after the pragmatic problem
solver you go to Java serve common type
inner line with receiving odd job every
now and again so that you've got net or
Java or something like that and you know
there's there's so much more kind of
seeming opportunity out there and so so
people are scared okay fine that's a
significant time inside Berlin we
actually actually feed my skills might
be less marketable and I would say well
know if if you're that kind of person so
to speak something a pragmatic problem
solver it's far more powerful than ten
years you know called j2ee or.net
development stuff so but we have that
inside the company we have people who
have defined their careers by the
technologies that they're working in
you're certainly come along and saying
enough is this new thing you're gonna
get resistance and again going to work
with people a lot of people through that
and you know Erlang has gotta be enough
critical mass inside an organization but
outside to kind of alleviate that
korea-based thought you know what if I
lose my job and then I say I've got the
land on my CV and all you know wants to
to employ me the other thing is is that
there needs to be sometimes a cultural
change inside of an organization to to
adopt a leg so you've got a personal
level whereby we're binding a word about
the job but for other line systems
typically in my experience really good
airline systems work across teams but a
lot of teams tend to be very siloed and
so you know just getting people to write
within one team and Erlang based system
it's very hard but then you've got to
basically be able to make the culture of
the organisation show so about the inter
team working between the teams is
it's an awful lot better know you've had
min success in that in our kind of girl
and adoption but you know there's all
these barriers to entry you know make it
you know quite difficult in it go any
further and now I'm going to talk about
some positive stuff place already but I
just want you to kind of know that it's
not a walk in the park and it's not that
really move straight forwards so where
do we use our land now inside of the
inside of five so these are enough push
systems so that system the first one we
did in our language is about the you
know the data dissemination of ours is
still have a it's still in production
before units second release now and it's
it's you know it's really doing the
business we use the default protocol
cash out so cash out is is basically the
ability to close out position early in
another so what we do is is that we kind
of settle all of our bets that people
place based on what the composition of
the market is and so say for example you
know your team is fighting a lot that
halftime think we're this is a dead sir
actually really would bet on this over
here you can tell she bets out early and
then you know comment we you know we
purpose that money if your team is ten
mill down a halftime anything up well
you know how we're gonna start up we
will give you a small amount of your
physical action learning back now cash
that is a very interesting context
embarrassingly parallel and so what we
need to be able to do is transfer the
information from various data stream to
site the company into a calculation
engine which basically sits there and
just churns the maps and settles all
WebEx at any period of time again it
needs to be low latency or does it need
to be reliable because if you imagine
that units spent ten pounds once there's
a market and then suddenly the cash out
system fails you can imagine you know
therefore war beings and stuff at that
you
because people would actually feel
cheated I was going to close that there
you know and some people would take
advantage of our situation as well yes
if I was gonna close up then and all
this other stuff and so that for us was
a perfect airline system because it was
embarrassingly parallel needed to be
really reliable was really really
complicated you know in terms of you
know the different business logic which
is inside there and so what we wanted to
do was build something that was simple
and so one of the other things I hope to
get into later is is that you know if we
further you can just solve some very
complicated problems in vertically
simple ways and you know other solutions
that we have which are less complex only
difference among millions of lines of
code and you know the code ended up
being a lot simpler which goes back to
this getting stuff done quickly so again
I'm going meandering the bitterness
talked about trying to get this
consistent theme that only is a
complicated base there's lots of subtle
things that make it work for pain of
actually adopting it and you know the
reduction in complexity and the
reliability and the ability to you know
parallel did lots of things of power a
lot more part about so what should you
cash it out we then really moved on to
much larger property of a system so we
looked at how we go beyond sequel so the
publishing system and the cash out
system would kind of like a periphery
what we wanted to do now is we would
have implemented for all the wave that
we know actually transacted some of our
some of our transactions water failure a
better way so we had a huge sequel
database and that database was running
on the you know the most exotic kit you
can physically get and basically we
could only run it at 50% CPUs and went
very slowly over 50% view the entire
thing was fairly would have to failover
to during the date sensor and without 15
15 minutes of outage so we then set
about this project okay well we know
that this is going like this we know but
without a scalability problem now we
know that we want to maintain our
productivity
with regards to developers how do we
engineer a lot of our background core
processes around the other line without
changing all of the client interfaces to
absolutely everything so well so this
was a very interesting news case and you
know one that took a fair amount of time
in R&amp;amp;D so how do we go beyond sequel
using using well the first thing is is
that early gave us the confidence to
start thinking more about distributed
systems and so one of the things when
you start looking at discrete systems
from a top level is think of that fear
them so cap theorem is an event of
something going on the P never position
you can either choose to be consistent
or you can be be available now with all
the stuff that I've just said there that
we are very much in in that point that
we care a lot about consistency what we
really really care about variability and
so the first thing that we did when we
started our next generation kind of
transaction process in the
infrastructure is that we knew we'd have
to start dealing with the eventual
consistency and distributed systems we
started looking at different databases
and we came across we act now we have
fortuitously is written in their
language and if you start with taking a
look at some of these source code inside
the react you will start seeing atoms
for vector clocks and consistent hashing
and all this kind of kind of lovely
distributed systems kind of kind of
concepts so we decided okay well we're
going to build our own based system and
you know we really quite like this
reacting we tested it loads you know we
could see that it had a whole load of
high-proof of kind of characteristics
and stuff like that but the really
important thing that that we have is pet
sauce in it for managing eventual
consistency so if you really want to run
a scale you've got start getting to the
amount of probabilistic computing things
might not be right all the time
but you need to look at the use cases
and work out okay for this use case that
we're doing
this can be wrong one percent at a time
as long as it consistently fixes itself
so react has this thing for sipping
resolution and basically what it means
is is that if you have two concurrent
updates to something or you have an
update in one datacenter and update
another and there's a network partition
both sides of the transaction can
actually go on but when the two things
come back together when the network
partition comes back you can store both
copies of that data and so then on the
network really gives you an opportunity
go mom something went wrong here
oh I've got two siblings and then you've
got this interesting job of how to use
to diverge the political data sets and
that kind of got us thinking and we
thought okay well you know won't it be
really good if we could kind of automate
that merging process because you're
writing these systems they're very
complicated in themselves but dealing
with every recovery and inconsistent
state is an absolute absolute nightmare
and we're basically then moved on to the
world of sync free computing which is
avoiding synchronization and what I
suppose I'm trying to say here is that
um it's difficult to make systems run at
scale and you need to take this approach
whereby you know that things are going
to fail all the time but writing these
algorithms that do this merge of states
which is diverse from each other is
really really complicated so the first
thing that you need to do when you start
looking at systems of this kind of scale
that were here is understand the
application invariants we choose it and
see if you can tweak them see if that's
really what the business physically
actually wants
you've also got to take much more
bespoke acacia to writing a software so
you know you look at your traditional
database system and you know you've got
a foreign key constraints and you've got
your common libraries that do everything
in exactly the same way and all this bad
stuff really if you're one of them
absolute scale sometimes you need to be
spoke certain operations and you need to
handcraft certain functions so that you
can look for how you would
so you minimize the amount of
synchronization that you've you're using
and that means that you you know when we
actually got to model your data
differently so if you looked at some of
our ways that we model data inside of
our system now I would get fired if I
looked at a sequel based system and one
with my data in that in that same way
you know sometimes when you're looking
at some of these things the craziest
things absolutely works you've got to
really experiment but the real thing
that saved our projects and that was
this thing called CID T's so I don't
know if anyone's come across the idea
T's they're a relatively new thing I
stand for lots of different things
button converting replicated data types
and so basically we found that we could
monitor we could model a lot of our use
cases assess and if you have a set
algorithm and the operations that you
apply to it are associative commutative
and idempotent which are the three
characteristics of CID cleave what it
means is is that you can by some
mathematical magic when spate diverges
you can actually get the state to repair
itself again without having to like
custom code to do it so we ended up kind
of building this platform for a lot of
some of our transaction processing
systems whereby we permitted certain
things to go wrong and then when they go
wrong trusted the CR DT algorithm to
actually invert that state back together
again and when I was talking about
probably computing we really really
looked at the invariants and the
different use cases to work out what the
timeliness of the different use cases
were so that if something went wrong
like some look at this and then that we
knew that we had a window of time to
actually compare that data but the
application developer would not have to
buy the bespoke code to fix it and so
ever you got away your
being very productive because the
developers of item relatively simple
code that conforms to these kind of API
seems to see oddities and and basically
you know you have a system that works
within certain notes and time frames so
if anyone's interested in simply
computing in that Apple ruffled just a
nice sense and really look at what this
guys doing
leads bailiffs and look at whether you
you sink free projects are physically
doing and I mean has some really
interesting stuff on there and it puts a
whole new meaning of what it is to fight
correct programs sometimes I feel really
shoddy you know talking about some this
stuff because I would like programs
which I actually evolve the periods of
time I do that for a reason and I do it
because I understand what use cases are
and you know the team and I do it
because we were able to explain what
this use cases are to our people so to
speak so the business and whatever
research is comfortable with it so you
know I've kind of gone off on one
they're like you know what was the
common denominator that allow about
different innovation to happen well it
was in my opinion it was it was early we
learned so much about how to program
differently and think differently design
forces you to think differently they
open up our eyes and allow us to move to
that next level of innovation and
allowed us to basically fail and miss
lots of things up because nobody's up
it's about to be hard thing to do and so
was the expectation in the company that
we could mess up when we did mess up but
by messing up notes we found that we can
learn loads and learn really really
quickly and you know when you start
getting to these really complicated
systems once they're written in Erlang
you notice a level of simplicity in
there would you get past that
boilerplate of trying to understand the
other and syntaxin what so TP weight
processor or to mutability and recursion
and all this kind of stuff these are
barriers to getting into something
you're kind of trying to do something
difficult one
get over that telephone is a nice layer
of simplicity on the other side and you
know we think the found that it makes
you think in you know kind of subtle
different subtle ways about the way that
you go about stuff and you know what
your view on complexity physically
actually is and I think it made me
personally and my team more valid
problem solvers it really started us on
this journey journey to kind of kind of
get that whatever kind of kind of
programming it gave us the confidence as
a team to try lots of lots of other
stuff so given all my waffling you know
where do I think that there like a
certain ecosystem goes next and I think
really that there is a fundamental
problems and we can only cap some of a
stuff one before first you know going on
you know doing and there's got to know
that it's definitely a journey and a
journey is made up of a number two
phases I try to outline before
progressively getting bigger and bigger
and so the first thing you need to do is
you need to make them easy to find so
the second thing you need to do is that
you need to make it easy to adopt so you
need good tutorials training - meaning
support etc and then in the longer term
we need more compelling trusted
libraries to support a wide range of
integrations that people have confidence
in
so making Beuerlein easy to find you
know we need to get it on all people's
radar in our organization it's time of
one person you know and then when we
started looking after to start with it
was kind of like there's just no to
computing kind of tutorials and all this
constant but didn't make sense things
are a lot better now but things need to
get an awful lot sir a lot better you
know as a community of the people here
who do user I mean I'm going to need to
shout an awful lot more about our kind
of that kind of successes and you know
communicate what that we've not done a
very good job it's there's a business
it's a hard thing to kind of explain
that people need to go on agenda but
that journey is very much worthwhile you
know need to write press releases blogs
case studies or that kind of stuff we
need to make the adoption journey easier
but making up too easy because if you
make it too easy then you don't get
learning under about color effects but
we need to recognize that it's unlikely
people from a traditional programming
language background rock and
straightaway so we need to make sure
that the research resources kind of flow
really nicely from a basic level to more
into material to an advanced level so
they can support people through that
kind of a life cycle
given that they probably remember
pressure to do it but whilst they're
going good we were lucky we had a
nominee tape you know we have picked up
people on our back so to speak that you
know can imagine in a you know in
different organizations where people
live you know people do this as a side
project you know that could be really
tough and you need lots of support
inside of that historically the you know
the toggling is that is quite caught
inside the outside of LA and I think
it's getting a lot better now but um you
know to people who are working on the
tooling our aside from the platform
itself and so you know you've got people
edging the rebar project all and getting
Kay and stuff like that you know they
it's almost like people ad hoc adding
things to the platform so physically
actually make it working cover its cover
its tracks and I think that there needs
to be a lot working there and that needs
to be robustly supported by kind of kind
of someone there were many really really
good airline drivers out there but if
you're going to adopt something as a
bigger company and stuff like that well
having Bob from you know Venezuela or
whoever Byrne and his friend might
looking after something it doesn't
really necessary for a lot of confidence
so you know someone needs to be able to
take some unit the core you know
integration libraries you know things
like you know the sequel access you know
and they need to find a way to
consistently maintain and support them
and make it look like it's not just two
people in a shed we were looking after
these these kind of things and also you
know some of the libraries are are
missing so as I say you know kind of
sequel support is is patchy and there I
say
web services things like soap I'm not
really very cool but you know certain
organizations will want to use those
those kind of things and or what to know
that you know their systems work
holistically and so libraries these
missing gaps need to who ever need to be
filled in maybe this one's a little bit
controversial and so you know early did
this 25 years ago I'm one of the key
things about Erlang is its stability
okay and so if you've got a community
that's obsessed with stability they tend
to be looking backwards you know I'm
looking back over class stories and and
stuff like that and and so I think you
know that some you know people need to
be in the urn community a bit more risk
less risk-averse missing more
risk-averse then then less risk of this
so and also think that in the other
community staff has been a certain Venus
as in cake it's hard to get into but you
get they'll be really really good gonna
tell you too much about how to get there
you know because yeah you know so - so
to speak
and so I think that that cultural change
in our community is it slowly but surely
changing but the you know there is still
a lot of we did this 25 years ago in in
Erlang and but we haven't really
developed the tool him to make it easy
for everyone to do what we did 25 years
ago you know really really easy also you
know one of the things I don't need to
look at what the community's doing there
so they are much less risk-averse and I
think that they're doing absolutely
fantastic things and the reason for that
is this that they are very good at
marketing
they've basically sat down and said okay
we got these movie on Rails applications
who don't really scale very well we've
got this fantastic very scalable very
solid platform in Erlang why don't we
market it to these people and so they've
done lots and lots of work in you know
making
Erlang based systems and look very much
like rails and making it kind of trendy
and cool and
well it mazing talking with pipettes and
mix and and stuff like that and they're
very enthusiastic and so if you compare
that to some of the other community
sometimes they're a little bit of fresh
air but that is because I never feel
they know exactly that's happening at so
maybe I need to find that narrower field
so it can be a bit more like that or
maybe it does just need to sit there and
say we're supporting a core platform you
know it needs to be stable whether these
people go off and do all this amazing
funky stuff and actually live with it
and maybe you you know your stuff as
well moving away that they did stuff
like that but you know the community
needs to know what it actually busy
wants to wants to do and even a cell at
the ellipse and people go off and be the
front face of Erlang didn't expect it's
not gonna be quite so cool being in the
other community or they need to define
their market a bit better I think so
this this will be on an industrial user
group which we are of a member of them
and at the moment these are the people
who try to look after the Erlanger
platform if I'm honest I think at the
moment they are open to risk-averse and
so you know there's tends to be kind of
like a lot of talking a lot of trying to
gain consensus and stuff like that they
need to kind of move forward a little
bit and you know get more people
involved and move a little bit faster
which you know going back to what I said
before if they decide to be a bit more
you know kind of a player so to speak
then they need to need to kind of make a
few few more things happen and moment
it's an industrial user group I think
there's like 10 20 no so there's plans
to move it to a foundation and so one of
the things that I would say is if you're
really interested in airline you can
join these people once it just passed a
critical mass will become more very kind
of foundation or nothing that would be
that would be good for it
but the key thing that they need to do
is balance stability with the need to to
innovate and bring on a new generation
of programmers like Alexia people
actually are so what are they three six
five dudes have so we are members of
this airline industrial user group we've
sponsored a number of
menacingly barre3 and different things
we are involved in to open-source people
together and so none of them are
spectacularly funky you know one of them
is is soap integration so you say well
why would you want to why we want to do
that you know that seems a bit kind of
backward picked up integration inside
the building holistic systems requires
these integration points and someone's
got to do it so we thought you know will
will will will put in despite the facts
of my brief dalliance earlier into the
world of kind of moving beyond sequel we
still use loads of sequel and airline
support for sequel server and stored
procedures and all this kind of stuff
again not funky stuff is is a bit amiss
or whether we're working on the side of
that so the future of a line goes back
pieces five
I'm always finish that I think he's
right we've got a core competence now
and we've got that we've got a snowball
effect we've got enough people using a
record critical mass for it to be a long
standing and you know very important
platform inside the business there are
loads and loads of other technologies
that we're going to look at an adopter
and as I said before but movement around
has given us much more confidence to be
my tool for the for the for the by job
you've got quite a few high-profile
projects which I can't me talk about
which are inner language and they'll be
coming out in the in the near future but
you know will continue using airline
whenever it's the right or you know it's
the right thing to do so hopefully
they're in summary up hopefully not
confused you too much but I've kind of
gone through where when I'm started how
it you know got going inside the company
how it reached a critical mass the fact
that their lands are journey we use it
for some really quite cool stuff and we
opened our minds to solving those very
cool problems we've kind of talked a
little bit about community where I think
it you know it's busy actually go and
the future like right so phenyl any
questions please
yeah I think your fear of working on
founded I think many free mobile source
projects that you maintain vibrating
cleaver in division yes yes usually yep
yes I I think the amount of development
that goes into some it's more informal
yeah I miss a ton of that mr. quality
reverb of development notes that quality
of being able to you know to trust it
and trust those developers but if you're
looking at it from a very big company
the corporate background you get lots of
internal barriers and resistance into
economists because we can do this
because we can't do this because and
what's a completely agree with you
sometimes if some of the core dogs know
that seem to have a little bit more
support behind them it made my life or
some other people's liking in the
corporate environment a little bit
easier they would have made it oh this
is a big risk but no it's not you know
and I thought these things are about
managing the risk so what completely
agree it's horses because is that you
know I think that someone would call I
was just need a little bit more help in
early but they are actually been good
and it is basically as the paper in
society because they are very good they
do work we're using lots of libraries
which only had one two people visiting
actually supporting them but what I'm
saying is from the adoption curve you
know I had to and Amity might have
pushed quite hard seen that just trust
as it will be fine
and it's how'd you make that journey for
people following a little bit easier
that's his political thing also I
wondered how did start accusing
you know I would love to talk about
exactly how we did that and it's it's
quite cool the camera is pointing out
holy a name is pointing at this
gentleman semaphores we have obviously
so know we're so but but yeah it was
said was quite a quite interesting yet
interesting project but unfortunate talk
about God go into the real depth about
how a lot of our things work under the
hood of the most superficial jazz hands
but you all that I would say is doable
you know and we're not really very
clever well I'm not my team of a clever
but I can understand how it works so I
only mentioned that when you first came
up as a prototype it was are you able to
share anything with that oh don't know
yeah I was interested what kind of
things do if you're on the background of
Fred pools and stuff like that we've got
a very definitive thinking of what can
come a programming because he actually
is intend to synchronize obviously do
with it if you can stone spin up hundred
thousand light wave processes and send
messages between stuff um and then you
know you start thinking in terms of
recursion and stuff like it's it's a
very different world
so our first publisher looks like jerk
you qualify for this I think of jello
you know they look like Java written in
Erlang and so we were using the same
principles we're using the same
methodologies we hadn't we maybe dropped
the super stack slightly but we hadn't
moved from our comfort zone or solid
just for a million processes up and just
trust that they will be there and
they'll work and if they fail all the
family dependently and
but the memory in another processor and
it's papa
that journey is one of a really subtle
things to anyone say you've just you can
read below to that pattern yeah yeah do
it you've got to let it fall over and
then you suddenly go running to be
stolen before being worrying about that
so the a problem at the moment won't go
into too much detail even now you know
talking about how the Menace concurrency
planted okay so I got all these work
with crest coming in okay and I'm a bit
worried that for every River crest I'm
gonna spin up a process to deal with
this because that's gonna be shared
learning process that we've done before
so we just tried it and we're talking
about a really busy system here doesn't
miss a bit and so it's getting over that
mental model everything that he used to
before and trying a different approach
and being prepared to people to mock it
and safety what really stupid things
never work and just going off and doing
it and going well actually it seems to
be a little bit smug about it honestly
in terms of adopting an I'm in a company
and stuff like that no that's techie
sometimes it you know it can be a bit I
like you if you've got to try and come
to gracious at the same time I've
realized in there that you had the space
and time to go on a journey and you've
got respect that people haven't and so I
get them enthusiastic by not rubbing
consistent and whether or not it's for
the best place or is it the old decision
little design that can you do some sense
that's wise I've got to admit from my
research in development earlier I don't
really know what the latest stats are
but you're basically everything is
calculated on every single change in the
market I'm sorry consequently we've got
it's almost like our settlement process
is running flat out over time for any
market movement and obviously we've got
a calculator count less than two seconds
or thereabouts and you know given the
number of events that rather than that
were bets that we busy have open at any
point in time that is a massively
massively parallel problem but it's one
that struck the fear of God in us when
you know our leaders if you want to call
it that basically came across that he
said we want to do we're going to go off
in debt and do this now I'll be the
first to say that for the Beckley saga
was purpose I was about being the first
tonight on something we were not the
first to market with with cash out and
that's one of the reasons why
politically inside the company was
started kind of thinking oh we've gotta
find a find a different way of busy
actually doing something so we weren't
the first to market but I think that we
had when we did go for that the biggest
coverage and you know we have the best
customer service related with it and
that's because of the fact that a little
bit all the entire thing doesn't pull
down and it's just such a powerful thing
you freeze you want fun we you know I
said you've got to be able to fail like
people get to fail well but you know you
can say stuff up for a massive double
you can say something for little failure
and then I'm the last you to succesful
not cynical failures and a production
system rather than a room so - so to
speak and so that you know it's failure
resilience and the ability to paralyze
out those calculations need to put you
know has to be complicated but they're
still very complicated over lots and
lots of nodes is that the key kind of
thing -
I don't think we are
I'm not commercial person so so classic
oh you know what our strategy is and
stuff like that I do not really have a
clip I've not heard anything inside that
area but so be honest until it gets you
out that budget that we're actually
going to develop I picked up every one
of the last people to basically from our
perspective with the kind of problems
that we have it allows us to fail and
what I mean by that allows us to fail on
projects allows us to fairly production
and via those failures allows us to
learn an awful lot more and so bet365
become very obsessed with knowing how
things work and being in complete
control of your destiny
and messing up because if you mess up
and you learn from it then you
ultimately become much more powerful and
so I would say that dealing with
failures on the court whatever Lange is
because it used to be one side lots of
telephone switches and telephone
switches are systems whereby you've got
loads of traffic going through them and
in the Ericsson days you would get
charged an absolute fortune in facts
which was basically actually down so I
would say out all the things about
earlier it makes you think about failure
but from a technical perspective from a
company cultural perspective in a
slightly different way and that's the
main reason why and if that sounds
fluffy it's because I got to try it to
to kind of not quite that's such a
powerful force for innovation inside of
a company to to get things done you know
feeling of failures just kills so many
good ideas and so many things and I'm
glad you to is a technical
only well failing in a much more
controlled way you know we do all our
own software the blind share of software
you might have pet freeze focus our own
software so we want the trading
applications we were like you know
back-end absolutely everything and you
just imagine all that flow of
information and all that coordination
that needs to happen with regards to
data to get information onto a site for
then someone to place a bet back again
if at any point in that journey anything
can fail at any point in time someone
come released a new trade at all that
has you know you want it to bite at the
end of something you know and for that
market fails in traditional world were
in before
one small failure that about 100 entered
system over here at idle way the
catastrophe over here what we found is
is that you know okay well market goes
down at still you know someone putting
things up and going to do a releasing
but it's just just that one little bit
the rest of it keeps on working be
powerful things it has to say why that
would be my answer
we use amnesia internally side of work
so one project we use that one we adapt
to a system that has consistency okay
you know it's a really good tool I
personally the arm chaos gonna go so I
find a lot of eventual consistency and
you know sync weaken Keating but it's
very much has its most we were worried
about maybe two stops I look in these
kind of to get four gig limits and it
can be weird ever messages stuff like
that and again you know we're talking
about libraries and stuff like that and
active development sometimes you're both
okay has it really moved on and is
anyone really behind it but we use it in
one production system which is very
important to us as being production
and it's worked worked really well the
programmer seem to like this but my talk
by job if you've got a learning system
ng1 an embedded database inside
adorable-looking which is focused more
on consistency that's not any proof so
and it seems to work that just means you
actually have different requirements in
different parts of data yes yeah yes but
this system which is being the more kind
of absolutely has to be correct in kind
of use case then we will use it sort of
favors consistency if we have a use case
whereby you know it's available 'ti and
we go through the business what then use
cases and we work out what the
probability of something is going wrong
in our journeys and what the meantime to
fix that inconsistency is and we'll the
customer actually notice inside at that
time then we will use more eventually
consistent systems and even then
probably computing you know it isn't you
know is it viable I kind of feel good
about yourself well this is gonna fix
itself eventually whether that be 99.9%
of the time will be within these bounds
you know but if you've got a culture a
baby well then you know okay if someone
in the business isn't happy about that's
a real move to more consistent for this
trade-off the trade-off of consistency
is coordination coordination slows
things down you know so you know
postings choices if you're willing to be
a bit more risky in a good way you know
for the baby after battle we certainly
would calculate your balance in a you
know completely eventually consistent
way you know law or something key like
that but um you know you know for the
right thing you can you know make
actually customers much more happy in
the long mentioned they
yeah when do you actually use it in
production or yes but every I said
before we hear that we build a lot of
stuff we don't the online database as
such we've built an interesting
middleware tool which sits on top of
react that you know does certain things
forwards but we use we add but to be
honest you know we really do understand
them you know personally but my team and
the developers at their pieces I've
really understand how the core of it
works and called algorithms and you know
go much were you saying that about it
that's why I sort of so powerful because
it's a learning exercise you know people
get to throw out there but these
academically kind of things I look
really hard in favor of it and funny
maps and stuff like that we look at
something like you know the
implementation that we had core once
you've learned earlier and you go huh
it's not so bad after all we can do that
and so here we use quite a lot of there
and we do find it to be you know really
good and that's its key differential in
the marketplace at Gucci tools and the
MIT community I've been doing a lot of
research in this area who gives you
tools to manage eventual consistency a
lot better than a lot of the competitors
we believe actually you know I said as a
hard thing to get into and then you
suddenly have like an epiphany and you
get going to fit we ask can't abstain
some time I thought their story for the
bit of people because if you know you
could Cassandra or MongoDB some that you
install it through a wash or where it
goes and then you know you start you
know looking at this a week for every we
might put a bead first and then you've
got to check for siblings and stuff and
that doesn't feel that productive
programming and so if the state but if
you just move those next couple of steps
down the adoption change so much that's
why they do them it's about managing
eventual consistency this announcement
and then the research moved onto CID so
I've seen a couple something with
solutions early yeah the solutions tends
to be considered sometimes may be quite
wasteful okay because one of these you
want things and their language can be
yeah so you can have as many processes
yeah the example with the cash out
forgets you're saying that you have all
the time yeah the same got Grand
National yeah you've got like millions
of bets on a execute Obama yeah the
price changes on that selection may be
other than a hundred or two three head
time
yeah you know I use you don't get a
massive enormous ripple effect through
the entire structure of the cross
changes and secondly as probably only
about what we want to send some bets
when that would actually ever cash out
the better that price it's crazy
wasteful unto you in love it again you
can you can do it is the ability to
count so I'm just working with all right
you compare that to a system where
didn't yeah yeah one thing that I would
say this is that when you start like
here simply computing you look at things
very very differently and so if you've
got many things which you're changing
one thing then you've basically got a
bit of lock there and if you look at
kind of new market X's and computers and
cache lines and stuff like that that
overhead of putting that lock in place
it's actually it's quite high and if
you're looking at a distributed system
where the working over multiple replicas
or data and stuff like that you know
doing distributed locks is even more
either costly and so I think life is
about balance there's lots of things in
baton sometime
some of the systems that we've looked at
as I said before I get fired if I did
that in and kind of stick on it it looks
amazingly wasteful but you have faith
you built them you run you know the
World Cup for you know ten times speed
us about that and suddenly fine
I'm using less boxes than I was before
and those boxes are using their
resources in a much more efficient way
than this other system which is sat
there with a massive cube using two
percent of seat for you but basically
you look at that you analyze it I think
it's basically you can almost get lots
of speed so it depends so much any news
days and it depends on your philosophies
with regards to computing and you know
sometimes we will do it one way and
sometimes we do it ever but what we try
to do and this is another thing about
Erlanger that's very good for knocking
together a POC and so what we realize is
certainly my world
we like to nut safe I don't want to hear
that I think that this is a good idea I
want to know so we got when we do it and
then when we do it when you measure it
then it gives you the confidence to to
kind of kind of do that it's a really
good question it's a really hard one to
answer because yes some of the things
you do are wasteful but it might be
wasteful into a sense of you know
creating or using as a resource but if
reduces your latency increases your
availability and the customers happy
then is that a price worth paying
depends on you completely depends on
users I can see both sides of both sides
of the story and I would say that since
we've dr. donor we're getting far better
utilization of our underlying
infrastructure than we used to with
other way of doing it so we are get
seeing that we're able to use that kit
more effectively so you know maybe a
small level is between wasteful but you
have a big picture you know actually
it's a bit better I think I'll
compartment you're trying to sell so you
know
basically and we did more space in time
okay and so that is our key key physique
much advantage we we tend to get
involved in in in kind of changed color
problems and so you know it was a big
problem like the website crashes on the
attend to is even if it that if there's
a whole new product there that some of
those we're going to be evaluating you
languages with evaluating new database
technologies well I'll be honest we do
kind of sit a little bit outside for
their teams and handovers know they're
always always a challenge either anyone
who wants to change anything you have
grits in the machine sometimes and you
know can be can be quite uncomfortable
but luckily we've got very strong
support from laughs you know from Martin
deservings that he's my boss and we tend
to get away from him and from the
development teams I prefer going to get
wet from a development team asking us to
help because if someone's asking for
help he's not necessarily you know kind
of pushy pushy so to speak sometimes you
know difficult problem and you tartan
fish great whenever
one of the biggest problems that
solution equal access stations Beijing
which they used to suck it up yeah
Kanaka variety of people one of the cuz
it gets the emotion pendulum so compared
to that
I'm sorry
one last question how was your
experience we don't use that much
distributed alike so we're service you
know maybe a weakness maybe maybe our
designs tend to minimize that kind of
coupling of systems to together the
operations people were initially very
scared of it but you know we were quite
a few to do a million things at once
we've went nice and slowly we've got one
thing out we proved that we trained
those teams up a lot of them had people
come or windows windows II kind of
background in operations
kind of mimics thing we ran lots of
training courses seminars you know and
all these kind stuff we try to build
people's confidence inside the
technology and confidences are really
important I think did we get a 10% by
clearness and problems are there some
people now still probably a bit why had
you know probably yeah but um it was it
was it was a really big sea change for
all of us okay and it's still ongoing
we still have shared loads of other
systems which are not using this kind of
our current technology um it's basically
being measured and slow and
understanding the people's dimension of
change it's actually sometimes it's a
lot harder than the technical aspects of
the change you know people that think
they mean can be difficult I mean you've
got two choices work with them or work
through that fear of you know of
changing are practical phones if things
one either left in the pool or this kind
of stuff
tried as hard as we could to engage his
people be there for them and lay their
fears there's been ups and downs in
matter on the whole for our react based
systems you know we just had a graphic
sporting event you seem to go a lot
smoother more smoothly for us than
others have before and still goes people
like that so again you just kind of
think they'll all turn and do a little
bit of painting to start with mr. burden
would you like to I'm not going to talk
that's what I haven't found of different
languages and systems are using together
with our I mean you said Alan is not the
only system yeah we used the Microsoft
stack go looking sharp
- scarlet - too much we're looking at
some personal problems see OpenCL openmp
you know it's one of a collection of
tools yes that's the thing it's pretty
cool because of everything yeah that's
really all got to follow on a note about
that you about the cash out it seems to
be an awful lot of numerical
calculations yeah and one thing Alan is
not really that good at is yeah heavy
numerical calculation says this was one
over there's a question about resource
is that the most efficient way of doing
it but it's only the most efficient we
think all the data in the right place to
perform that calculation perfectly you
know in a reliable way
yeah is it the fastest way of actually
doing the mass you know
and that may be a future project we tend
to try to avoid them I think we can use
them in there in a couple places again
what you don't want to do this is one
lift Bell bring your new virtual machine
my research kind of thing right draw
things to a close if I may because Dan
has to revert to the luxury I'd like to
thank you very much very interesting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
