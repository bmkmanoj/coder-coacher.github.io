holding up is it good bad indifferent
good wow that's that's quite a change I
mean how's that for an introduction
question but it is a serious one because
I've been to so many conferences lately
where where everyone has drop box and
everything turned on by default which
absolutely kills the the Wi-Fi which is
unfortunate so people didn't literally
have any way to communicate with one
another especially if they're dealing
with data roaming charges and so forth
so let me ask you a question then so if
we didn't have reliable Wi-Fi how would
we really share data with one another
that wouldn't eat up our data plan is
there such a way and the answer is yes
we have a notion on called the pure web
and what we're going to be talking about
today is really kind of the beauty of it
all so it's certainly not new when we
talk about the pier web but it certainly
comes a light given the privacy concerns
that a lot of people have where our
devices are sending out X number of data
just at massive massive volumes and and
who's reading it quite honestly who's
collecting it who's doing something with
it and that's that's a big concern I
mean it certainly the Edward Snowden
affair brought that a lot of that's the
light in terms of what people were
collecting and what people were doing
with it so that's kind of why I I'd like
to have people think a little bit more
about the pier web and what we can do
with it so you can truly say that you
own your data now I like alternative
titles for my talks so for example here
of how I stopped worrying about internet
connectivity and learn to love the pure
wet and it really is really as important
to me as I've grown as a developer and
as
grown as more of an ethical developer
over time and as stated I do work for
this particular company here where we
just add a little bit of you know metal
to what we do and I work in a group
called the developer experience and in
particular the partner catalyst team
where we work on some of the really
hardest problems that the community has
I in particular the the pier web and
lack of connectivity is is definitely
one of those things you would say well
why not add your everywhere well that's
just not a consideration that many
people have especially when they're
dealing with places that have absolutely
no internet connectivity overall so Who
am I well I am a principal software
engineer at Microsoft and yes I did
bring the Hat just in case people wanted
to see it in action uh and I I am a self
described what I will call myself an
open source for in that everything that
I do at Microsoft is open source
everything is is either on on my own
repo on the thali project which I'm
talking about today or the reactive
extensions which a lot of people know me
for already and I'm pretty unoriginal
when it comes to finding me on the
internet so feel free to ping me
whenever possible so let's get down to
things let's talk about the Internet of
Things what does it actually mean I mean
it means this gigantic term of oh I
don't know it means kit by refrigerators
it means you know connected this
connected that or does it well so it
really does it really just it says okay
anything from your from a thermostat to
your refrigerator to this little you
know this little micro processing board
that might have onboard communications
it's really about how things talk to one
another and how they share data so
they're all connected in some sort of
way whether it's the Internet
or not but when we can come to you you
know things like home automation and so
forth I you know there you know we have
perfect Wi-Fi your perfect connectivity
you know if you want to build something
custom pretty much any board will do you
know to me I like to dream big I like to
dream about you know big possibilities
and the Internet of Things space so to
me a lot of these things like this
aren't very interesting but it does
bring up a valuable point though is is
the the planned obsolescence of a lot of
these things that are coming down the
line you know when we buy a thermostat
when we buy your connected refrigerator
how long are those things going to last
you know are our parents generation the
generation before that would buy a
refrigerator for 20 40 years well in the
Internet of Things space well you know
you have so many other things to worry
about connectivity privacy and so forth
how often are they going to become out
of date that's a--that's a big worry at
least to me of why it keeps me up at
night especially with security if for
example you have a nest that's five
years old and Google decides to
discontinue support for it well you know
you could be easily hacked that's that's
a problem but what I really want to talk
about is more of the democratization of
the Internet of Things at a more
personal level to me you can't get many
more personal than your your phone quite
honestly your phone is who you are for
the most part and it really is serves as
kind of this binding for everything that
you do so I think you have a greater
chance of revolutionising the world when
you when you think of of these
particular things here your phones as
this sort of hub or this ports as it
were and what's great is the fact that
these these phones nowadays are just as
powerful as your servers were you know
five to ten years ago it's got the
storage it's got it certainly got the
compute capacity for a lot of these
things
so why aren't we using them for a lot
more yes I realize yes if you put too
much you might have a whole burn through
your pocket just because of battery
constraints but just let's let's dream
big here is the fact that we can we can
just use our phones and think of our
phones is yet another server and with
that have all of our data in one spot so
let's really talk about some of the big
challenges here some really hard
challenges so for example on the project
that I'm on we're actually thinking
about these big challenges here so in in
this particular case here what we're
talking about is a factory so factories
spend you know millions of dollars and
they run a very low profit margin in
terms of when when they installed some
equipment they expect it to run for a
good number of years 20 some odd years
on the same server same sensors and so
forth ah the problem comes down to is
you know the modernization I want to
modernize my factory for but not go
bankrupt in the meantime how do you do
that how do you say enable all of these
these devices to connect to one another
and to be able to diagnose them very
very easily and like I said the lot of
these places you know they're not going
to touch a lot of their equipment for 20
years and we've done some calculations
where it would be a you know to wire up
I Ethernet ethernet and Wi-Fi could cost
them millions of dollars into these
places and then you would have to have
the service contracts and everything
else added on top of that so that's not
really realistic and a lot of the times
these these factories tend to be in
poorer areas where cell phone reception
itself is not exactly a great thing
either but what let's imagine here if I
could if I could take this phone that I
talked about previously and use that as
my
central communication hub where I can
walk from machine to machine and start
pulling data off of them and then when I
go to an area with connectivity suddenly
things start to you know suddenly that
that whole social aspect that whole that
whole connectivity aspect change is very
very radically I think so like I said
it's it's just as you're thinking about
it on your phone is just as powerful as
anything else but even still I want to
talk about more of the social
implications quite honestly is is that
having something like the pier web also
enables or i would say democratize is
communication to the the world's poor
and underprivileged ends in so much so
that many people are trying to you know
rectify this by doing bullet by you know
Wi-Fi balloons they're trying to do
satellite internet and so forth but
quite honestly a lot of the those
solutions could be very much fixed by
just having a phone where your phone can
talk to another phone in share of data
memories and so forth with one another
with very very little infrastructure
required for that and especially if you
start to think about when you're
thinking about high density you know
living here you can think about mesh
networking as well where you can
suddenly start to build this network on
your own so quite honestly I think that
the pier web has a good chance of really
really changing how we think about
communication and democratizing that
communication with everyone and since
we're talking about this we're also
talking about you know government's
that's that decide that they want to
shut down the web for whatever reason
censorship or what have you but when you
have the pier web it's really hard to
shut that down so you still give the
people the freedom to communicate and
quite honestly save lives
because what we're talking about here is
is that oh you're exposing yourself
obviously when you have your phone out
and and it broadcasts any number of
pieces of information we'll get to that
later and really when you're when you're
talking about saving lives you're
talking about minimizing someone's
footprint so so that they aren't easily
found they aren't easily compromised and
their data stays to their own so you see
a lot of people on social media who will
be going out and posting a lot of
information and ultimately be found out
exactly where they are because of the
fact that once again they didn't own the
data and be it quickly identified who
they were so quite honestly I'd like to
to build a proposition to you and we
believe on this Holly project that you
have a certain set of rights when you're
when you're talking about these the
Internet of Things and privacy and so
forth and that's exactly it the the the
right to privacy should be absolutely
yours you know as part of this effort
what we're doing is we're taking ble
Wi-Fi direct and Bluetooth to provide
for local discovery that is so that you
can literally just look out and see
who's around you but we have to we have
to keep in mind that that there are
certain fundamental rights that the the
individual should have when being able
to enumerate who's you know who you who
you can discover and who you can send
data to and so kind of some of the
building philosophies that we had when
approaching this project was using Kim
Cameron's laws of identity and so users
have rights and we as ethical engineers
have every every responsibility to the
user to be able to do
hello to do that sort of thing did I did
it sorry about that something went
haywire here
so the first law is that technical
systems must only reveal an identifying
user with the users consent so basically
what that boils down to is that your
application should not start
broadcasting your availability unless
you specifically said so and the second
part is is it must be prominently
displayed as part of your applications
say hey you know I'm out there I'm
broadcasting to the world and it must be
absolutely in the foreground so that you
know exactly what's going on you know
discoverability is is different than
than any other thing because it opens up
the user to any number of of imminent
dangers quite honestly so when we're
creating apps like this we have to go
above and beyond to protect the users
and that's not really discussed when
people think about the Internet of
Things but I think I'd like to bring it
to the forefront as you know when people
are thinking about these sorts of things
you know so for example in this
particular law you must be able to
disable a lot of the discoverability
parts and you can add some constraints
as to you can be discovered by certain
people and not by other people as well
so that's what what it comes down to
there is that for example if you're
dealing with online harassment how do
you stop people from from pinging you
constantly finding out your location and
so forth that's you know you could
naively say well I'll just turn off your
your your location and just be done with
it but that's that's really disturbing
the actual you know her ass person
that's being harassed that doesn't
actually enable them to to be much more
productive in society and that's and
that's a real shame quite on
sleep so instead what we we have to do
is actually added a lot more features to
protect those users and just as well we
might also want to you know for example
i'm at work and I want to be discovered
by a good number of people while at work
so that people can you know hit me up on
messenger they can send me files and so
forth but I want it so that it's
certainly geo fenced in such a way that
when I leave work I don't have people
stalking me afterwards that is also a
fundamental right that we should all
have so we should be able to exclude
certain people from discovering us and
we should also be able to time boxes and
geofence it in two ways that people
discover us right now it's it's more of
a wish than a reality unfortunately just
because it's truly truly hard to to
control a lot of this information but as
ethical engineers i think it's it's
something that we should should strive
for and m and so forth so I you know we
we really really have to you know think
think really hard about the the user
here and all decisions like for example
must be coming down to the user as to
whether they enable it or our not enable
it so the second law is the solution
that discloses the least amount of
identifying information and best limits
its most stable long-term solution and
the third law is its digital identity
systems must be designed so the
disclosure of identifying information it
is limited to parties having a basically
a need to know it or a justifiable place
in a given relationship so what what
that boils down to is is the user data
must be exposed in such the smallest way
that there
actually identifiable not your whole big
you know internet footprint but just a
small piece of information so that
people can recognize that it's you and
it should be for the shortest amount of
time possible so kind of time boxing it
in in such a way and it really does
simplify a lot of things when you're
really time boxing it and you're making
it very very unique and and what it also
does is it really it goes against the
the whole thing about you know pinging
other people around you and saying okay
I'm going to you know ping this one this
person to to death or I can harass them
because I know their identity I know
that sort of thing well they can't
really discover who you are unless you i
dint you specifically go out there and
identify yourself so in the fourth law
is a universal identity system must
support omnidirectional identifiers by
public entities and unidirectional for
for private entities so for example i
can say to the world hey here's here i
am you can talk to me versus we're in an
intimate conversation and then we can
start sharing data back and forth you
know it's obviously fairly practical I
you know when we when we when we having
a private chat versus saying hey
everybody I'm over here let's have a
conversation so it also in in these laws
states to the fifth law states a
universal identity system must channel
and enable the inner workings of
multiple identity exchanges run by
multiple identity providers so what that
really means is the fact that you don't
take oh when you're creating this app
you don't take over the entire systems
identity system that you work well with
others and so basically you you bar
other people from from from
communicating that's far from ideal and
so
it keeps we we have the sixth law which
says the universal identities Metis meta
system must define the human to be a
component of the distributed system well
that's a really hard one to really
compute because you're like that's
that's going to take a lot of user
training for them to really understand
what the implications of of sharing the
data is and then finally the last one is
the unifying metadata system must
guarantee users a simple consistent
experience while enabling the context
through multiple operators and
technologies so our app will basically
use our technology to to enable itself
and the community to communicate and and
what it will find is a little fine
basically apps that have their own
communication identity systems and it
will it will basically identify them and
hopefully bring them into a more
standardized way of communicating such
as we do but you might say to me you
know you're full of crap quite honestly
because there's there's so many other
ways of identifying who you are and and
that's true I mean when you look on your
phone and so forth you have your
Bluetooth address you've got your Wi-Fi
mac address you've got your Bluetooth
Low Energy MAC address and in addition
to your international mobile subscriber
number so all of those those particular
things kind of already identify who you
are but the first law should always be
is do no harm so therefore not over
exposing your identity to anybody else I
and you know quite honestly a lot of
these are globally unique addresses but
quite honestly they don't have to be
when you're talking about local
communication and so forth is that we we
think that those are bugs those are
things that could be randomized over
time and that's there be no detriment at
all to you as a user so there's really
nothing magic
about those addresses at all if you
think about we could you know fix them
so that they're actually randomized in
such a good way than the way that we're
doing our identity here so with that we
also expect you to exam for example to
own your data which is the fact that you
have your your data sitting on your
phone fully encrypted and only have to
only be able to share with those you
explicitly set based upon those privacy
rules that we've already laid down now
you know imagine those kinds of
implications here imagine for example we
did that uninteresting stuff back at
home our home automation and so forth
and we're storing all of that data on
our phones or on a local local machine
or something like that imagine if you
owned all of the data inside your house
you know whether it's your thermostat
whether it's your energy consumption
everything imagine the power that you
would have to be able to sell that back
to somebody for a discount that's me is
it is very much a good thing that's the
pier web and those sorts of things would
enable because all of your your devices
would interconnect to that central hub
and then you would on your data that way
so enough of my philosophical blathering
how would we actually build such a thing
and that we've we've actually had about
three iterations so far of how we've
gotten here but none of them until now
have been adequately satisfactory in
such a way that we kind of build them as
a Lego block kind of solution now one in
terms of having a runtime yes you can go
ahead and laugh that we're using this
but you know quite honestly when we're
thinking about a run time
I can truly run pretty much anywhere we
have we have node and know pretty much
can run anywhere from from a simple
board to to a phone and so forth so it
really is that Lego by that base Lego
block that we've been looking for that I
can do all of the things that we need to
do whether it's us identity exchange
security synchronous incra nuys ation
and so forth so like I said was we can
take advantage of the massive amounts of
libraries already out there to to build
these kinds of solutions and then we're
going to kind of need a way to to to
deploy our solution and some sort of
sane way to something like the apple app
store or to google play and Apaches
Cordova is actually very good at this in
terms of it can take our server side
code it can take our all of our native
bindings and all of that and basically
package it up in such a way that we can
easily deploy it to our phones using
anything from x.x codes to iOS code on
iOS and Android studio for for for
Android I it'll package it up nicely and
and what's nice is the fact that Cordova
is allowed in the app store as well now
data synchronization is a very
interesting piece I because what you
want to do is is you obviously want to
have your data absolutely secure but
what you also want is a fairly reliable
mechanism for for sending the data out
to a lot of people now couchdb is a
technology that's basically built upon
couchdb which is a popular Erlang based
database which has at its very core data
synchronization it doesn't have a lot of
the very fine control
that we want but it's a very good start
in terms of how we can build these
really really robust solutions like for
example when it does these change
detections and so forth it can it can
basically pick up and say okay this
phone here has has only seen through
revision 50 this one's theme seen
through revision 52 and it knows how to
automatically communicate all of those
changes and synchronize them very very
nicely and with pouch DB pouch DB is
kind of a compact version of CouchDB
that you can put literally on anything
whether whether it's a web front end
which uses a local storage or index DB
or anything like that to the more
server-based whether it's using in
memory or it uses something like
Google's leveldb is which is what we're
using here so the the amount of
configurations that we have for for
storing data is very very flexible in
the fact that we can swap out one for
the other data synchronization is easy
but what we're going to do to really be
secure about that is we're going to
actually you know implement down at the
very deep level more of the access
control list to see who really does see
what when when those packets go across
the wire now when we talk about the the
idea of we want to keep unauthorized
people out we really want everything to
be you know TLS by default and everybody
is basically given a public key when
they install the application this was
taken at a fine this picture here was
taken out a fine Irish castle when I was
out at the note conf you and I just
thought it was a perfect perfect sign to
use for this but but the ideas is that
everybody who gets an app gets self
signed cert and that becomes their
identity that they can then they can
give out to the world another thing is
is we want to be able to do I key
exchanges and how do we do that without
making your users absolutely hate your
guts I mean it's a really simple
question is I you could you know you
could do QR codes and have people try
and synchronize just line up your phones
and do that sort of thing but I don't
think that's that's really super
possible so what were what we're
actually doing is is a modification of
the coin flipping algorithm or coin flip
commitment protocol as it were sorry and
this this opens it up a little bit to
attack but we're talking about say one
in a million tax we're taught I we're
talking a very very small chance of
being a tax um you know when we're
talking about that you could go to a
football stadium today and you won't hit
that number of people at all especially
those within radio range at all so the
your your chances of being attacked in
terms of a person in the middle attack
is very very small but let's just say
for it for example we have someone such
as I find Derek here and they in the
front on the front row here that's a he
and I have some generated keys on our
honor cell phone and we want to start
communicating we want to secure securely
communicate so that we basically
prevents an unknown key share attack so
that means that someone in the middle
can't just suddenly say oh by the way I
have your certs right here and in jump
in the middle so we can we can basically
say I can say to you my I'm expecting
one two three four five six did you see
that and you said I even expect them to
seize six five four three two one did
you see that and that's exactly what
we're going for is something as simple
as how you would register your phone on
your on your car or anything else in
terms of Bluetooth connectivity and we
need to be able to do this obviously
without any cellular or Wi-Fi
infrastructure to do that nothing
obviously prevents us from doing it
directly over the internet but we would
rather not and so like I said before is
we have this ability to do to do it
using QR codes where I would say okay
let's line up our phones and what scan
each other there but it's really a pain
where as having a six digit pin is not
super bad in comparison to you know the
only alternatives of having a 256
character code to past one another but
we really want security and we're
bringing it down to a level of that
one-in-a-million attack that I don't
think is that big of a deal when we're
talking about the hyperlocal
communication as it were and we really
want like I said we really want node to
be on every device well unfortunately
node by itself doesn't run on every
device but we found through trial and
error that we could have in fact get
node running on every device if we say
no shimmed spider monkey which is
Mozilla's network I'm sorry Mozilla's
JavaScript interpreter on to some
platforms versus javascriptcore on other
platforms but quite frankly that was
just a waste of our time so we instead
found a company called new visa and no
new visa themselves have basically taken
this
taken to extreme where it can run pretty
much on every environment in fact that
we've got it running now on android
we've got it running on iOS and now
we're getting it running on the
universal Windows projects as well so
really it's votes opening it up to the
world you know it's still stuck in the
0-10 time days of note in terms of the
API service and they're quickly getting
to node 4 and note 5 it's going to take
them a little bit of time but what it's
also giving us is the ability to do
since it is a fork of node they are
giving us kind of some unique holes into
openssl that aren't necessarily given to
given in the api's right now it's it's
in openssl but note doesn't really
expose to that level for example for our
our self signed cert on occasion TLS so
are working with them to do that so I i
highly recommend if you want to run I
you know note on your phone today you
can do that through JX core and like I
said is the fact that you can already
deploy these to these applications
directly to the App Store so for example
here we have a Wi-Fi shopping shopping
list where we can basically share with
other people and share what other people
are shopping with you know people that
we want to share things with so this is
an app that's out there now you can go
ahead and download it it's only 18
maggots not that big and it's really
kind of a cool app and just as well just
to make sure that the people on on
Android aren't left out they also have
an android version as well so once again
now you have this deployment mechanism
that literally hits a good 90 some odd
percent of the
of the mobile market as and that was
really our goal when we are creating you
know kind of the Internet of Things on
your device we really wanted to tackle
what was what was key there now what if
there were there is no cloud at all you
know what if there is no you know we
already have the technology one that
we've already been talking about for
example we have Wi-Fi direct we have we
have bluetooth we have bluetooth low
energy and so forth for service
discovery for any of these two devices
to to communicate so that actually
brings us to what exactly Tolly is so
Tolly yes it kind of looks like brass
knuckles but that's that's our that's
our logo what it really is is it's a
it's an experimental platform right now
for building apps it's named after the
Indian and nepalese plates called a
thali in which you can serve many types
of dishes on a sink many types of foods
on a single dish and it's made up of six
flavors sweet salt bitter sour
astringent and spicy so you know to us
it means like building bringing in
little things for security bringing in
things for privacy bringing in things
for for data synchronization and so
forth and building all of these little
things into this this thali plate so
that's how we kind of came up with that
and so all of our stuff is there we are
at thali project org and you can see all
of our stuff that we've been doing which
is quite a bit including a Cordova
plug-in on how you can actually get
started on building it yourself now
let's actually get into some of them
really nitty-gritty details of how we
did this because for each platform for
presents kind of its own challenges as
it were but like I said we're focusing
on the the the biggest markets right now
whether its iOS and Android and yes you
don't see any Microsoft logos up here
which is you know for a microsoft guy
who seems kind of weird but it's we're
trying to basically hit the mass market
of and in fact Microsoft is doing a lot
of development on iOS and Android right
now so for Android what we do is we do
our service discovery basically we're
advertising a string out to other
particular people of our identity using
Wi-Fi direct and with Wi-Fi direct we
can just basically you know saves about
discover other devices that are
advertising via Wi-Fi direct and then we
can start to see who exactly is a thali
application from there and then you can
go from then once that happens then we
can open up a channel on Bluetooth to
start sending back and forth data
through muxing and democracy of data
basically into smaller pipes and so they
can come out on the other side so we can
fit many many messages into a single
stream and so we have em in the Android
layer so that we can talk directly to
the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth stacks that
basically gets exported as a JX core
plug-in or JX court native module to be
able to do a lot of the low level
communication but we've obviously had
some problems in the fact that Wi-Fi
direct is not really a great protocol
because Google really doesn't care about
it and we've seen that time and time
again you know as as the updates come is
the fact that it is one of the most
unreliable pieces of software we've ever
seen but at the same points we're
looking at alternatives such as
bluetooth low energy for the actual data
discovery which you know kind of cuts
down on the radius that we can do but
ultimately it
will give us the reliability we need the
mac on the other or at iOS on the other
hand what we use for discovery is
Bluetooth so it's kind of in the reverse
and then what we can do for for data
synchronization is we use their Wi-Fi
other proprietary Wi-Fi connectivity
framework to send data back and forth
there and yes we've hit lots of bugs
there because I don't think anybody else
has been trying to send massive amounts
of data over the Wi-Fi connectivity
framework so we've had lots of instances
where I OS wasn't telling us that data
was being dropped it was just being
dropped so we found a way around a lot
of those bugs and and were able to to
get around a lot of those but to talk
for them to actually talk to each
other's is actually right now not
possible in the way that we've currently
written it earlier in iOS of iOS
versions they actually allow Bluetooth
communication to be to be allowed from
other types of applications so in fact
one of our our developers had a game
that was actually that could be played
on both the Android and on iOS that we
talked over Bluetooth since then Apple
has been so wisest to put a little block
a little blocker to stop that so we've
had to silence things such as that that
Android would basically become any a
Wi-Fi hotspot for you to actually
connect to its once again it's
trade-offs that we're looking into and
since we're experimental in this in this
particular phase it doesn't quite hurt
and where do we go from where we are
today well obviously the first thing
that we're going to want to do instead
of the more point-to-point
communications that we're doing is that
is we want to start getting into mesh
working and so forth because of the fact
that that if i want to send data across
the room i might want to have to bounce
off five or six or seven different
people to do that and so we'll have to
get into data quorums and so forth and
we'll get there definitely and just as
well for for for talking on local naps
for example if we're all on the same
Internet's most of the time they shut
down a lot of those local channels as it
were so that you can't just do immediate
from one person to another so we'll have
tor hidden services basically to do that
to basically communicate across there so
let me just show you hear that holly is
is a real thing and it actually does
work so I've got right here I've got a
nexus 9 tablet here and I've got a nexus
6 phone also down here and so I can
quickly log in with the greatest
password in the world one two three four
all right so now I can sit here I can go
and create a message here and I'll say a
hello from six and code mesh hit enter
okay so it shows up here and suddenly it
also shows up here immediately so we've
already built this so that it
automatically just instantaneously
refreshes your data and we're working
with a number of partners and building
especially in the more factory factory
scenarios where this just works where
you can send large data you can send
sound files you can send pictures any
number of pieces of data but if you
would like to play around with it I'd be
more than happy to let
people play around with these tablets so
with that all you really have to do is
to get started is to just install GX
core and then just do a JX NPM install
thali and that will basically give you
the building blocks of how you get
started on building one of these apps
today I you know noticing that it'll
have things like identity exchange built
in so that you and I can communicate we
can say you know that our numbers are x
y&amp;amp;z odd and so that's basically yet so I
want to thank you all and open up for
questions stunned silence I love it
anything yes we've actually fill a five
bugs on them so in fact some of them
have been acknowledged by Apple and and
that they will they will fix them
eventually we hope they've never given
us any time lines or anything like that
but they have admitted that that we have
found some some holes in there that they
fixed in for example iOS 9 + 91 they
fixed progressively fixed some of them
they they've created other challenges
for us unfortunately we're iOS 9 also
introduces weird suddenly this weird
bluetooth confirmation box would just
come out of nowhere and we just didn't
ever see that on iOS 8 so once again
we're kind of pushing the limits of
mobile development here at this point
yes if there's document editing on one
device and then it synchronizes those
two devices have to be online at the
same time no no basically when the other
device wakes up and then discovers one
another then it will say I've seen only
threat since reb 52 whatever you have
send it to me and so it will
automatically yet by default send it
over to you know it's not it's not a
only online solution in terms of you
have to be online it's the when it's
available it will be synced to you ok
but if like two devices and ever online
at the same time I yeah and then they
would never talk now I if but it once we
get to the mesh networking parts if so
for example some of them are on on it
from points then then it'll go from
point to point to point and then be able
to get to you so the more direct
communication no but the the more
advanced the more advancement meshed
stuff that we're getting into absolutely
will
do that well we are out of time so thank
you very much thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
