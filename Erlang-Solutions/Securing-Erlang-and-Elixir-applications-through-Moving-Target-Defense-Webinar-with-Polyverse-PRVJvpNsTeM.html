solutions monthly webinar my name is
Marvin Miller and I'm the VP for the
AMIA region here at airline solutions
today's webinar represents a
continuation of a series of webinars we
have been running across topics of
interest in the world of airline and
Alexia and dealing with solutions based
on the beam specifically today we will
be talking about securing Erlang and
elixir applications through moving
target defense and we will be discussing
how moving target defense can be
implemented to make container
environments highly resistant to attacks
as with any live event please do excuse
any technical issues that we may face
today but to start by telling you a bit
about erlang solutions we are a products
and services orientated company entirely
devoted to the airline and elixir
programming languages we work with
organizations and individuals using
Erlang and elixir we help evolve the
languages and we support people in
businesses using them we are
headquartered in London with offices in
Stockholm Krakow Budapest San Francisco
and Buenos Aires and we work on projects
across industries and across the globe
itself we developed Erlang and elixir
based products and some of those you may
have heard of such as long as I am our
open source messaging platform and
wombat OEM our monitoring and management
technology for Erlang and elixir systems
I'm really pleased to say our speaker
today is Alex Canaris the CEO of poly
Birds we are indeed deeply privileged to
have Alex speaking at the webinar and
telling us a bit about poly verities
latest achievements please allow me to
finish by saying you are very welcome to
pose questions throughout the duration
of the webinar by using the chat
facility on the webinars interface our
speaker alex will answer as many
questions as time allows at the end of
the webinar but if any questions do go
unanswered you're welcome to rate them
by email using my address which will be
displayed at the final
on the final slide of today's
presentation I would not like to hand
over to Alex who will be glad to start
us off
Thank You Alan it's great to be here
good morning and good afternoon to
everybody depending on where in the
world you are delighted to be working
again and hosted by erlang solutions for
those of you that don't know me I'm a
long time or Lane programmer having used
or laying I should provide a better a
bit better over a decade now at various
organizations that have been it and so
I'm quite a fan in Erlang solutions is
absolutely one the top partners you can
work with if you're doing anything with
Erlang or litzer so it allowed it to be
working with you all again to jump in a
little bit about Who I am and don't know
me and who the poly worst team are for
myself prior to committing poly worst
sign was the CTO for AOL and the CTO for
Microsoft online a probably festival
known for being the technical adviser to
Bill Gates for many years the team
founding team here our CTO our t-score
used to run the site security and
reliability team for amazon.com and a
head of engineering Chris hello
Brandi infrastructure for sewer and was
responsible for over a million servers I
bring this up because we have a team
here that is very familiar and very
empathetic to the to the challenges that
many of you on the call face in running
modern modern systems there's a lot
going on in the world today and
fundamentally there's a tension between
traditional cybersecurity and the
business need you know represented here
by DevOps but but you know for anybody
technical on the call how many times
your CEO asks you to go slower right
there's also there's very few businesses
in the world where they ask is that go
slower from the engineering perspective
you know we collectively have all
technology like DevOps and continuous
integration and even technologies like
Erlang that allow us to you know write
code rapidly and deploy it without any
downtime so we can use very in place
deploys and take advantage of a lot of
the other great features of our light
and all those capabilities really drive
towards the speed and agility when you
look at traditional cybersecurity models
however it's very much a contrasting
mindset you know traditional security
says lock things down have a lot of
process really keep things under heavy
change control always be watching you
have to do patches all the time and
you've got to watch your systems 24 by 7
in case something might happen and
that's sort of a you know process heavy
model just really flies in the face of
modern DevOps type approach and so when
we think about know a modern
cybersecurity solution it needs to be
one that really works well with you know
the fast and agile matter which
software's being written today all right
well the jump into you know I would
think about cybersecurity I'll do a
quick two-minute refresher on on
cybersecurity and in particular how
attacks work for those of you that might
be a fan of American Hollywood movies
there's sort of this myth of the the
30-second attack you have your hacker
and the running movie and they write the
virus super fast and then in 30 seconds
they can take over the alien mothership
and and pull it up and in reality
cybertek's don't work that way
cyber attacks take advantage of static
and homogeneous system they will attack
will go in
they will recognize or do reconnaissance
around your system they'll break in
somewhere and typically they break into
an edge system Oh break they'll break
into the firewall they'll break into an
edge or caching server they'll break
into your middle gear this or the one of
the first system for this processing
outbound data or inbound and outbound
data I am from that initial foothold
they'll put in what's called the
advanced persistent threat you know
their back door and then they do
additional reconnaissance looking around
for the next system to get into and then
they leave their way weave their way
around and eventually get to the data or
the or the system or what have you that
they're trying to control or perform
their malevolent act on so these attacks
tend to be very thorough they're very
very time-consuming and they are in a
multiple step the average timed
detection of an attack like this is over
two hundred and thirty days so when
somebody gets in they typically have two
thirds of a year in which to play around
and and cause whatever damage they're
going to do so it's a very very long
long long time that attackers are able
to work their way through your system
and the challenge is that traditional
cyber defenses frankly don't work your
firewall antivirus things like that
there's a lot of great products on the
market by all means use them the very
effective at getting rid of the so
called script kiddies and the attacks
that are just sort of well known and
automated but they don't get rid of any
sophisticated actor and we've seen this
recently with the betcha and want to cry
attack these are these are the dreaded
zero-day attacks where somebody's able
to get in
I even against a fully patched and fully
firewall system and the issues is very
very simple and that
the way that a modern attack can get in
and bypass a firewall or bypass you know
an anti-virus system is they literally
use your system your application your
Linux system your whatever they use that
as the virus and there's a technique
there's a wide variety of techniques
with one particular one known as
return-oriented programming I know
there's variations of it on top
programming job programming programming
and so forth but the whole idea is
essentially you string together your
virus using the assembly code and binary
code that is already on this system and
so for those of you that have maybe
never seen a real zero day that string
of characters on the bottom that is a
zero day virus that particular string of
characters will take over a Linux
machine running Java and give the
attacker shell access as root that's all
it takes now this train can be sent in
as part of an image this could be sent
in a URL there's any number of ways for
this this attack to happen and you know
fundamentally it's just using the code
that already exists in the system and so
if you have a java application powering
your e-commerce system what are you
going to do you know what Center I are
supposed to do delete Java you can't you
know admits your system that's supposed
to be there it's supposed to be a
permission is supposed to have all this
capability so when the attackers can
corrupt on your existing environment it
becomes very very challenging for
traditional defenses to defend against
it because all of that code is supposed
to be they're not supposed to be
permissioned having been a long time or
like programmer myself imagine some of
you in the webinar here or thinking well
that's great for Java that's great for C
but I'm do functional programming so Sam
okay
and you are if you're thinking that you
are a 50% correct I would say absolutely
functional programming is a brilliant
way to go it does eliminate large
classes of errors that are common in in
see and people spots and other languages
however the unfortunate reality is that
you know until we get to a pure
functional programming system from the
chip all the way up the reality is we
all work and live in mixed environments
and those mixed environments have bugs
you know Erlang OTP in particular the
runtime it has some pretty severe bugs
over the years there was one just last
year for example that was a heap
overflow and regular expressions and
this allowed an attacker to take over a
system if there was any regular
expressions being used in parsing
external input and so these issues can
be quite severe and as an open source
project you have both the advantage of
you know thousands of eyeballs making
the Erlang system better and better he
also have the disadvantage of thousands
of hacker eyeballs trying to find the
various vulnerabilities and as all of
you to write code though there's no such
thing as perfect code every system has
bugs and it's not just early one time
you also have to worry about any other
components that you may be using such as
Apache or nginx or any other plug-in
modules to our light system or what have
you so when when you look at those from
the attacker point of view it's you know
the entire system is fair game so now
the question is well all right that's a
little worrisome if anybody can get in
and attack my system with zero days and
and even functional programming that
kinda help me
what do I do about it the solution is
actually pretty fundamental and it's
rooted in the mathematical theory that
actually goes back about 20 years if you
take a step back and pull back from
firewalls and antivirus and all those
things and think about it from a very
fundamental perspective the core issue
in cybersecurity today is the static and
homogeneous nature of assistance that
we're using if you're building an or
laying program on on or ellipse or
program running on the Erlang virtual
machine on say Linux server that's the
same Linux that is available to every
hacker and malevolent actor on the
planet you know ditto with Windows
ditto with Java is you know there's only
a handful of sort of systems out there
that are popular so if you're the
attacker who cares if it takes a hundred
people a year to craft an attack because
if you can take over Linux you can take
over over Java or you can take over
you know windows there are billion
computers that you can take over and so
when you look at things like wanna cry
or touch out there are no that I've
actually had a chance to study the code
behind those attacked it was a very very
sophisticated code but the code
fundamentally relying indicate to wanna
cry it fundamentally relied on
understanding exactly how the Windows
SMP system works so if the attacks rely
on the asymmetric economics of it's
easier to happen to prevent what if we
flipped it what if we flip the asymmetry
and instead of having static and
homogeneous systems what if we created
dynamic and diverse systems such that if
an attacker were to try to attack they
could because there
thing still has buzz but they have to do
it and create unique attacks per per
individual machine or maybe per day so
if we can create a lot of dynamic
diversity in a system we can completely
change the nature of attacks and this is
the whole idea frankly none conspired by
human biology he asked the question you
know morning if humans not been wiped
out by choose your favorite virus
you know the bubonic plague the Spanish
flu h1n1 a bola no as devastating as
these viruses and medical conditions are
it didn't take out the entire human race
because as humans were very very diverse
species and that diversity did the
strength and resiliency in a face of
attack so let's create the same
diversity in computer systems so instead
of having a technical binaries across
every system what if every binary was
unique if we know that attackers are
getting in and putting in their
backdoors and georgians and other
malware and being able to reside and
control your systems for over 230 days
what if we continuously reset systems
you know this whole concept of reverse
uptime to keep them keep them
continuously clean and fresh so even if
somebody got in the attack wouldn't be
that big of a deal
now fundamentally it's all about
changing the asymmetry changing the
economic model of attacks where today is
a break once run everywhere from the
attackers perspective what if we change
that to a break once run once once what
we've done in in polymers and this is
what poly vs. is all about taking that
that sort of mathematically proven idea
of cyber resiliency through diversity
and making it phenomenally easy
to deploy abnormally easy to manage it's
what we build is a series of tools that
so very much a UNIX philosophy and
actually built in an early manner which
I'll talk about in few minutes
but these tools can be used in an auto
car fashion to create this dynamism and
create the diversity to protect yourself
against zero day attacks protect
yourself against advanced persistent
threats and script kitties and so forth
really walk through these tools very
pretty you know briefly and then I'd be
happy to go into any workout for the
folks that are curious and into the call
I am still an engineer despite running a
company so I'm happy to go as deep as
anybody English in the Q&amp;amp;A session all
right binary scrambling so if we call
back a few slides I showed you is zero
day using the romp gadget technique to
weather the rock gadget technique or
jump gadgets rather things what wanna
try touch how all these things are using
as a taxi base the solution to doing
this is to create diversity in the code
so what we've done at poly versus we
have a compiler based binary scrambler
and what this does is create
semantically identical binaries but ones
that literally every line of machine
code is different we change registers we
change order of evaluation expressions
we change the layout of the binaries
such that if you're an attacker you
don't know what this binary is you've
never seen it before and so it becomes
difficult to impossible to actually
engineer an attack against it without
paying it from the end user perspective
from a customer perspective it's
completely transparent and invisible to
you for those of you that are familiar
with RPM or a PTR APK the app stores if
you will for linux
what we've done is we've integrated our
technology into the app store so you
simply point young or ap key point it to
recode up polymers at i/o away from the
default Red Hat repositories if you
point to the poly verse repository every
time you install you get a unique
version to you to that server and then
the next install you do you get another
unique version again these are
semantically equivalent binaries when I
with identical performance you can't
tell the difference in the rest of your
development cycle is completely not
changed so with one line of code
you can protect the totality of your
open-source act we do this for all
10,000 open-source applications all
10,000 major open-source applications
including our link and so if you want to
have a unique or laying that is you know
resistant highly resistant to things
like regular expression bug you simply
just install it from polymer since then
installing it from Red Hat or want to or
what have you so a very very easy change
to create diversity in your environment
and provide a core level of resiliency
to your system this is our binary binary
scrambling a tool get one one click one
click install our second tool is this
notion of rapid titling and for those of
you that are using the OTP model and are
like this would be very very familiar to
you and actually one of the places where
we were when the design was inspired
from so Revit cycling is this idea of
continuously resetting your environment
back to a known good state if you go
back to sort of a traditional model
boatmen and how systems are run and how
hackers are working the traditional the
operations model is you measure up time
I myself when I was in
Microsoft online we would go to Bill
Gates and the board of Microsoft and
literally brag about how long our our
environment had been up and running a
little did I know I always doing was
bragging about how long the attackers
had to reside in our system and play
around so rather than trying to keep
your systems running for a long long
long time keep the service running for a
long time but reset your environment
rapidly and with part of us and if
you're using a virtualization technology
notice doctor we can reset the
environment as rapidly at every five
seconds again if you've murdered OTP and
how you know server processes can be
reset and traffic rerouted same idea
right we have a software-defined
networking piece that will take your
docker containers spin them up in the
background send traffic to the
background instances when it's time to
swap and then completely recycle and
refresh the system the net result of
this is that if you have vulnerabilities
like a logic flaw a configuration error
any other type of just sane on any other
type of cyber vulnerability insider
attack that is not based around sort of
want to cry like cyber attacks you can
still have a great degree of resiliency
again so I can tell you personally
having done quite a lot of white hat
packing and penetrating into systems I
personally broken through every firewall
and antivirus on the planet it's pretty
easy to do but when you get in and you
take control of a system here you're
your happiest day but if you get kicked
out after five seconds it's incredibly
frustrating and in particular that that
cycling eliminates the ability for
somebody to get in and work their way
through your system
our final tool here is a traditional
firewall is the Web Application Firewall
it's based around nginx and mod sack of
course we scramble and cycle that on
faro on particular is a lot easier to
configure if you use traditional
firewalls you typically configure them
with reg X and other or other
proprietary languages and the polymers
firewall you configure it just using
plain old JavaScript so it's very easy
to create lockdown whitelist and so
forth we have advanced features in our
firewall that are not available in
competitive products like completely
arbitrary validation and detonation
chambers and so forth but fundamentally
what the firewall does if you just use
it in the one command line default
configuration what it does is it gets
rid of the script key if you put a
server up on the Internet these days you
will be probed within two or three
minutes it was a great study done last
year great much fun amusing and
horrifying at the same time a gentleman
put an internet-connected poster on the
internet and watch the traffic and even
with a toaster connected to the internet
within two minutes it was being attacked
so there's an awful lot of the so-called
script kiddies and sort of port polling
going on there we're just simply having
an IP address that it's live attackers
won't mind you and it will probe you for
vulnerabilities and so a good firewall
is is useful to basically eliminate that
kind of noise so combined between the
scrambling our cycling and firewall we
get rid of the script injection attacks
of script kiddies we get rid of the
nation-state level you know crafted
attacks that use these event techniques
like Rob programming and we cover a wide
range of configuration errors inside our
attacks and so forth so
and all of these things are deplorable
with one line of code and so it's meant
to be very very easy low disruption to
your to your existing environment and
existing development cycle for those of
you that are doing Erlang and elixir
development as I said both both myself
and a number of the engineers including
a CTO on the team we are all or lang
fans it so not surprisingly if you ever
were to get a hold of the polymers code
and look at it even though we've written
this in the go language it would look an
awful lot like an AR Lang er Lang
program to you and consequently Erlang
and elixir are supported as first-class
citizens for polymers as I said to get a
unique scrambled or line you simply
install it from polymers and that will
give you unique version that is
resilient any of the nation state level
or crafted viruses that are out there in
a similar spirit if you're using OTP and
so forth that is an ideal candidate for
for the cycling approach that I
mentioned to you you can do this at the
process level but even better than that
is to do the cycling at the entire
application or an entire docker
container instance level not with
anybody were to take advantage of an
error to put in a backdoor you're
completely eliminating it from the
entire system but then we're big fans of
our lining elixir and have built our
technology to work seamlessly with with
those style of applications
so that's let me uh let me hop to a
quick demo and what I want to demo here
is a the a set of doing cycling on on on
a normal system and so I have a model
here of just your normal
application whether it's a Tangra system
a web a big data analytic system now you
have en servers and military micro
services and your storage here and isn't
meant to be a conceptual model and I've
sped it up greatly from the 230 days
these expanding red circles which are
hopefully animating true don't know what
order is going to go in it's a
mathematical model care probabilistic
system we're basically showing here that
you have a static and homogeneous system
you let somebody get in and give them
time to look around eventually they're
going to find another system that is
vulnerable and then they're going to hop
to that system and from that system
they're going to hop hop again and
eventually they're going to take over
the entire thing just it's not a
question of if it's a question of where
they're going to hopefully I've been
able to convince you that all systems
are vulnerable also since our hacker
bulb is fundamentally come every
non-trivial competing system has but
those bug can be exploited and so rather
than sitting there let's use an American
phrase like a sitting duck waiting to
get your system owned if you adopt a an
approach of continuously resetting your
system even if you have a very severe
vulnerability or somebody able to get in
and take over you know an ad server
microservices or whatever it is they're
able to get into the window in which
they can cause damage is greatly reduced
and they can be as small as five seconds
and so if you're continuously cleaning
up you don't have to detect every cyber
attack you don't have to frankly don't
have to monitor it all the time because
your system will be inherently cell
feeling inherently resilient
at this point you know I've said a
number of times that applying moving
target defense is is very easy to do
it's a very very effective approach but
rather than just take take a claim for
it let me walk through a real-world
example this particular one was
fortunate very confidential government
customer so I unfortunately can't
describe exactly what they were doing
but suffice it to say this is a very
large-scale big data analytic system
it's over half a million lines of code a
large number of developers running on a
significant number of servers and what
fundamentally does is taking data feeds
real time from around the world
ingesting them running analytics in real
time and then they have such as the
customer I'll say wicked-cool
real-time visualization using html5 and
website sockets and so forth so the
users of the system are able to see the
results of the analytics with some very
stunning frankly stunning visual
stations so this is this is a very
complex system with real time need using
a variety of both modern technologies
like docker as well as a significant
number of legacy pieces we've been able
to apply or the customer applied this
movie target defense protection in the
system using Kali worse with only twenty
three lines of code modified I have the
actual screenshot of their config file
there it's a trunk so that the text is
invisible to protect the confidentiality
but you can see the ads and delete of
what was needed to change their config
file and the changes were quite simple
it literally was installing and
configuring polymers
and we use the features that I just
talked you talked you through as well as
a more advanced feature known as session
isolation which happy to cover in QA or
offline if anybody is interested the
numbers old number 23 lines of change to
their configuration to protect a half
million lines of code all running
real-time applause hundreds of servers
this is a very practical very easy thing
to do to get state-of-the-art protection
you know in this to this point amount of
the protection worked it does we've had
extensive validation by the US military
and we've done quite a number of
commercial contests and other studies a
study that is currently in progress
shows that literally a hundred percent
I don't quote me on this because that is
not completely still they bind them one
or two exceptions to it but so far it's
looking like a hundred percent of the
remote coit exploits in 2017 would be
protected by this approach one of the
most interesting studies that we've done
is naturally there's a new I talked out
paper that just came out today and the
link to fold just was published
late last night that has another test
but were the most interesting ones that
we did is we took some awasum
applications that an open web
application security project we took
some incredibly vulnerable programs that
were not patched and these are ones that
have known exploits in fact the OS
project is kind of a training ground for
both defenders and attackers we took a
completely unpatched system applying
polymers to it and had a set of former
nation-state hackers try to try to
attack it they had six weeks all the
source code full knowledge of everything
along with a complete arsenal of attacks
that should have worked and despite
having a completely on patch system to
defend the polymer system completely
protected it and the attackers were
unable to get through so no I can't
promise that you know that moving target
depends as an approach and no prove made
systems in vulnerable we don't believe
there's any such thing as an available
system but if you change the mentality
of how you're approaching a problem
instead of being a very reactive world
of trying to watch your firewalls watch
your analytic systems and and stay
up-to-date on conscious flip the model
be dynamic universe make it so that you
are phenomenally hard to attack if you
can change the economics with the
economics in your favor then we win and
cybersecurity you know as it will become
just part of the normal day of life as
opposed to the gigantic issue that is
today for Western civilization thank you
very much for your attention
I'd be delighted to follow up with
anybody that would like to learn more
and in the meantime let me flip to q8
first of all Alex let me say a big thank
you on behalf of our audience for your
most inspiring webinar a truly
fascinating topic you covered and thank
you to our audience as well sending a
number of questions already we're
getting more questions that we can add
in concert so we'll start answering them
as quickly as possible
apologies to anyone in the audience who
will not get their questions answered I
can assure you that we will answer your
questions in writing after the webinar
but we will try and answer as many as we
can right now so I'll just sort of dive
straight into them the first question
and we'll ask these in the order in
which they were received
we have pure for asking Alex could you
give us a real-life example of an attack
on an online application where binary
scrambling prevented that particular
attack so just repeat the question in a
kilt resulting for a real-life example
of an attack on an online application
which was prevented by binary scrambling
so I don't have a tricky question of two
to answer in let me give a slightly
longer longer answer so the short
real-life example is the one that I
refer to earlier go back to that find
the regular expression of vulnerability
that allowed for an attack that's one
that the binary scrambling does prevent
now something you can validate in the
lab I don't know of a you know of
publicly to my knowledge there hasn't
been a public disclosure of that
vulnerability affecting a customer but
for those of you that are sort of deep
in the type of security space one of the
sort of well-known challenges is that
the vulnerabilities are very rarely
disclosed and the nature of the
vulnerabilities and attacks that have
been a very rarely disclosed companies
quite frankly or are both embarrassed
and particularly in in the United States
there's a significant degree of
liability associated with it and so
having the messiah attack is is rare to
see and so you know the general i'll say
conventional wisdom in the cyber
security industry is that if there is a
vulnerability that has been disclosed
through a CDG
you can pretty much assume that it has
been exploited by somebody because these
patches BCDE that I referenced before
they effectively become the blueprint so
if you're in the blueprint for the
attacker so if you want an easy way to
takeover in Erlang system all you do is
go to the Erlang source code look at the
fix that was applied for that bug and
from that you know exactly where and how
to take advantage of the unfixed system
because you know exactly the nature of
the vulnerability so it becomes a very
quick easy way to engineer attacks and
that sort of the the tension if you will
between patching near disclosing
vulnerabilities and patches that it just
you just getting blueprints to the
attackers at the risk of getting apply a
too long of an answer fundamentally when
you take a moving target defense
approach there are attacks that happened
that you don't necessarily even know
about I didn't cover it but we've got a
fairly extensive detection and an end to
event system kampala verse so you can
see the attacks but fundamentally it's
impossible to know all the possible
attacks right you just you just can't
because to know every attack you would
need to know everybody you don't know
everybody so you know there are attacks
that happened that you don't know or
understand that the mechanism and wanna
crys really good example you know that
the underlying methodology for that and
the source code and that molnár ability
has existed for about six years or more
and so you know during that attackers
that have been using that for you know
coming up on a on six years or more and
it's only in recent month that it really
came to light once it was disclosed more
more broadly and that's very very
typical
these attacks are completely unknown and
that's why we're big believers in the
moving target defense approach because
it gives you resiliency even if you
don't know what the attack is and you
don't know that it's happening you still
are protected thank you Alex I think
that's a very comprehensive answer to
what Goethe was asking now to move
straight on to the next question and
again apologies to everyone whose
questions will not be on cert in the
available time ELISA is asking generally
speaking when should a person take care
about the cybersecurity of a project so
would you do that at modeling time or
would you do that when you deploy
because as Philippe is asking you know
to begin with you do not exactly know
which functions and teaches your
application your application will
actually help that's a great question
the short answer is all the above and
the practical answer is worry about it
now we know it's sort of never too late
to think about about security and
Commerce's never too early to think
about security even in the design phase
we don't know exactly the functions the
functionality you might have or exactly
what the code is going to look like
there are many things you can consider
in the design of your application that
can greatly impact it the ease of which
you know security is going to be an
issue take something very simple like
user authentication no do you have users
do they need to authenticate you know is
that a fennec ation going to be a single
factor or multi-factor authentication
this isn't quite cyber security but for
those of you on a webinar a Europe there
are quite extensive new laws and
regulations about data location and
privacy
and so the design of your cloud systems
and where data is located what access
rights are there what the sort of user
know what your customer rights are with
respect to how that data is handled when
how much they can delete and see on
there's a lot of your regulations about
it so all those things whether it's the
fundamental code design how you work
with the users of how you have of your
data all those are good to be thoughtful
about even at the very beginning of your
project thank you for that Alex and
we'll move straight on to the next
question we have Duncan asking you
mentioned zero days in the operating
systems and he's basically saying he
understand how the cycling minimizes you
know the time available in the system
but the binary scrambling does not stop
Windows zero days
that's essentially what he's asking so
how do you sort of deal with that a
great question so for anything that is
short entered without current technology
that you can go to the poly verse at i/o
and just download it this works for
anything where you have source code so
the Linux operating system all of the
programming stacks on top of that like
Erlang or Java or Ruby or no js' and
then obviously your applications on top
of those stacks so the other source code
we can protect to top to bottom on
Windows we're able to provide this
cycling through cycling the virtual
machines and so that unfortunately is a
little bit more of a configuration the
configuration that it takes a couple
hours to let from a day we don't have
that the one click download and Paul but
if you have a Windows environment that
you would like to protect that from zero
days please contact me online and we'll
be able to to help you out with that
it's just a touch more work because it's
not quite is quite as convenient as the
Linux world
I like thank you for that and just to
repeat we will answer all the questions
that are now coming in faster we can
respond to them in writing so after the
webinar so do not worry and please keep
asking the questions you wish to ask now
moving straight on to a question from
Rick now Rick is asking I think quite an
interesting question if the containers
are restarted every few seconds then any
transactions that are in progress will
be lost and have to be rerun so he's
basically saying the average transaction
time needs to be a fraction of your
container cycling rate so what would you
say to that Alex
another great question and fundamentally
this is what Polly resettles we actually
support our long-running transactions so
in the case study that I just gave you
the quote transactions there can run for
many hours because it's a it's an
interactive real-time
for WebSocket session and so we support
this by virtue of Software Defined
Networking and essentially what happens
is we do session management through
Software Defined Networking
so as the containers are cycling with
did that five-second mark new traffic
new transactions will be routed
automatically to the previous demo
create a semi system have it ready to do
it ready to go at five seconds
traffic is routed to that stand by new
traffic existing traffic is allowed to
flush and then one of the things that
you can easily do and loading with your
indulgence I'm going to skip ahead to
one question that mr. Grove mr. gauss
asked about this not session isolation
honest my apologies for everybody else
in having mr. gauss dump the line his
question was what the session
isolation entails since it relates to
the answer here so fundamentally to a
complete risk question we handle
transactions in the handle session
there's no loss to user experience no
loss the state if your environment is
one where you have extremely long-lived
transactions another technique you can
do that's quite easy with us again was
always in this 23 lines of code for that
particular customer you can isolate your
sessions as well and literally put
transactions into separate container
instances and so I just walked you
through the example of how we handle
transactions where now they go through a
running container at five seconds they
flip over to the backup why not have ten
running containers and ten backups and
that's something that's very easy to do
with us to basically create you know
multiple instances of these and route
traffic dynamically through your system
and create isolation around session
boundaries so for that that answered
both questions there Alex thank you for
that to covered off both questions in
need and that includes Michaels question
now just moving straight on to the next
question we have one of our audience
members basically asking and concluding
the product seems to be based on product
of recovery so kind of assuming you're
going to have a security breach and then
periodically recovering to a known good
State but you also mentioned that
scrambling the codes is an important
part so he's basically asking what is
more important which which of these is
more important and why is obfuscating
application the application so important
itself it's a great question so the the
idea here of having sort of multiple
different tools is the idea
there's no single silver bullet I wish I
could tell you that oh hey just do
scrambling and that will solve all
problems it won't it solves a class of
attack known as these crafted crafted
malware or more colloquially said it
tells the zero day attacks but there are
other classes of attacks like when they
take advantage of configuration errors
and so forth or compromise amen the
so-called insider attack and so forth so
each of these different tools is aimed
at a different class of attack and kind
of a different portion of your of your
architecture it's very very easy for
example to cycle your middle tier
systems anything that is stateless are
functional become ideal candidates for
very rapid cycling your database tier is
something where unless you have an
incredibly flexible no sequel based and
undated here
cycling those systems is better done you
know across minute or hour boundaries
versus seconds just databases typically
take if you have a lot of data and then
they take a little bit more time to
acquire so these these your sewer
spot-on and your Commission I love to
use your phrase I think you said it
better than I did this is all about
going to proactive recovery
thank you that's exactly the mentality
and then use the tool that makes the
most practical sense for a given portion
of your architecture and we'd rather
have you use just one tool and take a
step forward and try to as the saying
goes boil the ocean and solve everything
all in one big Hospital be fast keep the
DevOps clunky and make it easy make it
incrementally better with every release
Alex thank you for that nothing the
available time
gives us an opportunity to answer
perhaps two more questions and move
straight on to a question that has come
in from Michael so Michael is basically
asking if you keep a container alive for
the duration of the session or
transaction as opposed to a static time
such as five seconds does that give an
attacker an entry point for attack or is
it possible to force a transaction
container to restart after a certain
amount of time our answer is yes it's
possible that is something that I
typically don't talk about an initial
introduction to our technology because
when you do a restart of a transaction
it is something that need to be a little
bit careful and thoughtful about so that
in other words if your transactions are
restorable for example
thank you Alex in just ask one
interesting thing that sort of come in
understanding that we've only just seen
the webinar and you know you've given up
certain amounts of information it's
probably very new for everyone that has
been participating in the webinar but
the question is what if an attack can
respond to your dynamic diversifying and
what if it itself can continually change
and respond to your defensive activity
that's a great question and it's one of
these things where while we take great
efforts to secure on simple the
protector customer particular customers
even if the attacker knew everything
that was going on and Mike described a
lot of the validation we've done we've
given the attackers full knowledge of
everything there's a there's a well
known security principal called
kerckhoffs principle the kerkoff's
principle says is the best security
works
even if the attackers understand and
know everything about it and the example
that's usually used with protocols
principle is public key encryption I
know the mathematics of public key
encryption everybody knows it I've got
all the code for how it works even as
the attacker
it doesn't make knowing all the code and
knowing the mathematics doesn't need to
easier to guess the prime number behind
public key encryption so the same
principle applies with the binary
scrambling and other techniques that
we're doing here and even if you know
that knew the attacker Eva's attacker
knows that you are how is rambold
scrambled system they don't know which
of the many billions economy of
possibilities it is and they would have
to try typical measures there's more
than a billion there's about a squatch
really in different permutations a
typical environment so the attacker
would have to guess which of eight
quadrillions possibility exists that's
quite hard to do even if even if you
know that you've got to guess it doesn't
make the guessing easier and that that's
the fundamental thesis behind movie
targeting that it's okay if the
attackers medal it doesn't does not
change the complexity of which it is to
attack a dynamic universe system and
that's where you get your strength from
the years old people thank you for not
Alex I think that that's a very
compelling answer and finally I'll
indulge myself with with a question if
it online and this is more on the side
of you know I've visited the poly verse
dot IO web pages and I would recommend
everyone attending the webinar does the
same
you know we're convinced we're sort of
sold how do we get a copy
are you planning to serve individuals or
is this sort of more oriented towards
organizations and businesses if you do
plan to serve individuals is there a
plan
roll out a price point that would suit
individuals what I all sort of business
intentions on that front a great
question thinking mind we support
customers of all sides are full full
transparency and disclosure you know the
bulk of our customers are our fortune
1000 and military organizations as you
might expect folks that are in the pics
of the cyber security war have been
attracted to us we've been in commercial
production for which years this is very
well proven technology and we now have a
potentially self-service version that
scale up and scale down our cheapest
least least expensive is $100 u.s. if
you just go to Polaris that IO
you can get a single server version for
$100 and then obviously that scaled up
if you everybody on the if anybody on
the call is working on a very large
enterprise we're covering the type
system we scale up to that level
quantity as well and for everybody on
this webinar I'm very pleased to offer
you a free trial if you go to our
website and use the code poly verse
trial that will give you a free version
of our stop to evaluate and we'd love to
have you do that we'd be delighted to
work with everybody and I pointless
let's go win it all the bad guys here
Alex thank you so much and I know that I
would personally feel better if I had
practice the defense of my machine so I
might just give that trial ago so thank
you for this and I'm sure that everyone
will join me in thanking you for a
really inspiring talk many thanks to all
of you who have joined us for the
webinar as well please join us again for
our next monthly webinar and following
today we will send you a short survey
just to make sure we
kyaa feedback of today's webinar now
also note that the recording of the
webinar and the presentation that was
shared today will become available for
you to collect and erlang solutions is
