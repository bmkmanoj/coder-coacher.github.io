audience yes
so I'm Fred I bet and basically I'm
Helen dear online community for having
written where are you sure line four
great good and then after that I kept
encroaching myself in the community by
doing more stuff open source libraries
tooling and everything and now I'm
pretty much going to the conference as I
can and I think people will be pretty
well in these areas but here and this is
confirmation so it's nice to see a bunch
of new faces and get into a wider
environment as well could you could you
briefly explain to the audience what you
talked about a cogniser yes
so mostly my talk is titled everything
is terrible and that's the entire theme
of it of it is that even though you
might have it fair a very simple
application no matter how confident you
feel about it there's always a slight
misunderstanding and how we model the
world internally to build on it that is
slightly wrong and that causes all kinds
of issues that can be having far and
wide-ranging repercussions and so that's
probably part of the philosophy that
brings me to our line at the same time
even though the talk is language
agnostic which is how can you I mean you
cannot avoid all these kinds of failures
so the logical conclusion is you have to
cope with failure happening sooner or
later sure so when people come to me and
they ask me how should I learn air lane
I usually recommend your book I
recommend Joe Armstrong's book do you
have any papers that you would recommend
papers or books that you would recommend
beyond those two books yes Jim Gray's
paper I think it's 1986 how compute why
computer stops and why computer stuff
and what can we do about it which is not
about Erlang at all it's about hardware
solutions to computers but the
philosophy that's in that paper is
pretty much the entire thing that guides
you to the right decisions that Erlang
makes and yeah so if people want me to
know what gives you the best way to
think about airline it's a paper that is
not about the language yeah
same underlying principles though that
that particular paper is one of my
favorites I think it's really
interesting because Jim Gray worked for
tandem computer at the time which had
the the nonstop computer at least two
computers crammed into one housing and
well it was software failures was the
ultimate cause of my computer stuff is
that accurate
they they have good protections against
suffer failures at the same point by
just replicating things that were
happening most of the failures that they
had turned out to be well a bunch of
them at the time was Hardware because
Hardware was far less reliable than it
is today but one of the shining examples
that they brought in there is that the
two biggest causes of outages they had
in production or due to not deploying
patches for buggy software and then the
other greatest cause was deploying
patches for buggy software itself and so
it still again it's everything is
terrible they kind of give you the idea
that you don't deploy a patch that
doesn't hurt you right now well for a
problem doesn't hurt you because any
modification is kind of risky sure and
one of the things that this paper kind
of mentions is that operators are entire
part of the system and that brings me to
the other papers are possibly talks that
I would recommend for that which is from
Richard C Cooke I think and he's a
researcher who worked with the
healthcare industry in terms of how you
make reliable systems that go well and
the approach that he recommends tightly
integrates really the practice of
operating the system into its overall
quality in life and life time and Erlang
is one of these interesting languages
where a runtime operation and the
ability to pop service system is baked
into the platform as opposed to
something you have to write hooks by
yourself into every program you write
yeah I think having worked on on
large-scale production airline systems I
think what's unique to me and I wonder
about your thoughts about this I think
what I found that's unique for airline
systems is the engineers that build that
tend to also be the operators of it
there seems to be less of a distinction
there is that your experience yes for a
simple reason I think that it's hard to
find system administrators or operators
that also know our language sir one
usually fuel Birgit a company you're
possibly entering it into the company by
a small product and everybody is like if
you want to put that in production if
they care for it you're preparing people
to be willing to do that yeah but
overall I think it's a good practice
I've worked in companies before where
the people deploying and running the
software are not those who write it and
you tend to have that kind of attitude
alerts just throw in a software over
defense and there is a very difficult
time communicating between the two
realities of them of both teams to
ensure that software e right is easy to
operate and run into production and
having at least one person on the team
that's able to do both responsibilities
I think increases the help of a running
system over time tremendously yeah it
establishes sort of a a positive
feedback cycle yeah where you understand
the consequence of your actions yes yes
and your family feels it as well because
you're on the pager rotation and that's
a downside of it you don't like that but
if you care about software quality maybe
not sleeping all nights this kind of a
company it's kind of crappy but yeah
there hopefully does a better way in
future but I don't know or there's a
better way already I just work for
people who didn't know how to organize
that and I didn't either
I don't know of any better way either I
mean the the ways that you seem to be
better or less effective or
significantly more expensive yeah which
in I think
in both of the domains that we work in
people aren't willing to pay $100,000
per line of code no no if it were
possible I think Coco would be a lot
more interesting
yeah so of the other of the talks that
you've seen in the conference have there
been any standout one to you I mean this
conference right now has had some very
interesting big names speaking guy
Steele has given in the past one of my
favorite talks of all time which is
growing a language and he gave one where
he just went through the kind of
notation that programming language
researchers use when describing their
own programming language and making the
history of that that one I found to be
extremely interesting but there's just a
lot of big names who know a lot more
than I do and it's fairly trusting for
me to get into that kind of aspect with
really being in the same room as the big
names around yeah so I'm actually not
familiar with growing a language can you
basically it's the approached of I would
say that the scheme or with philosophy
where guy still just starts to talk by
assuming that all words with three or
four letters are now by the audience and
every other word introduced in talk he
has to explain it to find them okay and
has he goes you just built that entire
language with all the terms required to
make complete sentences that are easy to
understand for everyone and it kind of
shows that idea that what you need is
the extensibility to create your own
language and expand yeah interesting
yeah it's a great talk if only for the
execution of it yeah
well I don't think I have any more
questions all right thank you very much
right thanks for having me yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
