called Corona we are one of the largest
earning shops in the world with about 80
people working on a code base of half a
million to a million lines of code
dependently found and with this many
people we've had to come up with ways to
make access to storage a little bit more
disciplined than just calling read and
write against the database directly so
what we did was we wrote this workflow
engine where people write their business
logic is a set of pure functions and
then they declare and simply dsl what
data they would like to read and write
and the framework takes care of managing
the actual access to storage for them it
turns out that when you have to sort of
framework in place it's very
straightforward to add certain features
to a database Nigeria purely client side
without touching this rubber at all by
just doing some well-known tricks and
things like that so if you're interested
in our scale earning development or a
distributed key value stores and how to
make it more usable you should come to
