the usual talk done about the Ericsson
team and what we have on the agenda do
you hear is it this is strange now not
good it is it is good okay okay now then
about this agenda we had our latest
release release the late februari and
that's the one you were running I
suppose all of you and I would like to
thank you very much for for testing
before the release it was very valuable
and the release went very well and we
have only found minor problems and we
always strive to to improve performance
in every release so and it's much about
scalability and if you despite that
should discover something that is not
better than before even worse than
before I think you should let us know so
we can fix it in this era of multi-core
processors and more and more course it
is quite tricky to be better on all
systems at the same time when you
optimize for something it can
and we measure it seems to be better but
it could be worse on another system so
we try to focus on some systems but
hopefully it will not degrade on ma the
release plans for the future we have
done surgical service releases I hear
that you happen something with
microphone here in June September and
December preliminary service releases
for or 16 B and then we have the next
major release in about a year I can also
mention here that we have found recently
at windows buggy its present in both or
15 and our 60 and it shows itself when
you're using a line now or can impact a
time machine system and it's under heavy
load many schedulers so it's not easily
detected or it doesn't appear very often
I mean we haven't heard about it in the
whole lifetime of our 15 but we plan to
build a new binary release of that the
roadmap done what we are working with
right now I talked about maps yesterday
and that's one thing that we plan to to
have into or 17 we are working on
scheduler the schedulers they can go
offline automatically if they don't have
enough work to do or I mean if you have
real it with a small work
and too many schedulers the reason to do
that is actually can be more efficient
to Roman's fewer scheduler or you can
achieve energy savings if you can buy
this turn of course temporarily dirty
schedulers a way to to make it safer to
do nifs and drivers they will then run
in a separate thread but this could be
seen as a enhancement of the a sink pool
we have protocols the dtls which is
ssl/tls over UDP or setp asn.1
optimizations Unicode in our 17 the
eunuch according to our plan that we
have already published the default in
source code will be utf-8 Unicode in our
17b
we will improve the pattern matching but
the possibilities to bind sighs fields
in binaries and this kind of pattern
matching is also needed for the pattern
matching regarding maps we are plans on
a new string module supporting than
Unicode springs I lists binary and we
will remove things as well a number of
tools based on the old graphical library
GS like table viewer process manager app
month because all of these tools they
will reside in this observer which is a
VX based to
longer term I have a few points here of
course we have a long backlog vitara
here are some things to mention native
processes but that's a step after the
doctor scheduler and by by this we can
you can use native processes to rewrite
the file and IO servers and make them
more efficient we are working on
just-in-time compilation for a line it's
not for release in our 17 it's longer
term and we we are trying to find new
concepts for parallel is what we have
today is support for concurrency that
you have a concurrent problem but if you
want to be parallel yes because of
speeding up the sequential problem
that's another thing you need perhaps to
share data between processes
garlic will be providing I mean because
copying in a big data yes because of
working parallel is sometimes too
expensive you can create some kind of
group Susan okay we want to improve our
way of working with the allen community
we plan to to make it public the current
status of patches and bugs that comes in
through the airline patches and allen
bags mailing lists so you can follow the
status of those possibly with an issue
tracking system we will have an open
back load of things that we have think
we have to do and you can also shoot
suggest things to add that backlog and
you can help us to to implement things
in the backlog we will have a wish list
of contributions based on that backlog
and we will improve the routines around
contributions and as Francesco said lost
yesterday this industrial group is
formed and this will will be done in in
cooperation with that group will get
help from that group and I encourage you
to join that group if you want to
support the community
we will also as a step in this direction
start having experimental branches at
github where we can release new features
so that it would be easy for you to test
them and give feedback and here's the
difference between putting all the
features in the branch on its way to our
17 for example because then its a mix of
all new things here we can have a
separate feature together with the
stable or 16 for a song and maps is one
thing that we are thinking of releasing
us in this way and there is other things
like sharing preserving coping which is
developed by the European community
release research project dirty schedule
is another one it could be released like
this and here is some examples of wish
list or contributions where we can I
mean come cooperate sometimes it
requires quite close cooperation with us
them to have it in the system but some
other parts are quite separate and of
course not everything of this kind is
not necessarily part of the early no TP
distribution it could be separate tools
enhancing for the a-line experience
okay that was all from Eric's on today
any questions yes
12 11 key to ask you about the
components of messaging which is
we have an elicitor communities topic
that stuff and some that part are 14 job
we did our 16 message 60 is getting sold
the I know there's a lot of opinions and
there are lots of perspectives about
this but what is the Erickson position
about this making improvement or making
some changes messaging coupons
in communication okay message is about
speed of message passing and I mean we
always strive to dust one mekinese that
we strive to make more efficient in
every release so I mean I know about
usage thinking that the message passing
got worse between our 14 hour 15 so far
in our 16 i don't i'm not aware of
anything but it can always be special
corner cases which is not part of our
tests where we try to look like typical
applications
it is lower and the reason why that es
seem thread will be getting started on a
short benchmark and actually took
performance for the system and made it
look like message passing slower we
disable the essence ready for the short
benchmark actually the same performance
yes that that is one saying I mean we
have started with our 16 here to try to
have something we call characteristics
impact in the release note and that is
the impact we can foresee in this new
release and that's new information for
four users but I'm to have other things
like if we have and maybe that could be
Anna characteristics impact but we have
changed the default and starting up a
link to always use I think threads and
that's the case you are describing but
if you don't have a sink threads you can
achieve better performance but you have
an unreal bus system which can block on
on potential dangerous file operations
but you get better throughput if
everything goes happy any requests
40 points no no direct plans because our
main customers don't need them but we
can if you get help in that area okay
yes I think so I'm not sure actually
the 11 problems
like to write yeah yes sir I think we
have even if it's not the default build
we have all that is required in the code
okay I have to check
like a web UI for tools that I think it
guess something that would be incredibly
helpful for systems we bill it's like
some sort of web tools are baby but I
can't run that most the time
so the question was I didn't hear so
well but you are asking for web UI to or
web UI yes
but most of these graphical tools you
can run them on another box than the one
you are inspecting yes it would be nice
with a web UI please contribute I we
actually we actually have one adding
application called web web tool that we
plan to remove because it's crap it's
used in in one tool called trash dump
viewer and we plan to do that inside
this observer tool instead okay okay
seems the questions are over thank you
very much done
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
