project with a team of outstanding
individuals we work towards creating a
mechanism that you can craft Erlang and
Linux into creating platforms that can
run on embedded system devices like
raspberry PI's and big one blacks and
maybe you want to give a bit of context
for people to you just it's sort of
where you're at in the project and also
maybe just the maturity it's pretty
clearly taught by something like a real
little example not in a measuring a
cornet in your pacemaker this is the
precedent of that claim sure so we're
fairly mature at this point there's a
lot of platforms that we actually
support there's a great deal of an
audience that's out there that's using
it to be able to build projects for
themselves but there's also people that
are shipping in production so we found
that people from makers all the way to
using ana warehousing also shipping GPS
and devices that operate on ships for
marine usage
there's people using it in smart homes
and new ones are popping up all the time
we're pushing on it to be able to try to
get a nice stable release to the product
after a 1l coming up pretty soon so
we're hoping that that's going to start
really invigorate in the community
definitely there's a bunch of good
presentations out there as well if
people want to find out further about it
right I think the nervous guys expect me
to do yeah if you a visit NURBS project
org you can find more information videos
how-to guides we're always looking for
more contributors to be able to put
together maybe some tutorials for
weekend projects or fun little
activities you can even check out more
documentation from our github site
github.com forward slash nerds - project
and from there there's links to videos
and conference talks and projects and
more
and the ears piece of tutorials fairly
often as well like a diameter Lisa
confidence and some of the other
competences
yes actually coming up this year at
elixir Tom 2017 in Seattle will be
putting on a two-day workshop where we
talk about building devices with all
kinds of goodies sensors it's going to
be surrounded by the Raspberry Pi 0w so
also be neat as vehicle and they sneeze
death so you just presented here this
morning is alright and you want to give
to the media flavor for a cold moist
version when you're talking about sure
it's been always difficult to be able to
try to convey what nerves is about and
some people get that running airline on
an embedded system is sort of old news
and there's not much new about that but
in reality it's quite difficult to be
able to put together all the components
necessary that you might need to be able
to create a system
so what nerves is really about what the
talk about today was how to be able to
build recipes how to be able to use
nerves as a tool to construct the
complete recipe of modifications that
might be needed to be made in Linux or
additional applications outside of their
language you want to be able to use in
conjunction with the beans up and this
include least that's happening in the DM
ecosystem as well right with like what
you will do with experience he makes and
he's giving you some more fun in
technology I think you can can take
advantage of all that as well yeah all
of the entire community is available to
pretty much all of the packages that
you'd find in text as well as writing
user interfaces using Phoenix you can
also use front-end languages to be able
to do that bring in whatever you can
with a anymore
jQuery
there's just so much out there at your
fingertips now to be able to get the
work done
yeah yes I think that's a really losing
that unique assist them and I think
never lying is obviously the backbone
and pillar to do so much of this and the
beam is so important to that but I think
there's lots of unique heavy stuff
happening - and then how's your
conference experience been so far I mean
have you enjoyed Oh Stockholm in Sweden
is probably one of my the most beautiful
places I have visited and the people are
so friendly interacting with everybody
from experience with LFE or just plain
airline or elixir there's a quite a
friendly atmosphere that we're all
getting along we're all working together
sort of on the same goal we all want to
be able to see more and more happening
on the beam and the advancements to the
beam ecosystem yeah it's very cool
definitely been interesting to see the
evolution and back okay well thanks a
ton for chatting is anything else that
last one it may be that you want to
share wish list you want to get out to
the community of the contributions
anything like that
oh so it's insanely difficult as a bunch
of hardware engineers and developers to
be able to be crafty and make beautiful
websites so contributions are fantastic
when it comes to documentation as well
as some pretty website work and graphics
so I mean in reality any contribution is
welcome whether it's the smallest
one-line change to Docs or really large
level projects they all have a huge
impact so well I'll raise my end to help
out on the docks actually so that we can
reach out to suggest near myself my
name's Willie and we'll rope you in okay
well thanks pencil community sure thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
