metaphors we compute why my name is
alvaro and i'm all sound on twitter if
you want to know more about me I wrote
that article how I went from selling
food in the street to working in tech
it's on medium and you can read the
whole thing there so I'm not like I said
we say in my country I only went to
university to use a toilet or the
restrooms that's the only reason why
yeah so yeah anyway this article is
already published by the ACM queue and
also the the printed version so you can
read it there if you if you feel like
going to the next track so the year is
1980 this is like a year before I was
born and there was a book published by
Lakoff &amp;amp; Johnson it was called metaphors
we live by so you can see that I the
title is not really that original
actually this book was so influential
that a lot of people came up with
metaphors we I don't care what else bye
so yeah there are a lot of books like
that and the main idea of this book is a
metaphor essentially a matter of poetry
and rhetorical flourish as that was
understood before they say that metaphor
dictates how we behave in the world how
we think and so on
because they were cognitive scientists
they wanted to study the brain but there
weren't many voluntaries to open their
brains and let them see what was inside
they say ok let's use a proxy that
proxies language so that's why they got
into getting into the metaphor thing and
just to give you an example ok so they
say metaphor dictates how we think how
we behave how we perceive and how our
conceptual system is built but as an
example they say that argument is war
this is how we humans in general we
understand when we argue with another
person or frame of work is war or battle
so because we understand it that way we
say that your claims are indefensible he
attached every weak point in my argument
I demolished his argument I never won an
argument with him his criticisms were
right on target and so on because we
understand argument as for whenever we
start arguing with one to destroy the
other person shall I go to any just
shout outside that V is Emacs rather
than VI or that you should use tabs and
spaces and you will see what happens
anyway the thing is yeah they asked
because that is the frame of mind when
we get into a discussion that's what
happens and they ask what will happen if
argument will be seen as a dance that we
need to collaborate to reach a common
goal how are we going to see the other
person and how are we going to treat
them but I see you are not convinced so
when somebody's not convinced we talk
about politics so I mean just think
about the United States and okay I'm
kicked out of the conference now I just
think like they want to kick some
immigrants but the immigrant they want
to keep inside they are called dreamers
that's a really nice way of speaking of
people you want to keep in you have a
really nice thing to say they're here
for the American dream or whatever it is
or in Spanish the
the ones that arrived in Latin America
we are conquistadores conquerors they
are not really nice sounding words but
in America they are settlers because it
just came there and the native people
say yeah you can just settle here I go
to the other side of the river and to
the other side of the river and at some
point the natives were on them on the
MIT license and then in the revolution
BSD license but you know what happens
when you cross the Mississippi right
anyway more into the point there is a
BBC article that say how metaphors shape
women's lives the article is really
interesting but it has a paragraph that
says that it was an experiment where
they asked two group of people to
analyze the statistics on crime some of
them had the metaphor that there was a
wild beast preying on the city and
another one that there was a virus
infecting the city the wild beast people
they really wanted harsh punishment for
those criminals and the other wants it
more like let's try to reform them help
them stop being criminals whatever thing
is when they ask these people why you
want to punish them because the data
look at the data both have this exact
same data one had the beast narrative
the other had the virus narrative but to
keep going there is a nice book from the
90s called feminism confront technology
by Judy vitamin I guess and she studied
how language started changing the way
technology was seen in the eighties and
how women started to be pushed out of IT
and it's because we change what's hard
and soft meant so because I'm a man I'm
a macho I need to show my testosterone
but whatever I do testosterone jsb
probably can search on NPM I don't know
and they they started using like all
this hard language that this is really
what how we identify as geeks you please
stay out of my realm and she keeps going
on that book on this study by this
person Coburn
explaining how language was used in a
way that didn't make it so friendly
anymore for for women that's research
there I can see that you're still not
convinced and I can see if I speak here
probably anyway human resource
management that's a really nice metaphor
for maybe another industry but do you
think you're just a resource as a
programmer that a manager can come
replace you put you there and keep
working like we people are usually not
resources but when you have this
metaphor in mind and the manager
probably has no idea too much about what
programming actually is they think they
can replace you and and it doesn't
really work that way but when you work
on that framework then yeah through your
warning metaphors there are conferences
on the other side of the pond that they
like to give platform to racist people
and when people complain to them they
defend themselves instead of taking the
criticism from the from the community
and one of the articles they brought was
called wrestling with inclusion at
whatever the name of that conference and
I wonder why are they're wrestling with
inclusion why don't you just work
together with inclusion or talk to
inclusion I don't know but why you need
to wrestle with inclusion just questions
to think how we talk how we speak how
this make us behave one way or another
but I'm pretty sure you're here to talk
about computers so I was not going to
keep my rant going and going on that now
my run took another diversion you
probably saw that film hidden figures
about the women that had NASA put in
many space they were computers and at
some point somebody came up with this
big machine that cool actually out
traumatize all these things and they
were just called
well automatic computers and with the
passage of time the automatic word got
dropped and now
computers are these things we use
everyday and in another article by sadi
II I can't remember her family name
sorry she has a book called zero
someone's about the influence of women
in computing and she say at some point
when working with von Neumann it was a
wife of unknown man and many others
there were computers building computers
like actual human computers building the
original computers so why does it matter
that this is a word used for one thing
and then usually used for something else
because metaphors they enable
understanding we use metaphors all the
time just to explain things today in the
in the talk about how this build this
theater in Germany he said that the
sound was transparent unclear usually
sound is transparent
I think but we use that I mean I'm not
taking from his talk actually is a
really good example of how we use all
these concepts to explain things that we
don't really know how to explain
so metaphors they enable understanding
but a metaphor is not I want to one
mapping of this thing we are trying to
understand like when Shakespeare saves
Juliet is like the Sun we don't
understand that Juliet is some sort of
atomic bomb all the time blowing up and
I don't know we just understand that
Romeo's life it goes around here he
depends on helpful for being alive
whatever they like is the reason for him
to be alive I don't know but we don't
understand that Juliet gave him cancer
like that's skin cancer sorry because
it's not a one-to-one mapping it's just
we see patterns on on a domain and we
translate those patterns to a different
domain and this is analyzing this book
called the geometry of meaning the
semantics based on conceptual spaces by
Peter Gander garden force he's from the
Netherlands I think and he said okay
well why can't I use topology to
understand language because that's what
people ask when you have a PhD grant or
something I know
and she says that metaphorical mappings
they preserve the cognitive topology of
the source domain in a way that is
consistent with inherent structure of
the target domain so metaphors they
transfer information from one conceptual
domain to another and what we transfer
is a pattern rather than domain-specific
information the atoms on the skin cancer
this stays there we understand what we
need from there so a metaphor can that
we use to identify a structuring a
domain that will not have been
discovered otherwise I will show a lot
of examples of this later on the top but
that's what metaphors are so useful
because they show ok those things in
that domain they actually look like
transparent and clear and then ok that
kind of sound yeah I know what you mean
and I think this is completely not the
graph but there's no people to back this
up I think we are doing the whole time
this graph isomorphism problem in our
minds like we see a pattern somewhere we
see it that way and they we've managed
to to match it and researchers on
conceptual blending they say that our
brains are actually pretty advanced at
discovering patterns in things compared
to computers that are made for computing
a computer is a really good tool to make
really fast calculation but it's not a
critical tool for discovering all these
patterns that we see and that we managed
to ignore when we see those
analyses let's say they put an example
in that look like Margaret Thatcher she
will never have one in the United States
because the unions in the United States
are stronger something like that the she
has the example stronger another
metaphor to explain how unions work but
he say Margaret Thatcher is a prime
minister they don't have prime ministers
in the u.s. the unions here and not the
same unions they have in the US
Margaret Thatcher will won't become a
citizen of the US and blah blah blah
blah all these things we managed to keep
them away and we understand what me what
they mean by that that she will have
gone there whatever that supposition
could mean because with this term for
translation or
transport of knowledge from one domain
to another is how it have metaphor
create new knowledge actually metaphor
in Greek I think it means to transport
maybe there's a great person here that
can correct me but yeah they did
transfer this thing from one domain to
another but they also skewed
understanding and it was a problem for
example when they tried to create the
first telegraph because telegraph means
like far writing and people were trying
to create actual far writing machines
they didn't understand that you could
encode things like in Morse code and
send this over the wire the code on the
other end and so on because Claude
Shannon wasn't born like in the 18th
century let's say so it was because
Breyer had the sign for blind people
then Morse started thinking with these
ideas of the Morse code and together
they came up with this whole code and
say ok we actually can encode language
in a different way on how we write it or
how we speak it let's say before the
Telegraph you could have like one bit of
information with a fire or over on the
top of a hill like similar to what they
do at the Lord of the Rings let's say
but back to the to the metaphor because
of people were so stuck with the
metaphor they didn't understand that
they could attach for from the actual
writing
and the Telegraph was like the cool
invention of the time that's one of the
reason why the newspaper here is called
The Telegraph because it was a cool
thing to have was when they started
having weather reports because people in
Liverpool called Telegraph's down here
and say hey this rainy here the clouds
are moving selves you will have rain in
three hours
they started catching people that were
stealing stuff because before they say
or after you just got into the Train
good luck catching me now this guy with
a beer and a square t-shirt shirt is
there in it will be in a no Paddington
in 20 minutes
touch him that was all enabled by the by
the Telegraph that means like Tuesday
change how we behave how we work in the
world let's say how we understand the
world and it's a quote by Nicholas Carr
he has a book called the shallows that
explain how the Internet is shaping our
minds and he said like sometimes our
tools do what we tell them to
other times we adapt ourselves to our
tools requirements in this case
metaphors are the tools of thought
depending on which metaphor we are using
is how we are adapting yourself or if
are we even able to see a solution for a
problem I will also show examples of
that so metaphors and code there is a
really great paper from the 50s that I
think is one of the best unknown papers
why because this paper actually came to
light because somebody started scanning
the Donald Knuth archives before that it
was probably lost somewhere and Newt
doesn't even know who wrote it he knows
to send the letter to him but here we
don't know who wrote that paper maybe if
you are there here raise your hand but
the cool thing of this paper is that the
idea this programmer had back in the 50s
about what was good code yeah like the
British and tea time I don't know what
that means she's out there but yeah some
some metaphor you're trying to show
anyway he says that or she that program
is to write to another parameter about
our solution to approach
a problem that's what we do as
programmers if you think you're coding
for a computer then probably this talk
is not for you if you think you're
calling either for your future self or
for your colleagues then this is what
I'm trying to get with this talk and
Newt says actually like a nice measure
of a good program qualities how long it
survives that I can still understand
what if what this program is doing and
that's what what this person argues on
on that paper and you probably know this
code as well program must've written for
people to read and only incidentally for
machines to execute that's from a
structure and interpretation of computer
programs and also recently I found the
paper were David wheeler
I think he's British when he introduced
the SU routine back in the 50s as well
and he says basically the SU routine is
not necessary with on these routines for
the program's to be actually run that's
like the conclusion of the paper we are
doing it because we want simplicity of
use we want correctness of code we want
accuracy of description and all
complexity issue if possible be buried
out of sites that's why we need sir it
is to make coal easier to understand is
not gonna do anything else like I can't
just write the code in a whole file and
run it it will be fine come back stay
there that's from his book he wrote the
first programming book in history
against or public book and a curiosity
is that woman is the first programmer
ever picture in a programming book and
you can see in the description there
that that's the actual library that's
your metaphor of library of programs
also routines they are explaining that
from there they can take the subroutines
and load them into the computer whatever
yeah so metaphor sank Oh like how do we
go for all this nice idea so how do you
actually apply into the code we write
every day
I think types are these characters that
tell the story in our programs are the
cultures that explain how our programs
work but if the Haskell people in the
crowd color people in the crowd are
really who this is my talk I'm not
talking about those types sorry and more
about this old paper from Barbara Liskov
she says programming with Astra data
types like how you will be your user
your cue your all these entities that
make your program and actually back in
74 I think when she wrote that paper she
had to argue that you actually should do
abstraction and actually encapsulate the
code the the industry both kind of
getting out of yeah is fine to use
functions or procedures we don't need to
just write go to everywhere and now she
came with this idea from outer space
like we can use abstraction yeah there
is a talk she gave at info queue I think
when she explained all this bits of
history how she had to kind of fight
again fight argument for for this ideas
and the point is that without types we
just have operations on stream of bytes
for a computer doesn't really matter if
you have a user or a bunch of bits and
actually one no man because we resolve
as always the discussion of are we who
is a real piranha a real programmer
types in Emacs I don't know for von
Neumann real programmer will bite will
writing byte code because this assembler
thing is just a waste of time
assembler know we need type we need a
thing that we humans can work with and
one example is like when we choose the
right data structure if we need to keep
track of us a bunch of users we can just
put all of them
into an array and that will be perfectly
fine but if they in the description they
say and this user had to be unique and
we we will have user set that
information is already encoded in the
set data structures telling me about
uniqueness of elements if I use a linked
list I may mean another thing like how
you can traverse those items the queue
gives me the information for sensors
first out the stack is the opposite and
can I use an array for any of the use
cases for sure but all these data
structures they are given me more
explanations on what this code is
actually trying to do or achieve because
I think the explanatory power of program
is a measure of its own elegance and
that the structures they have this kind
of experimental power and they can help
us get some sort of cognitive leap one
when we are trying to approach a problem
just think about what I should say
approach a problem that's completely
metaphorical problem is like problem in
I think in Latin is the same root as
object in Greek and it's when somebody
throws something at you and you need to
deal with that loser which is a
philosopher from Czech Republic I think
he's playing all this relation between
these two words
so object problem oriented programming
anyway
task scheduling don't ramble too much
tacit failure like I can try to explain
to you like yeah we need to process
these items they come into the system we
need to try to keep the order they enter
the room or blah blah or yeah just use
the terminology of queueing theory when
we understand our problem is a queue
engineering problem not only we have the
whole vocabulary related to QE theory we
actually have the theory behind it the
mathematical theory that can help us
solve the problem much faster reason
about it use maths and so on the same
with route planning
if you are like very new in the field
let's say I don't know you never heard
about graph theory and somebody tell you
to draw a route or find the route from
here to LA no Pennington it will be
quite hard to get solve this problem but
when you see that the map of the city
which is already an abstraction of the
actual city can be abstracted even more
as a graph you have the whole power of
graph theory and this is what lack of
course conceptual metaphors like the
same can be applied with rotation and
group Theory rotation is a way of seeing
or symmetry a way of seeing group theory
and all these things are metaphors of
different mathematical concepts it's not
just words replacing words we can also
work at this level with metaphors and I
think the most interesting one is come
from the database replication world back
in the 80s they tried to implement a new
way of replicating data I think it was
for C rocks and they came with the idea
of rumor mongering I like on the seminal
paper on this kind of gossip algorithms
so when you will do gossip I am a
computer I tell this new set of
information to two computers this one is
spread to other two and so on
kinda like rumor is is spread the
problem with this is really hard to
reason about about rumors yeah maybe we
have some Americans are used with the
telenovelas but not everybody has
telenovelas in their daily lives so
rumor mongering not so easy anyway but
they find out that actually this map
really cool to the concept of epidemics
when they saw there was a relation with
epidemics they saw there is also this
other book the mathematical theory of
epidemics from the 50s and they could
use all those masks to model and like
check their algorithms check that they
were actually going to converge into
whatever replication they wanted so here
you see finding the right metaphor maybe
epidemic is not the easiest one to
explain things
we rumor-mongering have it easier to say
how data will be spread out but when we
need to actually when the purpose is to
reason about it maybe this one is much
better so I don't remember no it's not
from this conference but it was not an
argument today on Twitter as I said as
it happens there is always argument on
Twitter about category theory and I
think was Jaron Minsky yeah category
theory saying that concept like map mat
a bowl of maple or whatever you
pronounce that are easier for beginners
and then there was this other person
saying no we shall use functors because
this is a well defined mathematical
entity sure but this is really easy to
understand this is really easy to work
with mathematically maybe maple or
however you pronounce that is really
easy for me to get it as a beginner I
will show you an example later of a
similar mistake I was doing but then
when people are using it when they fall
in love with it okay go with the
function notation and throw all the math
look into their heads but maybe we need
to find ways to get the concepts across
and then keep growing the a thing so
everything is a metaphor I don't believe
you okay let's grab this from
distributed system metaphors
whenever node needs to agree on a common
value we start consensus algorithm to
decide on on a value they there's
usually a little process that takes care
of making the final decision based on
votes it has received from its peers
even received decision all these are
takes care this is all metaphor though
this then it continues knows communicate
sending messages over a channel which
might get congested due to too much
traffic this cool create an information
bottleneck with queues at each end of
the channels backing up
and finally this bottlenecks my render
one or more nodes and responsive causing
network partitions again is the process
that that's taking too long to respond
dead we won now unless we set a timeout
it's just metaphors on top of metaphors
on top of metaphors maybe when you are
really good at understanding those
mathematical concept is because you
already built this scaffolding of
metaphors Lakoff has a book called where
mathematics come from and his plane like
when we understand things like the
number line that's a metaphor and then
we keep building on top of that until we
get to machinery numbers and things like
that so this metaphor literally
everywhere like here who doesn't love
and a good password in in the breakfast
so buzzwords you can guess which one
that is container right why I bring this
one up because I think containers as a
metaphor has a really cool story a
really nice elevator pitch let's say
that I can bring the waiter pitch again
that's a complete metaphor I'm not
getting any of you into an elevator so
containers they are standard they can be
shipped anywhere they can fit on train
ships and trucks they can be stuck they
can be reused we can understand that we
like that is really easy to explain to
talk about we understand that we don't
need to fill a ship full of containers
to do an actual shipment we get it that
the metaphor doesn't stretch that far
and we have a really nice thing to to
have a story about this new technology
anybody can go and sell containers even
if nobody knows what containers are
actually about I have no clue by the way
then will this happen in the future will
be be like highly the guy from the
comments
highly diving bell like he created this
thing to go under the sea to recover
rakish from shipment will there be any
company that will come later and do a
recovery of all the garbage we created
with the container industry who knows
that's your free startup idea don't
don't create me and another one is
microservices
when I was reading this
paper let's say or this article the
whole time i'm before i was a longer
yeah I know I've been there I suffered
that period of my life now and then when
I was reading this paper I was all the
time saying this is every single parent
this is that one this is that one they
say K we have this centralized
governance we can't have Mona Lisa
versus micro service just think of the
power of the world monolith like that's
like showing the Austrian age guy into a
discussion you know they won from 1939
if you throw monolith today you want
like you are building a monolith boom
okay
end of story this provides isolation
collaboration small is better big is
cumbersome David versus Goliath all the
whole story who microservices and yeah I
was wondering is this Erlang and in the
last footnote of that article you can
check it online they say in another
direction one could argue that micro
services are the same thing at the LM
programming model but applied to an
enterprise application context so are
you an Allen fine boy that came here to
cry about how Ellen didn't work no my
question is what a long elevator pitch
how do you explain the cool things about
Ellen I'm sorry in in like really short
time we make program done that don't
crash who which programmer will tell you
yeah I right so where that trashes I'm
pretty sure nobody will raise their
hands and we write reliable software
yeah me too in PHP you know and it's
because I came from the PHP community
into the Allen community and many of
these arguments for me were like I don't
care but the binary thing that was
pretty cool so that's what got me more
into Alan but anyway
Basia ones elevator pitch readable code
yeah but Mike who will tell you that
they don't write readable code
it's what they say there is no CC pulses
there are non in PHP common Libre yeah
in there what is the same it neither I
won't say it but yeah yeah like in the
world of the blind the one-eyed man is
the king right that's yeah that's
another see maybe not that nice but yeah
that's me when I defend PHP anyway the
figis first get people to understand
things then explain how things actually
work you probably know me from rabbitmq
and when I was going around talking
about rabbitmq people came to me and say
hey but RabbitMQ is a job server no it's
not a job server it's a messaging server
because a message is a higher
abstraction that a job and use a job you
are limiting yourself about what can you
do with Robby this amazing product
dude dude chillax I don't care anymore
this other tool is much easier because
yeah let's allow people to use rabbit or
calf cow I don't care what us whatever
they think it is and then we keep
putting the other layers of abstraction
which is a function is that a thing I
could do an app on I don't know at least
I understood it I managed to use it and
I think job server yeah it worked for me
late suddenly I understood this too late
conclusion I think we need to master the
art of metaphor selection the master the
art of meaning amplification and
understand that our program is a
metaphor for the solution we found we
had a problem we found a solution and
that is materialized let's say into that
program that we found there those are
the references because I know you're all
eager to go read that I recommend
metaphors we live by is one of my top
books ever if you don't wanna get in the
whole theory very in detail then
is another they secret life of metaphor
and how it shapes the way we see the
world that one is really interesting
yeah and that's the paper I mentioned
the information a history a theory a
flood that book is really cool about the
story of information created for the
pictures and thank you very much yep
okay so we have time for some questions
thank you very much lots of food for
thought I remember the paper I read many
years ago that said the best programmers
are the ones who have got many different
abstractions in their head and they can
apply them in for the particular problem
they they want to solve actually I think
it was bill wolf who had written that
paper but somehow it sounds related to
the idea of the metaphor to fine the
metaphor I don't know what is yeah I
think whenever we are abstract or
actually in a way that's what lack of
shows in this other book where
mathematics come from I think is that
abstractions are metaphorical in a way
because we find this pattern that
actually or put in another way this is
the story by Borges about this town that
wanted to make a very precise map of
their city and at some point even
completely useless so an abstraction it
will overtake some things and some will
be put aside and I'm completely agree
yeah
having many abstraction that we could
apply to problems will make it much
better so you make a very powerful
argument of metaphor being important
programming or maybe even you would say
is programming I don't know how you do
that but does that point to a gap in the
education of programmers because I don't
think kind of critical thinking about
metaphor or reading any of those things
on your nice reference list is part of
many people's si s education if they do
have a formal one okay I'm as I say I'm
really glad you asked that question I
he's planted by me from before
now actually I've been thinking of what
my next step from here and I stepped
into the tree view this idea of I don't
know how many ages ago and in the
Tribune you have grammar you have logic
and you have rhetoric we focus too much
on grammar of languages on the logic
user program zone but we don't care
about how to get the message across
which is that what rhetoric brings
together I'm actually the definition
they say grammar is input logic is
processing and rhetoric is output so
it's completely in a way metaphorically
relate to that said to to our field and
I think rhetoric is completely put aside
like we just don't care about that part
because the problem with this way of
communicating is as long as a computer
managed to be executed is good enough
most of the time we we don't put
emphasis on the human side of
programming so we should I guess I ve
found that the way you express yourself
at work write stories talk to your
teammates anything like that has changed
do you should so not trying to use
aggressive language you know wrestling
with or etc if you made any changes and
how have you made your teammates take on
those changes I tried to yeah to be more
careful about what I said because I
think it's important
my rule is if something is offensive or
whoever I take that person as the acid
they think that that it's just my
behavior because Who am I to judge what
offends you or whoever so in that sense
I think is very interesting to try to
change how we we talk or what we say or
or even think why is it okay to say
things like that in on a call more
cultural context but yeah because it's
just to think about the okay and in the
database industry say holder a slave
versus master
put it out and just think about the
conquerors versus settlers we are so
nice we just came here to so the whole
narrative you can put around it is
completely different the same about this
blameless blameless postmodern culture
versus who did it who is at fault like
when people say get blame that's already
it's just not good
archaeology or whatever it is I saw a
different joke on tea table and remember
the exact yeah punchline punchline yeah
anyway all right it's time to speak</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
