spill game's first question any of you
ever had to deal with like spaghetti
code or you know lots of so I'm going to
talk today a little bit about our
adventure to turn out big ball spaghetti
into some nicely structure than layered
lasagna so first a little bit about spil
games and where we come from spil games
is basically a mainly a publisher of
online casual games we house about 50
portals worldwide localized and targeted
to specific audiences like girls and
family and teens we throw about 200
million unique users per month with
various types of games mostly casual
games social games but also games on on
your tablets and cell phone devices
we've had a nice and steady growth over
the past five six years from less than
then like 15 million to the numbers we
are currently at and obviously this
takes quite a bit of work to support so
the tech department grew exponentially
to support this and you know we brought
in a lot of contractors external
companies to help us lots of leavers
joiners
and a lot of these people we didn't
really have the time to to put the hats
in the same direction so everybody just
you know did their own thing and I
contributed to our spaghetti bowl which
led to our current system design which
looks a little bit like this lots of
stuff going all over the place
interfacing mixed with business logic
cashing in various levels database
schemas all over the place and you know
as things grow your database is growing
and at a certain point it just doesn't
scale anymore so we try to you know
alleviate the problem by doing things
like you know shark making multiple
reader databases but obviously write a
database bottlenecks remains we had all
these all our components talking to each
other and since everybody had his own
cash you were hitting several cash
layers at once and they were not always
in sync so it's really hard to predict
if a user would get the correct data so
to sum it up we had like a big
inconsistent design the interfaces each
each of the components had their own set
of interface patterns it was not really
clear where everything was and it you
know we accumulate quite a bit of
technical debt so it was like swimming
in the mud but it wasn't all bad we
earned a lot of money with it
that so here we are now we have a very
nice view we but it's a precarious
balance and we climbed up there
ourselves so yeah time to do something
about that so what do you do when you
start a fresh first thing you do is come
up with some fancy words our new
architecture was to be flexible
predictable and scalable so what do we
mean by these words that obviously the
explanation came after coming up with
the words so flexible we need to be able
to change where we need to change
without having to you know stick things
together with duct tape we need to be
able to service all the different
clients to our system as they need and
not as the service or software component
things is designed we need to be able to
you know think of something today and
implement tomorrow basically and another
thing currently we run on our own
hardware but we want to be able to
deploy this to any kind of hardware
virtual machines cloud systems you
namings predictability very important we
need to be able to know what will happen
when we do a release we need to be able
to predict the behavior of the system
and we need to be able to have like a
really stable API so you know client
software connecting to our system knows
what to expect and knows how to
implement and we need to be a need to
have predictable response times
and last but not least predictable
delivery times like we need to be able
to know how long it will take to develop
a new feature or product and scalability
I don't think that really requires an
explanation so this these these three
points they they led us to to make some
choices first thing is we want to make
everything simple obvious one second
thing clean separation so we're first we
had like stuff going all over the place
now we want to create pieces which are
responsible for one thing and we
actually can more easily predict stuff
we don't want dependencies horizontally
we want to have like a clear path
through our system from top to bottom
and the last two bits things must be
able to keep running when things fail
and we want to be able to distribute
over many many machines these letters to
choose for a layered architecture you
know sorry oh yeah sure sure sure yeah
layered architecture this is your
typical classic interior architecture
and we came up with four layers from top
to bottom client layer this is basically
the stuff that connects to our system we
have fairies of those like our portals
themselves you know stuff that runs in
the browser JavaScript things like that
but also the the games we run they need
to you know drop their high scores and
things like that and the show so games
they have they have backends and those
backends need to be able to connect our
system so these for these clients we
create client libraries to East
integration to to to our system but also
it's not only for for you know third
parties but also for ourselves we have
like a JavaScript library to ease our
own portal integration and these keep a
little bit of state the client state so
who is this user where is it coming from
what what what local is he and stuff
like that second layer interface layer
here we do the authentication so
authentication is not only using a
password this is like once a user has
authenticated using his username
password we gave him sort of you know a
token and that is kept at the client so
next time we can identify him here we do
aggregation so we pull data from the
layer below and we you know wrap this
together package it and we can send this
off to the client we do no no changing
of the data just now pulling in bits and
constructing output plus validation of
input really important
the service layer is where we stick the
business logic so what does business
logic is like the authorization part so
okay we know this user who the user is
what made this user do macy the last
name or first name of another user may
he upload high score things like that
plus it pulls the data from the storage
and it can do some transformation on
this data so if we store an ID in the
data for an avatar in the service layer
we can transform this to a URL and at
the bottom we have the storage layer
which which is the only place where we
do caching for example this is where we
actually store the data and it should
take care of distributing the data for
us so at my application level I
shouldn't need to care about how this is
stored or how big my data droves this is
handled down in the storage layer and
this brings us a nice bonus having the
caching done down there plus keeping a
little bit of the client state in the
client is that the middle two layers we
can keep them stateless so this makes it
very easy to scale up so these are the
basic layout of the of the of the of the
parts of our system now the components
of the of the system how how do we do we
actually implement the stuff within
these layers we realized that you know
we have like within these these
different areas we have like heart
problems and simple problems also we
have like few very smart people and it's
very easy to come by you know more
junior developer people so we thought we
should do something with that and we
thought of abstracting the stuff into
two different building blocks firstly
most which is the most common thing in
our systems just the regular application
these are very small and very simple to
build anyone should be able to do this
they have little responsibility they
have you know just a single thing to do
and this makes them easy to test and
easy to deploy obviously for the more
complex stuff like the sharding and you
know
processing of of you know the stuff
stuff in our widget platform which I
come to later these these types of
things there they are you know they're
more difficult so we actually created
like sort of platforms on top of which
we could run these smaller applications
so we can abstract way the difficult
things and have you know the senior
developers work on this these things are
built to last and they don't have to be
deployed at often and the stuff that
that needs a lot of change remains small
and simple and we can deploy them
separately so since we're a gaming
company I'm going to do a walk-through
since we like cheating so from top to
bottom the the client layer I'm not
really going to focus in too deep
because this is actually sort of out of
the ddd application domain it's it's at
the client we do not really have control
over it we you know we created we gave
it out there but actually it's it's not
within that we you can't really control
whether what happens there and you're
not you know you don't have to use our
stuff to talk to our system so at the
top the system of the the interfaces
take for example a social game or just a
simple flash game which which talk to
our system the social game in this case
is family barn they want to get some
user data for a particular player
so what they do they you know they do a
HTTP POST request with with a JSON blob
to our to our interface layer this the
data they send its it's not arbitrary we
have like a really well-defined API
layer the the user interface in this
case which takes the the request will
then you know deconstruct the token do
the authentication bit and see okay i
know the ID of this particular user and
it will then start firing of requests in
parallel to the surface layer so to get
a user's profile we need to fetch some
different elements like the the data of
the user himself but for example we want
to have the number of words this user
has the list of friends he has so we've
we fetch that data we get it back but
the friends list is a list of ID's so we
need to enrich this with some user data
so we do another request to the user
service after that to fetch the list of
user data belonging to the friends and
then we can construct the output for for
the for the users information and pass
that back to the client key thing here
is that the interface does as much in
parallel as possible for a high score
it's a much simpler thing it will first
fetch a list of high scores if the game
wants to show a list of high scores and
then after that get the user information
associated to each of these high scores
the other thing connecting to our system
is obviously our our portals here's one
and for this we built like a widget
system what is a widget well if you look
at a web page it's composed of all kinds
of blocks of functionality really and
you could see these things as as
actually separate you know calls like
goes to a separate interface on our
system so each widget is in essence the
same as an interface so what what what
what is a widget for example at the top
we have the profile box so we need to
fetch some user data the profile widget
is basically a widget is basically a set
of first a definition and the definition
is what is the input of this for this
particular widget a set of logic you
know to fetch the data plus an HTML
basically an early detailed template in
our case and these three combined result
in an HTML output plus some properties
which can be passed back into the system
come back to that later so obviously
you're not requesting each and every
widget separately you're actually just
you know fetching one page so
if you if you would look at the page at
the top we have like the header bit and
it's it's composed of a few blocks so we
group them into a header header widget
which is actually a widget which says
okay I have for child widgets and these
need to be created first and then from
there output I can create my output and
so on so at the top I have like my
homepage widget which contains which
says okay i have three parts a filter a
body and a header and they contain sub
parts and everything needs to be you
know rendered in order to create this
homepage so in order to make this all
work these widgets they are very simple
we do not want to have the logic in
constructing all the stuff inside these
widgets we created like a platform to do
this for for us so the platform
basically what it does is it provides
all the AC to be transport it's actually
the host for the widgets and it maps
urls to to a particular widget so if i
would go to a game calm it would map it
to the homepage widget which which in
turn has all these child widgets so when
you come on to the homepage what what
the platform does it it will first
construct the tree so it it works
through all these definitions and it
constructs a tree of all this widget and
then starts executing the
the rendering step also the platform
takes any input parameters like cookies
and pose and get parameters and it and
it bundles them into a structure it
would do the authentication for all
these widgets so it actually creates a
sort of context for each widget to run
and each widget has in its definition
which parameters its needs so it the
platform will actually only pass along
the parameters which have been defined
so once it starts doing the rendering
step it will iterate over the tree and
start rendering in parallel all these
these elements of the page and you know
once one is done once once for example
all these four ones below are done then
the one at the top can render at and so
on and NZ at the end the the page is
rendered and is being returned to the
client so the the hold of widget thing
sits at the interface layer obviously
there are some client code also being
bundled here but you know these are
these are JavaScript files and they're
there and not executed here they're just
delivered through here so there they're
not part of the interface layer so the
profile widget in this case it needs to
show the user name so it has it fetches
its data from the user surface and it
fetches and it needs to display some
score which is calculated from the
amount of award so it fetches some data
from the award service so what are these
services
they sit below and when a request comes
in to fetch for example I use it some
user data the context information is
passed along and the service then first
checks the data the context so who is
this user what do you need it fetches
the data from the storage then for
example if the the user Joan has said
this profile to private then the user
service will then filter out the stuff
that you that the requesting user is not
allowed to see and then it can transform
the avatar ID into a actual URL based on
the configuration the service has has
gotten so here we filter and we modify
we do not catch this stuff why not
basically we do not do very difficult
logic it's really just filtering and
just small transforms and it you don't
want to catch any any like sort of
poisoned data so for one user the
filtering is different for another so
you need to need to catch a lot of data
and the chances that you would hate the
cash are very low
at the bottom we have the storage
platform I'm not going to go into a
great detail on this if you want to know
more about that then you either if you
have seen enriquez talk yesterday
morning then you already know a lot
about this and otherwise check the video
suffice it to say that it actually
provides an API to our data it's a it's
a it's a yeah it's a sort of key value
store but with a schema so we actually
define the the actual data that goes
into into it so it's not just a key and
a blog post data but actually a like an
SQL table we say what fields we have and
so we can do like lots of cool things
like filtering and sorting but check the
video as last component in their system
we decouple some data from from
decouples from some processes from the
critical path like sending emails or
whatever if the user registers then they
need to get welcome email you don't want
that to to be handled in main line we
did that before and then the email
system went down and then the users
could not register anymore so that's not
a good idea so everything that's not
critical to do just decouple it so what
we did is we made a definition of the
actual messages which we could put on a
message person we use a RabbitMQ for
that which specifies what is the sender
which user are we talking about a very
strict schema of data to put in these
messages and each each component in our
system can you know put a message on it
saying hey I did this so we can create
handlers to react to certain situations
there are not actually sending messages
to a particular
process but it's the other way around if
we want to implement some extra
functionality we can just hook into it
and you know at this thing these
handlers day they should also be very
simple one task only if you have three
tasks to do on a particular message
create three handlers so so we can
easily trace what's but what's going on
so after running through our system you
know we have all these components and
they they they need to need to talk to
each other and actually a quite tricky
bit because you know we run multiple
servers multiple versions if you do a
deployment one version might not be the
same as the other when you so when you
introduce a new parameter somewhere you
don't want stuff to crash because the
order of deployment was wrong or
whatever you just want it to work so one
thing was really important that you know
everything needs to speak the same
language and if I do a new deployment
somewhere and and and and I need some
extra data or I've removed some data so
some parameter it still needs to work
even if if the middle component was not
deployed yet or whatever so yeah we need
some sort of messaging protocol which
allows for you know skipping data which
we which we get but we don't need or
allows for now still working if you
don't get the data so for this we use a
protocol buffers internally which allows
this behavior and to the clients we
could also use protocol buffers but
since we have like a lot of JavaScript
like clients we also allow Jason there
which works very nicely obviously that's
not the whole story if you are allowing
these different these different messages
you still need to have like some sort of
control over over what what happened so
we strictly define everything so each
each input message output message its
URL it's each function each type the
validation everything is defined very
strictly when we do a change we need to
adhere to ferry straight rules so if I
add a parameter it cannot be a parameter
which must be there because if I would
do that and something has not
implemented yet it would crash so it
must be optional unless you're very very
sure and well specification is all very
nice but you know it must match the
implementation so in order to make sure
that the implementation is the same as a
specification we actually generate the
code so the specification is the source
for our basically our RPC code in all
these layers also the documentation is
generated from this so we can mitigate
the the chances of documentation being
out of
with what we have implemented so how
does that work we came up with a sort of
XML definition which allows of
specifying all this stuff but also it
allows us to add documentation and
things like that our system is which we
are building is mainly built from
airline components but it doesn't have
to be so that that's why we use this XML
thing because we can easily translate it
into different kinds of outputs for our
air long systems we translated to 2p key
which is a library which allows protobuf
and Jason encoding and decoding plus it
gives an HTTP art RPC interface and it
actually from this picky definition we
can generate the the RPC and encoding
and decoding stuff so we ended up with
like lots of small applications and they
run mostly on their own nodes so we can
deploy them separately take them down we
can you know at where we need them many
of them they run on the same machine and
you know when we grow our cluster you
know we already have hundreds of nodes
running
that gives a problem because airline
creates a fully connected graph and we
actually don't need that because you
know we only from one thing we only
connect to just a few other things and
we know exactly which ones we want to
connect to because of the definition so
we use hidden nodes and that keeps the
amount of connections nicely under
control so if I were to use just you
know connect all the nodes in the
cluster it would explode but in our case
this this we can still we can have like
loads of nodes without having loads of
connections this does need a little bit
of administration so we created a
component which we which is a library we
use in all our applications and just our
router library our application really
which which you feed a list of hosts
plus you feed a list of of applications
you need to talk to and the router taste
care of scanning all these hosts for
four nodes and then scanning all these
notes for whether or not these
applications are running and then
connecting to the notes it that runs
something they it needs you can you know
put a bunch of requests to this router
and it will try to send these messages
do the request in parallel to all the to
all the services or applications below
and this way an application can only
talk to the things you have actually
defined so you have a really clear path
through your system
response times yeah all these layers
they you know there's lots of encoding
decoding going on so that that gives
quite a it could give some overhead but
we found that it's it's it's it's a very
very low typically less than a
millisecond and but it does give us very
predictable response times per layers
since there's you know the things that
are going on in each layer are really
small really simple everything is nicely
detached so for the price of just you
know adding this few few milliseconds
over the whole board we get a really
predictable response time provided you
have enough resources available so yeah
but but it's easy to keep those
available since we can easily you know
scale up each individual bit so how does
this look like this would currently see
in our current PHP like Python like
environment so the the number of
requests go up and the response lives
nicely follow the number of requests and
this is what we're currently seeing in
our new platform requests go up response
times stay the same so that looks very
promising
so some closing words where we are now
our interface layer we have you know
largely defined it most of it is
implemented we're implementing the the
servers and storage layer obviously we
still have like you know a lot of legacy
going on and we cannot you know do a big
bang release so we created adopter
applications which allows you to use our
new interface and then at the service
layer hook into our old architecture so
we can start using our new api's and
then slowly migrated in the back within
the next few months we will be deploying
to two portals on the new widget
platform later this year we are going to
scale up to we're currently running from
one data center we're going to scale up
to multiple data centers in the second
half of the year and other thing is
we're working on a system to do elastic
deployments which means you know i can
define these are my resources I've a
bunch of servers and and I have a bunch
of applications I want to run and I can
just you know throw them at them and it
will the system will figure out you know
what to deploy where and and and how to
connect everything yeah get rid of our
old architecture and another thing we're
working on is a new airline multiplayer
game platform lessons we've learned well
the first one is sort of obvious seeing
the old picture and what we're doing now
it's very important that everybody has
their head in the center
when when implementing stuff we've tried
to implement parts of our new
architecture into our current portal
deployments took half a year and it
didn't work so don't it's you know
integrating stuff into something that's
not good try to keep that try not to do
that keeping you know layers with clear
responsibilities really really helps us
in structuring and figuring out where to
put logic strict communication is really
important everything needs to be able to
talk to each other if it cannot talk it
will probably stop working small
packages really make for really easy
deployments easy easy testing yeah we we
change all the time that's the only
thing we always will be doing and
predictability is I think more important
than any of the others if you if you
know what your system is doing then you
know it's then you can make changes to
it if you don't know what it's what it's
doing is really hard to do that any
questions the way it is now it is pretty
specific yes yes but it might be worth
in to investigate whether or not it can
be generalized enough actually each each
application as one so in generally
there's one per node because we run as
you know each application we run runs
mainly on its own node sorry can you yes
yes yeah
and dribbling the cast layers for
improving but if there isn't supposed
back tomorrow comes layers you have yeah
well actually what we see and what we
see currently we have like many layers
of cash and we have quite a few examples
where a failing cash actually gave us
improvement in performance it's I mean
we really said okay the storage layer it
just needs to be fast enough so there we
do the we we make sure that data is
properly segmented so you know you don't
have a really huge database which gets a
lot of requests Rick gets really slow
you have like you know fast units and
they have a cash to make them really
fast and adding cash is on top of that
it makes it less predictable and maybe
save you a few milliseconds but if you
know if your your average response times
like 30 or 20 milliseconds usually your
transport overhead is way larger so we
we don't want to do that anymore
