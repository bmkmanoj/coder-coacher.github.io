part is called sequential Erlang what
we're going to do
building on what we talked about last
time which was the basic datatypes in
Erlang together with how you build lists
and tuples which are the powerful data
types used to represent complex data
building functions and modules on top of
those so what we'll do this time is talk
more about how you are you write more
complicated functions so talking about
conditionals looping constructs and so
on saying a bit about what's in the in
the libraries what the built-in
functions are and talking a bit about
how errors are handled so exception
handling the sort of errors that can
arise in evaluation of airline programs
and the way that those can be handled
okay so let's move and just have an
overview as I say what we're going to do
in the first part of this is cover
conditional expressions how you branch
in evaluation and particularly talk
about recursion because that's the major
way that's that control is is it flows
through airline programs so we'll start
by looking at case expressions now what
you see in a case expression is it's
delimited by the keyword case of an end
you have a single expression that is
evaluated and then according to the
value that that has you have a number of
alternative cases and in each of the
cases the clauses you see a clause head
and a clause body the head you have a
pattern and in the body you have a
sequence of expressions just like very
similar to to the definition of a
function where in the head of the
function you have patterns for the
arguments and a body here you have a
single pattern which will match against
the value of the expression evaluates to
and then a sequence of expressions that
are evaluated in case in that particular
case the patterns can involve unbound
variables or bound variables the case
that they're unbound they get bound in
just in the way we saw always function
about
the case here is a very simple one what
you've got are true and false the atom's
true and false which represent the
boolean type and in the in the true case
you return ok in the false case you
return the tuple beginning with error
and ending with unknown clauses
separated just like function called
clauses with a semicolon
and but there isn't a separator after
the last clause because their separators
rather than terminators ok the general
case looks looks very much like this you
have a number of patterns it says in the
in the slide one branch must always
succeed the point is if no branch does
succeed what will happen is an
expression will be raised and we'll see
an example of that later on in the third
part of this sequential Erlang chapter
it's possible to make sure that a branch
always succeeds by putting a wild card
or an unbound variable in the last
clause because that will always match
even if all the previous forces have
failed evaluation is just as it was for
function definitions that is you check
the value of the expression against the
first pattern if that succeeds you match
you evaluate the expressions in the
corresponding body if it fails you go on
to match against pattern two and so on
as you can see if you reach the end and
it's a wild card or a variable you will
definitely match that but if you don't
as I said it's not if you don't match
and then what will happen is that you'll
raise an exception okay so that gives
the the an overview of a case statement
what I want you to talk about now is
just an approach to programming that
Erlang along encourages or the Erlang
style encourages what we've got here is
a function that takes a day passed in as
a variable day and days are represented
by the atom's Monday Tuesday Wednesday
and so on and what this is doing is
converting
that day into a numerical code for the
day so Monday gets converted to one
Tuesday gets converted to two and so on
what we've included there is the final
catch-all Clause and what what that says
is for any other input what you return
is a tuple beginning with errors so
signalling there's an error made an
error value there and just returning the
the Atem unknown day in the second half
so what what this says is you you
program defensively you've programmed in
case of any possible input what this
means is that result of this function
now could be an integer from 1 to 7 or
it could be a tuple so there is a
problem now that you've programmed
defensively so now anybody who uses this
function potentially has to deal with
the case that there is this error tuple
gets returned and the Erlang style tends
to be not to program defensively but to
let it fail if you've passed in
something that isn't a day then it's
your problem you ought to recover from
that so the the Erlang style is to let
it fail so remove that read text and
simply have a case statement that
doesn't match every possible input it
only matches the inputs you want to and
in the case where you pass in something
I don't know month or a year or a number
or whatever an exception will be raised
and it will be up to the caller to do to
handle that exception so that's the
Erlang style let it fail don't program
defensively okay the other form of
conditional evaluation is the if and if
again is delimited by the keywords if
and end there are a number of if clauses
which again are separated by semicolons
what comes before what comes at the head
of each clause is a boolean expression
called a guard now this is if you're
familiar with other programming
languages this is a place where our line
differs from
other languages that guards are not
arbitrary boolean expressions and will
so the next few slides we'll talk
through exactly what guards can be but
you can't write for instance a function
call in inside a guard the idea is that
guards should be evaluated quickly guard
shouldn't fail God shouldn't go into an
infinite loop God shouldn't have side
effect and so there is oh there are
syntactic restrictions on what you can
put into a guard expression God can
appear here in fact they can also appear
in other places which again we'll talk
about presently the general form of a
bith is we have a number of clauses the
boolean exit guard expressions are
evaluated in turn from the beginning and
the first guard which evaluates to true
as the expressions in the corresponding
body evaluated so if the first guard is
true you do the first set of expressions
the second guard is the first is false
but a second is true you do the second
and so on if you want to make sure that
every case is handled then the final
case should be the value true the Atem
true and that will be that'll be the
case that would be the the else case
effectively that you'll handle in case
any of the all the other guards have
failed to be evaluated true it's not
mandatory but if you fail to match any
of the guard expressions you will get an
exception and that will have to be
handled so what I'd like to talk about
now is the the particular form that
guards have but before I do that just
just to mention as I said earlier on
guards aren't just usable in if
expressions and here you see the first
example of using a guard inside a
function definition so what you can see
in the lower half of the the code sample
is the definition of factorial we wrote
in the basic Erlang chapter what we see
there is using pattern matching we can
distinguish between the case where a
number is an
to zero and every other case which might
include a number or any any other input
at all what we see in the top Clause now
is um after the the when keyword
introduces a guard in the head of the
function Clause so that says this will
match any input n but only if that input
n is greater than zero so implicitly
that says n will have to be a number and
n will be greater than zero now we can
say explicitly that n has to be number
and we'll come back to that in a second
but for the moment you can see that this
clause will only apply now when n is a
number greater than zero and then the
second laws will apply when the number
is zero itself so as it says in the
remarks if you have fully guarded
clauses it's possible to reorder them so
the order of those two clauses is is
independent we can choose the ordering
there of course if you reorder the
bottom two clauses you will never hit
the factorial zero case you'll never hit
the base case so now you can see you can
use a guard in a function head you can
actually use a guard in a case Clause so
mixing up pattern matching there with a
boolean expression and also in if
statements and finally and receive which
is used in in the concurrent part of
Erlang but guards can't be arbitrary
boolean expressions as I said earlier on
so what we want to do now is talk
through precisely what you can use
inside a guard so here's an example of a
convert function which takes a string
and converts a string or an atom and
converts those things into atoms and
what the the first Clause does is it
says when the input is a list it invokes
the list to atom primitive to read to
turn that list into atom and of course
when it's applied to an atom you simply
return the there is the argument
the result so one source of functions
that you can use in guards is avi is
underscore followed by type name so you
can check for example is the input a
number is it an integer is it a float
this is an atom appeared a tuple a list
and so on so all those checks can be
done so for example if we go back to the
factorial example we might we might want
to say factorial of X when is integer X
X greater than 0 returns the result x x
and so on so there we have a check that
first of all their value is an integer
and then we change that is 0 I'll come
on to coma in a in a second but it's
conjunction so you're saying it is an
integer and X is greater than 0 so what
we have also are some built-in functions
like we cannot look for the the length
of a list look for the size of a tuple
and so on and we've also got the the
comparison operators and here again is a
place where airline differs from other a
number of other languages just in the
way that you write the comparison
operators so what we have are to check
equality you have equals equals to check
not equality inequality you have equals
slash equals to check exact equality you
have equals colon equals an example of
the difference between equality and
exact equality 1 and 1 point naught are
equal but they're not exactly equal and
the relational operators to compare
whether one number is smaller or equal
to another you say equals less than to
check whether a number is greater than
or equal to say you say greater than
equals you have to get those in the
right order and they're not the same
operators as you see in other languages
so just beware
so you have these primitives you can
check types check length sizes of
composite data structures you can check
ordering examples so what we will do now
is look at how to put guards together to
build up more complex guards one thing
to be aware of is that guards variables
and guards have to be bound it's not
possible you don't do any variable
binding inside a guard but to compose
guards we can use comma and semicolon so
comma is conjunction so it says that
both guards its and both guards must be
as told semicolon is disjunction so you
can say 80 did you look at the second
example that is checking whether the
input is a tuple or is an atom and you
can combine commas and semicolons I
would advise you to use parentheses if
you're going to do that now there are a
number of other conditions on guards
guards must be free of side effects
there's only a restricted set of B is
built-in functions and expressions that
can be used if you want more details
look in the reference manual or in the
airline programming book so I guess
we're familiar in other languages with
being able to put arbitrary expressions
inside and if so how can you achieve
that in in early so here's the way that
we can deal with the general case where
you want to switch on the value of a
user-defined function what we would like
to write in our line but we can't is the
code at the start of the slide so that
says if F applied to args is true the
result is okay otherwise so that's the
true case we return an error we can't do
that because it's a user-defined
function but what we can do instead is
do a case switch on the result of that
expression so the second example the
second code is the way we do it you
apply F to our
and then match on the result if the
result is true return okay if it's false
return error so you can see there's an
easy way to transform what we'd like to
right into what we can so that's so the
general case which will always be will
always be possible so this for the
second part of the the sequential
airline part one is to talk about
control structures and in particular to
talk about how we work over complex data
structures the main mechanism we use for
control flow in Erlang is recursion and
what I want to do is remind you a bit
about how lists are constructed and then
talk about how we can use recursion to
traverse lists and build up functions
which are recursive over lists so just
to remind you we had we can think of
every list as being built up using the
empty list and then adding an element at
the head of a list so for example we can
build the list to 3 by adding 2 to the
list which has just 3 in it and we can
build the list 3 by adding 3 to the list
that is empty so given a list it will
either have this form or it will have
this form and if it has this form this
is itself a list so that's the pattern
that we're that's a pattern that we'll
see when we start writing functions that
work over lists with either have an
empty list or we'll have a a head which
is an element and a tail which is itself
a list
now looking at the two examples that you
see in this slide what we have were
trying to calculate the average of a
list of numbers mm-hmm excuse me and we
do that by calculating the sum of the
list and dividing it by the length so
that's the top line and what we then see
are definitions of the function to sum
the elements of a numeric list and a
function to calculate the length in fact
of any list and what we'll do is just
work look through in more detail what's
going on in that definition of sum so
what we have here is I'll just echo this
on the on the whiteboard in the case
that we have a non-empty list what we
say is take the head of the list and add
it to the sum of the tail and in the
second case we say the son for an empty
list is zero you can think of this code
because it's a direct recursion as
actually describing what the sum is if
you're trying to say what the sum of the
list is you add all the numbers up given
the list is constructed by adding H to
this smaller list what you're saying is
to add all the numbers up start with H
and then add up the remaining numbers
but let's see how that works if you're
not convinced let's have a look at how
this works in practice with a list two
comma three so what is the sum of that
list
wait that Clause doesn't apply it must
be the first clause so that will be um
two plus the sum over the list with just
three now what about that we've got
another case of the sum function being
applied in this case the head of the
list H is three
remember what pattern matching this
against H cons T H will not match to
three - you will match to the empty list
so what we get is that this is two plus
what's that sum which three plus the sum
and then finally we get the result that
the sum of the empty list is zero so we
can see that this is going to give us
two plus three plus zero which is what
we expected it's giving us the answer
five so it's a nice description you can
write down and you can write out the
evaluation of functions written in this
sort of way and convince yourself that
that's the answer that you're getting so
that direct recursion I'm going to
contrast with what's what's called tail
recursion a bit later on in this section
but the direct recursion is often the
most straightforward way of writing this
sort of function which traverses a list
okay so that gives us the sum and you
can I'm sure you can see that there's a
pattern here what we get for length
again the pattern is length of H column
with tail is 1 plus length tail in fact
we don't use H there so what we can say
is underscore and land what you can see
here is this pattern that you define the
function over the head
Conn's tail using the function on the
tail exactly the same pattern there and
this thing is just defined directly so
this pattern of defining things mirrors
the way that these functions are
themselves created so that gives us made
a recursive definition of some and so on
if you're less familiar with this I know
this can be this can be a bit of a
stumbling block when you first learn
they're like we can look at we can look
at this in a more imperative example
which I think can sometimes help
persuade people that what's going on is
not magic it's simply the obvious way of
iterating through a list this has quite
a lot in common with with iterators for
other languages so what we see here is a
function that runs through a list and
printing out its every member let's
assume it's a list of numbers it's just
printing out the numbers separated by a
space so again we've got this pattern
that you're either supplied with an
empty list or you're supplied with a
list whose first element is X and whose
remainder is X's there's another pattern
people write for lists recursions in the
case that you're presented with an empty
list you simply output a newline that's
what they may twiddles n stands for
there in the case you've got a list
whose first element is X what happens in
that in the body well what's going on is
you first of all evaluate the i/o format
which prints the element followed by a
space and then you print the rest of the
elements so what you're doing there is
performing an action at the first
element and then iterating to look at
the rest so rewriting this again you can
perhaps see even more clearly here what
we've got is this function print all we
do a case switch once you go into the
function if the it's the same function
I've just rewritten it slightly if the
argument is the empty list you output
the new line if not
which we realize we've got an end
non-empty list you output the element
and then you call prints all again and
that's just like a jump back to the
start of the loop so this is very much
like a traditional control structure you
see in an imperative language you have
an out so you have a clause that exits
the loop and you have a general tools
which re-enters the loop with some
different some different arguments in
fact this is an example of what's called
a tail recursive function if you look at
where the recursions happen they are
they come at the end of the bodies of
the clauses the only place that print
all gets called is in the in the
non-empty list case it's called as the
last call so that's what's called tail
recursive and tell the recursive
functions can be sure you know can be
implemented particularly efficiently
because you don't need to create a stack
frame for each call you simply overwrite
the existing stack frame and in fact
it's like a loop which runs through with
the variables of the loop being
represented by the arguments of the
function we're looking at another
example of that a bit later on but I
just wanted to show you that this
pattern just backing up here what you're
seeing is this pattern a recursive
function where you do one thing in the
case of an empty list another thing in a
case where the list isn't empty it's
very like a traditional iteration
through through a list in an imperative
language and that as its as its seen
here in the example of some is the thing
that allows you directly to compute the
sum of a list so that's what I hope will
will get you started on looking at
recursion over lists I think the way
that you learn that will be supplying
you with lots of exercises to - for you
to try for yourself different patterns
of recursion but what I'm going to do
now is just talk through a number of
examples further examples just to give
you more to give more weight to the idea
of computing things by recursion so here
are three examples of patterns of
recursion over lists and some of these
are things you see all the time what the
first function is doing is applying a
particular transformation to every
element of a list what it's doing is its
doubling every member of a list so we've
got this same pattern what if you apply
to an empty list well the exact answer
is you get an empty list back in the
case whether the first element of the
list is H and the rest of the list is
the tail you build a new output so I'm
just running this on the board in a case
where you have the first element is H
then the rest is T or what's the output
going to look like it will be itself a
list and its first element should
correspond to H so what we do is we
double H and then what do we do to the
tail or what we do is double the tail so
you can see and you can write that out
by hand if you wish try that out and
you'll see that what you get there is
this what we call a map function a map
is something people do all the time with
lists and we'll see later on it fits in
particularly well with with filtering
which you'll see next and and comes into
what are called list comprehensions
which are very nice compact way of
writing these things so what we've done
in the first function is you we've
doubled every element of a list what I
want to do now is is write a function
that will pull out the even elements of
a list and what I'm doing here is I'm
going to use a guard let me just run
through this again on the board and what
we have will start off with the case
where the the list is non-empty
so we've got a head element and a tail
element well what we're going to have to
do here is something rather different
we're not necessarily going to include H
in the list in one case where we do on
one case where we don't so the case
where we do is when it's even so what we
have to do is room divide it by two and
check whether or not that is you've sent
a zero result and if it does what do we
do what does the output look like well H
is in the output what about the rest of
the output when we apply to T well what
we're going to do is pull out all these
numbers from T so here we see so what
we've done is handle the case where HRM
2 is 0 so H is even now what we have to
do is handle the next case and that's
where H is odd now we could write
explicitly H round 2 equals 1 there but
in fact we don't because remember these
things are evaluated sequentially so
we'll only ever hit this case when H is
odd so we know that H is odd when we get
to here so what we know is that it's not
going to go into the output so all we
need to do is extract the even numbers
that are in T and in fact because we
don't mention it there what we can do is
replace it with a with a wild-card and
of course we've got to finally do the
last case and that says that there are
no even numbers in an empty list so here
we're using the guards to check the
particular whether that number is even
or odd whether it's even and we are
using the sequentiality here to write
that more simply you could as an
exercise write it write this case using
a guard so that you can reorder the
clauses as you wish
so that's giving us a check a what we
call a filter operation and map and
filter are things that we do all the
time when we're programming programming
with lists now let's have one final
example and what we're doing here is
we're trying to check whether a an
element X belongs to a list H cons t
well there are going to be two ways that
X could be a member of the list it could
be in there could be equal to H or it
could be a member of three so what we do
and what you can see in the in the
definition there on the slide is in the
first case we can use pattern matching
to say well if the thing we're looking
for is equal to the thing at the
beginning of the list the answer is true
otherwise we're going to have to check
whether that thing is a member of the
tail of the list and then finally we
return the result false whatever we're
looking for in an empty list because the
empty list has no members but the first
two clauses correspond to the case where
first of all then the number we're
looking for is equal to the element
we're looking for is equal to the head
of the list and the second case what
we're doing is is we're returning the
member itself perhaps what you'd like to
do as an exercise its just have a two
clause definition where the first Clause
looks like this
and the second clause is as we've seen
and for you to think about how to define
it like that using an equality and a
recursive call
that's an interesting got an interesting
exercise to do just getting you're just
beginning to get your head around the
way these recursions work now we've
talked quite a lot about I know all
these all these examples here are pretty
much direct recursions way that member
happens to be tail-recursive but what
we've got there is a description of I
think all of these are self describing
if you like what I want to do and
examples of direct recursion what I want
to do to finish this section is to talk
a bit more about tail recursion so let
me let's go back to the example of
calculating the sum of a list we look at
the slide in a second but the sum gives
us a slightly simpler example what we've
said what we said is the direct
definition looks rather like this
so directly we have some of the list
whose first element is H his tail is T
he's got by adding H to the sum of the
tail now what we can do instead is think
about using one of the arguments of a
function to store the result of making
the addition so far and let's try and
think about how we might how we might do
that what we're going to do is write a
new function let's call it sum back and
what we're going to do with this is
we're going to have the list in the
first argument and we're going to have
the sum in a second and when we've
exhausted the whole list what we do is
just output the sum but suppose what
we're doing instead is we've got the
list chat ahead H and tail T and we've
got the sum sum so far is s what's the
result going to be for this well what we
want to do is take off H and add it to s
and then restart with the tail so this
in this form let's write it down here
some no just got the tail left but what
we've got now is got the head added to
what we had so far
in that in that variable there now the
question is how do you start this off
and the answer is that you can calculate
the sum of the list by starting off the
sum accumulator with the list and the
sum so far is zero
so what we've done now is we're using
the second position here really just
like a variable we start off
initializing the variable to zero when
we get to the end of the list we return
what's the result of the variable but
what we do here is we go from the list
to its tail but when we do that we add
the head to the sum so far let's just
look at an example of how that works out
and this does look very much like
imperative programming I think with ups
before at the example of 2 &amp;amp; 3 - well
what that becomes is some back to 3 now
which of these clauses applies what we
have first of all what we're doing here
we take the first element off the head
off the list and add it to the sum so
this becomes sum AK this which is 3 n we
add 2 again we take the first element
off there and we get list with nothing
in and the sum so far now is 5 and then
finally this law says we've reached the
end so the answer is 5 now what's nice
about this is that what you've got here
is a tail recursive function it can be
the only thing you do in the body there
is call the function again so it can be
implemented in some situations more
efficiently so tail recursion is
particularly in when we start looking at
concurrent programming we'll be looking
a lot at tail recursive functions but in
this particular case we're getting
something more efficient as a definition
but what I would say is that we've got
something which is rather less
straightforward to understand
if you compare this to what we had
before we're directly we said what the
some of this cyst was and that some of
the empty list is zero so directly that
says what the sum is what we have to
understand here when we're reading this
definition is we have to understand how
these two arguments change as the
function is called so we have to
understand that we start off with zero
there and we gradually accumulate the
result in that variable as we're
iterating through the list there it's a
different pattern it's one that you can
get you can easily get used to using but
it's perhaps less direct than that so
just to underline what's going on
we use these positions if you'd like as
variables this extra extra argument here
act like a variable to store the sum so
far and what you see in the slide is a
rather supercharged version of this
where what we do is as we run along the
the list we simultaneously calculate the
length in the second variable and the
sum in the third so what we're doing is
you've got two accumulator variables
which separately calculate length and
sum and then we get the the average as
you see in the final clause when you've
got to the end of the list we divide the
sum by the length just was being aware
that you would get a runtime error if
you applied this to an empty list so
perhaps we needed a separate clause for
that and that would be good exercise you
want to try that
okay well that's come to the end of what
I wanted to talk about about control
structures in Erlang we've talked about
alternatives using case and if and we
talked about loops and iteration through
data structures using recursion and that
really is that's a crucial part of the
way that the machinery of airline for
doing day-to-day programming tasks and I
think the way to get comfortable with
that is to try
a whole lot of examples
