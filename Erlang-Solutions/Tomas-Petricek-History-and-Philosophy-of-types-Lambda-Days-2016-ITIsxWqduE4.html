such a hit I was more like for people
when I was at the university so the the
this talk is sort of came from the last
two years last year of my of my PhD
which I was thinking sort of theoretical
computer science and towards the end of
the PhD I was thinking hmm what is it
that I'm actually doing here which is I
think all all PhD students think the
same thing but I try to turn it into
another interesting topic and I just
started wondering when we do computer
science what are sort of the the the
things that we work with we always I
don't know we can give some definitions
we work with them we're doing some
mathematics but what is the sort of goal
like what's what's the idea behind what
we are what we're trying to do and I
think types are really nice example
where you can where you can think about
it because when you think what is a type
you can read a paper that says type tau
and there's primitive types alpha or
there's functions doubt at all and
that's types done and then they you can
wonder what are types for and they'll
tell you types give you some mess and
that's what we write in the papers but
when you sort of look around and go to
conferences and talk to people about
types then they will say something
completely different
so ah I'll get even better mic okay so
what are types what are they good for
and I think if you if you read some
papers on types then they'll have some
answers but that just doesn't correspond
to what I sort of think about when I
talk about types in F sharp talks or
when I see talks about types and
conferences and so I had a look at the
at the types lecture at the University
of Cambridge where there's like first
slide where they tell you types are
really good
and they're useful for detecting errors
my type checking they support
structuring of large systems they give
you documentation efficiency and whole
language safety and then from the second
slide it's like Greek letters and I
think there's this sort of interesting
thing that happens where we start with
the overall motivation and then we talk
about some mathematics also when when
you think about these so this is at
Cambridge and they probably had types
lectures since nineteen eight so okay
now in 1988 probably wasn't about
documentation and efficiency but it's if
you read these and you think about some
of the new programming languages that
are appearing like if you say typescript
or Dart they don't give you whole
language safety because from a
theoretical perspective they're actually
not safe somehow it doesn't bother the
people who use them they don't give you
a efficiency because they just erase to
JavaScript and then JavaScript does some
magic to run things fast yeah I think
like typescript is primarily sort of
appeared for structuring of large
systems and documentation sometimes it
detects errors sometimes it doesn't so
there's a lot of things that sort of
appear that really don't quite match the
the the thing that we say to our
students in the first lecture its first
lecture so they don't really listen and
then they don't complain so it's okay
but so what I'd like to do here is
there's there's two parts in the first
part I want to say a few things about
history it's actually more of an
archaeology so I'm just going to pick a
few random cases from history where
people talked about types or something
related to types happened to illustrate
the different sort of contexts in which
people think about it so it's not really
like I'm not trying to tell you what are
types I just want to give you a couple
of historical episodes where something
related to type happened and I also want
to look at
not at sort of what we now know about
things that happened then but what were
the people actually thinking when they
were saying the things and I think in in
computer science we have this bad habit
where we look at something that happened
fifty years ago and we were like oh yeah
they're talking about programming and
this is just like that browser when the
concepts that people were originally
using when thinking about stuff were
just completely different and didn't
match anything we do these days and then
I'll have a bit of philosophical
reflection where I'll sort of use some
of the episodes to illustrate
interesting ideas so the origins of
types there's Bertrand Russell if you
want to buy the the picture that I
tweeted there's really nice t-shirt with
like lots of weird philosophy shirts so
you can you can get his picture with
smoking pipe so he was interested in the
foundations of logic so he's a
mathematician and there's this problem
in foundations of logic when you say a
class of all classes that do not contain
themselves as an element that's a that's
a paradox and the logicians back then
didn't really know like what do we do
with it because does it mean that all
our logic is broken and we can't even
say anything because it doesn't make any
sense and then he sort of when when
Bertrand Russell came up with the idea
of types he was using types to avoid
these sort of paradoxes and then some
years later Alonzo Church took the
lambda calculus which was another theory
and added types to lambda calculus and
when you read the old paper it's
actually really interesting because he's
saying well so type theory is this
foundations of mathematics thing and
there's another foundations of
mathematics things called lambda
calculus and what would happen if we
added types there and he's not saying
like types are useful for error-checking
or anything he's not saying types are
useful for
this disallowing invalid programs he's
just saying well it's a interesting
theory I just tried to combine them and
see what happens
and they were they were really all
talking about foundations of mathematics
and in Brussels types he had some base
formulas and he called them type zero
and then if you have a formula that
talks about another formula it will have
type n plus one so you can distinguish
between formulas that talk about some
basic things and formulas that talk
about other formulas so that was that
was his way of avoiding the paradox
because he was saying when I say I am
lying the sort of self referential
nature it doesn't actually refer to the
original term it refers this so what
what I'm doing here it's like I'm
stepping outside and I'm getting one
level higher
so it's he was using types as a way to
sort of structure the the logic so that
you avoid this this kind of problem
now there's one really interesting thing
that I found when I was when I was
looking at this because what they always
say so this is from Bertrand Russell who
says it's unnecessary to know what
objects belong to the lowest type so he
doesn't care if it's like numbers or if
it's I don't no strings or system the
date time for him it's sort of formalism
to structure some terms but he's not
saying what the types actually are and
Alonzo Church also says similar thing
where when he has some some basic types
he refrains from making more definite
the nature of the types because again
for him it really doesn't matter what
they are and I think it's it's really
interesting when you go back to the
history to sort of see this because
suddenly people are not talking about
types in the same way we are when I read
the paper and I know programming I can
read it as
imagining they're talking about sets of
values and it's just like integer or
it's just like string but when you sort
of try to go back and unthink what we
now know they really were not thinking
that types are some sets of values so
that's I think one one really
interesting bit where types even though
we refer to lambda calculus when we talk
about types in functional programming
there's this subtle change where
something that was really more of a
formal structure evolved into something
that now has a meaning and it usually
denotes like integer denotes one two
three four five and so on so that's one
interesting bit the other really
interesting bit so this was the the sort
of logic side of the world and now we
get into the imperative like real people
doing computers so I think the first the
first use of the term type in when
talking about something that you might
call more like a data type there's
actually nice essay by Stephen Kell
who's sort of distinguishing between
types as in logic and types as in like
memory data type so the first use of the
two of the term type was in Algol 58 and
they actually before before one meeting
that happened in 1958 in Zurich in the
specification they were saying a data
symbol so that's like a value or
variable falls in one of the following
classes
it's integer or it's boolean or its
general so they were actually before the
meeting they were using classes and
something happened at the meeting we
don't quite know what but after the
meeting the the specification was saying
types and there's there's paper from
Simone martini who's tried to find out
what happened and he says well I don't
really know why it looks like they just
renamed it from classes to types
probably because they thought it's a
better name so if you don't know
anything about programming there's
nothing like types in your world that's
actually sort of nice words to use for
this this thing you just added to your
to your Algol 58 so what-what Simon is
saying is it's quite remarkable that it
really looks like when they put the word
types in Algol it was not related to
logic in any way they just picked it
because it was nice word so this is how
types sort of appear in logic and appear
in Algol and possibly maybe someone
heard about some work and thought ah
that's a nice name they're using there
let's do it too but there's really
wasn't sort of any strict relationship
and then I guess the the the to sort of
started coming back when John McCarthy
and then later it was more refined by
Tony Hoare looked at the programming and
they're sort of more more theory more
Theory focused people then the the
hackers putting together I'll go now
uncle people were actually fairly
theoretical as well but this is sort of
a late reflection where they started
thinking so what do these types that we
have in Algol what do they actually mean
and this is where I think there's
there's one interesting step that
happened where hoar developed McCarthy's
theory who sort of started modeling data
types in programming languages as some
sets of values so this happened much
later it's something like 70s where we
actually started where the idea that
pipes represent set of possible values
where that idea appeared before in logic
they were formal constructs in
programming they were probably just bits
or something in in whatever memory or
like holes in your punch cards so this
is where one really interesting
appeared there's a nice book that that
talks about a lot of the early computing
history signs of operations so if you
want to read something about how things
happened that's a good source but you
might think that this idea of types as
sets of values this is where we should
stop and are we figured it out but it's
actually more complicated so if you look
at languages where they're not they're
not pure they allow some sorts of
mutation and it could be it could be
f-sharp where you can just mutate things
it could be Haskell where you have to
use some monads to mutate things but in
some sense days you sort of introduced
the idea of mutation in there and then
so this is an example from sort of
languages where you have something
called effect systems so effect system
on the red on the left it says I have
memory references R and s and they're
allocated in some memory regions and
when I do the assignment the type system
so in F sharp the type system will tell
you it's unit I don't know what it does
it probably mutates something in Haskell
it will tell you it's a monad in
languages with effect systems it will
tell you the type of this operation of
this assignment is unit meaning it
doesn't return anything and this
annotation that says it actually also
writes the des bit of memory and reads
from that bit of memory so it's more
it's just another way of sort of talking
about what your programs do when they
run and it's interesting programming
language theory that in some ways is
corresponds to corresponds to monads but
the really interesting thing from the
sort of philosophical perspective here
if you look at the type unit and write
to one region read from another region
what does that mean what does it
represent does it represent some set of
values
well maybe I don't know in Haskell you
could modulate as set of functions that
take the whole world and produce another
world but that's really cumbersome way
of describing what it is because once
you have sets of all functions that do
something it becomes quite complicated
so there's there's another proposal
that's fairly recent where the idea is
no types are not sets that's wrong types
are actually relations so you're sort of
specifying some relation where when you
say I read from memory or when I just
say I read I write to this bit of memory
your relation is some relation between
the the previous world and the new world
where if I change any bit of memory in
the input that's not the one I'm reading
then it doesn't change the result so
it's just another sort of I think this
is like 2010 or so fairly new idea where
we are again thinking well actually
maybe types mean something else and it
goes more it goes even crazier if you
look at some of the new programming
languages that are appearing so I talked
about effects and monads then you have
things like dart and typescript where
they're not really sound so the type
sort of means well it could be this
maybe there's languages that are
dependently typed are very much based in
the theory world and they're the types
mean again something very different
they're actually more like the full
specification of your program and the
way the people in that in these
communities use you slang use types is
very different then the way say
typescript people use types but there
are some interesting overlaps because
for example a lot of the cool editor
features that people sort of started
doing in Java now if you look at um
I think the Emacs mode for a trace it
uses types in address to do lots of
clever editor editor things
though it's completely different idea of
types and then you have things like
f-sharp type providers where they're
rooted in this in this logical
background but then they do weird things
like your type suddenly your type system
is perfectly sound and nice and logical
except that it can depend on the
internet so your program type checks if
you're connected to the internet if
you're not connected to the Internet or
if your external data source changes
you're no wrong no longer able to
compile so that's even though it's
rooted in the logical approach it added
something that a lot of people will find
really weird especially the more logical
logical background people but it's
actually something that fits pretty well
with the programming language but you
have to look at it at you have to look
at it a bit differently so I think that
the key message for the first first part
is it doesn't look like we're getting
closer to any sort of clear precise
definition and the second part of the
talk is it doesn't matter so the second
part there's there's a lot of lot of
interesting literature on philosophy of
science or philosophy of mathematics I
think if you got intrigued by Phil
Butler's question whether things are
discovered on or invented you should
read something about philosophy of
mathematics because that's like the the
biggest problem in the whole field of
course people can solve it on Twitter
but I don't think they will capture the
full complexity of the topic so I'll
just have a look at a couple of
different ideas from philosophy of
science and this is this is something
that's been around for a long long time
in some way so this is picture of
Francis Bacon as you can see from his
from his clothes he's not very modern
this is in 17th century and Francis
Bacon is actually known as the sort of
father of the scientific method
and he he describes a couple of ideas or
a couple of things that people do wrong
when they try to be thinking precisely
in a scientific way they didn't quite
have the world back then but when he
tried to think precisely one come on and
he calls his idols the idol of tribe is
that the human intellect easily supposes
a greater order and equality in things
that then there actually is so I think
this this definitely fits you types
because when we think about types we
think oh yeah types are these precise
formal nice things but if you look
around well actually they're kind of
messy
the other one is idols of the market
where the confusions of language one and
the same name being applied
indifferently to things that are not of
the same nature I think I talked about
this before so types the the name just
appeared from two different contexts and
we meshed it together and now we think
it's actually one nice elegant thing so
I think there's there's a lot you can
you can learn if even if you go to
people who were talking about scientific
method in 17th century they got it they
figured it out the other the other
really interesting person and now we are
at the beginning of the 20th century
so Paul fire abend has this approach
called epistemological anarchism where
if you if you asked both Paul fire Albin
so Paul should there be a clear
definition of water-type is he would say
well he wouldn't just say no because
he's a philosopher so he says to clarify
the terms does not mean to study the
additional properties of the domain in
question it means to fill them with
existing notions from the entirely
different domain of logic so what he's
saying here is when someone asks you to
clarify something
it's not that they would want you to
sort of go into a case and think about
it for a lot for a lot more and then
come up with something that's clear
usually when you clarify things it means
you have to explain it in the terms that
are currently well understood so it
doesn't mean you have this like nice
little idea somewhere that's a bit weird
you don't study the idea more you're
trying to fit it onto the things that
are already out there and rather than
actually investigating it different
interesting things around here what
you're doing is that you'll just fit it
on to the well known things and you're
not asking questions that are relevant
here you're actually asking questions
that are relevant in this
well-established domain so when you come
up with with something weird people will
ask you so give us the formal system and
you're like well that doesn't really
work I don't know maybe yeah okay well
if I change it like this so that that
interesting bit is sort of moved away
because it was breaking stuff then I can
give you a formal system so fire urban
is sort of advocating something that
many people proceed as anti-scientific
where he was very much advocating for
the sort of freedom of thinking of
thought and many people think he's going
a bit too far but I think there's
there's a lot of interesting points you
can learn there where when you try to
clarify something often it means you
actually just fit it into well
understood area and forget the questions
that were breaking it so that's one
interesting thought and another one
America tosh so this is this is again
sort of umbrella cottage and pool fire
albums were actually actually pretty
close friends and lakatos was trying to
add a bit of order to what what fire a
band was saying and what he came up with
was was this idea that science is
basically consists of multiple competing
research programs where every
search program covers a sort of group of
people informally who who share the same
assumptions so every research program
has some hard core which is what we
believe and that's what we will never
question and then there's stuff around
that we can fill with so for example if
you talk to hospital people and you tell
them well actually if you do a if you
instead of using immutable map if you
use a hash table mutable hash table then
it will be faster and they'll tell you
well no no that's wrong that's silly you
can't use mutation but they have because
that's their it that's their hard core
assumption you just don't mutate but
they will tell you but and that's the
auxiliary assumptions we could have a
compiler that's smart enough to figure
out how to compile your immutable code
into something that under the cover does
mutation and that's their sort of way of
dealing with the problem so when you
look at any group of people who have
certain beliefs about types they will
always have some hard core assumptions
which is I'm never going to question
this type system must be sound and if
you have type system where programs that
are type checked will fail that's total
rubbish that's completely wrong or you
can have people who will say well type
system primarily have to be useful for
doing good editor tools and if your type
system just doesn't work in that way
like you can't build anything useful for
your IDE then that's not that's like why
why bother so I think there's there's
really nice idea here where you have
these different people coming from
different backgrounds with sort of
different hard core assumptions and they
have different ideas about what types
are for also when they talk together it
it becomes interesting because they just
don't believe what the other they they
don't understand that the other person
just doesn't want to make the type
system not safe because that's the
hard core assumption so the hard core
assumptions are never blamed for any
apparent failure and we always find a
way to describe well actually I don't
have to compromise on this hard core
assumption I can come up with some other
other excuse locket which has another
really interesting idea which is when
the sort of meaning of something
slightly shifts and evolves and changes
and he calls this concept stretching and
it's like when I when I think about type
systems and then someone comes with
typescript and says well actually our
type system is not sound but that
doesn't really matter that's a new
really weird counter example to
something that existed before and when
you once you learn about it it's really
hard to sort of ignore it and say well
this is this I don't know what to do
with it that's that's weird but there's
there's people so when you when you
stretch the concept and locket oh she's
talking he has this really nice book
called talking about polyhedra polyhedra
when the stretching happens it's sort of
what happens is that suddenly new things
that are really weird are called
polyhedra as well so when you think of
polyhedra you have this nice nice object
and suddenly someone comes up with idea
that polyhedra can have a tunnel through
it and it matches the definitions but it
breaks all the sensible rules and so
there's some some shift in the meaning
and the nice or or what often happens is
that people who sort of see this
happening they're like well no this just
this this never happened this is really
bad this is not a proper polyhedra this
is some weird monster and there's this
beautiful example from charles hermit in
1893 where he says i turn aside with
Hodder of horror from this lamentable
plague of functions which have no
derivatives when someone pointed to
charles hermit that actually there are
functions that you can't differentiate
he was like no doesn't never and then
eventually it took a couple of years and
people got used to the idea and they
said well actually blah blah blah here's
some solution but the initial the
initial reaction to something that's
really weird that we learn to live with
later on is this shudder of horror so I
have a little adaptation which is a
fiction but you could pretty much
imagine this so someone on Hacker News
could very well say I turn aside with
shudder of horror from this lamentable
plague of type systems which have no
sound best proof when they read about
typescript or dart yeah people on Hacker
News actually don't have that poetic
language so I couldn't quote anything
like actual but there's there's things
were in the same theme and the sort of
last thing going back again to fire a
band where he we are sort of going back
to the question so if this world is
really like as messy as I'm saying is
there some correct scientific method
like scientists they discover truth and
they tell us they accumulate correct
knowledge and discover truth so what is
the method and fire urban says well
actually if you look at the at the
history so if you look at how important
events in the history happened it's
clear that there's only one principle
that always can be applied and that's
anything goes so and he's not saying so
this is this he got he got misunderstood
quite often as saying there's no order
you can do whatever he's not quite
saying that he's C saying well in
different parts of history people
followed different methods and
they always followed some methods but
there's no sort of universal method that
always works so if there's a bit of
history where people discover something
really nice through theoretical
programming language research by I don't
know taking interesting ideas from modal
logic and turning them into into
programming language theory which is
what Phil Boulder was talking about in
the morning that's one method for doing
things but if you look at how things
happened in the history there's lots of
other methods that actually created
something interesting something useful
and something that science now calls the
truth so is there is there what can we
do when when we can't come up with one
universal sort of idea what a type is I
think that the really the most important
thing is to understand that that's not a
problem the other bit is to understand
that there are these research programs
where within a research program we have
some methods for doing things and that's
fine but it's worth looking at the other
research programs that are around and do
things differently and maybe try to
understand why they're not subscribing
to the same hard core assumptions and I
think it's also just interesting to
think about the fact that there's
different people talking about types and
we can we can do it even without sort of
agreeing on one common definition
because type is sort of a fluid concept
that exists in different worlds means
slightly different things but it's still
useful to have it as a shared concept
because sometimes you do something with
types in one way and you can actually
port it into other other research
program or other space and even though
you're sort of not doing precisely the
same thing as the people there it will
it will work and it will be useful so in
in summary I just picked two two really
nice
it's from fire abandoned Lakatos to
illustrate it so one and this is from
fire a band who says science is much
more sloppy and irrational than its
methodological image so when you look at
scientists you see these people who
acquire perfect correct knowledge if you
look a bit deeper or or read would read
this nice book against methods from pole
fire abend then you'll learn that
actually the world is a lot more
complicated and there's also on that on
the sort of notion of having always
precise answer fire urban says having
precise answers can actually hamper the
growth of knowledge and Lakatos says if
it can deflect the course of
investigations into narrow channels of
things already understood so that's sort
of the idea that when you do something
that's really a bit different then what
is generally understood it's actually ok
to just ignore a lot of things that are
established as facts and live in the
world where it doesn't quite work
because lots of early ideas start as
something that's really weird and
doesn't quite make sense only until some
years later when people find a way to
reconcile it or fix all the little
details so the example that fire abend
uses is actually the heliocentric system
invented by Galileo where when Galileo
first said that actually all the planets
are rotating around Sun it wasn't good
science because it was it was giving
worst predictions it didn't match with
what was established and everybody just
knew that that's not how it is yeah fire
urban talks about about Galileo but it
was Copernicus was the one who mentioned
it before but Galileo is the one who
sort of well known for doing it in as
having the scientific truth that he
liked
invented the telescope and knew that now
it's finally better but yeah even back
then it just wasn't giving the giving
better prediction and after Copernicus
Galileo and for like he stick to the
idea and eventually he was able to come
up with better predictions that made
madest made it through all right so
that's all I have to say it's sort of
based on three articles or essays that I
wrote so here's just links if you want
to have a look and find the other
references as well thank you and I think
we have some time for questions or
tomatoes or apples or whatever you want
to throw at me
eggs hi so in the context of what you
said what would you say or what do you
think about attempts to cry create some
higher-order abstractions that would be
able to unify all of the methods and
logic systems whatever like for example
I know that some people try to do that
with category theory yeah so what what
do I think about people trying to come
up with general abstractions that will
capture everything so I think that's one
research program that's like one one way
of approaching the problem but it's it
has some strong assumptions it has the
strong assumptions that you can actually
do this you can find general
abstractions without in some way without
losing all the things that are unique
when you when you do the abstraction so
it's sort of it's it's interesting one
research program but I don't think
there's sort of I don't think there's
there's a way to sort of start within
one one research program or within one
mindset and suddenly sort of escape and
cover everything so that's why all the
sort of philosophy books when you read
them
they rarely or the the the ones that
sort of try to talk about these
questions why they don't say why they
don't try to sort of formalize
everything they're talking about because
the the natural language that they're
using or the sort of human thought that
they're trying to to give you is like as
good as we can get about talking things
across multiple different areas but when
you sort of start with one method you're
never going to escape that area
delimited by one method Thanks hi Tomas
so basically in the in the research you
kind of focus on the Western
philosophical and the Western point of
you ever wonder out a little bit further
out and then have you seen an
interesting concept coming from areas
that maybe are not so focused on the you
know computational apply applications of
types yeah so I was I was definitely
focused on the more Western both the
sort of logical side of things and the
philosophy of off side of things and
that's just because I don't really like
that's that's what I understood that's
what I know that's what I'm familiar
with I'm sure there's lots of lots of
interesting ideas from other like
schools of thought that would actually
make a lot of sense here as well
I just don't know about them yet so um
I'm really sort of curious if someone
has a something that you think is
relevant I would definitely love to know
about it I think there's there's one
nice book by and this sort of going into
a bit random direction but there's a
book called economics of good and evil
by Tamar said logic from Czech Republic
and he has sort of a book about
economics where he's trying to trace
ideas from modern economics to things
like ancient myths or ideas that appear
in like ancient myths or the Bible or
other really old texts and I thought
that was really interesting because it's
sort of again trying to trace
a relationship between things that you
wouldn't normally or in the modern
thought you wouldn't see them as related
but there's actually really interesting
similarities and maybe some of the ideas
would work there and I'm pretty sure
that this would this would be
interesting thing to do about types or
computer science as well so I'm
wondering if having these unsound type
system is this really more practical
thing rather than philosophical yeah
right that means like in mathematics
compared to computer science you don't
really have the notion of time how long
does it take to calculate something you
know who cares right and I think also
mathematics doesn't have the concept of
money cost right how much does it cost
so in computer science in programming in
practical programming there's the
question you know how many people do I
have to hire and how long will it take
me to write the program right and there
is the option of writing you know less
sound programs that for instance contain
bugs and we know that essentially all
programs contain bugs so the fact that
you don't have a sound system is just
another source of bugs and how much
money are we willing to spend to get rid
of all the bugs right and it depends on
you know whether you are designing a
website right where you know if it
doesn't work no big deal right or
whether you are designing a nuclear
reactor right jet yeah right
then maybe or or financial programs that
can waste billions of dollars like that
maybe then you really want to have it
sound type system because that
eliminates a lot of possibilities for
bugs right so I think that sort of what
I and it's definitely sort of slightly
misleading here because both dart and
typescript are used for web we're in a
sense here it doesn't doesn't matter
that much but I wouldn't I don't
actually sort of think that when they
design it they're thinking it's okay
because it's just web they're thinking
well how do you how do you get correct
software well one way is we can prove it
the other is we do a lot of tests and
yes in if you if you if you subscribe to
the to the sort of theoretical approach
then you would say well no the only way
to do correct things is to do proofs and
then it sort of depends like is your
specification actually correct you're
sort of shifting the box from one bed to
another bit so I think and I don't
necessarily think that's what the
typescript designers would tell you but
I think there's sort of saying that that
proof is the only way to get correct
software is something that many people
would sort of believe in because they
believe that mathematics is the way of
getting to truth but equally there's
still room for for getting things wrong
and there's room for getting things
wrong even when my type system isn't
sound but yeah there's there's
definitely sort of different areas where
it will shift what are my core
assumptions but I don't necessarily
think that if I care for correctness it
sort of forces me to go in one direction
but that's that's the topic for probably
a longer break discussion
yeah so excuse my ignorance but when I
think of a philosophy of science the
person that comes to mind is Knut yeah
and so what I was wondering is include
usually turns out that except for some
rare exceptions that most of science
when they come up with new things they
have to figure out a way to explain and
reconcile with what we already know
because otherwise it won't be accepted
by the entire community yeah so I guess
I guess sort of philosophy question but
how do we deal with the fact that
sometimes these things that seem messy
how do we know that you're not just
being crazy how do we know that this is
something that makes sense
in the long run yeah yeah so how do you
know that you're not crazy
well popper would tell you you have to
come up with a falsifiable assumption
and then you're not crazy nobody does it
in computer science and lacA Tosh will
tell you sorry fire Albin's will tell
you well you'll never know sometimes you
seem crazy at the beginning and later on
it turns out that you were not crazy I
guess was what's interesting so I didn't
mention Coon because when he talks about
research paradigms he sort of says it's
something that covers the entire the
whole community like everyone has some
shared assumptions and he sort of does
it when talking about physics using
something like 300 years of history and
that's really hard to sort of apply to
computer science where we just don't
have that much history yet so I don't
quite know how to sort of apply Coon to
this in in in practice when you sort of
how do you know that something is a
science well it gets app gets accepted
as a paper by other scientists so yeah
you're not crazy if you can write the
paper that other scientists will think
it's not crazy and you sort of if you're
doing something crazy you have to find a
way to sort of go as far as they will
let you wait a bit and then go as far as
they will let you again
all right okay
