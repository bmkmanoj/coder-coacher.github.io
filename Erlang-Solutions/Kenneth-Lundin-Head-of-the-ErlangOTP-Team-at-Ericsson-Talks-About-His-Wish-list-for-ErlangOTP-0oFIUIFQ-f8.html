they work with the Vixen and I've been
for over a decade and it was actually
your honor that kill myself who I think
started and I give the conference
because Eric's on them and did it from
the beginning in the air so yeah we
definitely great the brain tracking or
GPM Airlines and then it became too big
yeah so yeah so Alex versus I'll go over
it's interesting how that happens so
often interpreters communities you have
to do the grassroots no words into the
conference on that idea when you succeed
a grocer point where you need a bit more
structure rounded and it's amazing to
see the turnout here in that it is
pretty taxing or good education on this
you see it so it's an event that all of
my employees they they can go with the
room too and I think we are twelve
twelve out of seventeen here in today
yeah that's very it's definitely a.m.
it's one of those experiences that I
find is really useful for even poor you
teens and people that are doing that day
to day right there's yeah there's
certainly connections that you make and
discussions that you can you have there
when you come to a conference like this
but you don't get you know behind desks
all right I think the important thing is
to make me users yeah and discuss again
that's more important than listening of
the poorest yeah it's actually the sort
of almost like the hallway track at the
conference yes yes so I think the
presentations are great I mean it's
really useful and there's this
discussion or dialogue that happens and
I think the presentations that I think
it's those spaces in between where you
get to have those discussions with users
and
different different experiences that are
really great yes and so and then you
just gave an updated sort of a status
update on over TP in the road map yeah
that was pretty exciting to hear form
sort of an annually perspective is there
anything that you wanted to share
condense and turns it sorted through
three negative takeaways to the
community I mean I thought about I
should have had one slime or in a
situation where I this is when I saw it
in the end talked about what we're
planning to do for the next year and so
on we I should have a wish list of
things that I want to see her and not
necessarily built by us but by anyone
yeah and it is more about support for
implementing micro services in Holland
and also support for Internet of Things
yeah it is acidity and there are a
number of passwords or protocols that's
good to have in in the echo system it's
like for example in the Artic exists
only the GRDC which is communication
implemented or developed I think by
folks from the beginning and it's
popular than my cloud micro service area
and it's built on top of HTTP 2 which I
think they will like somewhat support in
a line and the GRDC as well
yes it is invocation where you can
generate code there are also other areas
in the micro service the rest api there
are specification frameworks like Rommel
and swagger yeah which have support for
many languages but yeah they don't think
they have a good support for our yeah I
think there's a good opportunities for
community contribution as often people
may have used there's protocols or you
know those approaches with other
languages it really can take it out
learn and bring it to the relay misses
it and I think there's is also an
interesting opportunity I think for some
of that learning to be bi-directional
because Erlang is so strong in many ways
it's always been the micro-services
architecture in some ways right and has
had this you know integrally integrated
support for doing distributed systems
which many of those micro services and
those other languages are trying to
solve so ideally if people could bring
some of that knowledge around there's
you mentioned to their online ecosystem
I don't they have a lot of learning that
could be brought to the other languages
that they're working with right
were there any other examples maybe we
have other areas on that wish list
I mean clearly incremental things aerial
or some protocols like mqtt el toque
remember lang like way the m2m protocol
yankovic coop CQ AP yeah i'm only calls
interesting in that time yeah this is a
recent emerging protocols and I think we
is also in Europe they're lying and
elixir ecosystem with what's happening
around nerves
serve embedded hardware entirety there I
think there's there's lots of
opportunity to preserve a
cross-pollination between what's
happening outside of our ecosystem and I
think with some of the stuff that we're
doing quite well and I think maybe our
line doesn't necessarily need to execute
on the small thing but it could be very
suitable to implement server-side in
Armour yeah I think really goes to the
server side and sort of architecture for
deploying platforms like that every line
is just a natural fit for that right but
I think some of the protocols did to
sugar go out to the edge so to speak and
you know work with some of the smaller
devices and that that's a bit of a
mystery it's great well that's a good I
think that that's a great great extra
slide to get in the presentations and
then any other thoughts in terms of
other things that you might want to
share around their GP roadmap or you
know your your plans for the year
well the that is done of course if you
can have more contributions or
collaborations with developers I mean
it's better to have a ongoing
collaboration and just get the
contribution oh this is the code and
maybe it's done in a way that we don't
want in this vehicle yeah so it's more
likely that it gets into the main
release if we talk about it in
some agree on what to do so yeah there
is the whole BMO ecosystem is evolving
right now around Erlang and elixir in
Phoenix and nerves there's I think
there's some discussion around how that
community as a whole evolve and then
fostering more of that collaboration so
hopefully we can see a lot more that I
mean we have a lot of ongoing
collaboration with Cosima planks suggest
Chelsea hustles so yes I think we're
actually meeting on some rest tonight
which is great but I think these these
conferences present a really interesting
opportunity to do that because everyone
sort of face-to-face and there's an
opportunity to collaborate around the
collaboration and how we work together
and then you and start maybe doing coach
brands or contribution sprints where we
you know we use these events as like a
milestone where people were together and
even do some substantive tech support so
and we also in my wish list done if I
know that the LXE community is quite
strong but it comes to be that if they
develop something in the Alexia world
it's not so easily used from the other
yeah I think that focus right now is are
the focus of easel to make it easier to
adduce click sphere component from our
line yeah I think I think it which is
done a pretty good job of supporting
here and being able to use everything
that's available in Erlang and I think
almost the next wave of that is just
helping to foster that sort of
bi-directional flow where everything
that evolves and both languages can you
know can work in either
I'm not so we have just begun with the
latest on that is but I know there's
been some exciting developments this
year and that would be a great as Anna
be great to see more that over the
course of this year's okay okay well
that was really exciting I had the
fantastic talking we really appreciate
that humanity took to chat with a
service person and we look forward to
see you at the next conference and click
it okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
