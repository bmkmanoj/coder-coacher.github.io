robust systems and then in particular
how to take the server that we built in
the last section and make that rather
more robust you can imagine from what I
was talking about when I talked about
error propagation
it seems that errors propagate right the
way through a system in perhaps a
propagator Anza tively through a system
in a rather uncontrolled way and
potentially at least and I think the
advice that an airline architect would
would give you is to say make sure that
your system is layered appropriately so
numbering layers from from from one
increasing the number as we go down the
system that things level n plus and n
plus 1 are monitored supervised by
things at level n so exit messages might
be trapped and handled at level n minus
1 if things are going wrong at level n
with the application layer the work
being done at the bottom layer whatever
that is and again and this is supported
by some of the Erlang libraries and
design patterns application programmers
should not have to worry about the error
handling code this code should be
isolated in higher levels of the system
so application programmers deal with the
normal case with the unexceptional case
and exceptional cases are dealt with
uniformly across across the system by
the higher-level architectural layers
and in fact there will find that there
are processes whose only task is to
supervise their children and these are
called supervisor processes so typically
what we should expect to see is a model
or under like this so a clearly layered
tree structure in which the top level
nodes which you can see here are drawn
with double circles meaning that they
are trapping exits these are the ones
that monitor
the applications that sit at the at the
lowest level you can see here we have
actually layered supervision here so the
the node right at the top is responsible
for supervising the lower level
supervisors so we have a huge management
structure and then all the work done
right at the bottom so the in the middle
layer the process on the left is really
responsible for the first three
applications process on the right for
the last two and they will model those
and then if they happen to fail the
system at the top will take over and and
deal with deal with that sort of problem
now let's go back to our server we can
see that there are problems in that
naive server which were brought on by
clients coming and going a clients been
allocated a frequency what if that
client crashes before it is able to
release the resource what will happen is
that we all have a resource that's
forever allocated never D allocated and
so will gradually exist if we run with
that system we're going to find that
we're gradually finding having resources
used up and we in the end we become
starved of resource so what we want to
do is rewrite it in a way that makes
sure that if a client does crash then we
will handle that and in particular what
we'll do if a client crashes is that we
will deallocate the frequency that they
have allocated to them so let's have a
look at that about how that is done and
what what we've done is we've
highlighted in red the code that is
different from that that server and what
we have done is say that when we
initialize we put the trap exit flag
onto true so that means that our server
process is trapping exits in any process
to which it is linked now the next
question is how is it linked to other
processes what how is that achieved
now what we can see is in the allocate
process when we allocate a frequency to
a process with a PID we link to that PID
so every time we perform an allocation
we link to a process so that our server
will be linked to everything which has a
resource and then when we D allocate we
are able to unlink from that PID so this
handles we have to modify allocation to
link D allocation to unlink so that
during the period that that resource is
allocated to a PID we are linked to that
client now what happens if a client
terminates abnormally during while the
server is still alive and while they it
has a resource allocated to it well we
have linked to it so now if it does
terminate we will receive a message in
our main loop so what we need to do is
ensure that our main loop is extended to
handle those new messages that will come
in and what we do here is that we
process this incoming message by
defining a new function called exited
and what that will do is deal with the
situation that we've had so we see
coming in we match on the atom capital
capital exit with a PID and a reason and
what we do is we pass that PID together
with the data structure representing
what's which frequencies are allocated
from which not to the exited function
and the final bit of the jigsaw is to
see
how we deal with that situation what we
do in the exited function is we look up
on the PID to see what frequency is
allocated to it and if a frequency is
allocated we D allocate that frequency
using key delete otherwise we we don't
need to do anything
so what we're able to do here is knowing
the PID we can find the frequency
allocated and deallocate it and so that
has the effect if we go back to the main
loop of showing that when we get that
exit message saying that that to that
process has terminated abnormally we
make sure that it's frequency looking it
up with the PID gets D allocated and so
that the new frequencies data on which
we loop has that frequency free again
and just backtracking one more slide the
way that we're only linked to processes
which carry a resource so we link to a
process when we allocate it we
correspondingly unlink when we perform a
deallocation and the final bit of the
jigsaw running backwards is that when we
set up our server process we set the
traffic's it flag to true so that we
receive these abnormal termination
messages as exit messages rather than
killing the server so we're able now to
link an unlink and that the cause of
that is for us to receive exit messages
from links processes which terminate
abnormally and what we do there is look
up on the PID and allocate make sure
that that frequency which was allocated
the PID gets recycled
so here we can see another message
sequence chart if we get this final
crash then that what that will do is
send an exit message to the server so
what we've seen in this example is that
robust systems are built by making sure
that high-level processes
monitor supervised lower-level processes
we'll see that later on when we look at
look at the the OTP library and design
patterns and we've seen a particular way
of reverse defying our server so that
it's resistant to clients crashing and
it's also able to recycle resources that
are not so that they're not hogged
forever by a client having crashed while
being in possession of that resource and
the basis the mechanism were used for
that was the linking process which we
talked about in the first section and
linking allows exit signals to be sent
between processes propagated or not
according to whether or not we're
trapping exits and as we saw here when
we do trap exits and control whether a
linked we're able to respond to abnormal
termination in a way that makes our
system efficient and robust
