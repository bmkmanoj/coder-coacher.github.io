before I was study they put me with this
microphone thing and then I discovered
it easily then that before talking to
our busy God's the loop because it is
embarrassing to Susteren in the middle I
thought for Christ's sake thought they'd
turn the microphone off it also reminds
me of the time that i gave a talk to sun
microsystems a few years ago and i
noticed everyone was watching me going
onstage like this paper straws are
looking very peculiar and i finished my
tour crack talk to roy was with me said
why would you look at me said that you
like that is it Mike you're either
however that's where the nowadays they
called me a grumpy old man Harrington
because that's all I do I complained
about everything maybe they've got
things to complain about my there was
something to write their mind well
firstly a bit of history who I am that's
me I wrote my first program 1967 on an
IBM 1130 which has 16 kilobytes of
memory I suppose 67 was a long time
before lot of you were born but
nevermind i worked with developing real
Thai working real developing real time
Benes software for telecommunication
systems and I developed the first li
little machine the jam jams does jose
abstract machine it Joe here somewhere
that's not sure it's out of this Joey I
he know not to tell you the gory details
of the jamming why we don't use it any
longer I'll awake Morning Joe hello Joe
there's Robert here as he escaped hello
robert got easy he's too embarrassed to
be here at once once upon a time i tried
to sell their line that is a long
strange history but we started a company
called the airline systems aksi blog
actually belong is limited to Swedish
and I tried for about two years to sell
it I had one customer everyone just
immerse he'll explain to his son stage
why was necessary to have AI system and
Alaska's be able to live in America
that's one of another story through he
tells you that story upon try to meet
again I'm not working I actually was Roy
Benson employed Jane to see if she could
sell em I she looked at it for about
three months and said this is a bloody
silly idea we should be using you're not
selling it however having discovered
that i couldn't sell our lying and
they're going to do something else i
worked as a manager for the last 20 odd
years i think it's about 20 red with
this and manage groups between bouts of
the 15 and i think 50 was the smallest
i've had 600 mile stage I never learnt
all their names and anyway that's what
I've been doing I won't bore you all for
the address of force that why are some
program is better than others so what is
a product produced love total sub count
why is it you have to so many some teams
in detail almost telling when to go
eat their breakfast in the rental sort
of rather than the develop code that
some teams should do know by themselves
you don't have to worry about it why is
some project successful I'm Jews
wonderful products and not necessarily
successful commercially but they're too
beautiful forgotten why I suppose don't
why are not software projects much much
harder to run the small projects or why
can't you Brandon was a lots of small
projects we're not going to answer all
these questions these methods I thought
have answered all these questions I
might have anything to say learn next
time that Francesca are switching over
the top so I want to answer half these
questions I don't know whether I can do
the proper answer either but anyway so
for thoughts well this Ethan to
advertisements I trying to imply
programs i pulled these probes stir I
think they're from UK advertisements I
mobster few Kaiba thought that won't
embarrass anyone in Sweden especially
not my only employer who am I to issue
simple advertisements if you look at
these adverse events in detail you see
that they are all about knowing things
about C++ or Java Script or something
like that this is typical where the
people are the tightest taking a good
programmer or fridays no you
should never ever ask the people that
this of the way if you do this other
thing you'll get the second rate
programs that's what's what happened the
distribution don't do it that way
absolute rubbish so what's why should
you do you have to recruit programmers
who can show that they're protective can
actually show the leaf actually written
some code link works ensure that they
can develop systems you have the
programs programs who wants and learn
new things are you interested when you
sort of say oh by the way you want to be
program when they does it was did that
get another job I want to do c++ house
when they told me college that's not the
sort of person you want you want someone
that says that when you sort of sets a
new airline you say yes they say yeah
pretty much prepared to use castle by
using said please that's going to be
okay that's the sort of people do want
people want to learn new things people
want to be excited about what they're
doing and I have the right mindset you
have the right way of thinking about why
they want to do something what's the
purpose of it what's the meaning of life
well this is I soft enough the tories an
ideal program this what they should know
and I made a long long list they went on
for several pages and this is only paid
wall and i gave the conclusion that it
always going to apply anyone up and ask
them if they can do everything on this
dish it wouldn't work I couldn't do it I
wouldn't be able to find anybody with
all these attributes all these things
that they you so what you do instead we
are capable of writing any software why
why does it work how pretty much how
people who can do all things let's do
complicated will never find everyone
so what do we do instead well I came
across a paper a few years ago so the
cameras or two hops it said about
programming ability in favor from
British university faculty 2006 the URLs
there sure I'll give it your few
instances and it had contained some
remarkable statements which I think you
want you to look out for a bit the first
one is that programmability is nothing
to do with age with sex or with
education attainment nause mean
correlated any intelligence tests or
anything which should be neither done
but it can't give him more of a test in
products to see a little pellets to see
where they've got to go with a
programmer now this paper was about a
group of people who were found that
three-quarters of the computer science
for the people that looking for their
education never ever looked at a program
or whether why and what they do about it
hopefully sort that out in advance
strangely enough some years ago I was
asked by my favorite enemy in Erickson
HR HR human resources they neither you
nor are there resources they asked me to
sort of Kenai another the test fun to
see people could program Isis a very
easy to sit and a given the paper and
safety for our program on this organ
assoc Maxim sort of thing easy straight
finding some of the program was awesome
if the UC Merced they said no you said
you were fired
yeah however HR insisted that he wanted
to have some sort of way said he might
be other can get people couldn't program
to teach them a lot of the Willie go to
be able to do that or not so I thought
that I gets a good programmers I killed
them we've got some psychologists I've
got wonderful available i actually have
said over here to a psychologist a sort
of her i came back to view this story I
and all sorts of studies the is anyway I
think England was subjected to this
about remember that England well the
only conclusion that this succubus I
calls it came to is that the people they
had I said with no parole slightly above
average intelligence and exceed be bossy
inevitable they were tall however other
if see things that they came in this
paper that people are the computer
scientists or tell you you should
consider program or top down that's what
sort of a rational and roof and modeling
people always say stop that right all
this or bodies all about Oh
people never do that yourself the
bottoms of the difficulties first if you
get a difficult bit slow at work maybe
the top down bit afterwards as we always
worked this position paper somewhat
literacy stuff in it and in to see
combat there's a lot of us good
debuggers people if about finding bugs
and programmable programmers but a lot
of good Colonel are not put the burgers
they can't find
gennaro course interesting reflection
it's very much to me another final
things about oh my god is always perfect
and the last one is about pointing and
clicking the people try to make IDs and
I mentioned yesterday about in the
distal talk about sort of
point-and-click interfaces if you can
make everything point-and-click and
everyone's used to fighting eating on
thats and things like that you teach
anyone the program well also rubbish
that if you can't use Emacs account for
the you can't program no mouth of it
clips or contemplates is going to help
you know man modeling is going to help
you know my turn I think boxes writing
coding boxes instead of writing code on
the street is going to help you you
can't do it you can't do it that's all
there is to it which would lead me to
this challenge there are three types of
people you know the old they're seniors
there are two thousand people those
people who think through two terms of
people of those adults where are three
types of people there are those people
you never really need to teach the
program at all they serve low provoke
look at the program understand it and
some some sort of some sort of magic
happens and they learn how to do it who
those people that works very well I work
with a lot of people like that that's
how I wish I other people myself after I
became manager and however there are
people who could be taught program they
actually in the ability to learn and
then the third category that the people
however hard you try will never be able
to write
programming all their lives maybe we'll
be all throughout hello world but it
stops about there and you have to
remember that the third category is the
largest category people never be a
program unfortunately programme unity' a
full of these people lots of them they
become managers instead of finance
people and about things like asinine
thousands of horribleness advisor said
so this is a lot escape routes into mr.
800 gets Angeles the only way to find
out of a person can program is told to
do it look at it see the results and the
divider prize a simple programming test
years ago where we employ people and
again it may still off of other people
erickson when I recycle problem i said
well these people come from kth they've
had a good education they've got top
marks in all their classes they must be
some good programs i say that's an essay
listen i'm going to give them a test and
see if they were working on the engine
about this test i never they create the
results we used to send this asshole to
people say write these program through
this initiative works and so designed
this from the first and people that are
the two you could do it they they they
said pat results it'll always create the
people that you knew they couldn't do it
discover from the test they couldn't do
it and then they never got a test
package should have which is better it's
also very easy to discover other people
cheated because you could ask them to
explain what it doesn't test fernando
you can see the result so if you employ
a program for God's sake give them a
good test first as easy to make it s
like that y'all can do it really good
again a child on that one earth house in
this test
we have a lot of the ways I said no you
do it in progress enjoyed programming it
should be something our articles working
and write as horrible software must if
you've got that Judith it's never good
work people are never going to go
through programs let's say think it's
fun the people that sort of Irish it all
happen to use you've got to do something
in the evening and your life following
up saying when you build it come home I
just saw this going to finish and nearly
finished I'll be ready in half an hour
for your half an hour later she fell why
aren't you at home I'm so the kids are
looking after I need you to sit this I
need to go and say wow this is kevin is
small and enjoy things come and they
follow us when we do have to go home
with a little something and you right in
the middle of your code I got this far
that's what I'm going to do tomorrow and
you realize when you come back tomorrow
is what do you think he 10 minutes to
get sort of the half an hour get started
again but their programming something
that needs assistance it's not my son
here Kari turn the key in the third car
goes if you're lucky it's something we
takes about half an hour to get into
programming mode and learn what you're
doing yesterday if you're doing
significant program which is why things
like open plan offices or complete
disasters or a program as a concerned
you have to say people don't realize
that people should optimize the wrong
with this is why running a big project
is very difficult because the good
people are the people that can find the
books and when it just becomes along and
said
developing you have to prioritize the
customer both above everything else you
have to go to people and you say look
I'm very sorry I have to interrupt or
what you're doing I need this boat fixed
because the customers scream he's not
paying us in this yoga does he pay that
you all get paid this is why there is a
terrible compromise between sort of
maintenance and developing colder why
you should keep it separate if you can
the way you can't the other thing about
a good programmer is you can always tell
us a good programmer always hates his
manager that Lisa Lisa hate management
that don't understand what it's all
about and as a video interesting
characteristics and the problem of
learning new things lots of new things
to the most exciting things that aspect
of our own right outside looking a
couple of puppies and the program wasn't
you tools or operating systems
applications and most of all the good
program is someone that makes mistakes
you don't make mistakes you don't learn
everything and you have to make mistakes
you have to experiment you have to do
things you've never done before and you
could tell a good programmer because a
good runner will do that not only in a
while programming a good runner will
make mistakes and do other things as
well with beaks expensive we'll try
going into holidays stupid place in
finding those two silly place how
holiday group overall biases a stupid
car because of sorts of things in these
national muffin or what it is is a
Vauxhall van Gogh is a good progress
made mistakes because they're interested
in
and exciting they don't worry about
making mistakes also the program will
learn from his mistakes at Upstate you
don't learn from the sake of learned
anything to make the same say twice and
then you're stupid and definitely
rocking code we make signal same day
lots of times now some / no reason trial
and error process and this is a
fundamental thing which you have
demolished randonneur for the first time
you put your code in a digit code you
put in the papaya papaya tells you which
see where where the syntax errors are
simply trial Harry know these quickly to
find that the compiler to find syntax
errors that it is to find them yourself
you don't spend three days staring at
code to make sure that the part is going
to get in find right is easiest to do
that it starts there and then you sort
of all sorts of things are finally on
debugging tools that's why we have
static analysis tools because it's trial
and error it's easiest to stuff off find
out what's wrong and collectibles of
course you don't put too many errors or
pencil cases of four errors but it is
important and also this is something
which is fundamentally not understood by
management management don't understand
the programming trial error management
think that by salon giving a
specification the some sort of factory
like process today a few about 20 years
ago there's a lot of talk about what
they call the software factory remember
you're only telling me had this vision
software factory the first are there are
the if statements the second ones
writing assignments the third line about
the case papers when we pass it to each
other the crane gang Ericsson cycle or
doesn't work first year years ago
five years it wouldn't make programming
more efficient the best way to do it is
to use the fact we got different time
zones in the world and we serve together
people in Europe to start off writing
the code when they finish they got to
tactical all in there they hadn't know
within the Americans and when the
Americans have sort of gotten done the
next phase of currently honey there was
someone in the below the Pacific and
enter the Indians until it all came all
the way back again people don't realize
it doesn't work that way but there are
still lots of management's and think it
does and this is why you get these
horrible processes horrible ideas and
people don't understand about the other
thing about it is that a program is
repaired a good program prepared to
spend a lot of time testing its code the
thief's hiding a bug is fun you old goat
have another once is great service Carl
I have that understands it is important
throughout necessary documentation and
is equally important not to write a
necessary documentation the necessary
documentation actually a very good way
to start is right the manual on how it's
going to work and what amuse you should
know about it at the end right at first
and then you have a certification which
you can so change as time goes on
because sooner or later going to health
write a manual wouldn't like it a lot so
you might start by doing a program of
lights teaching others and the light
retaining old cold because it says
strange that a lot of people always
think this was under is he knew his name
anything during some him looking old
stuff and then as any new features I was
wrong the last one is important is that
you're always always going to God
organization at people different
abilities and you have to have good
program will tolerate people as the loss
is good we're going to need those people
at the end of the day at the end of the
day
software which is going to be maintained
by 20 years for 20 years 20 years later
the people you're not going to get the
top quality people to maintain software
which is 20 years old that is the fact
of life and that being so the good
program has to have the capacity to be
able to understand that people very
tolerate the fact that people work in
different ways now England know who
these guys are that's right magnificent
rugby team probably one of the most
coordinated that's one of the other
thing habit that they're making rude
gestures for a moment explain what
they're going to do to the people who
they beat it's not a hard cap I'm sure
you find about how tender heart code
youtube you want the good i have in the
show's within this mythical eyes again
is a URL again here's what i found
interesting paid fairly recently and it
was paper saying there are three things
that the top 30 must have to be at work
they must know what they want develop in
detail what they're going to do if know
what you're doing if the why you're
doing it i get more detailed things and
you've got to know how able to go about
doing it if you don't get those three
things in place then you're in trouble
so i continued for examples of weight or
one is our police or lets up anyone know
about each robinson incredible best
present brain store nice machines making
pancakes what can vary sometimes you can
have a detailed specification sometimes
the customer said i want this and he
gives you specification exactly what he
wants and you can leave this reason
customer you can work without otherwise
you're after
work with the customer gave me the
specification sometimes you got standard
and that's what tends to happen tourist
areas we have huge humongous 3gpp
standards with an incredible amount of
detail everything that has to happen I
need to get a mobile network to work and
these standards are actually necessary
it could have a number of people in the
making handsets and number of people
that are making base stations and the
base stations have to be able to talk to
the handsets and then pointed out is a
very very complicated protocol very very
complicated products that they say that
the 3gpp standard for for wcdma i was on
3g it deliberately made complicated so
there's a small companies cops of the
job I company think that's true but a
nokia handset no chaos that has to be
able to talk to at aricent base station
that and they they have to be maintained
in similar ways because operates fine
succeeded it with otherwise so don't not
the fact that people were stationed at
large project is no way what the fact
you can make a mobile TV system without
having hundreds of people who were
working it is not thousands I think in
the areas if you look how many people we
had working on
on wcdma was about 4,000 programmers but
it was actually necessary okay we
couldn't probably done it with fewer but
we would have needed several hundred the
least sometimes the big idea is good
enough sometimes you need other spec as
you're going along you want to make a
non SQL database you want to make a chat
server you don't need to do it it's good
that provided you yourself or the source
of the spec that's okay but on the other
hand I've seen several projects we have
had a vague idea of the we've got to
make a platform assault over now I can
talk about this nowadays because I
believe Eric sorry shorty was about your
tire but in the 1990s was a wonderful
protocol a GM which factory in fact
spent over a billion dollars in making a
platform before it was in abandoned and
main reason i think that the it went
wrong I mean people play to the fact
everyone can write everything a c++ we
should miss me he's made handicapped but
the main reason that wrong they don't
quite knew what they were trying to
develop why they were trying to develop
it they were going to make a platform
which made a home location register huge
database at the same time the same
software and from the ATM switch so they
landed that were the only system in
which and there which had a huge
database of an ATM switch in the middle
it and it was hardly surprising that
this projects or the film is an enormous
crush that I tell stories about that if
you just in love so the how I discovered
it was going to
we closed down rather the last I want
allowed to tell anyone about this so I
went to the lose my Baba phone I'll be
honest tell you all about it the term oh
it's nice leaving a company should be
makin some else's about things are
feathers any reason you have to know
what you're doing what what is important
to be motivated you guys know why you're
doing you have to see what you're doing
is sensible you have to think this is
enjoying an idea to make this is
software that it beats me that a lot of
people work at the munitions industry
making our systems and they think it
says something I think it's fun they
must be perverts this of the working out
of the world way to think make bombs
missiles are going to kill people thumb
that I got have all does he was there
was a long time ago that's a good
colleague of mine refuse to take a job
behind him establish a I thoroughly
regretted offers you have to know baby
what's your development why why do you
have to think it's a sensible thing to
develop and say no one licensing
stupidly might be said sensible for I
hear from an academic point of view
might be sensible because it's an
intellectual challenge it might be
sensible because it's a good product but
you have to think it's a good thing to
do and yes I think it sees its nice in
the beach system is very important if
you're only making a small part of a
system that you know how that's all part
of the system fits into the big profit
system why it does somehow it
contributes that very frequently you see
organizations where they can program
your job to this is
they program isn't in the system and now
the focus i hear what is good for why is
good never get motivated people to do
that senseless I think you need to
believe the final product serves you
useful purpose in life how I paid for
building site I've never understood how
many whenever build the building I've
tried myself as a bit more mysteries
let's be a strategy of how everything
fits together it doesn't really matter
if assistant different parts of our
system using different technology but
you must have overall strategy of how
everything's going to fit together in
the end wats of technology is going to
use the wall parts you can't have
someone that says I think this part
should be doing today I and says life
and then the parts is actually use
rationale Rosati to develop this part
and other part says I should use P first
develop this bit and hope that they all
going to fit together at the end of the
day obviously you have to have a
strategy about what sensible pet shop
sensible technology to use of all places
and then when you made this strategy in
a big party you've got to lose some
people you're going to lose some people
because you say we're going to develop
this way using airline and other
people's I don't want to do that I'll do
something else fair enough good that
they've gone but they don't want to use
a technology you've agreed on it's
better that they go on the other hand is
hope hopefully the technology is a good
technology of you made a good choice
there must be a good reason for choosing
technology it forcing company policy now
people start saying this is where we do
this in
company XYZ this is the technology
you're going to use like it or leave it
the people making a product has to be
agreed in the technology they have to
think it's the right technology
otherwise it's not going to work that
I've seen too many people forced use
technology they don't like you never get
a good result for the end of that I have
not mentioned too many damn time i get
suit people as this a must enjoy working
with it and the last one here is a quote
from another new zealand person I
original key frame cranking another
network we look here elegance is not
optional a sister you may ask the
elegant software has to be elegant if
it's elegant it's probably good software
our ligand is not optional eyes actually
a very vital part for making it our
system okay since we don't have ideal
programmers we have to have a team they
give a rugby team here that so quiet NY
hey screw a few years ago many years ago
I was playing rugby and I skank Ruby
wish we could tell them that in America
Thursday robious as a hooker they are
they begin to look at you'll be
peculiarly but on the other hand the
hookers it actually appears in Romeo and
I landed over the name of the scrum well
someone's boot caught me beside the chin
miss you took this side because I
brought my jaw tofu flew outside know
how to place and since that it was a
scrub nurses and i decided i hate scrub
but he did scrum a long time for scopes
actually use the software technology
however if you don't have a idler
program you have to have tea which has a
people which has a lot of the
characteristics of idea programmers you
whatever you do you must avoid the large
traditional company approach even there
it's a maxim current changing this now
it's taking time with its occurring that
you don't want people that you have a
department of systems people you have a
department of programmers and you have
the department of testers and your
department integrators in the department
and deliverers department of maintainer
that was the way the last company's work
for years stupid idea you have to have a
team where each member of the team can
do everything they're not necessarily
equally well but anyone comes do
everything everyone happy birthday uncle
everyone for those specifications about
maybe some people better than others but
young guilty people each member of the
team can't do everything you'll get that
but you should strive with us what about
agile angleton for agile at CERN I had
the operations when did you work to
believe what what's a lot of time
how long friendship dogs and she got a
email former Frances long time ago do
you know anything about agility and say
oh yeah I don't go see fragility so I
Charlie parking all the idea the fact is
if you look at the good teams have been
working for years you'll find that
they've been working in a child fashion
long long time before this idea of
agility of strobes turned up before
starting to exist before scrum and XP
and Kanban was invented okay he's caused
us to bad idea I'm not going to knock it
too much but let's face it is too much
religion in this that there's too much
attitude a lot of people providing you
have the right way of working providing
you have the right way process you can
have stupid programmers in the world
right creddies is rubbish you too much
religion keep your religion out of it
okay strung by all means but let's do it
sensibly let's regard it as one of the
things that is needed not the thing
which will solve all problems technology
will never be replaced by good methods
of work it's never gonna happen that way
and as I say they are plenty of examples
I can think of at least three examples
team to type I had in my organization as
it were excellently agile fashion
without any sort of a turn you need to
you scrub our horns like this in two
years years and years ago so okay
annuity yes but don't think is the
answer to all problems don't think that
it is something new it's not okay what
for people do we need in the project we
either guru guru is essential a guru is
a person that knows
it's all about understands the complete
specification knows exactly why thing is
going to do what it's going to be
developed for knows the details in tour
without the guru you'll never get the
project working the ghoul sometimes can
be several people that's a bit disasters
you need one guru keep everything
consistent the Guru understands it beat
architecture of the designs and why it
is the way it is what's well guru isn't
a little person that sits in the sort of
a corner and hopes that people come and
ask question good we'll go out and this
is sort of missionary will explain how
the system works wire works or what is
good for without the Guru you won't get
the consistent the Guru's make
necessarily be the best programmer but
the Guru doesn't understand the
application and the Guru is a programmer
hearts understands how r what program is
about maybe you're the best programmer
but at least understand why this is
being what it's supposed to do for
what's my boobs program that maybe
doesn't program their day-to-day basis
but if you are struggling to go to a
question that Google guru will say I
don't know the answer to that you'll
find out what the answer is for you were
pointing to the right person and the
guru will know the awesome self
surveillance of the more girls are
essential not good as you you'll make a
product and I in fact I look at the
erickson products
public projects have been successful I
actually identified in all of the hulu
guru walls or is they do live offers the
all-around an experimenter you have to
have someone that really understands
everything that can keep this a bit
everything together it can understand
the tech software technology that could
be used understands why for example if
you look at assistant built with OTP
understand how they are handling
mechanisms work in detail I can
experiment with and play around with a
mess around and get more all right the
Guru can jump in and work inside be
around that you jump in and working any
part of the projects you can say I can
help anywhere and that's because the
Guru is that sort of person understands
the technology maybe doesn't understand
everything say the Guru dundas house who
able to look at every part of the
technology and make sure that
everything's fitting together make sure
the whole thing either person creases
the wheels making sure that they have
the work actively in the project the
all-around is a person at this
experiments that says that all this
places we have the capacity we need in
the system now if we change this waiver
change the programming model here it
would change the architecture there we
change the process structure and then go
on a work late at night over a week or
whether we can make this very see you in
actually looks any better you need this
person because this is the person that's
actually
make sure the technology person if you
like to keep the technology alive
enthusiasts and experiments can be me
anything can be performed as user
friendliness development efficiency will
just simply making assists more elegant
you need the include the organizer and
enthusiasm bringer usually the same
person somewhere at the end of the day
you brought to me something which
included some sort of project manager
it's not not not nice that say you're
going to need them but the important
thing is approaching money is how to
program the project might understand
that I've seen too many systems where
the project managers have never program
their life and don't understand why
daughters together how does it feel a
daily basis you have to have a project
manager who don't subprogram the
30-month you also has a person that
needs to be enthusiastic is where their
arms about keeper will happy the actual
what why how will they mentioned earlier
that is something to actually the humid
paint it needs to be some contained if
you remind people what they're building
if there might be for why they're
building it you have to remind you how
they're building it and keep them aware
of the fact it's a very good thing
they're doing it this way otherwise the
people will drift off and try to how in
a different way or we'll try to change
the product it's important that someone
keeps up the enthusiasm of the guy now
these people usually charismatic people
will walk around that they're usually
good managers and then they usually the
UV light fun people you need you never
get an organizer
30 manager who is a bumper bully will
alienate the project of the team and
it'll everything will go wrong it's also
important that pretty much understands
that things go wrong and doesn't stop
blaming people with me things go wrong
such finds out could see things that go
around see what to do about it and
learned early that something has to be
done about the situation so Sora see
organized in enthusiasm bringer the
human skills are as important as
software skills the mechanic the
mechanic is really needed and they can
lead is something which keeps the whole
bloody system working the mechanic made
sure that the email system works make
sure the version control system make
sure the backups are actually done you
can't rely on my IT departments working
behind you to do this other thing to
make sure that the programming system
workbook installed new compilers when
new version of the compiler de iturbide
looks at the requirements handling
system make sure that it's actually got
all requirements in other works look at
the build system to check that you can
press a button build a system of the
whole thing works those are the test
framework to make sure that automatic
testing works ish it should work looks
at the delivery system to see that you
can actually deliver things to customers
and Mail wiki bug handling systems the
mechanic just has to be there to make
sure
system actually works so the actual
day-to-day infrastructure what people
are doing actually works you probably
need more than one mechanic mechanic
needs a lot of apprentices to keep it
keep them going without mechanic if you
know systems are sort of fail you can't
print out documents all your things will
work irritable so they can it is
essential person a lot of these girls
can be combined with each other but I
think in mechanic's it's probably a
large project at least a full time job a
super tester the super tester is a
person that understands the project from
the problem nearly as well as guru
sometimes in small projects the Guru
listen / tester the same thing I'm super
testicle work out if I do these peculiar
things this is what made the system
crash and I'm going to do they make the
system crash the super tester is
essential you have to have a super test
it could actually find out all the weird
and wonderful things that the end users
of the system is actually going to do
and go make it crush and when the super
testifies the bug is not going to go to
the programmers at how are you a mistake
with not funny it's simplechess there's
be a capful person yes Pacific you know
I've Hansen from your coat I can show
you what's around or oily and the people
who do that were said wow I found the
mistake my toe isn't that fun finding
mistakes should be fun it shouldn't be
some punishment it should be something
you regardless nice good I found
something is wrong assume people so they
can offer may find big fixes can also
themselves say this is what needs to be
done to keep the system going the super
tester is someone that can also point
out in detail how to reproduce the fault
will fault occurred what to do about it
the time they used to be a few years ago
Lord in eretz and the tradition of
testers whose job was to write what we
call karoon reports when they found
something was wrong but they sort of
their true report and then he went had
the next cup of coffee the super
technician do that simtech should run to
the person and they find whether the
department and said this is what's wrong
you shouldn't communicate by mail
systems you shouldn't communicate via
Sandberg report systems these are
necessary as well just make sure things
happen you should communicate
person-to-person learning to test it
does it also test coverage make sure
every part of the system is tested make
sure every line of code is tested make
sure every branch it tested okay can't
we all but as much as you possibly can
the librarian integrate the maintainer
I'll show that the number of people that
worked we work together in the OTP group
or years ago can identify a number of
these people that sometimes soon as
mechanic but someone actually has to
maintain version control system where
they're using git or CBS or horribly
using erics and clear case is somewhere
has to maintain the version control
system and make sure everything works
make sure that everything can be checked
in properly make sure that all the
system hasn't got too many branches and
maintains the test and delivery
so you just have to press about that
anyone committing delivery system at any
time and you should take 0 minutes to do
that and check the whole thing works you
need the librarian the librarian net
doesn't necessarily have to be the best
programmer librarian doesn't have to be
some of a very good programmer than a
very nice to understand version control
has to make sure that everything works
and actually with the system is being
used correctly very important role the
document a well I lose project a group
that I work together that's a very good
group where child reported together
years ago and their productivity is not
used today I won't embarrass them to
save the world and one of the reasons
their product was not used today is that
no can ever understand how it worked and
the reason that no one could ever
understand how how it worked was simply
that they had hated documentation so
much they ployed a special consultant to
come ridin documentation consultant have
two problems which made it that he made
it possible to complete work together
with very right documentation the first
told me he didn't understand the system
either but he wasn't highly paid
yourself Indian or the money the other
one does he know to the baths he saw the
sweat and no one would ever go near it
because they explained things are how
things worked result of that because
there wasn't any documentation the the
no one could ever work it out
occasionally we find people who capable
reading
skoda workout alla system worked and
what they would do they did that they
were actually be able to do systems but
it was more sort of trial and error
process through their work the
documentation is essential and I think
that's one of the things we actually got
right I think I thank Joe Vella that
early in the days when we make your TP
were realizing that we actually have
assented manuals and I've still got the
original set of ltp manuals way as a
witch who will produce the time we
actually when we did that we actually
made a beautiful set of manuals which
had constructed documented things in
detail I think Jojo got involved in the
production of documentation systems and
I think that writing a new typesetting
system was a serious threat to America
teasing his thesis was a lodger you need
to understand what needs to be
documented in what does not need to be
documented and the end of the day the
most important thing to document is how
the system works and so people can use
it user documentation is probably most
informed and from user documentation you
can often derive the documentation a lot
of people can click hopeless at
documentation I often look at people
thesis workers that come a right there
pieces of their MSC thesis or you're
doing presentations after they're
finished about their working and these
presentations nearly universally awful
because they have no understanding why
they writing there why they've written
the deafies recommendation who the who
the audience is the third will
understand it the term one of the
haddock is severely missing in any sort
of computer science education is
education and what document what
multilocular you have to understand the
needs of the people who read the
documentation and as well as that you
have to be able to write clearly
grammatically correct concisely pedagogy
and your fair hotel to help other people
to do so so documented or he doesn't
write all the documentation but make
sure that documentation which is written
is actually readable and understandable
and I is not written in some sort of
weird way translation of documentation
is also an enormously difficult problem
because the people that translates also
have to understand why they're
translating spelling spelling not a
problem Jana I can't spell to this
matter spelling can be Australian
correct as nowadays on the other house
funny connectors can make all sorts of
weird mistakes that is very correct in
Harrison a program called framemaker
which consistently suggested a very
obscene
well I'll tell you what he was every
time that everyone's had worked with
Erics it changed direction unfortunately
so commander the documentation went out
or people have most change okay we have
the findings of the program is the
madman it has been bad to program must
be crazy the anyone who thinks that they
can spend their days working the trial
and error process has to be absolutely
crazy well it's good the operation is
the way works other a good program will
in turn is an to any aspect of software
design whether it's sort of writing Java
for further system interfaces or whether
it's writing a DSP see to do based on
controlling signal processors or whether
it's writing Eric use control systems a
good programmer needs to be officers
will be the sort if they learn learn
everything and a good program I see the
Lord programmers who is an individualist
and actually more programs who are so
individualist so they can't work
together with other people that's a good
programmer Burma has to be able to work
with other people it has to be able to
sort of will work in a nice helpful
manner as an important characteristic
interpreter program if you don't Ryan or
that one man team is to be able to work
with other people the social aspects and
programming are actually both well the
question need to ask Israel if you see
an if you see a project is Israel
process the has to be a process which
describes on everything
yes everyone has to know how everything
works you have to know how requirements
are found how requirements will be
broken down to this market Xu how the
parts of the architectural program
helped pass the test now assistant built
our system is that sound system
delivered Allison to maintain our
version control isn't done how bird
reporting is done has to be process if
you don't have a process and you don't
actually have very very simple
documentation i'm not talking about
whose files talking about a few sheets
paper saying how pricey me dog process
