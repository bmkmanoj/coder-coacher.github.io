andreas blonde so and i'm talking about
integrating phoenix channels into your
existing rail peg and so i have seen
that some of you are rails guys so i
hope this is interesting for you but
also they're going to also be used on
other back end so it's not only rails
related and again as I said hello and so
my name is kelly osbourne you can find
me at deep flame on github and also on
twitter I work for Swedish company
called it's in the node and what we do
is we have a goal go tracking system for
companies where people can you know put
their goals and they can put in the
progress so what we have is there
actually a rails API in the back end so
it is very simplified overview of our
you know of the app that we have and we
have an API client that's currently
developed in ember Jas and of course you
know he's a very happy customer he's
using our app just alone and he thinks
everything is also because everything is
working out very very fine but what
happens if and the many clients right i
mean we know the the same thing and so
what happens is that when the his
colleagues and he's still you know
trying to update his progress and what
happens is they of course have no clue
what he's doing and because they don't
get any updates there's nothing new to
us and certain they may think you know
the whole app is not so cool and made
reject it and so the idea that part we
need to push the data from the server
and there are in rails different ways to
do it and you know you can also wait for
rails 5 to come up you know they have
this amusing action kayla built in but
since there's an extra conference and
phoenix of course scales way better i
think so no offense so we used phoenix
for the pops up side and of course you
have too many web sockets is just
amazing to have on one beef machine menu
you can have that and so again so we use
finish them for pops up but then the
question is of course and how do we
talk from rail to Phoenix and also
different protest so that I thought that
using Redis em is you know a good thing
to do because it's very fast it's just
reliable and it's out enough for a lot
of years and you could use this Phoenix
pops up redis adapter that is the
official you know read as pops up
adapter for Phoenix yeah so and how this
is working then is dead and the rest api
needs to talk kind of something that
Phoenix understands so it has to speak
kind of etf VT f stands for external
term format as you probably know so this
is kind of the serialized and way of you
know having yeah it exert or Erling
terms in the binary format and that will
be pushed out then published taratus and
phoenix and pick it up and push it out
to the other clients everybody's happy
and there's a ruby gem for that that i
put together it's called phoenix pops up
and that you may check out and as a
summary it's very easy to integrate
because phoenix already comes with this
officially ready pops of adapter for
rails we have this Phoenix pops up thing
and but for others you can also use an
ETF sterilizer you know there's one I
think for java that also the earning
guys froze and I guess they're probably
also something out there and for other
languages yeah so the idea is that you
can use this to bring election Phoenix
into your company you know if you say
well you have these different blog posts
about you know 20 million web
connections i think is very good selling
point and the idea that is to add this
for us hopefully to my great aunt irma
API endpoints from rails to phoenix
that's the idea and hope you find it
useful so thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
