am so I actually put a slide out
that I've actually works in software
since nineteen sixty seven which is
before most of you were born that's
correct not you her and I know your
other and not new beyond are either was
there and then I first started in
Fortran to on an IBM 1130 process that
you'd have 16 kilobytes of memory times
have changed considerably I join
directly in 1970 and I spent a long time
developing software in C and assembly
language I remember one thing from that
time that i wrote a real-time calendar
in assembly language and you may
remember that just before the year 2000
there was a great panic in the world the
world was going to stop rotating because
everything was going to go wrong with
the year 2000 because of the great two
thousand ships so they asked me to look
at my code and say I say you know does
it does this really work and I looked at
my code written assembly language I say
if I written that wrote it just shows
how quickly you forget things anyway
where the computer science lab I will be
on a deck it was hits out there was my
manager a few years later I became
pianist manager so he was under there I
also fired be on there was also sit sit
he was actually I think we filed a
fabulet I think we and then went out and
celebrated afterwards because he got a
good deal I always look worried be on it
she's just passed my sister boo baby and
we had a crazy idea at the time that our
site I do introduce unix to Erickson and
I was actually the person that wrote the
first virtual machine which I think we
talked about yesterday JoJo's abstract
machine I actually implemented it in in
airlock and then people like clacker and
Tony took over the Machine and made it
work properly but mom she was actually
using the product for number times the
first time I think that I ever had the
problem of sort of air were telling
people that the weird error messages
which came out actually meant something
we there was ever a weird idea that
would sell our line we started a company
there's a long background history about
this which I will not going to call
airline systems axial our galaxy blog is
limited in Swedish and in one way now
that I actually landed up becoming the
managing director of this company it was
the smallest company in the Erickson
concern and the least profitable company
compared to its size and was me the
Secretary on the salesman we sold one
system to a guy in Alaska elf viga who
some of you might know know and then I
decided that I'd do better things so I
gave up trying to sell ericsson in one
way now that I became a manager and I
worked as managing ericsson for about 20
years either just about two years ago I
decided had enough managing people and I
want to take life easy so I'd if did a
few other things before retiring so
nowadays I do exactly what they want if
I writes off to our right software i
want to write myself I don't do anything
anymore conceivably other than myself
might want so that's my background there
I've observed a large number of projects
in various what was working and since it
see how things work I know vaguely what
works I have a very good intuition i can
say very rapidly that this won't work I
found it very difficult to say
project this will work but weeding out
the ones that won't work is very easy so
we're finding out the ones that actually
will work is more difficult the first
thing you have to remember about
programming is that not everybody is
actually very good at programming in
fact most people absolutely love your
programming and they if you look at the
people that they confronted with the
weird interfaces that they have on
trying to sort of control their video
recorders once upon a time or trying to
sort of take their android phones and
all the rest of it hardly any of them it
is very very difficult for the average
person to do these things and that's not
even programming we haven't got very far
the average person finds it using
something like Excel very difficult
despite the fact that a lot of people
can use now you people already know how
to program and it's not you probably
find it difficult to understand but most
people can't program and they will never
be able to do that all the people that
can program that there is a huge
difference between the people that do it
well and the people that do it badly
that I the figure 15 is often quoted as
a matter of productivity it's not even
just a question of that that's
the people that can't program they also
write lousy program some al a full of
bugs so the difference between a really
good programmer and a lousy program that
is you know you can talk about factors
100 easily what's can you know notice
about good programmers well firstly that
all good program is incredibly agro
centric you've probably seen Joe on
stage and I think that no one would sort
of a deny the fact that he has a slight
touch Vega centricity in his personality
the other thing about sorry get this
thing and the other thing you can say
about good programmers is that good
programs don't understand the need for
project management AG really good
program can manage themselves and I was
talking to as someone actually also Joe
the other day and he said you know in
Erickson they do things in a strange way
they want people to write implementation
proposals before they actually write any
code and they pass implementation Brasi
sakes that's crazy what kind you said
stood you straight off there and
implement things well this is simply
because if you have a project the last
group my last their organization a
mannish direction and 140 programmers
and then if you talk to people the good
program will say well you don't need
undone 40 programs once it's not true
you cannot recruit in a sane large
organization hundred forty program as it
costs too much and they aren't available
and probably they don't want to work for
this sort of May bradya base station
service they want to do cool things like
writing nice graphical interfaces or
protocols or management protocols he
wanted man manage money getting 140 good
programmers than normal industry each is
not possible and you have to realize
you're going to have to work with maybe
10 good programmers 130 mediocre
programmers and quite a lot less media
for it is no good at all and that is the
reality of life and
this is what good programs don't
understand good programs never
understand that other program sounds as
good as they are you can also realize
that people can be good at incredibly
different things and very few people to
go to all of them written some of them
knowing the program knowing the domain
of what you're trying to program is
probably more important than
understanding programming languages or
databases or whatever the actually
knowing understanding in detail what is
it i'm going to program or why am i
going to do that is the the most
essential characteristics that in the
police in position i had no reason at
that time we were I said 140 programs we
were actually writing part of the
software for radio base stations the
actual number of program is working
radio base stations is it probably about
300 so I was doing about half of it
honest I wasn't doing awfully I was
telling people how to do off of it which
now wasn't even doing that i was
watching while people did half of it and
they you can realize all the people of
the hundred forty had about five or six
that really understood what they were
doing the rest of them were actually we
are going to be told by these five or
six people this is what you need to
program and this is now our need how you
need to do it okay other people learned
but knowing how to manipulate the weird
systems you have in the mere programming
languages you have and then also being
able to be very good the application
domain is very very rare you I think
must listen to plaka earlier on his
keynote track it is an incredibly rare
animal like a cake is of kelly rowland
can actually understand everything he
does about his major systems and what's
more he's an extraordinarily good
programmer with certain exceptions i had
to create some of this code
he never realized that strings ended
with a zero and if he did a Malick on
the string you had to do a Malik's
string length of one the first thing
with clackers code was gripped for
string length and I'd 12 all the answers
but 10 worst thing that's an awful sort
of bug because it works one time in
foreign a 32-bit machine however
technology have to be good at some
people to go to that some people of
version control testing is a weird
animal at the day I saw that quote the
other day I come from where it came from
that all good testers are good
programmers but not all good programmers
a good testers which is very true to
being able to be have that perverse
attitude that I'm going to mess around
with the system and they make it to make
it go wrong you have to have a sort of
sadistic attitude I think towards the
programmers I'm bloody well going to
show these people they can't write code
and find the bugs so testing is a little
bit just being able to do release
handling and delivery is a skill which
is very underappreciated there's a lot
of things but the thing to remember in
organization I've never met anyone
that's good at all these things there
are very few people that go these things
and with the one of the first things I
say in a if you've got to run into
project make sure you have at least one
person in your project that understands
at least everything that these do one of
these things no one will understand all
of it but if you're going to start the
project go through the people you've got
in your project and say have I got
someone that can know all these things
necessary in my organization if I
haven't got that person go and find that
President and if you can't find that
person don't start do something else
it's brutal but it's true during the
time I discovered there are a lot of
people that don't want to use languages
that I used example Havana I've seen
this in other cases the most prevalent
thing I saw in Erickson was not people
that didn't want use Erickson who once
you want to use a airline but people
that didn't want to do modeling with a
wonderful thing called rose real time I
think the some of you have seen rose
real count that it is the most horrible
programming system i have ever seen in
my life and I had great sympathy for
people doing this and I had a great
problems to try and persuade people in
my organization it was very good I
couldn't even pretend myself that it was
very good i just said this is what you
have to do to get the system out very
sorry folks you have to sort live with
it however that I'm met in my life for
so the number of people didn't want to
use airline or what did I not found i
can give you some examples there was a
group of people in them some
organization far north of Sweden that
decided that they wanted to make eric
erickson make a telling our object
oriented and then they got the weird
idea they could do that modifying the
error handler no the other handlers when
you actually call the function in a
module which is loaded and it can see
our handle and what it does it
lodha so you have this wonderful idea if
this function didn't exist i'm still
trying to work out which module that it
should be in and it'll find out so super
class enjoy working with work things out
that way so they changed the error
handler and imma stop this bloody thing
turn off Wi-Fi presumably the changing
our handler to their amazement when they
stopped doing that they found the code
loading suddenly stopped working and
they're so if you don't know you know
all the work with people they don't want
to use the system and tell them to use
something else and go away there were
another group of people are also in the
credit closest taco we've got the idea
that they wanted to work in object
oriented fashion and this was the time
when we only had 32,000 processes in
airline and that they made every thing
that they considered to be an object as
in an airline process result of the
classes you land that we know is
horrible sort of shelling mess and you
confuse you don't actually see the real
concurrency because you've disguised it
with everything else and I don't we ever
got anything to work they just I think
that project thank the Lord was actually
discontinued before anyone ever tried to
deliver a thing there again they do
wanted to change it nothin othr nice
example was oh yeah this was a wonderful
people in line in los angeles in a
generics and business communication
systems los angeles we've got the weird
idea that they wanted to make a support
system for airline which is very good
thing to do the those time the tools
the debuggers and all the rest of you
were absolutely crap but they didn't
like air like so they decided to make
the support system for our lang in small
talk which is also weird because if
you're going to do something that the
Americans got a nice expression which
eat your own dog food that if you're
going to use our line when you motivate
a support system friendly for God's sake
do it in our names you do in there like
you might have some idea of what the
property is you're trying to solve so
they made this huge support system in
small talk never ever was used by anyone
and they enjoyed themselves for about
two or three years and then the whole
thing was dumped yeah then we had then
we had the people that's decided that
SNMP was a good protocol for managing
systems you heard clacker earlier about
this and they in communicated between
two two airline systems the manager was
written in airline and the the
application is an airline they decided
to communicate this by in the SNMP an
SNMP maybe it's good for management it
certainly isn't good for a sort of a
issue in complex commands and this was
horrible the members were such that they
were sort of the mids were thousands of
pages long and it was just totally
incomprehensible but they tried to
persuade them this was a bad idea it
just didn't work that product was
actually delivered I think that the
people that are actually received it
were not very happy with the result and
yeah we have the people that decided
that they'd ready designed their own
system in C C++ with a lot of
concurrency and done a lot of systems
work and then they got the idea to use
airline and they were actually told to
use airline and they said what we'll do
is we shall actually graft our system on
top of the system that we've already
written and then messed around with it
completely of course if you're starting
using airline processes and then have a
sort of the idea that you're going to
communicate via shared variables between
threads you land up in a slight problem
that there aren't any shared values
between threads and this causes again
problems and
what else that could go on frigid about
this and there were there people in line
I think they were in Holland if I
remember rightly but maybe wrong there
who decided that they didn't like ot P
therefore they would write their own
schedule isn't everything on that and
all supervision seized on top of OTP and
write the rural and modify it but they
do her TP but then they do everything by
layer on top of it i think he was called
i think it was called the process
abstraction layer wasn't it do you
remember that yonder oh yeah that one oh
yeah that was wonderful yeah every
message bass he was headed to back to
make sure he actually got it and that
was also sort of absolutely wonderful so
second moral is that don't tell people
to use our lying if they don't like it
they don't understand it if they want to
use something else would either go away
and do another project or let them do it
the way they want to do it don't force
things down people's throat so they
don't like because it won't be a success
its causes problems and that I've seen
anythingthat saying it's not only think
about their language out force people to
use technology they don't like that
programs are strange people there they
have their flight driving a car some
people hate driving sort of air there's
some cars and some people hate driving
others and they sort of strange views
about it but yeah then of course we have
the typicals of organization and the
this really dates back from the days
that when you wanted when you wanted to
program something you actually punched a
lot of cards you handed them into a
window in your computer center it came
out of the results and then you are this
is the old-fashioned attitude and the
way it all worked was that and his work
for years income
is like Eric's and thank Lord they're
changing you nowadays that you're an
assistance Department assist in
department I get on to what they did
then you have a programming Department
the rights or program that test and
delivery department and on the side of
that you have a bug tracking thing so
everyone can report bugs and everyone
can you check the whole thing works and
this in theory it all looks very nice
and if you sort of people that believe
in this sort of flow and nice of
theoretic room and they think the term
in one part where it's the one stage I
can pro Taylor nice to me I tell these
stories now that have left their Xbox
they can't so fire me anymore the one
that they had a whole unit whose sole
purpose was to invent processes for
process not and not processing the
machine but processes for how you worked
and they had the what they did is they
put up in the wall of a room they put a
great bit of plastic and they want to I
proper posted stickers on it now will do
this and I will do that and now I'll do
the others and they had a huge i think
it was 40 50 people who spent all their
days working out how other people were
going to work they never actually worked
in that way themselves they had no idea
if it was going to work or not it was a
completely amazing and they people
develop this sort of thing I'm sorry
accuracy I won't actually spent time to
the working on how to love my wife I boy
oh wait a minute i can press this magic
button here and turn off the Wi-Fi that
good job no so what actually and what
hash it happens when you design this
organization what happened the
organization is of course that the
microsoft invented something called
powerpoint and powerpoint is wonderful
because you can actually make nice
diagrams without having to think and you
don't know if they work on up so that
you get a sort of Mad PowerPoint develop
positive a a lot of power point slides
to send to her to other people and then
of course you have people to think that
modeling is the solution to everything
in the world and they write models on
these models they pass on to the next
people who are the powerpoint and mad
model interpreters and they try and work
out what that bloody hell does this mean
why is anyone done it this
way and it's sort of a they try and get
something to work and of course if you
make a model you everything looks very
nice but then you forget all the error
cases and everything goes wrong so you
actually push all the responsibilities
down onto the programmers to work out
the strange things that things will
happen the other thing which happen is
you actually never really understand
what the way something works until
you've programmed it and when you've
started programming that's the first
time you actually understand how things
work because you're forced to deal with
every single little tiny detail of what
happens but the cost of mag model isn't
there never do them the power fight
designers they do that even less and
then of course you get the bottom level
the bug reporters these the testers now
in this organization you find that
syndra certain number of people don't
like programming I don't want to under
quite understand that but there are
people that don't like program and they
migrate into directions the people that
have got a great ambition in life to get
more money they go to the top and become
mad PowerPoint modelers because that's a
nice thing they're not at the pub
program then have to think very hard and
they get paid very well because they're
called systems people assist as people
always get paid better than programmers
and then there are people that's aren't
really that keen on sort of programming
but not really not so ambitious and they
move down to this level to the beer but
bug reporters because they don't have to
burrow program either they just execute
test cases and see if they work it's
very very nice you find a test case
doesn't work you actually submit a bug
report to the little bubble the right
bubble on the right and then you're
drinking a cup of coffee you don't have
to fix the bug report you just have to
write the bug report anyone can write a
bug report you don't even have to say
where the bug is you just have to say it
didn't work I said Liam or does life
then of course you have this wonderful
sort of thing which was actually
intended to be a bug tracking bug
tracking system and the bug tracking
system turns out to be the only way that
these three separate entities ever
yoona came with each other it's only in
the end of the day when you actually
have to deliver something to a customer
that you sort of get mad teams of people
to start working together running around
in circles and make things work you can
actually make this that model work I've
seen it work never seen people deliver
things but it's a comfortable way of
working and incredibly inefficient and
then of course you can make it even
worse that if you take the southern
middle bottle of the program of
departments and then you look at you
have several program departments located
in several different geographical
locations I can give one example here
which I'm sure some of you might know
something about when we had one program
department in in Holland another one in
Norway another one in Montreal or while
working together motive really put
things in different time zones as well
that makes it even worse and then we had
a test department in Stockholm and
another test department i think it was
in Research Triangle Park in raleigh in
a in America I can't remove the exact
details and then you have us a bug
tracking system to translate whether
these people communicate with each other
of course the bug tracking system
becomes the only possible method of
communication because people are so
sitting in different time zones they
can't even phone each other it's you can
make me you can make you make this whole
thing work as well and I have seen this
sort of thing work but it is incredibly
inefficient and incredibly frustrating
or way of working ok that's the sir
organization let me have projects and
you have to realize that the ring
project are very very different it's not
only a question that people working in
the projects you get some project for
very small groups of very excellent
programmers you get some project and
mediocre programmers you get some pretty
of people that can't program at all they
never produce everything and then the
program
the business of trying to program
something for the first time is very
very different from the first one I
together the Y from from actually a
project which would actually win you've
got big project up and running in you're
making a product but actually what kinda
gets me working at all the first time is
a is difficult and then of course the
maintenance you've got a project you've
got to be you got a product and it's
running and you're getting bug reports
from customers and maintaining that
product and keeping it going is very
very different from that now they're
getting ahead of my slides for Garko and
so what you see about the purging what
is the difference in types of people
well they do anything for the first time
this is a bowl you need bold wild wild
people you need the clackers of this
world and prepared to sort of a write
code throw it away tonio rubriz another
person i respect highly in this respect
can write go throw it away try again try
try try again until you get it right in
your tie it's a child and error business
getting the architecture writings try
and hair you cannot get an architecture
right unless you've done something
before then this is the third time
you've done it you cannot get it right
without doing experiments and people
don't really realize that the so-called
prototype for experiments you do are
absolutely vital together to getting
things right and then of course you get
the sort of a making a problem this is
very different you actually have at this
stage hopefully done the experiments and
you know what works and if you know what
works you're actually filling it out and
get implementing it and everything is
maybe not beautifully specified but at
least you have some specification you
know roughly what you're doing and then
of course you've got the maintenance
project we're actually you're fixing
broken making enhancements you're doing
things like porting your system to new
versions of operating systems and none
of that sort of thing that is also very
very different different way of working
different number of different
type of people needed going on from
there that you look at the different
types of team you need for these now the
first one if you're starting doing that
with more Nate people I heard the old
one that said that the sort of you
should never have a team which is larger
than the number of people that were
which were once required to hunt
buffaloes and kill him because this is a
number of people you need you need a
tiny team to do the first one you cannot
do that with hundreds of people and they
because you can't have a hundreds of pic
you can't have a hundred people or doing
experiments and all throwing away code
and a totally in coordinated fashion you
need a team of very good excellent
people knowledge of the good they need
to combine the knowledge of domain
knowledge and they need their software
technology hopefully it's done in the
same person but you need one person
that's excellent in software technology
and you need in one person that
understands the domain and understand
God's needs to be done then they're
further down you need several small
teams software technology at this stage
is what becomes more important because
hopefully you've actually worked out in
the first stage what's needs to be done
and it's how timid software is running
tools how to debug systems that will
becomes important at this stage and at
the end of the day when you have a
system which is going to live long and
you need thing you also use a small team
in a small team of people to correct the
bugs keep the system alive keep it
running ported to new operating systems
and these people actually the most
important thing for them is not the
answer soft tech technology it's
actually knowledge of the domain to
understand what the problems are what
the customer needs to do what the
customer needs to modify that's actually
important so you have software beginning
small software technology domain middle
software technology to the bottom domain
and of course the middle bit is the big
bit way that's where you need maybe
hundreds of people and then of course
you get different different types of
people the i mentioned i go centric
individualists the forefront of
technology those are the people you
e to the beginning they have to be
completely nuts they're the real nutters
than the people that I can do I feel
that they're doing something new and
then the middle you need a different
sort of person you need a person that
actually enjoys working in a large
organization the people that you have in
the first stage find it very variable to
work in the second stage because they're
having to work in an organization
they're not the sort of people that can
do that you can find examples of people
not there are not saying during our
course except but you need team players
and you need people happy to work the
technology think that's working they'll
think that what they're working is a
good idea by the way you never need to
have have people that say in a project i
think the product that they're making is
a stupid idea get rid of those first and
at the end of the day you need long-term
people that people you know one of the
most important characteristics and
maintenance is being able to understand
other people's code understand code for
people that have left the company ten
years ago and now work for her for
someone else that is an incredibly
difficult thing and i personally think
you're not understanding other people's
code i actually think that understanding
other people's code and wires written is
actually more difficult than writing
your own code and i don't think people
actually realize that the other hand you
want people here that are really happy
they like their jobs they're going to
stay in their jobs for 10 years while
the product lives on very very difficult
yet those people they're prepared to do
that and it's very very difficult once
more to burn to get the sort of stupid
human relations management people to
realize that these people need to be
very well paid because unless you pay
the maintenance people a lot of money
they're going to change jobs and then
knowledge that they have in their heads
going to disappear incredibly difficult
to realize it if you look at this OH pay
payroll you should have these people
should get paid most the individualist
of the other thing get paid second most
and the people live in the middle of the
night she died they should pay third
most you can change these people you
can't change the first people and you
can't change the second people okay the
first people don't have to stay in the
project that all the time they just have
to get it going but these people maybe
have to stay there for 10 years I used
to say in Erickson that the greatest
direct enemy for Erickson was not far
away the Japanese ed chinese
manufacturer it was actually the HR
departments that didn't actually
understand two organizations both
beginning with H big companies have HR
departments HR departments never
understood the way I stay with us
software is developed in many great
mistake in many organizations time to
market is critical and they jumped
straight to the second making product
organization I've seen many many
projects the first thing they've done
saying oh this product is going to
require a large number of people to
develop and therefore will recruit a
couple of hundred people to start with
and we will go on with that and willing
to do that if we do that without doing
the first stage you just don't know what
you're doing you have a system where
people are doing experiments in a
context of hundreds of people and it
always goes wrong I've seen it happen
going wrong time and time again and it
always results in a product which
creates a massive cleanup afterwards to
do anything about he can't do it but the
cleanup costs an enormous amount of
money and you live with a system which
is badly designed for the rest of its
duration and the important you don't
save time this is what people don't
understand you don't do it save time
because the mess you create is so great
that it takes such a long time to clean
up and get the first
working let's say it's just not worth it
so don't do it that way always if you're
going to make a new product make sure
you have a new product organization a
new product phase first organization I
started with the middle organization
that you noticed I had their department
i had the pictures of systems
departments pro going to bomb was tested
pops up with this is the way to do it
the unfortunate thing is that people
don't really realize you actually need
the top and bottom bubbles as well but
in not system departments and they're
not test departments there are tiny
groups of people are hold it all
together you're going to need a steam at
the top to coordinate everything to make
sure interfaces between everything work
to keep every you can't get away without
having that team it has to keep me if
it's more than five people than
something's gone desperately wrong I've
seen to that that's in certain
organizations get to a couple of hundred
people that's desperately wrong you need
someone that actually puts everything
together delivers in and test the whole
product before you deliver it you need
them and maybe that's 15 people and then
of course you can have countless of
teams in the middle that put things
together but in these teams you have
people working together who good at
systems work who are good at programming
a good at testing and hopefully combine
those skills in the same person but you
need lots of these you can't get away
with it an important thing about these
is you should actually make sure that
each of the bubbles teams in the middle
work with a defined role they should
work with defined part of the product
they should work with the GUI the
interface I should work with the
database so they should work without you
shouldn't think you can allocate work to
these in the sort of random sort of
fashion people actually have to know and
understand the part that they're doing
and actually understanding what you're
designing and why you're designing is is
absolutely much more critical than
actually understanding anything else
then take more time consuming that so
you probably can learn programming
skills provides your reasonable fo are
always learning actually
how a product will do what it does is
far more difficult organization I've got
cad/cam one slide for this yes your
organization that a developed least by
the first time one small team and keep
the team small and remember that
maintenance and doing showing the first
time require different sorts of ppl
recruitment is a problem most people
like doing things for the first time I
think it's fun and it's very very hard
to recruit the top people to do into
product maintenance and for product
development and you have to realize that
if you do this you're going to land up
with people who are not the top talent
in there these organizations and it's
difficult to keep people there it's in
order crew but don't forget that the
there's a rule i call it why how all you
have to understand that people i both
know what they're going to design they
don't know why they were going to
designed it they got to know how how
they're going to design it and what's
more they have to like the ideas in all
these things you can't so do this if
people sort of hate the idea or God
after design this to have to use this
horrible tool if you are such people in
your organization's they're going to
spread this content and cause problems
another silly idea that people get round
to and this is a wonderful idea that
I've seen in very many organizations not
just director is the idea that we can
make things a lot cheaper if we transfer
the whole product to India or somewhere
like that or China or something like
that because the Chinese engineers and
that it's there are several reasons why
this is a bad idea and one of them is
that if you transfer everything to it
a low-cost country that low-cost country
very soon is going to become a high-cost
country the other thing the other reason
it's a bad idea is the people you
transfer it for a sooner or later going
to say hey wait a minute I can do that I
self I don't have to survive spawn off
my own private little organization make
money selling the same product you're
teaching people to do to do to do your
own product I'm not singing about the
skills and we're pretty sure that if you
look at the sort of skills of people in
China and India they are every bit as
good as what you can get in Europe but
they do charge less and people there
don't have the same loyalty to the
company and product that you have so
it's not only cheaper I baby cheaper on
paper but the actual cost of
transferring something is enormous and
the loss of knowledge neth no system is
ever properly documented most knowledge
of systems is in people's heads and that
is an enormous problem that a head full
of knowledge is a lot more than you
never can get down on their cell formal
specification you lose information your
bigger gear systems okay then the cost
per hour is less but you're going to use
a lot more hours and you can have a lot
more bugs not because you're
transferring it to bad people which is
simply transferring anything for one
place to know that costs a lot of money
yeah and there I thought that the diss
track was called agile on something so I
actually have to say what my view of
idea really was but I think I gel is a
very good thing and the main reason I
think a job is a very good thing because
it is becomes popular in this a number
of people have written books about scrum
and XP and they're all sorts of other
ways of doing it and it's actually
something management can actually
understand and realize that this
old-fashioned ideas of having systems
department programming two bottles and
tested but was a bad idea and you need
small teams and for that reason if if
our job means you can break down these
wonderful ideas and do it more sensibly
then it's a good it's a good thing you
also have to remember that
there are two aspects of our job one of
them is creating teams of people that
work together and work together groups
rather than separate individual separate
organizations the other one is that your
course you have to have something which
speeds up the program test debug color
correction programming is a trial and
error process you you write code the
first thing you do is you put it in the
compiler the compiler tells you all
those syntax errors you've made you
create the syntax errors go back again
no one actually spends their time
running staring at the program forget
you for four hours to get rid of the
syntax errors the compiler does that
feel faster the same time no one spends
around looking at all the bugs is much
better to run it through a test suite
and see what goes wrong because that
will tell you what's goes wrong it's a
lot faster than trying to do everything
theoretically and it's the second one of
the of these two that that's where
airline is absolutely excellent it's
because they enter Airlines debugging
tools I find that the far better that
any tools I've ever seen for developing
C++ or Java or something like that the
symbolic information which is left in
the system because it's dynamically
typed incredibly useful you can pinpoint
where bugs who can create a very very
fast the other thing of course is the
dynamic code replacement I think I
mentioned this yesterday as well it's
incredibly valuable for testing you
don't have huge build times you can
correct something recompile a module
often and often in less than 30 seconds
you've actually put that thing back in
yours code on you and then running your
text cases without interruption just
dynamic code so the actual design cycle
is absolutely ideal for I agile
programming I'm sure the relevant
aspects to our Jam all the rest of it
but this is what I think about it okay
summary the ability skin layers of
programmers incredibly different
programmers a different beast all of the
work in different ways and make sure you
have people with the right mixtures of
skill in your programs if you want to as
airline you pro in your project make
sure that people like the idea I think
it's a good thing to use if they want to
use small talk if they want to use
long if they want to use PHP or whatever
you like well and they don't want to use
our like well either managed to convince
them is a good idea or drop the idea use
something else don't set up
organizations with separate systems
programming test units that's old
fashioned developing to me the first
time product development maintence
completely different ways of working
required different organizations and
different people realize that don't try
and cut corners it's hard to find good
people for product maintenance and the
product development because they don't
want to work with that they want to work
with new cool things realize that and
realize that you are actually in many
systems you have to work with teams of
me do two programmers you won't get the
best people working in these areas it's
an unfortunate truth but really could
recognize the truth and make sure at
least it's got a few very good people
transferring code more organizing their
into another bloody wasting time don't
do it unless you absolutely have to
there are K shins when you have to do it
simply because you haven't got people to
one place and I think the last one is ni
OTP I think it's highly contributed to
the agile paradigm I think it's one of
the real advantages of it and now if
people don't often don't realize either
comment heard the other day someone say
that a in some organizations people say
that we can't use their like it's far
too complicated and difficult for our
programmers do they like Java and like
imperative programming yeah I incredible
listening to people that say such things
and I'm is actually incredibly much more
simple language than C++ or Java
incredibly much more simple you can
teach people it very very shortly and
the people that sort of a good go around
thinking that just shows that what an
incredible number of prejudices there
are against changing things to a simpler
paradigm well that's all I've got to say
for any questions please go ahead any
questions anybody know yeah
did I is a problem you have to make sure
that the people at the beginning of
prepared to write something down and
they hopefully have made a prototype and
they hopefully can use that prototype as
teaching material for the other people
you also have to make sure some of the
people actually from the first phase
move into the second phase is people's
heads that transfer information it's not
pizza paper the transfer information but
some people have to move and but you can
say to them okay I'd like you to
continue this for the next year and i'll
pay you well and they're the end of they
go someone else but for goodness sake
doing that yeah your job is not to go on
developing new stuff your job is to
teach the people what you've done yeah
sorry don't you have the step before you
collect your group of talented program
is because what they are going to
implement is usually some at least in
telecom systems some kind of
specification may be originating from
3gpp org so so what what do you think
happens when you give this thick
specification to these talented programs
do you do you think they like those
specific eight I mean they had a absence
actually hate those specification mean
isn't this a problem too it is like this
step before it is a great problem that
and this is why the ITF and the RCF way
of working is so much better than the
the certainty Conway working basically
if you make an RFC you're basically if
anyone's going to listen to you have to
have implemented it first you've
implemented it first then you cuz the
you don't make specification a lot of
these huge specifications are incredibly
complicated and incredibly overworked
they're much more complicated than need
to be but it's a great problem getting
people to write the specifications and
it's even greater problem getting people
to read them I don't have a good
solution for that problem except saying
if you recognize it's a problem then you
might be able to do something about it
if you don't realize it's a problem then
you can take a problem yeah very fast
program if you go one step down true to
be speed
I think you actually have to combine
people together through some people that
are very very fast a programming and
make a lot of a lot of errors and there
are some people that are kind of some
program systematically don't work quite
so fast and they're getting their higher
quality all in all I'd go for the second
category people that work slowly or get
it right because I think the people that
work fast and get it wrong I'll probably
or make a lot of bugs at the end of the
day create more work for people though
the Ender they're creating them but I
think that the best solution is if you
can get people to work together and then
so that's a good programmer can work
together with good fast programmer can
work together with a good systematic
programmer the time and time again I
think the best way of doing it is to
someone actually brought a tax code code
and the someone else rewrites it
afterwards to get it good different sort
of people there are so very very few of
those people okay I think we're all time
thank you Mike
