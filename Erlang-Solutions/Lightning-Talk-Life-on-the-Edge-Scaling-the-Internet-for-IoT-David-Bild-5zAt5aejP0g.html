routing for the IOT so there's sort of a
trend in the OT research community in
the IOT literature to try to push a lot
of the resource usage out to the device
edge to push computation and
communication storage to the devices
away from the core of the Internet so
this is often comes under the umbrella
term fog computing and is enabled by
protocols that support true device
device device to device communication so
those are ad hoc protocols device to
device machine to machine they go by a
variety of names and it seems promising
because there's no central bottleneck so
you it looks like it would enable a
better scaling than routing everything
through the core internet the other
approach is to continue to extend the
ratray and from the core internet which
uses the traditional Internet backbone
where all communication even even
between physically approximate devices
has to hit a central router so I'm going
to talk about what advantages that
brings and is it feasible to actually
scale the core internet routing
infrastructure for the IOT so why
centralize that really comes down to
economics and security by centralizing
you get economies of scale you can pull
the resources of for the money of a lot
of device manufacturers or data
collectors to build a better centralized
infrastructure and I think more
importantly outlines the incentives of
the people producing that infrastructure
or those those routing resources with
the people that are consuming them it's
harder to charge for a decentralized
model or for a distributed model so
oftentimes the features that get built
there are things that interest the
developers of those features and not
that interest the not that are important
for the consumers of it with a
centralized model the consumers are
paying so there's an incentive there for
the development to focus on what they
need security it's easier to secure a
few points when you distribute
everything out to the device edge now
you have billions or trillions of
devices you have to secure and we've
seen by recent attacks that that's
certainly not working today
and also it enables more interesting
sort of analysis approaches for security
I think there's gonna be a trend
Georgie's in I don't like the term but
big data based in how only detection as
a way to detect threats in real time
rather than having to sort of reactively
detect them and then go apply
traditional say firewall rules or other
security measures if all the routing and
computation has been done off the edge
you don't have that big source of data
to do that detection so we can look at
recent examples and seasons it's a
decentralized approach often wins out
social networks diaspora nobody uses it
everybody's on Facebook
digital music Napster BitTorrent those
people with families here to use Spotify
or Pandora something like that that's
built for the needs of the pain user
Wi-Fi for cellular it's much easier to
just have your cell phone connect to
your cellular than which works
everywhere than have to go you know get
the Wi-Fi credentials reach building
that use asset in retail of course the
big chains were able to sell things that
are better price them and make more
money centralizing the ralien structure
also aligns to the market trends if we
look at the next 18 to 24 months the
dominant used to lease for industrial
IOT is gonna be aggregating data into
cloud applications the data already has
to come back into the core looking
forward two to five years there's gonna
be some trend to controlling those
devices but again that's gonna be coming
from the backend analytics applications
we have to go up maybe five to ten years
to start seeing pervasive use of
device-to-device communication so then
we have to look at well is it feasible
to scale the the core of the Internet
one of the selling points that's given
for sort of the pushing everything to
the device edge is that I was lower
latency it's it's more scalable you
don't have bandwidth concerns the two
widest points in the or most distant
points in the lower 48 are about 2,800
miles apart
that's only 22 milliseconds of travel
time and a fiber-optic cable and
actually the core Internet is
distributed geographically in these
various internet exchange points so
routing through the core is really only
costing you less than 10 milliseconds of
latency
for most IOT applications is gonna be
acceptable similarly for the total
bandwidth is the Internet core fat
enough this chart here is showing the
total Internet traffic in petabytes per
month for the past 15 years and then
projecting forward projections from
Cisco to 2028 so they're projecting that
by 2020 will have almost twenty thousand
two hundred thousand petabytes per month
of total traffic on the internet with a
projected 20 million i/o 20 billion IOT
devices at that point if all of those
were using their full narrowband IOT
capacity of 10 kilobits per second that
would only be 137 powder by its 137
thousand petabytes per month of traffic
so that's well within the scale of where
the internet backbone is growing and so
it's apt on this forms the core of our
IOT architecture we exist in all these
internet exchange points that are
distributed around the country devices
connect to the closest one we'll wait
and see and we can efficiently route the
traffic to whatever back into
applications they need thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
