experience so let me first show you how
I basically got there like where I
started to dive into and by the
development Booz Allen it all mainly
started with this device which is a
flashing device for automotive ECU's
like equipment for manufacturing of
flashing quick stock or whatever and the
architecture of this one was that there
was a freebies the industrial
motherboard inside because it's a rather
big box and there were some gateways
where embedded operating system was
running called attempts and which
basically just translated whatever was
spoken on the USB by the LLVM so I had a
USB driver for the are nvm i am talking
USB to a gateway and the gateway
basically talks their automotive
protocols i needed to actually build the
device so if you see if you look at the
operating system of the gateways
it's called autumn's and this will like
stay with us so since probably a lot of
you of you don't know what autumn's is
yet let me give you a short intro so
Adams is a hard real-time OS but OS was
a misquote because it's actually not a
normal oh s it's more the inner terms
means executive so it's a real-time
executive which means that you you take
your application and you link it
together with the operating system and
then you basically put this on well
right from reset if you want or from a
bootloader actually I mean this has been
done for a long time in embedded and
didn't have a special name but it's
recently occurred to me that there's a
new name for this it's called unique
kernel so actually it's a unique animal
I linked together the application with
the kernel
and running on the hardware I mean most
unicorns don't run on real hardware but
atoms runs on real hardware so what kind
of hardware can run on you can can run
on pretty small RAM but that's not
important to us for in this context
because the Erlang VM wouldn't fit into
32 K of RAM so it runs on very small
machines and it's where it's very
efficiently switching threads so it
doesn't have tossed I mean I actually
call tasks but there are no processes
there's it looks like there's one
process running everything having
several thread hello so in the context
switch between these threads is very
fast on a very slow machine even this is
kind of historic I probably have to go
to a museum to get the machine with the
CPU there's a POSIX API in in atoms
among several others which are more
important for other embedded
applications the POSIX API is the most
important for us because it actually
helps a lot porting they are and we end
to this and so we virtual memory and and
and all kinds of other things that know
what operating systems have if there are
some you have device drivers but device
drivers are basically just a library
that you link with your code and which
helps you talk to the actual device so
it's not it's not a real device driver
so I just mentioned porting Alan to this
the set up in the Box was kind of
inconvenient for other applications
because for one thing that the island is
pretty far away from the hardware so it
has F latency which you have to deal
with so you have to have some smart
queuing on the gateway so to get rid of
the latency to get get some flow control
going on like this
and also I did smaller embedded systems
work and I wanted to use the along there
too so I tried it out and it worked
actually quite well a few years ago I
bought at the Allen pm-2 on the at
autumns Colonel which basically means
that you get an executed which you can
boot on the hardware I mean real bare
metal I mean that's why I mean I have to
say real bare metal because bare metal
currently in the meantime means I'm
running on some large VM Management
thing inside VM Management thing three
layers deep and and then they call it
bare metal I don't see any metal in this
it's virtual metal so this I'm talking
about real metal except that silicon is
not a metal actually so the architecture
of the the whole setup if you have the
LLVM on the atoms thing you have your
allen code runs on the air long runtime
and allen runtime uses the POSIX API to
to actually talk to the hardware and to
use for example the tcp/ip stack of
atoms you actually have a choice of
three tcp/ip stacks from very small to
the current freebsd tcp/ip stack with
SMP support you can add to this another
application written in C if you have
some parts and see some libraries or
some some other legacy stuff you can
have this on the side and from your from
your allen code if you call an if or
LinkedIn driver or also known as port
driver basically you you call out from
the island VM to C and this C is
directly talking to the hardware so they
have very little latency between
something happening on the hardware and
some some like a message receive on they
along the N which kind of makes the soft
real-time stuff of dial and VM much less
soft and it would be on a Linux kernel
because there's exact you know exactly
when your Allen VN will be be preempted
so if you don't have any threats that
have a higher priority
it will only be preempted by interrupts
drivers and you probably should know
when when and how often these trigger so
with this set up there was a customer
project and for company called Bosch
Rexroth subsidiary of Bosch which you
probably know and for them in this
project we build smart transfer
controllers so that's basically smart
conveyor belts everything on that the
keyword industry 4-0 sometimes a little
bit internet of things thrown in cyber
physical systems is also a key word a
buzz word there but yeah it's just buzz
words so to show what will be what we're
actually doing with this and to show
your video but this is one of these
conveyors and everything that's moving
currently is controlled by a network of
L unknown so 15 L on nodes so do you see
the other nodes and there they are
without pops the thing that the blue
cables on it yeah they're not very
visible so they are strewn in between so
you have these lifts that detects their
sensors then there's our rfid stuff on
there on the node which is also
controlled for me along and sometimes
you have to fix the stuff if you want to
work on it so this is just an empty
conveyor belt demo thing so I always
wanted to basically give this back to
the community submit my code back to OTP
and but there was always the hurdle that
it's kind of I mean Fred this morning
talked about that it's kind of like a
hassle to get started with a alarm if
you try to start with autumn's on real
hardware
that's real hustle much worse much worse
learning curve very very steep and so I
I always feel that nobody would use the
the just put out the code nobody would
build something with it and while viola
I thought about writing sets of drivers
and ports to like raspberry pie and
biggie born but basically this also has
a cost and you need more variants of
drivers and you don't control the
hardware and people like have to put
stuff together themselves and also that
the the kind of embedded harder you get
usually is either too large like a
raspberry pie I mean it can run Linux
and you don't need to have a line
running on your hardware you could do of
course and then have the hard real time
stuff going on but yeah you actually
don't need a raspberry pie and it
doesn't have that many i/o also the
bigger bones are too large and if you go
to the lower end like Arduino those are
too small can't run a line on it no
they're not memory nothing so that's why
while ago I decided to design a hardware
specially for this use case and the
hardware that's available and that's
affordable and where I can basically
combine the hardware and the driver and
a software tool set so everybody can get
started very very quickly with a allow
and some real embedded systems project
or make a project or robotics or
Internet of Things or whatever so this
board has arrived let's see on the table
unfortunately they arrived I got the
first working board on Monday evening so
the demo has to be a little bit limited
I don't have a robot with it yet so this
is support let's just rush through the
different parts of the board so that's
the CPU admin CPU
that's not our we know class CPU from
Atmel but it's a Nam core it's a cortex
m7 that's the largest mobile low-power
arm design that you can get so it has
such two bits and an FPU and everything
you need another interesting piece of
the hardware as you might have noticed
there is no ethernet plug on the board
and kind of if you want if he if you run
L and you kind of want to have a network
and so since Ethernet this kind of
old-school
we put Wi-Fi on by default one can
connect an ethernet adapter if one is
old-school but yeah if you want to run
Wi-Fi you can run along distribution of
a Wi-Fi so we need something to put from
and this is this little slot and it puts
these little I don't have one lying
around microSD cards which you also
could put in Android phones but not in
iPhones when we boot we need to load
some load stuff into some memory there
is some memory on the CPU because it's
an actually an embedded automotive CPU
this this kind of CPU it's actually for
multimedia applications in the car and
so the onboard and then on the ownership
memory is only 300 K 3 and K 4 so that's
a little bit small for running a normal
air long and so we added a little bit
more memory and since the CPU supports
SDRAM interface we added one SD RAM 64
Meg is plenty for now in this set up
really plenty I I have the same amount
of memory in the other device that you
saw the video with and I never checked
like how much memory my stuff uses
because I'm I'm so far from the limit
that when could put a little database
you know whatever you have to connect to
the board and have to debug it somehow
so there's a USB connector to it
and it gets powered by the USB connector
so you can power it by your laptop but
you can also use a normal USB power
supply of course or a battery USB
battery so you can get all kinds of
sizes of packs of batteries but you have
to load them make extra so you have one
of those use people as you charge them
you connect the minion in runs so it
doesn't have a a charge in electronics
on or something so this is the user
interface the input you have five five
little switches which you can set to on
and off the sixth one is is taken over
for changing the debug thing oh I forgot
to say on the USB interface there's also
the serial console and there's also
onboard jtech debugger so you can do
hardware level debugging with a very
cheap adapter to access the onboard
jtech debugger and then you can
basically single-step in the hardware
there's also a JT connector on the in
the corner which I didn't highlight
which is for one of the big tech
debuggers which have more features but a
much more expensive but I I found it
important that there is a cheap hardware
debugging facility accessible to
everybody so the other part of the UI
are these little these two little white
dots that's our - our RGB LEDs so that's
the output that's a little bit limiting
so we added a lot of connectors so the
the row of black connectors on the board
on the border they actually p-mod
connectors which is a standard by DT
length and where I can get about
lost-time account was like 80 plus
different sensors and actuator boards
which you can just plug into these
connectors the different kinds of these
connectors so the first one is a GPIO so
I will talk a little bit more about
different interfaces to extremely
explain what they are the second one is
also a GPIO because you need usually
more than one
and the third one is UART which is
basically not normal zero console thing
but in this case it's not 12 for 12 volt
plus - which is the normal serial cable
which were on very old pcs but it's
basically three 3.3 volts so but there
is some hardware which you can directly
connect to a UID interface and then you
actually want to have one of those plugs
the next one is SPI SPI interface which
is almost as simple as GPIO but gives
you more options because it's serial and
you basically shift bits out with the
clock and then you can a lots of chips
directly can support SPI so then since
there are a lot of chips that support
SPI there's a second spi this one is a
little bit higher it's an extended SPI
has a has two interrupt lines as input
so basically your chip can basically
interrupt back and say I have some data
for you and then you fetch it was a
synchronous serial thing so actually
left one one interface so this this tiny
connector there the three pins you see
that's a tell us one wire interface
which is also a low-level interface but
has different characteristics I'll
explain later what it does which are
left one off there is one connector
whoops there's one connector just beside
the the keys that's actually I Square C
it's on the top so the top because
usually have a cable going from you can
connect several boards to the one
connector and you have a cable going
hopping from one to the next
so that's why it's on the top so that's
the hardware hmm Oh
wants to go through this sorry about
that
let's stop this and rush on to the next
slide okay so there's the the basically
the data I already mention of the CPU it
basically has all that you want it's
assertive
two bits if you'll arm cortex-m seven it
has these P extensions but for these P
extensions we actually need to put a
driver into into the thing that kind of
sniff driver that you can actually use
them but finally eventually I plan to
basically make almost everything
available that is on on a chip and
accessible from me along yes I F pew and
so the memory as I mentioned there's an
internal flash which only is used for
the bootloader so the little program
which incidentally is also atoms so
atoms is the bootloader and it's used
for running the airline VM at the same
time because it's so small that you can
build a very small bootloader with it
actually you don't need most of these
two megabytes and the SRAM I mentioned
and the other Ram there's also an EEPROM
where can like stock configuration data
or stuff like this so a little bit more
explanations about the i/o stuff since
we are in our software conference and
not in the hardware conference so GPIO
as general purpose i/o which is called
is just basically for digital lines
which you can switch on and off and they
are mapped to bits in a register and so
these bits in the register we will base
make make accessible by some yelling
holes which you can switch on and off
the bits or set them all at once or also
have some driver support to do some
pulse width modulation so we'll have
life basically a rectangular way from
the thing where you basically can send a
value to the driver and it it then makes
the wife there on time longer or shorter
which you can for example use for the
LEDs which are also connected to a kind
of GPO GPIO so every LED has three iOS
every one for every color and if you do
pulse width modulation you can get all
the colors that there are if you only
switch on and off you only have eight
colors
and none I mean seven colors are none
but off there's also a reset button
because it's kind of convenient if you
can just reset your thing if you crashed
it so SPI and I Square C are kind of
like variants on the same team theme
there are serial interfaces which has
advantages that use that you save a lot
of like IO lines
so with GPIO if you have lots of things
going on you need lots of pins on the
CPU and they are limited I mean you can
do more more useful things with the pins
and you need less wires so if you if you
have a serial protocol then you need
less wires and in case of SP I usually
have four wires so there there's
basically it's a it's a so-called master
slave protocol which very recently has
become non-political correct but since
it's basically encoded in the i/o lines
so the the miso and MOSI means master
ins life out and master in know Master
ins life out and master out slave in so
these are the two directions so it's
bi-directional so that's where the data
goes on and off and then so you know how
the timing is there's also a clock and
you need to configure because every chip
can have different things on which on
which time of the clock you basically
change the data and on which it reads
the data so there's four combinations
name basically inverted clock or normal
clock and rising edge and falling edge
basically and what what one needs to do
is basically look up what did--what day
the actual chip ones and set one of the
four things and then off you go there's
also a fourth line it's the chip select
which basically tells the chip that now
comes some data it's for you so this
makes it possible to actually share SPI
is with several chips if you want to so
for example if you have lots of SPI
interfaces you could add that
pío and use the additional i/o lines as
chip select and then drive this manually
and basically say this chip and then
send the data and then that trip and
then send the data etc so I Square C
basically makes it more easy to address
more than one chip because it's a bus so
you have a bus you have basically only
two lines a data line and a clock line
and ground and power yeah I mean y'all
safe ground and it's also master slave
protocol and the slaves or clients have
built-in address
sometimes it's fixed sometimes you can
toggle a little switch on the board and
say yeah have some alternative address
and then you can basically if you know
the address you basically send out one
byte the address I think that's yeah
it's one byte address you send out one
byte address and then you send a data
packet and then the chip answers with
answer to the data packet so you have
our a little bit more high level
protocol but only buy so much but then
you can talk to many chips but this is
used for normally for talk on the same
board not like talked over over the
sensor over there some people use it
like this but that's actually abusing it
and it's not very it doesn't work too
well if there's some noise in there or
something going on so there's a kind of
extension to I square C it's called
Telus one wire it's called tell us
because it was invented by a company
called Telus semiconductors and it does
everything on one wire well it's
actually a lie you need a ground wire
but you actually only need a ground and
one other wire and over the one other
wire you can power your your opponent so
you can send power and data which is
kind of cool
so you basically have to wire very thin
wire and you can just power a
temperature sensor and read it out
and so it's quite similar to ice Chrissy
it's an extension of this but it's much
slower and has a little bit more data
protection there's a checksum and what's
also a neat feature is that every device
I mean this device something very small
things very small sensors has actually
are built in 64-bit unique ID which is
worldwide unique and there's a discovery
protocol which gets you to find out what
IDs are on the bus and then you can have
many sensors on one bus and you actually
know who is who at least once you need
had configured them I mean still have to
know if if ID one two three is the
sensor over there and four four five six
is a sense over there of course but yeah
that's very good and it also goes over
long distances so I was talking about
like sense of the Year sensor there so
you can basically wire several sensors
in a house or on an experiment and talk
to all of them over just this two wires
make sure they're the two biasing has
also three weapons or fertilise there's
one more wire because you you can have
additional power if you want to but it's
actually capable of powering out of the
data line so the little capacitor in the
devices which which basically keeps it
running over the gaps when the data is
low which is kind of a neat feature so
there are several form factors where you
can get these sensors or devices the
there's a traditional form factor
tío 92 that's basically the form factor
that the normal plastic transistor had
like 20 years ago that's kind of
convenient if you want to have a
temperature sensor on let's say if you
want to control your heating system or
your solar warm water system that's one
of the sensor form factors which are
kind of convenient you probably usually
put them in a little little pipe and and
glue it off full with silicon
then uses there's also their eye button
which is basically a one wire device in
in a metal button which is very robust
and which is used and basically it's
it's like a battery like like a like a
clock battery or something so you have
the two contacts on the on the box
outside in the middle and they actually
contacts for their for the opposite side
it's a it has a standard form factor and
it's used for access control stuff so
kind of what's their kind of prior RFID
but it's also kind of like still use
dive I think the turkish public
transport system uses or one of the
buttons and you have a key fob and you
can just put it in and you so you you
also get chips which have memory and
some cryptographic primitives which are
the only way to access memory so we can
actually have some access control
applications
what other security stuff that you want
to do and then there are lots of
temperature and climate sensors and
whatever there's a plethora mainly it's
used for temperature sensors so I've
talked about the peanuts so let's look
at a few examples so there are of course
lots more but I wanted to show you a few
examples which I basic by the way in so
that's a peanut that's the size of a pea
mode so let's let's look through a few
so that's or I can't see this it's very
small this is I really can see that's
compass so a magnetic compass and the
next one is easier to detect it's a to
impaired motor driver so you can connect
external power supply for the motor and
the motor and then you can switch it on
and off and drive two and four it's a
bridge driver the next thing is those
four motors it has connectors for for
standard RC servos which are used in
model planes and stuff like this so you
can just get one of those and plug them
in or four of those and then
basically you have some pulse-width
thing going on it's for GPIO that's one
of the reasons you need these
pulse-width things because this actually
controls where the sensor moves to the
servo moves to so you can control the
angle whether where the thing goes to
it's very easy to use and you can do
lots of fun stuff with those the next
one is a little bit larger one it's
actually I also wanted has actually has
so every everything is plugged in where
it actually needs to be blocked in so
try to get also samples of every P mode
for testing that we can test all the
interfaces so this is a GPS with
everything all the features I don't know
I don't know all the features but lots
of features and the next one I think I
can't read it here oh yeah it's a three
axis accelerometer accelerometer and the
last one is a 3-axis gyro so with those
two you can basically stabilize your
drone if you put the board on it so yeah
that's the overview a little bit about
these peanuts these little things it's
very easy way to get sense selectors
actuators and it's also a good way for
us to provide drivers for for common
sensors and actuators because if you if
you would have like all kinds of sensor
chips you have like hundreds of drivers
but there is if there is only one
accelerator accelerometer why did I pick
this one if it's so hard to pronounce
there's there's actually one gyroscope
in the P mode system and we can provide
a gyroscope high level driver and you
can just get your readings then on the
along level so there's also there will
be also low level drivers basic ating
i-square see SPI GPIO and all the low
level protocols on the along level
because actually I don't want to write
the high level drivers again see there's
no use
so there's you can have a very minimal
driver and see and you could do anything
in airline because it works actually
quite fine so the demo as I said is a
little bit limiting so I have to move
this over here
so the first working board arrived on
Monday and
oh it's shrunk again so so I plucked
this in the USB it's connected to the
board and you see something's going on
with the lights or something happens and
what's actually happening is that it
doesn't work oh no that was the second
demo let me change the demos let me let
me read on the SD card yeah that's it
actually that's that's supposed to
happen but actually I wanted to show you
this one first so these are these D
cards easy to lose they're hard to write
on so that's the second one I just put
it in and push reset and then you see
it's um something's going on with the
thing and then this this LED changes
color so this is not much to see but
what happened actually is that the
bootloader booted the hardware it
actually read a little program that's
not in our line yet but it's in C from
the SD card and the little program
actually changes the bits on the on the
three lines of the of the RGB LED so in
order to see a little bit more let's
look at at the serial terminal so yeah
it works so I reset it again so you can
see the boot process so that was that
was all it's booted so two seconds I'll
do it again done and actually currently
the SD card driver is palled and the CPU
is running on a slower speed and it's
nothing is optimized of course to boot
now on the island VM basically to boot
the image would take a little bit longer
let's say three seconds then it took
people tit maybe we can optimize it to
of like 1.5 seconds and then you
currently you haven't the so called
autumn shallots are a very minimal way
to interact with autumns and to debug it
but if there's a along VM on the SD card
you will actually get their LAN shell
here at this prompt and then you can
configure
everything from the island shell you can
configure your wifey Wi-Fi and then you
can connect by a distribution with the
Wi-Fi module so the driver for the Wi-Fi
is not done yet as I said the hard way
arrived Monday evening and unfortunately
they were delayed because this
conference was I want to actually wanted
to show a little bit more and I actually
tried to get the Allenby I'm running but
it doesn't compile yet completely but
there hopefully will be a demo tomorrow
in Claudia's talk where we actually have
the hardware of the industrial thing
which does the same thing I can see that
it actually runs so let me let me show
you that actually if something is done
on the SD card so let me take out the SD
card and push reset again so it does
flash of sync
now it's red blinking no SD card that's
actually a bootloader error and then
let's put in different SD card that's a
different demo and booted so there we
have actually this is a demo which also
has a secret driver in the application
so I should be able to look at the SD
card contents from the autumn show so
let's see I have an LS so there's device
and a TCS and the RAM disk and media is
kind of it mount stuff so let's go to
media it's very limited shell so you
can't do auto complete and anything so
that's the SD card driver thing mmm CSD
there's 0 there 0 and if I LS here you
can see any file where you configure it
and dot pin file is it's the actual
image that gets booted that would be ul
on VM and then beside you along VM you
just put a release later and then it
puts a release and the other files are
some some some crap my Mac put on it
when I mounted it they tend to leave
traces mix
okay so let's connect it back
yep so about the build process actually
I love the topic of Fred's talk this
morning because actually was what what
but he says we are supposed to actually
do for for a long haul together we
hadn't planned for for embedded
development with Ellen so have a really
easy build process really easy way to
start if the board comes out of the box
on the SD card there is already a long
image and a normal OTP where you can
actually play with the shell and on the
child play with the hardware drivers but
we will also basically write we were
plugins and there will be templates for
new projects for different kinds of
projects so you can basically get up and
running I mean we've got a target set
this morning by Fred so I see this as a
goal to go but I think we can go pretty
close to this I mean we have a little
bit more complications because if we
only pull the nail on the release then
it's actually kind of easy because you
just build a normal release with the
cross build airline and you have the
binary of the cross modal and it's just
copied into release and the rest is just
normal beam files so you don't have to
do anything special so as long as they
only add allen code it's very very easy
to build like everything else it's like
you just pull the release and copy it on
the SD card but if you have C drivers or
need some different C drivers that are
not included in the system or building C
drivers or other C applications then you
actually need to link this together with
the Erlang VM which is actually built
with the OTP bail process so there my
plan is for this to have basically a
repo plug-in that takes the OTP source
copies in the myths and the pot drivers
that you want to link so you can
configure it on the in the rebar config
and and then it sets up some tables and
then it puts it statically links
everything but I kudos to the OTP team
to add that
sniffs they're very convenient because
we don't have a dynamic loader we can't
load anything dynamically so yeah so
there will be plugins for all this stuff
and so if this if this is too
complicated to use you can complain to
me I I promised today to make it very
nice and easy to start with so a little
bit worried about the airlock
distribution so the among distribution
can be used over Wi-Fi and there's a
longer term project I'm going to
actually improve a long distribution to
be able on Eric's is also working on
this to make it able to run on more
nodes have to have more like thousand
nodes and and and also to have more easy
way to add an encryption to their long
distribution which might be interesting
if you run it over wireless I mean if
you only run it in your own Wi-Fi you're
fine
of course there's another thing which
was done for the initial project EPMD
can't run in autumn's unchanged so I
rewrote it in pierrelang and I'm happy
to announce that this has been adopted
by by the OTP team to be in there long
github top-level thing and so this can
be used as a stepping stone for actually
build an improved distribution because
if you have like several ways of do this
to be doing distribution needs some
addition to EPMD to actually find out
what kind of protocol does this node
want to talk to what additional protocol
can use or whatever and this this
dispute this purely PMD is run in the
same node which I can do in the embedded
note because I know there is only one LM
not running because there can't be two
so I can actually run EPMD inside my one
lr node but you can start these the
source code EPMD in in a separate non
distributed LR node and use it as a
replacement for the normally PMD
for to play with the thing is there I
mean we have the initial thing was there
are more languages on the beam and of
course since it's just a beam VM you can
run anything on it we might not be able
to support all of the languages in some
kind of spirit tools because it's
probably beyond our capacity but if
anybody wants to volunteer makes makes
Alexia run or whatever language on the
beam Lua L or L Fe or whatever we will
help you as far as we can and we will
appreciate if you do yeah there's the
image attribution and there's actually a
new website set up where you can
actually enter your email address and
get like very occasional updates how
about about when you can pre-order the
boards and stuff like this oh I am
talking about pre-order so the the price
target I can't say anything about the
real price but it will be around 100
euro so this is not a project to make
money with it so we will never get out a
development cost of course so this is at
cost and it depends on how many orders
we get the more orders the cheaper the
board gets that's easy and there's an
easier automatic going on there so we
have to like ramp up a little bit so it
might be that that if many pre-orders
are there that actually we drop the
price even before we ship the first
board because I want to make this
accessible it should be an easy start
for students we are very glad to work
together with teachers who want to build
some robots with their students or
whatever so if you if you teach and want
to use this or if your student have a
nice student project for semester
project we probably will just send you a
board if you describe the project to us
questions
yeah what's the power consumption so the
CPU has has very good low power supply
as of support so there were several
remotes working like set it to sleep in
in stages the overall board with this
depends what P motes you'll connect to
it because if your P much use a lot of
power then you whole bullet one won't
run long run battery maybe so it's it's
not that the whole board is like a
special no power battery board we might
be building something like this later
but then probably this is only glue the
battery already but currently so it can
be run low-power and we will make use of
the low power modes of the CPU so if
nothing is running and it sleeps very
deeply and doesn't consume anything and
waits just for the next event to happen
how long I have no clue no I I got the
hard round I didn't measure even
probably yes I have to ask my hardware
people so send me an email I will get an
answer about this so we will do
measurements about the current
consumption everything but I currently I
just want try to get the along running
but yeah the build process is not
complete yet and we didn't do any
measurements because the hardware people
because they were very late they didn't
do any measurements either so it is
possible to run a battery of course it
it you can have large batteries nowadays
rather large but then they are heavy so
if you want to fly then it's not so good
but so as soon as we have numbers we
will publish it on the website or on the
newsletter get on this nice newsletter
and if you get a newsletter can written
10 boards I mean one of 10 not 10 at the
same time unless you're the only one on
the newsletter but then it will get all
10
what's the story around them
fault-tolerance what happens when Bheem
crashes or stalls out
thus Bheem crash actually there on the
embedded CPUs I have to get away from
the antenna on these embedded CPUs you
have a hardware watchdog timer which is
very easily integrated into the Allen
heartbeat system which we already
started to do for the other things so
you basically get then several layers of
fault tolerance you get so a hardware
but Shock Trauma is basically a piece of
very very simple hardware in the chip
which you actually have to you have to
write several different values usually
so there's like it can't be done by
accident in in sequence to a register
and you can configure it how often you
have to do this and if you fail to do
this it does a hard reset on the board
and if you wire this to the to the to
some hop it mechanism which basically
shows if beam is alive still then if
beam crashes because probably because
one of your NIF drivers which is the day
she of course if you have a C Drive and
then of course you beam can crash easily
and in the beginning it probably will do
often so then you can use the harder
what should be to even keep running and
then have the the fault points of a long
on top of this so fault tolerance on
different hardware scenarios and
embedded systems is a big topic which
I'm doing professionally and everything
that spins off of this will be put on
there or to okay
you decided I guess not to put canvas on
there actually the chip has a canvas but
the the hardwood have something mumbled
about that lines are talking about
something else
so usually have all kinds of stuff one
on on the CPUs but there are all lines
the actual i/o lands on the CPU are are
used several times and you can't have
all so currently there is no canvas but
I think there's a pee mode with canvas
and if there's a use case for canvas
then just negate me then we might have a
canvas on the next version cluster with
a long distribution or yes sure
wirelessly yeah I mean that that's the
whole point have a long distribution on
the Wi-Fi and then put them wherever you
want and they all talk together okay
yeah so sorry for my question does it
I'm sure it does but just the question
it doesn't support
hot-swap like yes sir I mean it does
everything the normally Allen VM
supports you can have roll-ups
everything that's I mean it's just what
they are on VMs actually not much
different from the normal air line being
actually not at all it's a normal it
will be a normal non SMP threaded along
VM but actually autumn supports SMP and
we are actually looking at porting the
Elan VM on SMP atoms electrons SMP
course because this is a combination bit
actually is also very neat for lots of
high performance applications you can
get lots of cores and embedded
controllers like 24 cores and a few like
16 gigabit lines on a just on chip great
thank you all right Thank you Thank You
bear great talk and then yeah round of
applause for pair
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
