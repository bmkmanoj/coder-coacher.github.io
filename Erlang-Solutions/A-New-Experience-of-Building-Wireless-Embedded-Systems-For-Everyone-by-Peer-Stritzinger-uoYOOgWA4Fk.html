experience so let me first show you how
I basically got there like where I
started to dive into and by the
development Booz Allen it all mainly
started with this device which is a
flashing device for automotive ECU's
like equipment for manufacturing or
flashing click stock or whatever and the
architecture of this one was that there
was a freebsd industrial motherboard
inside because it's a rather big box and
there are some gateways we're embedded
operating system was running called
items and which basically just
translated whatever was spoken on the
USB by the llvm so I had a USB driver
for the island vm i'm talking USB to a
gateway and the gateway basically talks
their automotive protocols i needed to
actually build the device so if you see
if you look at the operating system of
the gateways it's called items and this
will like stay with us so since probably
a lot of you of you don't know what
items is yet let me give you a short
intro so our items is a hard real-time
OS but OS with a quiz quotes because
it's actually not the normal OS it's
more the enr terms means executive so
it's a real-time executive which means
that you you take your application and
you link it together with the operating
system and then you basically boot this
on hardware right from reset if you want
or from a bootloader actually I mean
this has been done for a long time in
embedded and didn't have a special name
but it's recently occurred to me that
there's a new name for this it's called
uni colonel so actually it's a unique
colonel i linked together the
application with the colonel
and running on the hardware I mean most
unique homes don't run on real hardware
but Adams runs on real hardware so what
kind of hardware can run on you can can
run on pretty small Ram but that's not
important to us for in this context
because the island vm wouldn't fit into
32 k of ram so it runs on very small
machines and it's where it's very
efficiently switching threads so it
doesn't have taught i mean i've actually
call tasks but there are no processes
there's basically looks like there's one
process running everything having
several threat hello oh so in the
context switch between these threads is
very fast on a very slow machine even
this is a kind of historic I probably
have to go to a museum to get the
machine with the cpu and there's a POSIX
API in in atoms among several others
which are more important for other
embedded applications the POSIX API is
the most important for us because it
actually helps a lot porting they are on
vm to this and so with virtual memory
and and and all kinds of other things
that normal operating systems have if
there are some you have device drivers
but device drivers are basically just a
library that you blink with your code
and which helps you talk to the actual
device so it's not it's not a real
device driver so i just mentioned
porting Ellen to this the setup in the
box was kind of inconvenient for other
applications because for one thing that
the island is pretty far away from the
hardware so it has F latency which you
have to deal with so you have to have
some smart queuing on the gateway so to
get rid of the latency to get get some
flow control going on like this
and also I did smaller embedded systems
work and I wanted to use a long they are
too so I tried it out and it worked
actually quite well a few years ago I
bought at the Allen v m2 on the other
items kernel which basically means that
you get an executed which you can boot
on the hardware we're in real bare metal
I mean that's why I mean I have to say
real bare metal because bare metal
currently in the meantime means them
running on some large vm management
thing inside vm management thing three
layers deep and and then they call it
bare metal I don't see any metal in this
it's virtual metal so this I'm talking
about real metal except that silicon is
not a metal actually so the architecture
of the the whole setup if you have the
llvm on the atoms thing you have your
long code runs on the ellen runtime and
yelling run time user suppose X API to
to actually talk to the hardware and to
use for example the tcp/ip stack of
autumn's we actually have a choice of
three tcp/ip stakes from very small to
the current freebsd tcp/ip steak with
SMP support you can add to this another
application written in c if you have
some parts and see some libraries or
some some other legacy stuff you can
have this on the side and from your from
your Ellen code if you call an if or
LinkedIn driver also known as poor
driver basically you you call out from
the island vm to see and this C is
directly talking to the hardware so they
have very little latency between
something happening on the hard and some
some like a message receive on their
long vm which kind of makes the soft
real-time stuff of the llvm much less
soft and it would be on a linux kernel
because there's exact you know exactly
when you're a long vm will be be
preempted so if you don't have any
threats that have a higher priority it
will only be preempted by interrupt
drivers and you you probably should know
when when and how often these trigger so
with this set up there was a customer
project for company called posh Rexrode
subsidiary of Bosch which you probably
know and for them or in this project we
build smart transfer controllers so
that's basically smart conveyor belts
everything under the keyboard industry
40 sometimes a little bit Internet of
Things runnin cyber physical systems is
also a keyword a buzzword there but yeah
it's just buzz words so to show what we
what we are actually doing with this and
to show your video but this is one of
these conveyors and everything that's
moving currently is controlled by a
network of LR notes or 15 along notes so
do you see the other notes and there
they are without box the thing that the
blue cables on it yeah they're not very
visible so they are strewn in between so
you have these lifts that detects their
sensors then there's RFID stuff on there
on the node which is also controlled
from me along and sometimes you have to
fix the stuff if you want to work on it
so this is just an empty conveyor belt
demo thing so I always wanted to
basically give this back to the
community submit my coat back to OTP and
but there was always the hurdle that
it's kind of I mean Fred this morning
talked about that it's kind of like a
hassle to get started in there lon if
you try to start with autumns on real
hardware
that's real hustle much worse much worse
learning curve very very steep and so I
I always feared that nobody would use
the the Fed should just put out the code
nobody would build something with it and
why Lila I thought about writing sets of
drivers and ports to like raspberry pi
and Biggie born but basically this also
has a cost and you need more variants of
drivers and you don't control the
hardware and people like have to put
stuff together themselves and also that
the kind of embedded harder you get
usually is either too large like a
raspberry pi I mean you can run linux
and you don't need to have a long
running on the hardware you could do of
course and then have the hard real-time
stuff going on but yeah you actually
don't need a raspberry pi and it doesn't
have that many I all also the big ones
are too large and if you go to the lower
end like Arduino those are too small
can't run along on it no they're not
memory nothing so that's why while ago I
decided to design a hardware especially
for this use case and hardware that's
available and that's affordable and
where I can basically combine the
hardware and the driver and a software
tool set so everybody can get started
very very quickly with a along and some
real embedded systems project or make a
project or robotics or Internet of
Things or whatever so this board has
arrived let's see on the table
unfortunately they arrived I got the
first working board on Monday evening so
the demo has to be a little bit limited
I don't have a robot with it yet so this
is support let's just rush through the
different parts of the board so that's
the CPU Atman CPU
that's not our we know class CPU from at
no but it's a non-core it's aquatics m7
that's the largest mobile low power arm
design that you can get so it has
searched to bits and an FPU and
everything you need another interesting
piece of the hardware um as you might
have noticed there is no ethernet plug
on the board and kind of if you want if
you run l and you kind of want to have a
network and so since ethernet this kind
of old school we put Wi-Fi on by default
one can connect an ethernet adapter if
one is old school but yeah if you want
to run Wi-Fi you can run along
distribution of a Wi-Fi so we need
something to boot from and this is this
little slot and it puts these little I
don't have one lying around microsd
cards which you also could put in
android phones but not in iphones when
we boot we need to load some load stuff
into some memory there is some memory on
the cpu because it's an actual and
abetted automotive cpu this this kind of
cpu sexually for multimedia applications
in the car and so the one border and
down the ownership memory is only 300 k
384 so that's a little bit small for
running a normal air long and so we
added a little bit more memory and since
the cpu supports sdram interface we
added one sdram 64 meg is plenty for
allah in this setup really plenty I I
have the same amount of memory in the
other device that you saw the video with
and I never checked like how much memory
my stuff use this because I I'm so far
from the limit that when could put a
little database you know whatever you
have to connect to the board and have to
debug it somehow so there's a USB
connector to it
and it gets powered by the USB connector
so you can power it by your laptop but
you can also use a normal USB power
supply of course or a battery USB
battery so you can get all kinds of
sizes of Petra batteries but you have to
load them make extra so you have one of
those USB metrics you charge them you
connect them in the run so it doesn't
have a charging electronics on something
so this is the user interface the input
you have 55 little switches which you
can set to on and off the 61 is is taken
over for changing the debug thing oh i
forgot to say on the USB interface
there's also the serial console and
there's also on board jaytech debugger
so you can do hardware level debugging
with a very cheap adapter to access the
onboard jtech debugger and then you can
basically single step in the hardware
there's also a JT connector on in the
corner which I didn't highlight which is
for one of the big chatak debuggers
which have more features but a much more
expensive but I I found it important
that there is a cheap hardware debugging
facility accessible to everybody so the
other part of the UI are these little
these two little white dots that's our
to our RGB LEDs so that's the output
that's a little bit limiting so we added
a lot of connectors so the the row of
black connectors on the board on the
border they actually p mod connectors
which is a standard by digital end and
where i can get about lost time account
it was like 80 plus different sensors
and actuators boards which you can just
plug into these connectors the different
kinds of these connectors so the first
one is a GPIO so i will talk a little
bit more about the different interfaces
to extremely explain what they are the
second one is also a GPIO because you
need usually more than one
and the third one is you art which is
basically not normal 0 console thing but
in this case it's not the 12 or 12 4
plus minus which is the normal serial
cable which were on very old PCs but
it's basically 3 3.3 volts so but there
is some hardware which you can directly
connect to a you I'd interface and then
you actually want to have one of those
plugs the next one is spi spi interface
which is almost as simple as gpio but
gives you more options because it's
cereal and you basically shift bits out
with the clock and then you can a lots
of chips directly can support SPI so
then since there are a lot of chips that
support SPI there's a second SPI this
one is a little bit higher it's an
extended spie has a has to interrupt
lines as input so basically you're your
trip can basically interrupt back and
say I have some data for you and then
you fetch it was a synchronous serial
thing so actually left 11 interface so
this this tiny connector there then
three pins you see that's a tell us one
yr interface which is also a low level
interface but has different
characteristics I'll explain later what
it does it's your left one off there is
one connector whoops there's one
connector just beside the keys that's
actually I squeal see it's on the top so
the top because usually have a cable
going from you can connect several
boards to the one connector and you have
a cable going hopping from one to the
next so that's why it's on the top so
that's the hardware hmm Oh wants to go
through this well sorry about that let's
stop this and rush on to the next slide
okay so there's the the basically the
data I already mention of the CPU it
basically has all that you wanted two
32-bit
you'll arm cortex-m seven it has these P
extensions but for these P extensions we
actually need to put a driver into into
the thing that kind of nifty reiver that
you can actually use them but finally
eventually i plan to basically make
almost everything available that is on
on a chip and accessible from me along
yes I FPU and so the memory as I
mentioned there is an internal flash
which only is used for the bootloader so
the little program which incidentally is
also atoms so I autumn's is the
bootloader and is used for running the
airline vm at the same time because it's
so small that you can build a very small
bootloader with it actually don't need
most of these two megabytes and the SRAM
I mentioned and the other Ram there's
also an EEPROM where I can like stock
configuration data or stuff like this so
a little bit more explanations about the
i/o stuff since we are in our software
conference and not in the hardware
conference so gpio general-purpose i/o
which is called it's just basically for
digital lines which you can switch on
and off and they are mapped to bits in a
register and so these bits in the
register we will make make accessible by
some Ellen calls which you can switch on
and all of the bits or set them all at
once or also have some driver support to
do some pulse width modulation so have
life basically a rectangular wave from
the thing where you basically can send a
value to the driver and it it then makes
the wave there on time longer or shorter
which you can for example use for the
LEDs which are also connected to a kind
of GPO gpio so every LED has 3 iOS
everyone for every color and if you do
pulse width modulation you can get all
the colors that are if you only switch
on and off you only have eight colors
and none I mean seven colors an on or
off there's also a reset button because
it's kind of convenient if you can just
reset your thing if you crashed it so
spi and i square C are kind of like
variants on the same team theme there
are serial interfaces which has the
advantage that use that you save a lot
of like IO lines so with Qi piao if you
have lots of things going on you need
lots of pins on the cpu and they are
limited i mean you can do more more
useful things with the pens and you need
less wires so if you if you have a zero
protocol then you need less wires and in
case of SP i usually have four wires so
there there's basically it's a it's a
so-called master slave protocol which
very recently has become non political
correct but since it's basically encoded
in the i/o lines so the miso and MOSI
means master ins life out and master in
no Mustangs life out and master out
slave in so these are the two directions
so it's bi-directional so that's very
data goes on and off and then so you
know how the timing is there is also a
clock and you need to configure because
every chip can have different things on
which on which time of the clock you
basically change the data and on which
it reads the data so there's four
combinations thing basically inverted
clock or normal clock and rising edge
and falling edge basically and what what
one needs to do is basically look up and
what did what they the actual chip ones
and set one of the four things and then
off you go there's also a fourth line
it's the chip select which basically
tells the chip that now comes some data
it's for you so this makes it possible
to actually share SP is with several
chips if you want to so for example if
you have lots of SPI interfaces you
could add that
pio and use the additional io lines as
chip select and then drive this manually
and basically say this chip and then
send the data and then that trip and
then send the data etc so I square C
basically makes it more easy to address
more than one chip because it's a bus so
you have a bus you have basically only
two lines a data line in the clock line
and ground and power yeah i mean you all
set ground and it's also master slave
protocol and the slaves or clients have
built-in address sometimes it's fixed
sometimes you can toggle a little switch
on the board and say yeah have some
alternative address and then you can
basically if you know the address you
basically send out one by the address I
think that's yeah it's one byte address
you sent out one byte address and then
you send a data packet and then the chip
answers with the answer to the data
packet so you have our little bit more
high level protocol but only by so much
but then you can talk to many chips but
this is used for normally for talk on
the same board not like taco over the
sensor over there some people use it
like this but that's actually abusing it
and it's not very it doesn't work too
well if there's some noise in there or
something going on so there's a kind of
extension 2i square C it's called tell
us one wire it's called Della's because
it was invented by a company called
della semiconductors and it does
everything on one wire well it's
actually a lie you need a ground wire
but you actually only need a ground and
one other wire and over the one other
wire you can power your your opponent so
you can send power and data which is
kind of cool so you basically have to
wire very thin wire and you can just
power a temperature sensor and read it
out
and so it's quite similar to I square C
it's an extension of this but it's much
slower and has a little bit more data
protection there's a checksum and what's
also a neat feature is that every device
I mean this device I mean very small
things very small sensors has actually
are built in 64 bit unique ID which is
worldwide unique and there's a discovery
protocol which gets you to find out what
IDs are on the bus and then you can have
many sensors on one bus and you actually
know who is who at least once you had
configured them I mean still have to
know if if ID 123 is the sense over
there and for the 456 is a sense over
there of course but yep that's very good
and it also goes over long distances so
I was talking about like sense of the
Year sensor there so you can basically
ryer several sensors in a house or on an
experiment and talk to all of them over
just this two wires actually the toolbar
thing has also three weapons or
fertilized there is one more wire
because you you can have additional
power if you want to but it's actually
capable of powering out of the data line
so the little capacitor in the devices
which which basically keeps it running
over the gaps when the data is low which
is kind of neat feature so there are
several form factors where you can get
these sensors or devices the there's a
traditional form factor to-92 that's
basically the form factor that the
normal plastic transistor had like 20
years ago that's kind of convenient if
you want to have a temperature sensor on
let's say if you want to control your
heating system or your solar warm water
system that's one of the sensor form
factors which are kind of convenient you
probably usually put them in a riddle
little pipe and and glue it off full
with silicon
then uses there's also the I button
which is basically a one wire device in
in a metal button which is very robust
and which is used and then basically
it's like a battery like like a like a
clock battery or something so you have
the two contacts on the on the box
outside in the middle and they actually
contacts for their for the opposite side
it has a standard form factor and it's
used for access control stuff so kind of
what's their kind of prior RFID but it's
also kind of like still used I've I
think the Turkish public transport
system uses or one of the buttons and
you have a key fob and you can just put
it in and you so you also get chips
which have memory and some cryptographic
primitives which are the only way to
access memory so you can actually have
some access control applications what
other security stuff that you want to do
and then there are lots of temperature
and climate sensors and whatever there's
a plethora mainly it's used for
temperature sensors so I've talked about
the peanuts so let's look at a few
examples so there of course lots more
but I wanted to show you a few examples
which I basic by the way in so that's a
P mode that's the size of a pea mode so
let's let's look through a few so that's
all I can't see this it's very small
this is really considered compass so a
magnetic compass and the next one is
easier to detect it so a to impaired
motor driver so you can connect external
power supply for the motor and the motor
and then you can switch it on and off
and drive to info it's a bridge driver
the next thing is also for motors it has
connectors for for standard rces levels
which are used in model planes and stuff
like this so you can just get one of
those and plug them in or four of those
and then
basically you have some possible thing
going on it's really slow gpo that's one
of the reasons you need these
pulse-width things because this actually
controls where the sensor moves to the
several moves too so you can control the
angle weather weather thing goes to it's
very easy to use and you can do lots of
fun stuff with those the next one is a
little bit larger one it's actually i
also wanted has actually has so every
everything is plugged in where it
actually needs to be blocked in so try
to get also samples of every p mode for
testing that we can test all the
interfaces so this is a gps with
everything all the features i don't know
i don't know all the features but lots
of features and the next one I think I
can't read it here oh yeah it's a three
axis accelerometer accelerometer and the
last one is a three axis gyro so with
those two you can basically stabilize
your drone if you put the board on it so
yeah that's the overview a little bit
about these peanuts these little things
it's very easy way to get sense an
actor's actuators and it's also a good
way for us to provide drivers for for
common sensors and actuators because if
you if you would have like all kinds of
sensor chips you have like hundreds of
drivers but there's if there is only one
accelerator accelerometer why did I pick
this one if it's so hard to pronounce
there's there's actually one gyroscope
in the P mode system and we can provide
a gyroscope high level driver and you
can just get your readings then on the
along level so there's also there will
be also low level drivers basic ating i
square see spi gpio and all the low
level protocols on the along level
because actually I don't want to write
the high level drivers agnon see there's
no use
so there's you can have a very minimal
driver and see and you could do anything
in a long because it works actually
quite fine so the demo as I said is a
little bit limiting so I have to move
this over here so the first working
bored arrived on Monday and yeah let's
pawn this hello
oh it's shrunk again so so i plug this
in the USB it's connected to the board
and you see something's going on with
the lights or something happens and
what's actually happening is that it
doesn't work oh no that was the second
demo let me change the demos let me let
me read on the SD card yeah that's it
actually that's that's supposed to
happen but actually I wanted to show you
this one first type these are these D
cards easy to lose and hard to write on
so that's the second one I just put it
in and push reset and then you see it's
um something's going on the thing and
then this this led changes color so this
is not much to see but what happened
actually is that the bootloader boot the
hardware it actually read a little
program that's not an airline yet but
it's in see from the SD card and the
little program actually changes the bits
on the on the three lines of the of the
RGB LED so in order to see a little bit
more let's look at the at the serial
terminal so yeah it works so I reset it
again so you can see the boot process so
that was that was all it's booted so two
seconds I I do it again done connector
II currently the SD card driver is
palled and the CPU is running on a
slower speed and it's nothing is
optimized of course the boot nailing the
L nvm basically to boot the image would
take a little bit longer let's say three
seconds then it should be booted maybe
we can optimize it to like 1.5 seconds
and then you currently you have on the
so-called autumn strata bits are a very
minimal way to interact with autumns and
to debug it but if there's a long vm on
the SD card you will actually get there
lon shele here at this prompt
and then you can configure everything
from the alum shell you can configure
your wifey Wi-Fi and then you can
connect by a distribution with the Wi-Fi
module so the driver for the mifi is not
done yet as I said the hard way arrived
Monday evening and unfortunately they
were delayed because this conference was
I want to actually want to show little
bit more and I actually try to get the
Allenby I'm running but it doesn't
compile yet completely but there
hopefully will be a demo tomorrow in
Claudia's talk where we actually have
the hardware of the industrial thing
which does the same thing we can see
that it actually runs so let me let me
show you that actually something is done
on the SD card so let me take out the SD
card and push reset again so it does
flash or sing now it's red blinking no
SD card that's actually a bootloader
error and then let's put in different SD
card that's a different demo and boot it
so there we have actually this is a demo
which also has HD card driver in the
application so i should be able to look
at the SD card contents from the autumn
show so let's see i have an LS so
there's device and a TCS and the RAM
disk and media is kind of it mount stuff
and so let's go to media it's very
limited shell so you can't do auto
complete and anything so that's the SD
card driver thing mmm CSD there's zero
there's zero and if I LS here you can
see any file where you configure it and
the dot bin file is it's the actual
image that gets booted that would be you
I along vm and then beside you along the
MU just put a release later and then it
puts the release and the other files are
some some some crap my Mac put on it
when i mounted it they tend to leave
traces mix
okay so let's connect it back
yep so about the build process actually
I love the topic of Fred's talk this
morning because actually was what but he
says we are supposed to actually do for
four ll all together we hadn't planned
for for embedded development with Ellen
so have a really easy build process
really easy way to start if the board
comes out of the box on the SD card
there is already our long image and a
normal OTP where you can actually play
with the shell and on the child play
with the hardware drivers but we will
also basically right we were plugins and
there will be templates for new projects
for different kinds of projects so you
can basically get up and running I mean
we've got a target set this morning by
Fred so I see this as a goal to go but I
think we can go pretty close to this I
mean we have a little bit more
complications because if you only build
an airline release then it's actually
kind of easy because you just build a
normal release with the cross build a
long and you have the binary of the
Cross per gallon is just copied into
release and the rest is just normal beam
files so you don't have to do anything
special so as long as the only a dl
encode it's very very easy to build like
everything else it's like you just play
the release and copy it on the SD card
but if you have see drivers or need some
different see drivers that are not
included in the system or building C
drivers or other see applications then
you actually need to link this together
with the llvm which is actually built
with the OTP build process so there my
plan is for this to have basically a
rebar plug-in that takes the OTP source
copies in the myths and the pot drivers
that you want to link so you can
configure it on the in the rebar config
and and then it sets up some tables and
then it puts it statically links
everything by the by kudos to the OTP
team to add
link nifs they're very convenient
because we don't have a dynamic load we
can't load anything dynamically so yeah
so there will be plug-ins for all this
stuff and so if this if this is too
complicated to use you can complain to
me I I promise today to make it very
nice and easy to start with so a little
bit worried about the airlock
distribution so the along distribution
can be used over Wi-Fi and there's a
longer term project I'm going to
actually improve LMK distribution to be
able on Eric's is also working on this
to make it able to run on more nodes to
have to have more like thousand nodes
and and and also to have more easy way
to add encryption to their long
distribution which might be interesting
if you run it over wireless I mean if
you only run it in your own Wi-Fi are
you fine of course there's a whole thing
which was done for the initial project
EPMD can't run in autumns unchanged so I
rewrote it in peoria long and i'm happy
to announce that this has been adopted
by by the OTP team to be in there long
github top-level thing and so this can
be used as a stepping stone for actually
build an improved distribution because
if you have like several ways of do this
to be doing distribution need some
addition to EPMD to actually find out
what kind of protocol does this node
want to talk to what Additional Protocol
can use or whatever and this this
dispute this prlog EPMD is running the
same node which I can do in the embedded
note because I know there is only one L
and no running because they can't be too
so I can actually run EPMD inside my 1lr
note but you can start these the source
code EPMD in a separate non distributed
LM node and use it as a replacement for
the normal EPMD
photo play with the thing is there I
mean we have the initial thing was there
are more languages on the beam and of
course since it's just a beam vm you can
run anything on it we might not be able
to support all of the languages in some
kind of spill tools because it's
probably beyond our capacity but if
anybody wants to volunteer mix mix
alexia run or whatever language on the
beam URL or LFE or whatever we will help
you as far as you can and we will
appreciate if you do yeah there's the
image attribution and there's actually a
new website set up where you can
actually enter your email address and
get like very occasional updates how
about the about when you can pre-order
the boards and stuff like this oh I am
talking about pre-order so the the price
target I can't say anything about the
real price but it will be around 100
euro so this is not a project to make
money with it so we will never get out
the development costs of course so this
is at cost and it depends on how many
orders we get the more orders the
cheaper the Board gets that's easy and
there's an easier at matok going on
there so we have to like ramp up a
little bit so it might be that that if
many pre-orders are there that actually
we drop the price even before we ship
the first board because I want to make
this accessible it should be an easy
start for students we are very glad to
work together with teachers who want to
build some robots with their students or
whatever so if you if you teach and want
to use this or if your student have a
nice student project for semester
project we probably will just send you a
board if you describe the project to us
questions
yeah what's the power consumption board
and does it have a low-power mode for
better applications so the CPU has has
very good low power supply as of support
so there were several modes breaking
like set it to sleep in in stages the
overall bored with this depends what P
mots you'll connect to it because if
your peanuts use a lot of power then
your whole bullet 11 run low on battery
maybe so it's it's not that the whole
board is like a special no power battery
board we might be building something
like this later but then probably this
is only clue the battery already but
currently so it can be run low power and
we will make use of the low power modes
of the CPU so if nothing is running and
it sleeps very deeply and doesn't
consume anything and weights just for
the next event to happen how long how
many million pairs with it I have no
clue now I I got the hard round I didn't
measure even okay I shut down a deer am
probably yes I have to ask my Hardware
people so send me an email I will get an
answer about this so we will do
measurements about the current
consumption everything but I currently I
just won't try to get the a long-running
but yeah the build process is not
complete yet and we didn't do any
measurements because the hardware people
because they were delayed they didn't do
any measurements either so it is
possible to run a battery of course it
it you can have large batteries nowadays
rather large but then they're heavy so
if you want to fly then it's not so good
but so as soon as we have numbers we
will publish it on the website or on the
newsletter get on this nice newsletter
and if you get a newsletter can ring 10
boards I mean one of 10 not 10 at the
same time unless you're the only one on
the newsletter but then you will get all
10 any any other question
what's the story around them
fault-tolerance what happens when beam
crashes your stalls out thus beam crash
actually there on the embedded CPUs I
have to get away from the antenna on
these embedded CPUs you have a hardware
watchdog timer which is very easily
integrated into the Alan heartbeat
system which we already started to do
for the other things so you basically
get then several layers of fault
tolerance you get so a hardware but
shock trauma is basically a piece of
very very simple hardware in the chip
which you actually have to you have to
write several different values usually
so there's like it can't be done by
accident in in sequence to a register
and you can configure it how often you
have to do this and if you fail to do
this it does a hard reset on the board
and if you wire this to the to the to
some heartbeat mechanism which basically
shows if beam is alive still then if
beam crashes because probably because
one of your nif drivers and which is the
ratio of course if you have a seat
driver and then of course you've been
can crash easily and in the beginning it
probably will do often so then you can
use the harder what should be to even
keep running and then have the the fault
lines of a long on top of this so fault
tolerance on different Hardware
scenarios and embedded systems is a big
topic which I'm doing professionally and
everything that spins off of this will
be put on there or two okay okay any any
other question I think we've got time
for one
you decided I guess not to put canvas on
there actually the chip has a canvas but
the the hardwood have something mumbled
about that the lines are talking about
something else so usually have all kinds
of stuff on on on the CPUs but there are
all lines the actual I all lands on the
cpu are used several times and you can't
have all so currently there is no canvas
but I think there's a pee mode with
canvas and if there's a use case for
campus then just negate my then we might
have a canvas on the next version is it
possible to cluster these boards cluster
with Ellen distribution or yeah sure
wirelessly yeah I mean that's the whole
point have a long distribution on the
Wi-Fi and then put them wherever you
want and they all talk together so one
way we're taking it I think okay yeah so
sorry for my question does it I'm sure
it does but just the question it doesn't
support airline code hot-swap like you
your vm vm you compile for yes sir I
mean it does everything the nominee had
a long vm supports you can have relapsed
everything that's I mean it's just what
it they aren't vm is actually not much
different from the normal airline being
actually not at all it's a normal it
will be a normal non SMP threaded a long
vm but actually artem supports SMP and
we are actually looking at porting dial
nvm on SMP autumn some actual SMP course
because this is a combination bit
actually is also very neat for lots of
high-performance applications you can
get lots of course in embedded
controllers like twenty four cores and a
few like 16 gigabit lines on a just on
chip great thank you alright thank you
thank you bear great talk and then ya
round of applause for a pair
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
