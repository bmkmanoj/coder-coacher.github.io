curtain we're from science and we're
going to talk to you today about how you
server length in smart metering will
give a small object history on who we
are and technology stack and how we used
like the song super really interesting
problems so cyan our core technology
stack is a back home for smart grid and
public lighting control so our state
starts at the meter on the LEM wireless
mesh networks to concentrate two units
GPRS backhaul to head in a server
software so we have a complete
end-to-end data delivery and control
system so primary markets are smart
metering and smart lighting so as I say
enterprise-level scalable in very large
scale systems for millions billions of
pieces metering and lighting subcarriers
I same band radio book public lighting
confort lighting electricity metering
athlete ring Walter big trick so one
common platform give us a lot of great
solutions should be I think these small
microphone has a problem yeah fellows
this really helped well spotted so just
a big potted history about syang we're
an a listed company so where this little
london stock exchange acknowledges we
originally started as a fabless
semiconductor company way back in 2002
we kind of progressed over the years to
wireless products nice a nice FM radio
and mesh networking with only IP for a
mesh network in stacked as well we rest
over the years out from
sounds really to system-level price so
since 2008 selling assistance is the
utility metering light of control for
Lance men data delivery so that's really
out at USP is that we go all the way
from our web products in the later
sedate up to the tenth circle so another
way of saying it we've got a huge amount
of experience in that company we used to
design microcontrollers writing by this
James IDEs mesh networking IP and now
we're in soon as software as well full
system to agree so I talked about coal
technology stack is really mesh network
running between notice so we consider it
alone speed for street light or
electricity makes more gas things are so
that's the called platform which or
products based on top of that first
level and patience neck is sine X so
this is the electricity metering stop
this day we provide transparent
communications from heading service over
all the way through the step to me to
itself so we have Y Direction control
tech temper lots of good things in
Romania since they're so similar stack
of this lighting triple silence silence
that you too monster public lighting the
street lighting to control giving rules
and so for example in the middle of the
night here one will answer to be a
50-percent you can and you get the great
energy savings by an intelligent
lighting we provide hardware so we
provide the hardware modules for six
inside laughs or meters and we have a
health place is like packable mechanisms
using chipping RS or Ethernet quite
right wheels as other pictures there RF
module
data concentrating Union so just two
before we get on to the early on thurs
just to say what our business focus is
to be very important that we focus
primarily at this point of Simon India
and smart metering so we're providing
solutions are sold in service do for
their years and reasons up and facing
some huge energy energy problems
primarily they're very fast immersion in
common cold generating electricity and
the electricity that I generate is lost
basically from a revenue stream we hear
some really good interesting numbers
there perhaps fifty percent of all
energy that's actually generated isn't
paid for is tempered with install
there's a real pressing need to have
small featuring in India when they're
actually a fourth or from some of this
technology rather government in Europe
recognize the problem of very large
funding programs in place eight billion
others mentioned to fund the utility to
all that sort this monitoring programs
is interesting article in The Economist
there is the movies then thirteen
dollars per atom is stolen from the
electricity reading so it's hard to
argue with those numbers so we believe
British from peace in this case which
one some of these problems so wise am I
was why the same why so fundamental task
is to mediate literates analyze the data
look 10 month right my directional
control
am I mix different things to different
people really do you need to provide a
solution that's really easy to integrate
if there's a high engineering various
barrier to entry system will not be a
lot so our radio modules quite a very
simple uart interface most existing
electricity meters in India heaven and
internal we wanted to faisal an
expansion or like our module into that
expansion port there's no need for the
meter manufacturer to change any further
in the visa to give them a wireless
enabled meter other three points is that
your system should enable mesh and
concentrated in one trip back wall also
to allow meter readings over wireless
from a handheld unit one point handheld
unit and leaving flexibility to be able
to do both it's not one size fits all so
real time clayton delivery and also know
me just being tampered with very quickly
and by the information to believe 30
seconds for each of intemperance utility
company will know about that the
wireless mesh network and eating back to
their own office you should allow remote
configuration of management we should
note eric changes its be scalable up to
credibly those numbers rather than 10 30
working alone model is a 10 to 20
millimeters so this is where you start
thinking that oberlin current solution
to this look without some very large
numbers operation in a very difficult
environment local environments are very
dense urban environments very difficult
for wives communications
work quite well so which technology is
best suited for am I power line comes
this is where electricity cables
themselves are used I used for
transmitting the data you have tried
nice good solution because of the
electric electricity is the lesson so
that's probably not not good when
switching data 2.4 gigahertz so this is
the cpp space Pastor Mike Leigh's very
end this so 2.4 and sickly my phone's EP
we don't think that's a good solution
either rain cheese with is what all ok
just a mesh network around it really
doesn't doesn't work with anything well
there's a problem it's good for our
things in the home so he's placement ask
Bluetooth existence this file technology
when you have to go building to building
it's really large with fear hello so
something has eyes in bed radio is a
really good fit for this and demonstrate
that through repeated or leave you at
China that is a really good match for
this history one so now I'll hand over
to meri telling you about some of the
events like this texting hello so this
is just the top down diagram of the
typical electricity metering system that
we've been often so I home run right
here you can see the electric arrange
themselves you can see our silent
concentrators data concentration units
pc years of shop now both meters of the
concentrators are equipped with our own
sinx modules for the is FM radio the
steepest talking about other women the
meters run on 16-bit processors their
firmware as we can see the concentrate
is likewise and 16-bit processors here
we can see all that we need an
experimental forward shown room for the
yes network switch over to that okay so
we have the ability to get the nature of
the wireless mesh networks on the right
it's easy but then we need to get it
back to the data center now the data
concentrating events have arabic with
the GPRS so linking the link up to the
internet and they communicated to the
site that server which you see there now
that electricity metering circles is
called a head end it's responsible for
managing all of the council traitors and
all of the meters in one particular
utility or particular type or however
they're cheating Tyrone now that for us
is called the code name dean and is
written in LA one person dollars a
little bit later but essentially serves
two functions what is that it holds two
meters on the right-hand side I guess we
didn't issues commands can't dyskinesias
and the other solid glass isn't it so
communicates with the customer crm
solution on the left
so most utilities with many utilities
will have them crm system employed
sample or doing other building customer
management center run again current
congratulate the problem that your
pieces ivory sit in the small operator
interface is either bottom yet in sir
from the other like will use web machine
thanks Patrick ha when base so there's
no software installed on the desktop
typically used by another too small to
repeat alerts that's there for the Opera
magic this was probably look at that for
this is a and this is an example of a
network that I remember we wireless mesh
network Oh eat this particular diagram
you see is actually a subset information
shows all the room to all the nodes in
this a fairly small network back to one
particular Network show is essentially a
tricky subject of man it also shows the
link metrics for all of the opposite Bob
and quiet like a federal officer
excellence under all of the enzyme food
and strong repeatable which means in our
rush terms that we can't waste that time
and energy free transmission packets
necessarily but those are hopping where
they need to in order to establish
witlings and seemingly earlier that the
cell forming self-healing never so this
is not this network hasn't you figure to
be like this in the little
sup like microfiber satira great one of
those notes employees one's pretty
bubbles of routing traffic brother those
the network will prepare yourself for
that can you keep an intervention so
this is our loot ridium what a landslide
so yes all one programming language is
really yeah can the everything so why
would you choose a quick show of hands
who vs Britain and then to produce some
programming language like C C++ Java hi
well it's not easy is it however up
there are frameworks and things I don't
help you better language certain that
the general purpose languages allow you
can do an awful lot but don't
necessarily give you any assistant to do
at any particular thing I've reminded as
the the kind of the tale of the the lost
traveler you stop suspender in there and
ask for directions to Reggie's going
with the stranger says a 12 wouldn't
start from here so chosen to regularize
like application one of these languages
that doesn't give you very much so you
have to the ground you have to evaluate
the technologies available within the
language of evaluating frameworks that
you might be using my use each other
then automate the signal to that how
your applications game to scale and
distribute if from this project is like
most on it will also be some project
pressure to actually make some anyway
and get something so somebody
considerations like scalability fancy
still left until it's very difficult
putting in measurement product having in
short basically for our evaluation early
evaluation of early it seemed like a
much better starting point for writing
network so that the other languages
available that certainly was with other
people in the mixer so this is just to
give you a flavor of those numbers so
this is for a single system for a single
utility but really it does twenty
thousand ECU's so that's the ratio of 50
meters / DC and that number climbing to
pension all there are two meters as they
roll out more and more apply now if
you're talking about getting you can
read link back from every week that
every 15 minutes that gives you a 22,000
readings per second coming in through
the system our goal is not hold on to
that date a better keep it for just long
enough that we can pass it on to the CRM
you happy systems that the guilty
already has but still that's a lot of
metadata you got to be very careful with
it must lose any certainly having that
he may say well what's up you know my
you chose to come to every Friday while
you're eating once every couple months
say they're not going to mind a thing as
a few hundred fifty minutes but meter
readings Robin all alone this this
proves they don't have everything they
cook Steve mentioned Tampa so if I try
and pry the case of my meter the
utilities have done that and it'll slow
that it
some crucially the the evidence that we
can get back neither over the air can be
used in a court of law how the utility
nature decides to prosecute something so
if we were to lose that the message as
it flowed through our system that would
be a big problem that evidence wouldn't
be a bit likewise I mean this system
acetal up on the constant heavy go this
is a machine to machine system it
doesn't seem against reading initiating
an instrument we meet up it may be in
one Geographic healthy but there is no
there's no time periodic fluctuation in
love having said that because that India
where they have said little power
adapter in everything and power cuts
they have reached in students whether
they have had it is so there is no
they're certainly going to the
fluctuation in loans in terms of how
many meters currently have electricity
and are able to your important readings
at this time I'm so obviously i'm going
with up or high availability which is
you discussed in the x-men talk this
morning trying to avoid a single point
of failure and architectures
distributing the application objects
reported outages and pull-offs of any
particular machine or any piece of
program and cramped by fault tolerant
database that's abstract away so Placid
it could be much worse made with hot hot
feather but ultimately if it has to be
happy no we have a mix of a functional
scalability tests we don't have any more
based Nessus to make sure various
colleges about six mom yes but those are
naturally more words you know
testing in the high availability subject
I have difficulty about ssl it's all
very well having high variability system
that's watching beauty routines which
ultimately is delivering but if you
don't secure the theta ensure its
authenticity that this is all to walk
through the wireless mesh networks and
cells are encrypted with the AES what to
Ike's using preciate keys that are out
there the VC used on communicate with
the head by a standard ssl when excuse
themselves a commissioned the efficient
river standard x509 freudian certificate
and welcome the room number recently
athlete is to integrate a certificate
authority into the air to make managing
the 20 million certificates it's a lot
easier as you have run on their own open
see a water immersion of the season we
said that once you find that they went
up hybrid
the last thing I'm going to talk about
is a very fiercely generational thing
that's like things so we already have
the ultrastructure and use the SNMP
tactics in particular for voluntary
service of a health system of service
availability that kind of thing and one
thing like a very good attitude
presently doing well SNMP and box
theater look like working after due to
an SNMP in hue excitation and to stop
monitoring patterns of interest to you
with the time traps should usual density
is actually going low so put that in
fairly straightforward leaf and easily
criminals repeal pre-existing while
they're treating alerting reporting
interface and where you go so that's an
excellent very good early just come with
such an excellent education oh and we
were just at the back aleppo to the type
of person that we actually the president
revisiting and we jamming system as we
move one movie we'd lock up to the 20
millimeters so that is that something in
a work in progress but so I'm their net
we all feel as though i have no that
will do it my whole street portland even
if you try to grow this general for
example okay i can txt
thanks man so much more fun prom
interface between now heading and in
system is or web service API or escalate
your night so we will side the side and
abstract or intensity of the network
minus different metric radicals away
from too insistent usage so we used your
web assuring from a friends of fashion
so it was great talking from this world
maybe I remind the guys like yeah that's
providers of ETA theta cos you should
provide us can just simply awesome
obliterating so over a restful interface
so that's a typical end S&amp;amp;S is the name
of thing smaller scale systems are run
from a few tens of thousands to hundreds
of hundreds of thousands of meters
beyond that looking at some canadians
need to taste management system this is
where the larger more well known locally
mostly into the mix so goes on oracle
oracle small / pro or tartar let's grow
back feelings lot of things so we've
been used successfully integrated with
that move assistance from a number of
Marty significant article so they do the
estimation as reduced meals from the end
of the day so we believe science is in a
really interesting place platform as we
have is not just littering and lighting
is of something that if you considered
our machine to machine it's a huge
emerging market and the numbers written
by they are fantastically son needs some
estimations while you're innocent city
only 50 billion in 20 devices by 2020
and lovings is hard to believe that
that's not going to be my pleasure to
everything this is a really strong
emotional arc you we
really we're going to see that auction
so if you want to join us women grow
tent alone okay I've seen I've seen
these as presentations before its
traditional to end up ugly sliced so for
a lot of different skills my bestest
fibers like program is immensely user
interface design for a network
management side that's the really well
Morris so we still we threw ourselves to
be a starter really even though we go so
long local yet our kind of work ethic
that we nervously startup or natural gas
for halting brief experience people
agile development methods good
engineering practices who is an exciting
stop so we offer food and prevent
questions all our technology try to do
in Cambridge which is only a short train
ride away yeah the interest in case
looking at it sighs the opportunities
about 20 fly within metres it's really
slow moving it's really heavily
regulated the opportunity ninjas about
200 million meters is this regulator
slopmaster moving much prefer solid
India wake up with you anything else
okay good extra time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
