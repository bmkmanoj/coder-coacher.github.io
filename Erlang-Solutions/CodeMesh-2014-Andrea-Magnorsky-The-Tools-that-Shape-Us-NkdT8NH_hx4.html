norske and i'm here today it's that
while the tools that shake us and the
whole point of the talk is basically
talk about what first as game developers
were an if you love developer and like
if you read Cal and you're making games
you wind up mostly running tools for our
people to make games and that's kind of
funny it's hilarious actually ic0
laughing and so that's one thing but
there are things as developers for also
shaped by tools so I our tools are and
language at the ecosystem the community
around it because they influence our
opinions so that's kind of the this is
your time to escape if you make the
wrong choice of staying here so and I am
working on this game called only kita
then you should you know you should be
on the phone right now going and
checking out how amazing this looks and
it's coming to stay in person and
hopefully an early access this friday so
I'm I'm kind of terrified so if I shake
when I'm speaking it that's that's why I
see nothing else and this game is
developed an invention called duality
it's an open source game engine that
it's very nice for to the development if
you were in an angry on AKA ml plus
analysis at your breathing and it's very
similar to unique and how to use it but
it's to be and it's a you know it's a
few years behind on actual tuning but
but it's a really good super a little
stuff so that's good we got there every
partner of the way so yesterday I was in
and one of the workshops and i saw this
i mean i don't i'm not natively from the
UK or
and this is this is where you get this
thing of like might or might ask should
i choose to do that is to wash my hands
and I can choose between burning to
death or reason to this and and when
were a dozen terrible painful moments we
think why why what made us do this one
what into an engineer plumper in
person and mine too this is a good idea
and and then I post my opinion aside
Aaron good to lose the earth the room
and people there told me well and
historical recently and there's
historical reasons for this to be okay
like it was a separate hot hunk and it
sometimes 14 there so you don't want to
be working there but right and this is a
beautiful thing to think about and and
hopefully the rats are not there anymore
but the thing is we want something more
like this honestly I don't care why I
don't care about what's right do you
care about what no dear carrots good
good
Oh all I want is to wash my hands so
these things like an unwanted
explanation to say us again developer I
want to make game and one you
have designers and artists trying to
work at this if people are very creative
that are full of bright ideas this is
the people that it thankfully work with
I need to do so the art for my my name
dust awesome how do they look I mean
seriously what do they break and so I
don't my job is to not get other way
right so I want to keep them this faucet
no tell our fault so that's my task so
and this is our Father so and I need my
tools as I said before are the language
and the ecosystem in the community
remember how about this was at the start
and so and this this is how that happens
so I wanted to I heard bottle and order
as very smart people talk about
functional and how functional
programming can help you to deal with
complexity how you know immutable
particles are a good thing how you know
you can just write better code so you
see all these beautiful solutions and
that you can read and go like wow that
looks very nice and i want that i want
to apply this this thing and but you
don't we don't have it yet but then F
sharp this is the logo it's a new logo
it's very pretty incident and so I like
it anyway and it looks really nice on
this this Connor this is when you're
brilliant no no points league good and
so what is that sharp sharp is a booty
like it's a multi-part and forum
programming language but its primary
function and it's a vital order
variables in turn you can define
variables but it's harder than defining
values or expressions so your default
mode of operation is with immutable
expressions so we have you know let
something equals 42 is going to be
mutable by different so that's a good
start and it's a hitch you can't have no
reference exceptions but within the one
you're in writing Nate in a sharp you
can't have new reference exceptions most
okay there are aspects but mostly you
done but that's the normal path I don't
know you but in my game that has csharp
most of my errors are no preference
exceptions if I can remove those solely
my job is canyoneering on and I can
actually get on with making a game which
is nice and so and we have a beautiful
time system if you just use fish our
core java you have style system that
sometimes gets on your way and if you
get this full of expression of three
generic types and you're like ah I think
I don't much health so that's better and
F sharp is also open source and in the
last few weeks it took over a hundred
pull requests from different people that
are not necessarily microsoft and and
that's really really good because it
means that their language is moved and
progressed and enriched by the community
and this is when a tremor of certain
language ecosystem community community
actually really important and the best
of all things and it works really well
on our windows platform but it works
free well I'm Mac and it works somewhat
in Linux I actually there and I heard
good things that in 12 it runs and
there's a good editor support but good
when you're done to a linux person it's
kind of hard to tell what that actually
means
sorry and and so what you tell me okay
so you're telling me a sharp is great
and how about you what are you doing
with it so what I'm going to tell you
now from this part of the conversation
on it's basically what we found after
using and basically how we got in to
start using it and and the things we
fund so um Oh yet those of those things
that I tell about the language they were
all crows I actually tried really hard
to find I know I'm biased right
but I want to move to like the website
to the internet in what like what's
wrong with offshore and everything that
i found was old and has been fixed and
so the blooming porn was tooling was not
there so do you have pour tester support
this only I don't see that problem
anymore so I'm gonna feel good about
that and brawley people as people trying
to learn f sharp and not having learned
that yet and so yeah how are we using it
let's go to the cool thing so in reality
we the one of the language features we
used to most while we're scripting if we
have ability to script ever up in our a
game engine is actually pathologic so
and we instead of in game development
I'm sure you've seen angry on Scott you
have if something and thirst if like
this long and do compare much so you can
do really nice and concise ways to say
but there is there something it that's
something this way is it some other way
and because I'm good and hopefully you
can read let's see you can you read run
kind of okay and I'll show the actual
co.clare but and basically in there were
doing we're piloting on skipping
inscriptions here we're matching on who
I have an OTV component and we're saying
if I do a play and here we're using a
composition of functions and I can say
so this is a function there's actually a
combination of all these functions so if
you try to you can do this in c-sharp
but it doesn't look as nice and concise
a stash and I mean you should be falling
in love with this like right now boom no
actually it's just this Jeff is not so
bad but and you know and so this is a
picture of this morning remember and so
this morning and Jessica and Kosta pork
essentially that we move aside from me
you know we're leavin Twitter and they
were talking about all this ecosystem
stuff so they're talking about tests
deployment and evaluation or stuff and
and I laugh because I thought what this
is quite suitable and because what I'm
going to show you now that we have a few
of these things that are easier with the
ecosystem that f-sharp provides for
example for a building and the run you
have a fake which is as simple dsl for
Meg but because it's small and more
concise is nicer and for tests we have
FS check which is similar to could check
properly testing and so you know that
that's kinda nice what we use right
we'll return about what we use so we can
use the rapid to do some investigation
on the types so instead of guessing
compiling building going to the editor
does this thing work like we expected we
can just actually wrap up into it and
what we're going to add soon is like
holding and so we can and just inject
bright stuff and say her world and it
will show hello world and yes I this is
I'm here trying to talk about language
and the features of the language we use
in the future and this is a test Tector
and this is active patterns so in here
and I was parent remember to learn much
everything but and in here i can define
north in case pattern over there with
the keyboard and separate between and
what i want what we know what is the
logic and here i'm pressing left or
right and or maybe i'm pressing
something else and and also to hear
separating it inside in what I'm doing
and in games again you have this thing
where Jeremy it's all mushed together
but you two are separate and you just
make worse this could be turned into a
little function so you have trillian
parts one is about trying to say when
what is it that generates this what did
you plug it into and what do you do
after this is and this is not the end
I'm working on that this was more of a
test now the evolution of this is that
you can say something such as and
separate those they're forming one of
these you have one case and at Anarchy
so you don't let left key and much
similar neither boy and what you can do
is you say left Keith and so here it
left key and not right here and you can
also say for example they find the
controller you're holding for 150
milliseconds and have that as a pair of
matching expression and as someone who's
writing a funny game this makes me very
very happy and so this is just a little
thing about and the language that we're
using currently or that were primed
things so that picture about from
Jessica and us to put this is this is
the stuff that is in our existing right
now and we're using FS check for testing
but we're using in a very lightweight
way so for example we have a score
component right and score component
basically means that when someone does
something that gives them an increase
their score you scored but the thing is
and because it's a fighting game sir and
you have like when you hit that guy you
get extra 50 points when you know
something has happened you actually have
some points and if you're in this
particular States your blue so
multipliers so there's all the special
conditions but in reality at least I
want to know that this thing is run we
def is take I can generate data and so
this is stuff like I can say if i
increase the score doesn't go up so you
define a property saying that and and
that's very useful because we would like
three tests or three generate fests I
can get a bird's eye view off it's the
system still functioning and not just as
crazy stuff in a health component that
we're going to see next and you can want
to know if you if you're decreasing
score do you die displacing step because
you don't always add and make it more
fluid but at least you have the basis so
that surface check would break you have
a build system compiler services and
that's how we have scripted so you can
you read some stuff and sublime you just
click on the editor Rick you get the
focus back on the editor compiled
beautiful and so I'm gonna really proud
of that and this is like basic stuff
that is there for reference and in the
future we want to use therap this is a
thing that basically generates the
bindings automatically and we have to
love her will and for working on this he
already did some findings for and didn't
so competitive grants tomb and kickin
Hawk ownership which is really really
cool and packet is that it's like
something on top of nougat packet
manager but it helps you resolved upon
instance better I actually have to check
it out better to know but we have
dependents problems that are about
partially and I think it's all that so
this is a simple example of FS check so
you can use the dis uses an unit if
you're seeing donut you know what the
unit is and there's an integration would
it unit since version one then I
actually worked and all I finish it off
okay and I'm gonna go to one point 0 and
so now you can do stuff for this and you
can say instead after the fourth hundred
I want a thousand tests or I want to see
what balance you passed here and also
this makes it readable so in your test
runner instead of saying increase
underscore and some portion of that and
you see increased muscle tone so I'm
checking if i increase anybody does it
ever go this is like has the boolean
conversion and if you've never seen this
you should be like oh and I hope you are
it's it's in other languages too so
whatever language you're actually
working on it there is a star check for
for most of them no I'm not going to say
that and so fake is the you basically
write F F sharp and you get something
like this like in my case I have their
targets and these are at how long it
took to build this and it just kind of
runs and I'm showing you this here and I
won't actually show you running it but i
wanna so you get some idea and so the
tablet tool is no
deal but it's actually no big deal who
wrote some build scripts and when like
three days later still doesn't do what I
needed to do and so whatever computer
services as i was telling you i'm
showing you this what happens is that
you write some some scripts and you
click on the on the editor and the what
you see is in the log it says if
everything goes okay it tells us a
pre-loaded oral icicles and you made a
mistake so now i'm going to show you cuz
you don't believe me obviously because
you're there going like sure sure that's
it that's very funny what you tell me so
i think i'm going to show you scripting
because it's there and the it's in honor
of grandeur that flew all the way from
New York just to show us closure in
unity and within so in here we have seen
and yes it takes a while so and so I put
a 0 there and there some stuff and in
this not well defined game object I have
a music player then I'm actually gonna
turn off and a script and if I run this
night it says hello code mesh that's
cool that's cool but smell echo is it so
I'm going to open this and tell you hey
here you are so we're writing something
so my sharp that's all well and good
because I'm really while typing under
pressure on people are looking at me I
am kidding so I wrote this just while
you were sleeping obviously and then so
what does this do is much so it's fine
this game object here there it is right
and
if it's nor to nothing you could make it
do something you can't right turn here
how are they cool and so I'm saying if
this is so with a script to show me
right so it's not like this is the way
with these things we do better in that
right and so if we're you're after such
a position then we're saying that zero
is not active anymore cool assembly
loaded and if you can see that where I'm
actually going to make it go wrong just
so yeah I don't know say that Oh error
you did something wrong okay so um we do
that and we go and play the game you can
see it because you're actually can't see
it right so up there you go left and i'm
going to do it again just cuz disappears
which is what I told it to do I told him
after this thing disappear and that was
on the flag so say I changed this tooth
I don't know so this before it's like
not to worry and I go I can do this f5
so the feedback loop is quite quickly
it's quite fast because you don't have
to you compiler wear this on the front
right that's cool let's go yeah you
should feel smiley N and then okay and
what else so we're cool colorful came in
time which is surprising and i'm going
to show you this so that they do it
scripted understand your life right and
this this is plugging for duality which
is a video player we actually had to
write one because there wasn't anything
to play on TV videos and that was fun
and so this built this is fake okay so
this is all a sharp we're doing let that
we have free directories and I'm saying
what's the version then I'd set up some
assembly in full version right can you
read this and is there any kind of
nothing clear even if you don't do F
sharp i think is quite readable then I'm
setting a few targets liking like you
have targets I think I don't know
remember and but basically this tells
you about I'm gonna go to the bottom
these are more targets I'm saying to
create knowbut compile and save set
versions thing so it's gonna do this in
the order that you read it will clean
separation components and presently
that's how I think about it perhaps were
reasonable Minds just make clean
separations companion safe credit so for
example remember I said yourself to make
so here we're saying bill won't release
okay we're saying optimize true I no one
safe blocks you need that because we're
doing crazy Theory plain stuff that's
the Ojibwe player and so I'm trying to
ensuring you this because you don't have
perfect or clean bills that our own it's
any platform and stuff eight games you
have always something crazy it's going
to be never lazy way and so this is one
of their in a distant these crazy ones
like you have to build on and safe and
it was possible because it's just to BSL
on top of it so you can use it and you
can do on unit tests if that's your
thing and create the new good package
this is also quite nice and you can have
this on something like a player or
anything like remote CI and to say get
me at ease if I'm building locally which
I can
need to do very often and I just get the
case for wisdom because it's a checks on
publish do I have a built pram then it
doesn't do it one and doing it locally
because my builds depends on Moodle
packages so have a look on google so i
can say i need to be booked something i
can build this it goes straight to work
should and because i can change this
thing up on top how do this and so
that's pretty nice I think and so that I
showed you that I actually use this then
I mean right this is stuff that is
actually from my production stuff the
other thing about the community is that
up on the top there and you see all the
use of groups that either you save shark
or are functional friendly and if there
is not one where you are you would
create one because will help you all
right and another awesome thing about
the effort community isn't it not only
do I have a picture of the tooth that
created over here it was actually
sitting over there which I don't find
all inspiring and I don't know what what
my first experience would have sharp was
and don'ts I'm Twitter can anybody merge
I'd like to a pull request and include
this book and F sharp torque I was only
starting to learn and I was right I do
my puppet and I went did it in about 20
minutes and he is refutes second request
saying Andrea I'm so so sorry someone
beat you to it and I was I was like okay
this is this is a community I want to be
part of and I think because we all try
to model ourselves on on that
awesomeness and we'll try to be nice and
pastel internationalist for people and
and it's something that I haven't found
in our communities maybe because i
haven't been partying I don't know and
but I find that really good and if you
put up world all on twitter with the
hash of sharp and if you ask for help i
I don't know i don't think it takes very
long I actually kind of was tempted to
do a test and ask something a burden see
like what how do you define an active
pattern and see how long will take four
to get an answered prayer pressure
moving very fast and say my stack
overflow and stop there and resources
now that you're all convinced that you
have to run a sharp because it is a
really good tool and maybe I don't know
you don't have to put a skunk ooh and
these are really good resources you have
if you're into books expert f sharp but
is a great book if you're more if you're
coming from an object oriented and kind
of mindset this book of our work
functional problems pretty good if you
just want to learn it's going to go and
actually try go to try Raptor log and
it's really good because you can do a
getting started and you can do more
advanced stuff and then if you want to
read f sharp or for nonprofit is one of
the best way to to to just hit the guy
that writes it is very about trying to
use very simple examples and non-parole
monadic and on its descriptions and i
think is great for onboarding people
into a functional material and a sharp
in particular and ever up Chrome's if
you just actually want to talk some code
in the editor is basically you have some
exercises you fill them in at five and
go and yeah well and I don't know how
long this has been but I'm hoping you
have lots of questions or where I can
show you more stuff but
yes
okay well it doesn't this do that
because here I am checking only for what
you can't see my hair spray sorry and
that's why I was like why are you asking
you know I don't think a speaker to this
and I don't understand oh yeah so
doesn't this to Canada here there is
basically one case that are matching
interested in like a non-exhaustive set
of patterns so if you remove the Nile
from oh this won't your compiler in room
but I told the compiler will probably
tell you that that's not good it should
maybe or not oh okay well I can see why
but then when you can do an example
I actually okay also you just do 0 and
get out 0 I thought 0 0 when y0
something something like that I'm sure
I'm not getting your questions I I ok
I'm gonna guess that you won't be able
to not do that for if I like this is
where you can jump people that know more
about a sharp yes that's that's well you
know what I remember no no I thought I
would get off but I did but now I did so
in general it shouldn't like you look at
the compiler tell me become you know we
have a real type system here so the
compiler will tell you you're you're not
doing this properly but at the same time
I know because for interrupting here in
this particular example we're
interrupting with C sharp so I know
certain cases are slightly skewed and
not F sharp you but i'm not sure i'm
answering all your questions
I don't need to do that myself because
I'm and I know what this could be and
but you can't you can have exception
hundred if that's the question unsafe oh
ok and so that does the name is built
and I needed to help but they okay the
assembly on C sharp so this is pure not
dammit and the assembly that I was using
was the time one of the dependencies was
a see assembly the one you mix
unmonitored managed code you need to
know I'm safe in most cases so you need
to build that assembly saying that is
unsafe and ms build support star and
fake is basically by proxy supporting it
yeah something like pattern matching
look like and what is it me that's
that's how look and so here which is a
fast there so we can go here from pain
this is FBI case you're wondering this
one we go to F we open this I never know
what people I I was really good curious
about what people would ask about and
this is a very interesting and so this
cool
oh that's the old one sorry
and
cool so that in that case
what you can you don't have a an amazing
high side so in this case it generates
on it yeah it's a it's really funny to
go to say I told this a lot when I don't
know what I drop my name parmar ting or
redacted patterns that's a fun I'm so
glad you asked to say I thought I was
covering it and I didn't and so I I
wanted to direct function but I wanted
to run function just because I knew that
even if you don't use it in production
curve your code gets better and you
would handle complexity by her that was
the promise but the things like you you
know you start going start learning as
Haskell and basically what the
experience was something like walking to
a wall and start banging it and because
the principles are lonely and the ideas
are great yeah but you have a lot of
difficulty and organ doing the exercises
that you get and it's hard to the
learning curve would not help us it's
terrible and so I hear a sharp I go try
and do the exercises and then go like
have interoperate and the thing that
hurt me was FS check so I always loved
testing and one thing about games is
that game developers are not very used
to testing in
many ways and this is my my they all
development company right and and I was
worth missing you know we need to have
this and the discussion was well you
know and you put tests and you put a
harness on the health we need to have
power fluid code and and it was a fair
enough thing certainly whatever's check
i had the possibility of knowing that i
had a working system but not necessarily
being tied up to own on everything so
the hook was nefas check then and one
room using an introduction so why not
and use fake because the bills were a
problem I we're using theme city for
automated building but we needed to
create the the actual google packages
and our bill stepp because when you're
debugging you need to have the
assemblies right because sometimes you
don't know if the problem is in your
plugin in the in the engine code in
tomorrow plugin that you depend on we
have like 20 different projects that
will build independent so not having
some really fast way to hood what was
making no sense and or before example
need to compile to an x86 or 64
depending on the scenario so then it was
fake and and then when we got we wrote
the scripting for c sharp with rustling
and we had that kind of working and I
was like you know there's this compiler
service and stuff I'm gonna add a
trapper solaris it's a it's it should be
our work so we know weekend I had
something we're basically not a date at
eight nine hours we had something up and
running wicked robots a hello world from
F sharp and we could achieve move stuff
around so we don't really tired and so
then scripting and no one more so that
was the path and it was and this I
started using it and maybe fake it was
around March and I feel like what I was
running before but again you get
productive quickly and of course you see
that FS check
test if your world if you want to go and
you want to kill yourself but and but
then you refactor right and then you ask
the community to help you hey you know
what can I do better you know so that's
huh yes and the parts that ship I don't
know say at the moment maybe two percent
represent like it smoothly the code i
write the scripts that i right but
because of this like the desk
citizenship but they are a significant
part of the compass and the best
quarterback dark tone of oh but but
still this is all things that make me
more productive and able to do stuff so
i think it's a little bit more when you
talk about that yes so you can use FS
