okay can everybody hear okay great um I
understand you had a big party last
night I'm not going to ask anybody to
stand up just to be clear in fact feel
free to go to sleep if you really are
tired but yes I was asked to come this
morning and talk a little bit about
what's going on within the Linux
community in ecosystem hopefully some of
those things can be applied to your
community I think I mentioned some folks
this morning that air lang and Linux are
kind of like chocolate and peanut butter
i'm going to give you guys chocolate
because i know everyone likes that
better than the peanut butter but if you
think about it are our two communities
have very similar backgrounds very
similar characteristics and i think have
the same kind of potential in terms of
changing the face of computing not just
what's going on today which i think is
incredible but far into the future you
know if you think about it we share so
many of the same characteristics you
know the code for you guys was opened up
i think in 1998 is that correct um you
know both use permissive licenses you
know your assumption is that things will
fail I you know and so it was you know
it's really well suited for cheaper
hardware clearly Linux very very similar
in that that case most of Linux early
growth in particular was on cheap
hardware mainly because that's all
torvalds had and you your your portable
too many different architectures no esas
again you know linux runs on more
architectures than any other OS in the
history of computing so that allows
people to hop across different
architectures very very easily so very
very similar in some of the
characteristics also you know both ideal
for a huge area of growth in computing
today for embedded applications and I
realize this is just one area where this
technology
is a very very appropriate and but I
thought I would highlight it you know
today and in the future and I'll talk
about this later in my presentation you
know we're making tons of connections
daily you know and most of them are
transparent and intermittent right and
if you think about it that brings a lot
of challenges right you know with more
endpoints you have more devices to build
more connections to manage more failures
to tolerate and I think the combination
of what linux is doing and what you guys
are doing really addresses a lot of
these challenges you know when we look
at the build-out of the sort of Internet
of Things Linux is really becoming the
de facto standard for that in fact you
know in the mobile computing world
unless your name's Microsoft rim or
Apple nobody makes anything these days
without Linux so really because of its
flexibility the fact that it supports so
many architectures it's low costs and
all the skills out there Linux is really
being used to build these devices well
when you build all these devices there's
lots of connections to manage you know
the things that you guys are doing the
suitability for concurrency for data
isolation all these things really really
are fitted to what your community is
doing you know fault tolerance be able
to recover quickly isolate failures
that's that's something that you guys
have built into the whole design of what
you're working on and so these two
things in tandem I think solve a lot of
tough problems that are really proving
that this development model what I like
to call the hacker way sort of the the
way of collaborative development the
Linux community airline community are
really proving that that works both our
communities are growing very quickly I
think Linux Scott you know arguably a
head start and so it's a larger
community at this point but your
community from what i see is growing
hand over fist perhaps at a faster rate
than linux is at this time and trust me
linux is growing fast and what's even
more interesting and what i'll explain
from a linux perspective but i think it
can also be applied to your community is
that
we're solving big problems in the
fastest growing segments of technology
today today we're in the middle of what
I think most pundits out there would
characterize as a disruptive time in
computing where the fundamental
characteristics of the computing world
are changing and that disruptive time is
where all the opportunity is for new
technology to succeed for new businesses
to succeed and for legacy businesses to
either adapt or fail and i'll show how
both air laying and linux are really
solving problems as these new markets
and new problems emerge and i think the
most important thing is both linux and
airline solve a lot of these really
really hard problems at the lowest
possible cost and when I say that not
its low cost because of the nature of
the technology its low cost because the
nature of the collaborative development
which produces this technology it just
solves these problems in such an
efficient way that I think it's going to
be hard for rivals to compete with both
of them and so you know the more I
thought about it really is true that
these two technologies they often run
together they're really a lot like
chocolate and peanut butter but more
importantly I think we're all proving
that this concept of collaborative
development again the hacker way is
really working and so when I think about
the hacker way one of the things that
I'd like to ask all of you is whether or
not you recognize a couple of the
statements that I'm about to show you
here on the screen as you read these
think about who might have said this
code wins arguments we heard this before
sounds vaguely familiar right the best
idea and implementation should always
win right you've probably seen this on
mailing lists for 10 20 years right if
for anybody who participates and
collaborative development these are
almost intuitive thoughts does anybody
know happen to
who actually said this both these
statements anybody wow there's always
one wise guy in the crowd close but
incorrect they must have been a good
party last night damn I should have come
over here excuse me was it wasn't this
guy Lina store vault sounds like
something you'd say right we got a yes
here torvalds does anybody say torvalds
all right well you're all wrong uh it
was actually this guy Mark Zuckerberg
and it wasn't ten years ago on a mailing
list it was about two months ago in his
introductory letter to investors upon
the eve of the most anticipated IPO of
the decade Mark Zuckerberg wrote a
letter to the investors when he
introduced their IPO not talking about
how great Facebook is but about how
important this concept of the hacker way
is to Facebook it he talked about how
collaborative elip Minh tis a
fundamental part of how Facebook works
code wins arguments the best
implementation should win it was so
important to him that he wrote that up
when he stands to make a hundred billion
dollars or Facebook I think he gets 50
billion of that when they're standing to
make a hundred billion dollars off of
this IPO that's how powerful this
concept of collaborative development is
something that you guys have been known
for you know since 1998 something Linux
community has known for over 20 years
isn't something that people even think
about these days Mark Zuckerberg didn't
say you know I wonder if I will should
use dot net or Linux to or Windows or
Linux to write Facebook it was just
intuitively obvious to him he took open
source software and he created
book and he believes in that method of
development so much that he pointed it
out on the eve of their IPO so I thought
that's pretty impressive in terms of
just how mainstream this type of
development has become and so when you
think about it the
to raised why is the world why did
Zuckerberg instinctively choose Linux
and open-source to create all of this
value why does Amazon Facebook Google
why did ninety percent of the world's
equities trading platforms by the most
air traffic control systems why do all
these things now run on open-source
software and Linux it's worth asking
stepping back a second saying and asking
yourself what what is the bigger picture
that's going on that's driving this
consumption I think everybody in this
room including my selves will argue that
it's because the technology that we're
all working on is so incredibly good
that anyone would be a fool to choose
anything else and well I would like to
think that I think it's not as many of
you know who've been in technology for
years and years and years you know the
technology alone doesn't always make for
success I would bag on Windows right now
but I've vowed to stop picking on
Microsoft but you know it is true
technology doesn't always win and so
what's going on right now that's driving
this incredible adoption of Linux where
it is number one in embedded systems now
where it is numbers computing where it
is number one in mobile devices where it
is the fastest growing platform in the
server space where it's powering 700,000
android activations a day what is
happening that's driving all of this
growth and so I have three reasons that
I want to walk you through and I hope
these and I believe these are applicable
to what you're probably dealing with in
your community as well the first one
certainly is the first reason is the
Internet is fundamentally changing and I
think the work you guys are doing really
is suited to meet this fundamental
change and what I mean by that is the
Internet's not just growing right
there's I think a billion people online
today it's moving to two billing and out
we're somewhere in there right couple
billion people online and I think that's
interesting the rate of growth of users
of the internet but what's really
fueling the growth of the Internet is
the internet of things that were growing
to trillions and trillions of devices
being connected over the Internet I read
an article the other day I don't know if
anyone saw this where someone stated
that a huge maybe even up to fifty
percent of all traffic over the internet
is not actually generated by people it's
device device communication or
machine-to-machine communication that's
an incredible load I think that's going
to go up by the way as you connect more
cars as you make you know all the things
that we take for granted every day
smarter and smarter you know smart grid
technology and so forth the dynamic of
what is required technically in this
world dramatically changes and I thought
it would be interesting to look at the
most simple example of this chain that
this change in technical requirements by
looking at the most simple example of an
application within this new Internet of
Things and so you know and admittedly
this is just the most simplistic example
I think we can all think of other much
more complex examples but this is just a
power company in the southwestern part
of the United States that has a million
customers and that company decided that
they were going to build a smart grid
system to a label better power
utilization more efficiency and better
service to their customers and
traditionally a meter reader would go
out to the million customers that this
company had and read the meter once a
month and that produced 12 million
transactions a year right guy goes out
right sit down enters it into some place
when he gets back to the office they
send out a bill 12 million transactions
a year well when you install smart meter
technology that wirelessly transmits
that data to a server stores it it
analyzes it just on a daily basis
obviously the number of transaction
jumps significantly
now this power company's goal is to be
able to read the meter every 15 to be
able to balance load and again be more
efficient and serve their customer
requirements better when you start
reading meters every 15 minutes in this
scenario with a million customers it's
35 billion transactions per year the
data lo the type of network you need
every component of the technology that's
required by this company changes and if
you think about again in the most
simplistic terms what those changes
might look like you need a few types of
new things again this is the very basics
of what you might need but you need some
kind of instrumentation some sort of
smart meter that can transmit wirelessly
an embedded system to collect the data
and transmit it you need network servers
to gather and store this data you need
supercomputers high performance
computing to analyze this data explosion
and then you need mobile devices
increasingly tablets and other things to
be able to display interact and
communicate with that data and so I look
at this world and I'd like you to think
about the technology you're all working
on and think about this world of a vast
increase of embedded systems lots and
lots of network concurrent network
connections you know high performance
computing now exploiting multi-core new
devices to display these on embedded
systems well that all sounds pretty
familiar right Linux is number one in
every category of these these
technologies that will be critical to
this new Internet of Things and I would
argue airline is also going to be
critical in this tech we're at the tip
of the iceberg in building out the
Internet of Things we're at the very
beginning of the applications that are
going to make life better in terms of
transportation and weather forecasting
and taking advantage of all this huge
huge amount of data that's being
generated as more and more things get
connected to the Internet and I think
Linux is clearly situated to be a key
component almost a
fabric of that computing trend and so is
arently the second reason why people are
adopting open source and Linux in
particular is because it saves money I
think everybody gets the saving money
thing right sounds like you guys got the
free as in beer thing a little too much
last night right but I won't I don't
want to talk about why linux or
open-source software free software saves
money in the aspect that is just cheap
you know red hat yesterday there was day
before yesterday actually on their
quarterly earnings call announced that
they broke a billion dollars in revenue
actually they didn't just break it they
blew it out it was 1.2 billion dollars
in revenue annually they announced
clearly a free software is something
that you can make money off of and it's
you know not necessarily free as in beer
but it does save money in some very
important ways that I thought I would
point out to you I that solves a lot of
big challenges for the industry today
when i go to talk to consumer
electronics companies embedded systems
companies more and more they're saying
that their world has changed
dramatically and they're struggling to
meet up with those challenges and when
they say that their world has changed
what's happening is the old model for a
consumer electronics maker for example
this is i'll just use them as an example
was you would build a you know a Walkman
or something i don't want to pick on
Sony too much but you get it you know a
Walkman or some kind of device and it
would cost a certain amount to make and
then you would sell that if you look
here on my right in the market and
generally you'd have these things for
like three four years right I mean even
not too long ago a basic cell phone you
know which was primarily primarily used
for voice communication last did you
know 23 years you'd have this thing
right and so these were relatively
uncomplicated
Isis I think the hardware design was
very sophisticated the industrial design
the way that they match these devices to
the market was good but they weren't
super expensive to make and they lasted
in the market a long time right so you
could make a lot of money off of that
investment you made in creating these
devices and that model is fundamentally
changing today because you guys are all
throwing your cell phones away every 12
months and it's not just you guys you
know the kind of vanguard of tech
adoption it's almost everyone you know
technology just doesn't last in the
market these days you know Apple as an
example is produced every 12 months and
get a new device coming out a new device
coming out people are lining up around
the blocks for these things it's
unbelievable right the point being that
there's not as much time to monetize
these things in the market so that sucks
less time to make money doesn't make for
a profitable business but the other one
is that the cost of creating a
breakthrough device has gone up
exponentially in just a massive way and
when I ask people you know can you give
me specifics on what is driving all of
this cost for you to create these
interesting devices and experiences they
say it's all about the software that
software development has really really
raised the bar in terms of cost if you
look at a phone today you know and we're
really moving towards the world of
smartphones is a phone right there's no
you know I always hear this argument
well you know for people who don't have
enough money maybe they just want to
feature phone they don't need a
smartphone I'm like they're poor they're
not idiots right i mean everybody's
going to have a smartphone they're just
going to get a little less expensive but
the cost of creating these is it's a
it's a full-blown operating system with
lots of applications and network
connectivity and has so much more
functionality than was ever had in these
previous generations a device that's all
software driven that's expensive
development and it's hard to do and so
in order to meet that challenge what
people are doing is transferring that
internal development cost externally
sharing in the development of non
differentiated software in the case of
Linux for the underlying kernel most of
my support in many of the critical
libraries that are used to build these
devices and only focusing on the things
that really add value to their customers
and differentiate their business and so
by using this collaborative development
they're not just saving money in the
sense that software itself is free
they're saving money in the fact that
innovation now becomes better faster
cheaper that is what i mean by
collaborative innovation what we're all
doing saves money not only does it save
money in terms of production but it
allows for new value creation because
based on the licenses of the software
you actually own your own intellectual
property you don't have to go ask
Microsoft or Apple for permission to
create your own app stores or your own
services right and that's what people
are doing and increasingly we're moving
towards a world where those services are
where people make money and those
services are increasingly being deployed
and created using open-source software
and that leads me to the third and sort
of final main reason why the world is
true during this disruptive period is
choosing open source and Linux is
because we really are moving towards a
services model of computing across the
board so in my world most software will
be free right people will
open source software and create
incredible new things and this idea of
going out and licensing expensive
proprietary software it's just going
away and I'll just you know I'll put
myself out there on a limb and say this
trend is showing no signs of slowing
down you know we're not going to rewind
the clock to the days where proprietary
software ruled the roost but there's
something more interesting going on than
just this trend towards free software I
would postulate that hardware will also
be free nobody's going to make any money
all right so hardware will be free but
what I mean by that is not that people
won't be able to build software and to
sell it to people the customers are just
going to be different if you think about
it free can be a new model where
hardware just becomes the delivery
platform for a service and that I think
is the future that we're all going to
face the best example in the leading
indicator of this is probably amazon at
this point i mean here amazon hosts two
of the most diets a of the most dynamic
service opportunities and technology
their cloud services anybody who's an
Amazon Prime customer which I am you
gotta love it to the shopping as a
service and then the kindle fire and
when they announced this i love this
quote from jeff they don't think of the
kindle fire as a product they think of
it as a service they lose money on the
hardware costs more money to make a
kindle fire than it does than the cost
of actually purchasing it as a consumer
and if you look at where all of the hot
value is being created in the consumer
world where you know google adwords
probably being a quintessential you know
service right you know just creating
billions of dollars in value but
streaming videos like Netflix Amazon
Appstore wrap see all of these there's
just dozens and dozens
aer lingus behind a lot of these these
type of internet services the world is
increasingly moving towards that
services model I mean but once the last
time anybody in this room even bought a
DVD right you know I mean I just think
that people are going to stream these
more and more in the future and really
things are going to be services based
and it's not just in consumer services
depending in cloud computing as well and
whatever you want to call cloud
computing I it is definitely buzzword
worthy I agree with that I I was part of
a start-up back in the late 90s that did
application was an application service
provider we were doing hosted enterprise
software and then it became software as
a service and now it's cloud computing
and then platform is service but I think
you get the gist it's a service right
it's software that is hosted somewhere
that people consume as a service smart
startups in Silicon Valley today again a
sort of a canary in the coal mine for
technical trends don't buy any hardware
software these days they don't need to
raise even much venture capital these
days because they can create an idea
they can fire it up in the cloud they
can build it using open source software
their cost of capital their ability to
experiment with new ideas to raise the
innovation bar higher is so much more
efficient in this services economy and
in this services economy open source
clearly wins and the easiest way to
think about it is to think about it in
terms of these tremendously successful
service platforms on the internet today
could these be the companies they are
today could Google be who they are today
if they had written google search using
microsoft dotnet i mean i don't i don't
think they could be who they are today I
don't necessarily think it's a technical
reason but you know they needed to
control their intellectual property or
own destiny they needed to tweak it in a
way that they could optimize for their
particular company and so
a shows open source software to do that
and so did Zuckerberg and so did amazon
and I think that trend is irreversible
and when you look at any new company
they pretty much all are doing the same
thing and so what linux is a part of and
I what I think you guys are part of is
being at the center of this set of
disruptive forces that are happening in
technology today we're the the change to
an Internet of Things the need for
economic efficiency in producing
innovation and this move to services
allow us to be uniquely positioned for
that change and I think there's even one
bigger reason than that that I'd like to
continue to remind you guys as you know
your community continues to grow I'll
make prediction right now I think this
room will be have twice as many people
next year I think your community is
growing that fast and i love this
technology i think it's that important
and the importance of being on the right
side of history is also something that I
think the Linux community can share with
you and what I mean by that is you know
last year was Linux's 20th anniversary
and for those of us who've been a part
of the Linux community for a long time
we have seen so many naysayers so many
reasons why linux sucks I am the world's
expert on why linux should fail and how
much it sucks I assure you because I've
heard it all right it's not technically
good enough it's just for hobbyists
right the legal underpinnings of the
license month licensing model are an
abomination to intellectual property
rights right it'll never work nobody can
make money with open source right I've
heard everything and every single time
history has proven Linux right you can
make money the legal structure
and licensing mechanisms are not only
sound they fit business as I just showed
the technology evolves at a pace of
innovation that cannot be matched
because it's more than just this there
are almost three million lines of code
added to Linux every year there are
10,000 lines code added to the Linux
kernel every day more importantly there
are about five thousand that are
subtracted every day which is equally
important as you all know the collective
rd value of the world's largest
collaborative development effort is over
ten billion dollars that cannot be
matched but we did something more than
that with Linux and I think you can do
something more than that with airline
and that is we are the existence proof
that collaborative development is a
better way of innovating and have
spawned not just a technical movement
but an entire genre about how to
innovate there are hundreds of books
it's expanded beyond just IT into
pharmaceuticals and mining and other
aspects of global industry the idea that
any one of us is not as smart as all of
us collectively and that is I think
what's going to make your community to
succeed over long periods of time you
have the right technology at the right
time you have the right development
model and you're on the right side of
history so I want to wish all of you
luck and know that at the Linux
Foundation we are definitely rooting for
you because we are obviously fellow
travelers in this world and I want to
thank you for your time so thank you
very much
any questions excuse me covering from a
cold one going to be five I was in grade
school but no III I understand yeah yeah
you're definitely right in that this
this has been predicted over and over
again you know the way I look at it is
in order to really achieve this you need
a confluence of a few characteristics
you need relatively widespread cavity
right first of all in order to be able
to provide these services in any
meaningful way you need the development
of new service business models in order
to do this on the enterprise side I'll
just give you an example you almost
needed because I do I I wasn't actually
in junior are in grade school but um you
know i'll give you one personal example
for that back in in 1998 when i started
with this company called correo we were
hosting erp applications we're basically
hosting peoplesoft and oracle apps back
office applications front office
applications and you know our cost of
delivering that service absolutely blew
it sucked and here's why we were running
you know PeopleSoft on a spark machine
with a solaris operating system and an
oracle database with ve a middleware
with you know an expensive erp
application on top of that we were
running it over very
very expensive pipes the
telecommunications costs at that time
were very very expensive and all of
those things have dramatically changed
God if I you know what if we had had
sort of the type of cloud computing
models that you're seeing today the type
of oak you know open source software
that can build it the type of you know
multi-tenant web architected
applications that you see today the
broad and lower-cost connectivity if we
had had that back then I would not be
speaking to you now because I would be
rich and I wouldn't even work you know
that that you know we went public a
summer 2000 we really struggled the
number one risk statement in RS one was
we don't own the software we host right
you know it was tough and so I think you
know that's just one example of where
you've had this confluence of freely
available really kick-ass technology
like airline like Linux you have broad
connectivity you have commodity hardware
that this stuff can be built upon you
have manufacturing processes that enable
amazon to create a two-hundred-dollar
kindle you know i think that's a big
breakthrough by the way you know i look
at that confluence and I say you know
that really means something you know
I'll give I'll give one counterexample
where you know why hasn't Google's
Chrome OS taken off I would argue it's
not a technical challenge i mean i love
chrome right i think you know if you're
an IT ops guy chrome is awesome right
security deployment all of that is so
much better in that model Chrome's
biggest problems a pricing problem
nobody wants to pay five hundred dollars
first you know for that computer right
it should be free with a Google acts app
subscription or something else right
that allows you to offset and subsidize
the cost of that the the industry that
probably understands that the most and
again is another leading indicator of
why this works now is the wireless
telecommunications industry here in the
united states where phones are free
right wire phones free because the
average revenue per subscriber on a
monthly basis x the lifetime of that
subscriber you know subtracted the cost
of customer acquisition and the cost of
goods sold the subsidy on the phone you
know allows them to make
money right and so that's how software
will be delivered in the future and so I
think it's that confluence of things
we're not completely there particularly
in cloud computing I think we're very
early on and developing the right types
of infrastructure models particularly on
the ops side and don't even get me
started on how much carriers just need
to you know just the cold capital
expense behind building out the networks
and make doing that efficiently it just
sucks but we're getting really really
close and that's why I do think this
time it will work another question
well so here's what's so ironic about
that so every time I tell my dad about
things I'm working on but my grandfather
was in the computing business he was one
of the founders of Cray research my dad
worked it I don't know if anybody
remembers control data and you know he
worked on mainframes and supercomputers
and every time I tell him about
something cool that's going on in Linux
there you know he just is like we did
that like 30 years ago right you know
and the whole idea of sort of this
client server architecture that that's
killing me today is when I look at how
does anybody here have an iphone fess up
all right at school uh it's like we've
regressed back to client-server like
like I thought we were going with web
architecture and then Apple comes out
and now it's all objective-c and
client-side executable you know I
thought it's killing me I think that
naturally at least on my experience in
terms of like dealing with IT ops people
day in day out the web model the the the
the thinner client model that you
described is is preferable and and we
will probably land somewhere I hate it
when business guys say this about
technology like yeah it's somewhere in
between right but the you know clearly
like JavaScript and things like that are
creating a little bit more you know
heavy client you know executable stuff
but I think that you know things like
html5 and a lighter client or where the
industry will tend to go over time I
just have no explanation for how the the
iphone and ipad and just regressed us
back to client-server other than Steve
Jobs is a genius right you know you suck
this all back into that world I think
that that world does end up changing and
going back towards a more web
architected lighter client side
hopefully that makes sense to you guys
but if I was an IT ops guy I would not
want to be updating a bunch of
objective-c applications all the time
that that totally sucks just security
alone that sucks so any other questions
I know you guys are all tired alrighty
well thank you very much for your
attention today I hope was mildly
entertaining when you guys were all
tired and I see you guys get next year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
