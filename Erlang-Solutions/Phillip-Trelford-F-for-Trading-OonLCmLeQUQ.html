coming
poor trade poor is a market leader in
energy trading software so the light in
the chandelier up here will have been
traded approximately 13 times on our
system before it hits we have about 13
thousand trades I'm sorry I'm trading
screens across Europe the US and Asia so
that's why I've worked for the last five
years my background is actually in video
games so I've done an assembler C++ all
sorts I actually find F sharp a really
close fit to the way I used to think
about C++ ironically so how many people
here have done some F sharp before I've
got about half and C++ Algol 60 so when
you when you choose a language you're
you're kind of picking a community and
you get the richness that community has
so if you're doing web programming
probably you'd be thinking I'll go Ruby
because they've got great style sheets
and if I if I'm or no js' because
they've got some lovely single page apps
if you want abstract singleton proxy
beam factories then you probably pick
Java and in terms of Finance machine
learning you probably want to look at
something that's functional something
like F sharp so I help run the
functional londoners group here in here
in London and we were founded about
three years ago
we've got close to 650 members now we
meet every two weeks and the consistency
of the group is about a third finance
the other third is kind of insurance and
sports betting so it kind of semi
related to finance and then there's a
misc
of all sorts quite a lot of gaming
actually
video games social gaming so we cover
topics like finance machine learning
reactive and functional so if you're
interested in finance I think it makes
sense to go to the community and choose
the language where you're going to meet
experts and we also get help
f-sharp itself we add these are the the
blue dots are user groups across the
world
the yellow ones are functional groups
that do quite love f-sharp content so
you can see where we're pretty well
spread but the main focus are and the
large groups tend to be in the financial
centers because that's where sharks
being used most the earliest adopters of
air shop were investment banks so the
investment banks particularly in London
started to adopt F sharp around 2007 and
they pushed through and pushed to get F
sharp into Visual Studio and it came out
in Visual Studio 2010 so you can just
literally do file new projects but
they're kind of people I mean the group
we've got call of hedge funds coming in
Insurance has got gone from strength to
strength so you've got off actuaries
prop shops and utilities one of the
things we find is that probably of of
the people who come in only half are
specifically developers and a large
number of people are using F sharp like
they might use R or MATLAB or in
combination with those so we've got
actuaries who want you know ounce an
hour programmers quants and traders
using the system because it's a very
natural language it's very close to
their MATLAB experiences closer so the
way they think actually when I started
with F sharp I was working in the
machine learning group in Cambridge
working with machine learning
researchers and F sharp was a language
that we could both talk I could talk
they'd on that side and they could
express their mouse and we could work
together so it's a probably a pretty
productive space to be in rather than
somebody joined download of maps and
then six months later some C++ or C
sharp Koch
that doesn't match and then you can't
read that either so as closer to the
main so why are people using f-sharp in
finance color hasn't come out great
there this is a forthcoming Manning book
but the cover has to be changed they
didn't like my idea there so there's a
bunch of testimonials on the F sharp org
site saying why people have adopted F
sharp what sort of benefits they've gone
and these are the things that tend to
run through these are the themes that
run for our company as well if you need
time to market efficiency correctness
and solving complex problems then F
sharps a great fit if you're doing web
pages like we mentioned before you're
not going to get a huge value from it
well if you're doing crud apps it's not
not the language for you but I think
this is probably where functional
languages in general starts give you
value so I'll just go through some of
the examples here's time-to-market
ya notes Games's found an order of
magnitude increase in productivity nests
that's something you can get excited
about that's something you can tell your
boss and start adoption yeah and I'll be
speaking late this afternoon
they were taking about two months using
Java to produce a new application and
they've gone down two days now and
that's huge and again the correctness
and solving complexity at the same time
the system they have is as well hundred
and fifty million requests per second
with seven hundred thousand unique
visitors per day and there's a great
talk landed with the donate rocks crew a
couple of months ago if you want to find
out more details here's a very recent
testimonial from Handel's Bank over in
Sweden
is phenomenal can't argue with that
that's been my experience as well we can
recalculate the entire portfolio in less
than saving I think they were in the
hours right before that so obviously you
can if you spend months and months
cranking your C++ in tuning it you may
get there you'll get there a lot quicker
with f-sharp you're going to get close
performance on like-for-like but because
you can iterate quicker you can find the
algorithm that actually solves the
problem quicker at least that's how I
found it here's a fixed income company
this is one of the major problems of
doing presentations for F sharp in
finance is that most people want to
remain anonymous and not really share
their extra experience because they feel
they're getting extra leverage and they
want to keep that to themselves but
leads to virtually bug-free code when I
run my c-sharp code are usually feeling
a little bit tepid about oh it's gonna
blow because I've had to do a VIN extra
work the stack there compositors forced
me to think about some things usually
when I hit f5 when I run my application
f-sharp I feel pretty confident it's not
gonna crash which is a really wholesale
change it feels good and on complexity
this is from a slightly different domain
Byron Cook is a researcher in Cambridge
he recently won the British Computer
Society
Roger Needham award and he does proof
systems for all of the windows device
drivers so he checks determination and
since his F sharp program called
Terminator was some name for a
termination detection system was put in
place there's been a lot less crashes
they actually found a really big
termination issue in the device driver
example that they were sending out to
device driver users and by doing that
things have got a lot better there's a
talk that Byron did it
nor londoners group so that's all good
love talk they're showing me the money
right let's see what we can do so I'm
going to show you a quick view over our
trading screen and I will show you some
code after that
so this is a video that's already public
that shows trade caused trade new
trading screen called jewel which is
written in a combination of F sharp and
C sharp the domain modeling is we ran in
F sharp the calculations engine the
concurrency parts pretty much all of
computation parts are in an F sharp and
a lot of the boilerplate the plumbing
we've done in C sharp because it's
something that we're familiar with and
the interrupts between it too is great
so - as the screen goes across we seem
to the colorings not right but some of
these prices are firm prices on the
market for probably gas and one of the
things that our company provides is
imply prices so it looks over a market
of ten thousand products and tries to
imply overspreads
combinations so if you've got January
February March it will say we've got a
price for you four quarter one if you've
got quarter one in January and February
we can imply March and it's a huge graph
of prices and we we update those prices
on the screen continuously so f shops
are not just about the server side we've
got functional in the client side we've
got functional server side as well so
back to the slides very quickly
when we first started looking at f sharp
one of the issues were going to resolve
was to add new implied price types to
our system which was written in about
30,000 lines of C++ and we weren't we
didn't really have a huge amount of
documentation the code had been written
in the late 90s early noughties before
unit testing was particularly popular
and documentation and stuff everybody
had left so the way we approached it was
actually to write in a kind of behavior
driven development style examples of
what we expected the inputs and outputs
the system to be and then we were able
to wire those up against the existing
application so that when we made changes
to our C++ we could be sure that it was
behaving as it did before and then we
could add new features and that worked
really well for us and we did the
testing site because integration between
C++ and F sharp is great we did all the
testing in F sharp and all I'll show you
that we had such great success with that
it seemed like a shame not to go further
you can write the samples over in an
editor we used to actually a wiki page
so that we could share that with our
business users and our traders so we
could work out what it was in the system
was supposed to do and what the new
system should do and so here we've got a
really naughty example of adding two
numbers I guess I should have done
Fibonacci this is a mostly functional
conference and all we can do is set
breakpoints in text files winning and so
basically this code needs to map onto
our actual applications so I can step
through and I'll reveal the magic in a
second basically
to wire this up to your actual domain we
have methods with regular expressions
and it's very lightweight so each of
these wire wraps is just a single line
and then here I have entered insular
calculator we're expecting an integer
and I can push that through so very
easily you can wire up your existing
code to to to your actual objects now
once we've done this just keep letting
all that run through later on we
realized that we had other issues
performance issues and we need to extend
the system a lot more
and so we've rewritten the C++ code into
f-sharp
we now do more functionality it runs
faster and offers a DSL as well and the
30,000 lines of code are now two hundred
lines of F sharp so that's nice and we
can actually see the code it's still
quite complicated cuz it's quite a
complicated problem but as graph
traversal is but it's it's much more
manageable than was before so that's
pretty happy so let me let me switch
from here over to a little bit of a
simpler solution so one of the things
that people don't suspect is that would
F sharp you've got it's coming from Oh
camel so object supports really good
folks Ophir domain modeling so the next
kind of task we did was to try and model
the domain of our system and we managed
to get 50 files oil down and be able to
see our domain on a page and finally
actually understood the domain of the
system easy to read formal can everybody
see that ok so here we have a very
simple model of the order and order in a
record type so we have a namespace this
is in effect
enumeration now the key thing here from
an integration point of view which we
might not do if we were using language
in its own ecosystem because we're
running on down there
I can actually access that from c-sharp
so if I pop in here into si-xiong
program I've defined an order time
new order and we've got intellisense
over that so it's actually created a
constructor for us with all the labeling
in and all I've done is written three
lines of code in the app shown so
literally I can define a really rich
domain and f-sharp and consume it an F
sharp but if I need to for plumbing
reasons maybe I want to do WPF or
WinForms it's all accessible from C
sharp as well by default it's all
immutable but we can certainly ability
if we want we're not pure we just like
to get things done in the F sharp world
yeah I'm start start with good defaults
but you know sometimes performance
requires different approaches so I can
fill that in now and all's good now
that's a very simple structure how do we
scale out to larger things so how many
people here work in finance is it
everybody anybody not work in finance oh
okay cool so I think some of these
things are applicable across domains I
kind of find coming from games industry
there's quite a lot of us in finance
it's almost the same thing
tracing performance and large amounts of
data
but let's funky graphics so one of the
things that I'd add to an order is a
time enforce so I need to pee I want to
place this order in the market I might
say it's good until I cancel it that's a
fairly standard form and I might say
it's good for day so at the end of the
day I want an hour I don't last thing
you want to leave an order in the market
in a month later you go whoops my I've
been here and I don't have that anymore
so at the moment it looks like an enum
right and that would be great and we
could do that in c-sharp or Java but n
we then we realize ah actually what I
might want to do well who pretty much
want to do is say good till all day
and here I can just hoist in a system
take time so you've got much more
advanced capabilities with union types
so in effect this is now bill an
abstract base class and a concrete class
for each for these instances and it's
just trivial to do and then we compare
match over those and now I can add that
into my domain
and that would be accessible from the C
sharp side as well one of the nice
things here is because you can get
yourself into a position in C sharp Java
scholar very quickly with the tooling by
you know pressing all enter and
generating the code but generally you
can't get out of that position by the
time you've got 50 files it's very hard
to track back so by keeping a nice
subtle supple domain you can as you as
you are doing your first iterations and
as you go you can just look at it
understand it and make subtle changes
add fields and so forth we found that
really useful the only real thing that's
survived in our code that hasn't been
churned hugely is the F shot code that
we've written we've only had to make
small amendments to it
rather than having to create new
factories delete files and completely
move things around so it's works really
well for us so I'm gonna finish off that
little section so that's the domain side
of things so these are all kind of
things that you could do in your
standard programming c-sharp Java
language but you're getting some
leverage just two quotes kind of wrap
this one out this is from footworks
a consultancy business which Martin
Fowler works for and they have a
technology radar every six months I
lifted these words last year but f-sharp
is excellent concisely expressing
business and your main logic and I think
this is pretty much a general thing for
functional programming but if you're on
dotnet then it shall it's the crate for
that developers are trying to do
business logic choose to express their
domain and f-sharp and they're pretty
much they're calculation staff in F
sharp but they may decide to do their
plumbing in c-sharp
so you may keep that cool let's switch
over to calculations now so that's a
little bit boring that's the the kingdom
of the nouns let's move on to verbs
where we actually do some action so
come back into the code f-sharp has
units of measure support built-in so in
terms of correctness we can do our
calculations these are all compiled
times so when you run it actually boils
them out so you get all the benefits in
the time checking of the unit's measure
without any runtime performance penalty
so all we've done before is just looked
at running applications anything that we
have we have a repla knife sharp like
most functional languages and we just
press all Center and we can execute our
code so now I can use that gyro to
pounds and I will push in 100 euros and
I think the conversion rate was rather
good at this point and now we've got
coming out as pounds now the nice thing
here is if only were to actually get
that wrong it's expecting pounds so
that's that's all pretty good what a lot
of people are using F sharp for is
they've got two gigabytes of Excel
sheets and they can't scale any further
they've got awful VB that they can't
work with and so a lot of the projects
happening in investment banks is
shifting over to F sharp from Excel so
it's kind of two kept the calculations
side of thing and I'm going to keep
going down that rabbit hole so you can
embed F sharp into excel as a VBA
replacement this is a product here
called F cell so if I define some labels
over these values
I can now instantaneously get tight
access to those labelled values on the
sheet so that's kind of nice for doing
calculations and you can see it's
inferred the type as well so there's no
compilation just off you go so it's a
lot better place than having to deal
with VBA and I can define a function
which might even use some of those cells
and then it will instantly appear here
and there's my Blackadder function so
all of the power of F sharps just
available to you not just in visual your
visual studio environment but in many
embedded environments - and then you can
obviously work your way to the point
where maybe you can throw away that
spreadsheet or take a lot of that
spreadsheet into a safer place so could
I give you your idea of the nice smooth
simple functional side then to lay
between these so we've shown that this
is a nice sign from the US this is what
happens I think when you don't consider
units of measure it's a genuine side I
don't know if they were trying to be
funny or no that's they were but not by
ironically I mean we've had the whole
austerity move seems to have been Excel
errors I was reading about the
Australian government losing free
billion on an Excel spreadsheet three
billion dollars and then finding it
again in that case they were really
happy but obviously it can go the other
way
wow we've got three billion dollars to
spend this is amazing
so I've played around a little bit with
Excel itself I tend to do a lot of hobby
projects and I was away I had a holiday
for a week and I decided I'd never
written my own excel so let's do that so
I'll just quickly show you my version of
Excel so this is written in F sharp
that's about 900 lines of code
it's not a huge program you can import
an export
Excel files simple 2003 excel files it
supports all of the coloring and things
that you have in Excel and the formulas
so we can do plus great you know that
was nice and easy but I thought oh you
know you know smash your cool if we
could do that's looking better
so my Excel spreadsheets
support students imagine and that was an
extra 50 lines of code bolted into the
parser so I'll show you that in a second
so then we could we can support any
arbitrary complex arbitrarily complex
unit type so I will go to keep going
with a physics thing second squared cool
now I showed you the union's hypes
before so the types for units of measure
you can have no unit which we saw the
first one a unit of the string and a
power and conversate units where you
have multiple units and that's pretty
much it was just a bit of pattern
matching and that was solved all the
things that I really like is pair
matching in functional programming
languages so to implement the function
so I've implemented the majority of
excels functions
we have a pattern match a few helper
functions here we match over the name
and values that I've passed as a passer
built-in for some we take the values
convert into decimals and cause some one
line winning and we just wrap it in a
unit value counts the same know it's
nots gets more more fun if we've got F
and a boolean condition and a true and
false value if the condition is true
then return the true expression of Y is
the force expression one line for an if
and this here is an active pattern
another F show specific feature which
lets you add functions into your pattern
match it's really awesome for writing
very simple passes for simple languages
like Excel and so on you go so you can
write really quite powerful programs in
just a few hundred lines so just give
you an example of a medium-sized program
so so far what I've shown you is what
was in F sharp one right what I want to
show you now is what's in F sharp three
so so tied providers anybody here play
with tight providers before okay so one
we got one again another unique feature
to F sharps being in F shop free it's
part of Visual Studio came out in 2012
it's a very mature technology one that
shows not a beta it's something you can
use in people are using in production
the thinking behind tight providers is
when we're accessing data and we're
accessing more and more data these days
you tended to take two approaches kind
of dynamic Python like approach where
everything string Li types you run an
expression five hours later you realize
you typed your wrong string in because
Python didn't run an error it just
carried on running and in the other
extreme is you run some sort of
cogeneration
to generate the times that's kind of
weird isn't it
you've got metadata that you need to
understand about metadata about your
data and we have to compile it into the
programming language so that the
programming language can understand the
metadata originally so we combine from
one metadata form to another
so I provides just say well it's just a
waste of time we'll let you inject your
metadata and make it available as types
provided as types directly in your code
so the first one I'm gonna show is very
simple one just to show the general
principle which is an XML type provider
but there's type tries for CSV JSON
sequel and we'll go into some more later
the message I'm going to process is a
fix
XML for point for order message so a
trade request to order so it's just draw
back in so I have my order XML as a file
I open f-sharp data F show update is one
of the many packages available on
something called new get which is dot
Nets package manager
so there's 15,000 packages available on
you get and here's one of them f-sharp
data which has a bunch of type providers
so in order to set the type for I
instead of using a DTD we're just going
to say here's an example order and I'm
going to use the same order afterwards
and after I've defined that it will be
able to it's in it will infer the types
and make those available to me and now
all of our XML is at my fingertips
so no cogeneration just instant typing
over there so that's pretty cool it just
means instead of doing lots of
boilerplate saying things up literally
you just use a provider and you start
pressing doll and exploring your dataset
now XML is a bit boring you know that's
kind of solved base it's a nice simple
introduction also you'll see these are
tight so account ID has been inferred to
be in and so forth price will be as we
expect decimal cool so not only can we
collect data we can connect to other
programming languages so one approach
standard approaches to try and rewrite
everything in your own programming
language and I think ignore all of the
existing ecosystems but that's just a
unwinnable battle the our community are
great creating great statistical
packages the MATLAB community have great
packages Python community so instead of
saying we're going to rewrite all those
to working down there we have the
ability to just dot our way through
their ecosystem which seems a little bit
more sensible so here I'm referencing an
AR provider so that's the statistical
programming language are not the pirate
programming language so anybody not
heard of our cool it's very much more in
a statistical field but once Sam once
I've opened the our provider I can
actually walk through all of the
packages on our and call them so I'll do
for this sample as I'll pick that up and
run that in an interactive window we're
going to go and pull financial data from
Yahoo just from the web
and now I can actually ask our to do the
calculation on MSN 40 let's just take it
down to asking you are to a draw so 90
can I swap data in and out levar I can
actually ask you to plot graphs for me
and I can do the same with MATLAB and
Python so this is a pretty awesome
feature so I'm gonna take that a little
bit further now where we're type
providers kind of go beyond what you can
do with code generation and strings is
in the richer data sets so for example
we've got say the World Bank it has a
huge API and if you try to Co generate
it you'd actually run out of RAM right
you just you wouldn't be able to compile
it so the typewriter mechanism works
lazily I'll actually go and get the
types as we wander through the API so in
the case of the World Bank here I've
opened the World Bank provider and I can
type data dots and we could pop in on
the United Kingdom and we'll have a look
at some indicators and those are all the
indicators for the UK provided by the
World Bank so a huge amount of data on
pretty much anything the world at your
fingertips inside Visual Studio this is
just one of the data sources that you
could connect to you could connect to
freebase which is a collect a huge
database of all things open source
database
a more recent type provider is for
xenomorph and that lets you connect to
all of the stock indicators across all
the exchanges and find out indicators on
those which is nice and so if you
imagine you can be in Excel explore all
the indicators across all financial
markets and compute
it's pretty rapid in terms of doing your
financial calculations and realistically
this isn't something you need to be a
developer for you can you can as a
developer you can do it but this enables
people who just want to get stuff done
to get stuff done so let's just have a
look at this sample this particular
Psalm who is compiling from f-sharp to
JavaScript so we can generate a webpage
the F shop codes gets compiled out so
there's no dotnet in the end you just
get a js4 you can drop on your server we
use a tie provider so that we can attach
to different JavaScript libraries and
get types from them and so here we're
going to character jQuery and there's
all the time so jQuery and we can just
explore the jquery api so that's kind of
nice or we're gonna want to plot with
high charts and there's the high charts
API now that what this is doing is a
little bit sneaky there's a Microsoft
project called typescript which is
supposed to be a one of the another one
of these compiled to JavaScript
languages but it provides types and so a
bunch of people have gone and annotated
types over some of the more popular
libraries about 50 or 60 libraries so
the f-sharp community one of the guys
that Bray spent weekend and wrote a
parser for typescript definition files
so we can import them in and so we have
all of their types which is nice so once
we've got those things I can set up a
list of countries that I want to look at
and we can do some messing around get
some input boxes f-sharp has a sync
built in so we can just mark a block as
I sync and push it wherever we want to
and so this works you compile out the
icing for us so instead of having to do
lots of nasty JavaScript continue
Asians will just let that let the
compiler deal with that nastiness
and we're going to pull out from the
provider school enrollment tertiary see
what school enrollment is between
different countries so we've got about
80 lines of code here and we're all
types we'll just press Doc through it
and when I run that that's getting
compiled out to JavaScript now runs up a
little web server
and so now I can query World Bank and
back pops our high child shot so what
you can see here is is that we're really
able to go across huge numbers of
ecosystems and put together really
interesting app so you've got all of the
kind of standard functional capabilities
but on top of that this amazing type
provider mechanism the ability to access
other languages well the other strengths
is that you can access other you can
compile to different platforms so here
I've compiled to JavaScript you can
compile to GPU you can compile for Linux
and Mac you can use xamarin studio
monodevelop
and go to mono and so there's absolutely
you get the same support that you get in
Windows the F shop compiler is open
source on Apache 2 and so Samer and use
the same compiler that Microsoft use to
compile F sharp you're not a
second-class citizen so that's good
that's some let's wrap up there they're
worried anybody a little bit surprised
by type providers do like some like type
providers thinking might be useful I'll
pretty good so so I'm gonna kill that
keyboard and press I just did which
so the r-type provider shown you well
bang so last couple of things if you're
coming from a C++ background using a
managed language of any sort
you worry about pauses latency don't hit
4.5 big big movement there are new sets
of garbage collectors specifically for
financial trading applications there's a
low latency mode for trading screens and
sustained a latency for servers so
things are really improved there and you
can hint at the garbage collector when
it wants to collect you can say I don't
want you to cleanse click now and try
and get that that latency that you need
on the mono side if you're running on
Linux or Mac monos garbage collectors
old garbage collector is famous for not
being great a conservative garbage
collector this is this is taken from a
graph database and they put different
loads for their graph database and the
really noisy line is the old garbage
collector this is the new garbage
collector flatline happy days so even on
the lining side with Linux mono f-sharp
is pretty good open source combination
for running on the server
hopefully you're sold now if you are
coming from a c-sharp Java background
any functional language will probably be
a little bit spooky because it has
different syntax we have something
called the f-sharp Cohen's which are
available online it's a bunch of failing
tests each time you get one of those
tests to pass you've learned a new part
of the syntax after about an hour and a
half you've got F sharp nailed so that's
nice and easy there's a try F sharp tour
org
if you go there you get a bunch of
samples including a finance section
where you can do chance you get full
intellisense
in the browser all the capabilities of
Visual Studio in the browser and
wonderful resource for learning all for
free its course some really interesting
things as a do live type provider so
you've got tight access over I do and
yep that's I definitely recommend
checking that out terms of books it
doesn't you just can't stop the F sharp
community producing books I'm working on
F sharp deep ties with Thomas Patrick in
a number of other authors and the idea
there was to look at different domains
so instead of looking at hello world and
other syntactical parts we'd actually
write about domains like finance machine
learning social gaming and put a chapter
each in the book so you could say I I
need to do machine learning for a bank
fraud assistant we have a chapter for
that so but if you just trying to get
into the syntax there's a lot of options
the programming language concepts books
very nice they're using that in Denmark
is for undergraduates doing computer
science and there's parts in there on
how to write your own compiler
interpreter a garbage collector so
there's a really cute book and they
chose F sharp because they wanted to
have less pages no it's a nice concise
language so instead of having lots of
boilerplate it just gets down to the
nitty-gritty of solving the problem it
is possible to get t-shirts now with
f-sharp once you've got your book and
pretty much the last slide in terms of
the job market a couple of weeks ago I
went to IT jobs watch and I typed in
programming languages as a category and
sort by price which is obviously a good
strategy and we need to discount some of
these so languages that have less than
two digits in terms of job adverts and
last three months probably are worth
considering and they may even be
spelling
stakes but in terms of London the top
three languages in terms of wages are
Scala f-sharp and closure so it does
feel like in the financial senses is a
good safe bet to put your money there
well and also a good safe bet to get
some money
so hopefully you can see things are
going the right direction questions
so everyone who uses it for real it
seems to be using it under the nose has
has changed or not because there are two
problems so that a windows is suboptimal
in many ways former sort of deaf ops and
other perspectives and also borne things
as it's pretty poorly developed as a
sort of whole repeatable good
infrastructure under windows compared to
for example Java or so so has changed in
any way or yeah repeat the question
while that's going on I'm just going to
put a website up so the question is
f-sharp seems quite tied to the windows
ecosystem which is not a great thing if
you're wanting to work with Linux and
Linux is pretty solid for doing
server-side work we say that the f-sharp
Software Foundation a year ago to
provide support across multiple
platforms
nice easy support and now you've got
easy instructions to get going on Linux
Mac FreeBSD there are bindings for Emacs
sublime vim so in terms of support it's
come a long way probably off the
Microsoft platform the biggest thing for
us over the last year has been much
better support
with mono and xamarin studio and now you
can develop apps in F sharp and target
directly onto iOS and Android
and they'll compile after native and
it's totally seamless in terms of
server-side Linux the zamarons halls
work in with Linux work with Mac and
you've got all of the kind of
functionality asp.net solutions
different web solutions available on
those platforms but I think it's
something that was growing out probably
the biggest great at the moment is a
mobile for us outside of the windows
ecosystem we have people doing small
apps on iOS and Android but I don't like
I don't know everybody so yeah it's
something that we want to move into but
definitely we've benefited hugely from
all of the tooling and Microsoft's bill
and as a foundation we're trying to aim
towards more cross-platform capability
we're not there yet yep you related
question what's the user experience like
on Linux or Mac in terms of ID in terms
of type providers cool yep so the
question is what's the experience on
Linux Mac for type providers and f-sharp
in general with xamarin studio you get
pretty much the same experience that you
have a visual studio on Mac on Linus we
got monodevelop which is quite close not
as as developed but still all of the
typewriter stuff works so the guy who
develops the f-sharp to javascript
library actually just uses Linux and
he's released an app on the Android
store which he develops in Linux and
so the moment you have Samer in studio
on Mac and monodevelop on Linux my
throat's still very good but Sam rune
have been really successful in a mobile
area and they've put a lot of effort
into their tooling on Mac and Windows
and they've recently partnered up with
Microsoft any other questions okay
Willie will you be around for the rest
of the day I'll be around for another
five minutes cool I think now it's lunch
time so I hope to see you back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
