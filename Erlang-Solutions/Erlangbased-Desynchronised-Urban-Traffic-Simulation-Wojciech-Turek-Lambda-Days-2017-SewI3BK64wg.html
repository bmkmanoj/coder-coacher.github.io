experiments with implementing traffic
simulation a really really large-scale
system this is one of our focuses of
research we focus on computing and on
using large-scale computing systems now
different ways and actually we are more
and more interested in applying
functional paradigm functional
technologies and languages in these
applications because they they help they
solve lots of issues when it comes to
using supercomputers so these are the
results I managed to collect using air
lung on our supercomputer in Krakow we
are working on micro scale traffic
simulation on traffic simulation in
general on drivers modeling on quite a
few problems related to this to this
subject we have some novel ideas in this
area which encourage us to go deeper
into large-scale simulations and more
detailed models which which require high
performance and so so I will just
briefly describe the background and then
the implementation the results which are
probably most interesting of it all so
the traffic simulations been there for
decades now probably four or five or
even more using computers of course so
it all started on a very high level of
abstractions when streets and cars were
not very precisely represented was more
like gas modeling or pressure modeling
to just get some insights into the whole
road system how it may work but from
more recent research on behaviors of
drivers in especially city traffic we
can figure out that it just doesn't work
that way but if we use very simple
models if we use average models it's
it just doesn't give us the whole
picture and that individual drivers
actually are crucial for the results of
performance of a throughput of city road
systems so actually one of our PhD
students made experiments using a real
car and the real people at least 15
drivers drove the same route in Krakow
and he collected some interesting data
where he shows that the differences
between the behavior of a particular
driver in the same situation can be very
very different between one and another
and it is a significant difference this
is actually a chart of braking before a
cross roads at distance on a horizontal
axis and a velocity depending on the
distance so if we take an average model
it just doesn't reflect what really can
happen in in particular cases so we want
individual behaviors we want precise
models of course we want more and more
details but still we need to have a
simulation of a whole city we don't want
we don't want only one crossroad with a
high accuracy and we want the result as
soon as possible because we probably
want to use this for forecasting some
disasters forecasting traffic jams
predicting what will happen in a few
minutes and maybe avoiding some unwanted
situations so if we want these free
together then then we need truly
high-performance computing to to get it
and actually the my interest in it was
how hard can it be
mmm I'm a great fan of Erlang virtual
machine of its distribution mechanisms
and I wanted to try it myself if it's
really so hard to use arirang on a
supercomputer so basically the model I
was using is well known and well
established discrete model of traffic by
knockout second Berg it's been there for
30 years probably right now
this is a model based on a cellular
automata where each where space and time
are discretized as well as velocity so
we have a street represented as a list
of cells actually several lists of cells
which represents different lines and
cell can be occupied or free and the car
can each car has its velocity and the
directions of course determined by by
the by the model of of the street each
car can accelerate the acceleration is
limited but the deceleration is
unlimited so cars can stop immediately
which makes it quite simple to implement
because you don't have to predict that
you will have to stop in the future so
so you simply if there is no room for a
car it stops and that's how the model
works so this is just a transition
between two moments in time so the
yellow or greenish car had to slow down
because it needs to reduce the velocity
it does it just just instantly without
any limitations this basic model has to
be extended because of course this
doesn't reflect interesting situations
which can occur in an urban environment
so I added lane changes
I added cross roads actually with
traffic lights so or with some traffic
rules like a right hand rule and I need
to well take care of cars occupying the
crossroad so that there is only one car
in in each cell at every moment even
though a cell can belong to two lines
two crossing lanes and of course
individual features so each car may have
a different acceleration and a different
actually random factor because there is
also a random factor of slowing down
spontaneously in considered in this
model so now if we have this model it's
very easy to update it as a cellular
automata just cell after cell we
consider if there is a car if if the
cell is occupied and we look at the
velocity
we look in front move the car to the
proper cell adjust its velocity and and
that's fine and we can do it for us big
model as we want unless we want to do it
really fast if we want to do it fast
then we need to split the model and do
it in parallel so now how to update this
this model in parallel and is it
possible actually this is a good
question because the intuition just
would say that it's straightforward
let's just cut this city or whatever it
is into pieces and let's compute each
piece separately and let's exchange
information about cars that are leaving
and are incoming after each time step
this is a quite nice problem for
parallelization because the
communication over here occurs only very
locally so each cell can be computed
separately not so each space as I call
them and they only communicate with
several other spaces this can be
represented as processes or actors or or
whatever so the communication is is very
local and there is no centralization in
this model if we don't want to collect
some statistical results or an image of
a whole city in a particular moment
because we are for instance not
interested in the whole picture we can
let it go it can just run on this
parallel machine and we can look into
particular spaces in particular moments
to see if something is happening or just
put some well breakpoints in a
interesting situation so that we collect
some data and analyze it later but it
turns out that this matter that
parallelization is not as
straightforward as we might think
because if we have this update function
which converts a previous state of this
space into a next state of this space it
needs the knowledge about the incoming
cars from other spaces and this
knowledge is a result of update of the
other space so actually this Li
that lock so this can't be done this
cannot be done accurately because of
these mutual dependencies so each space
depends on the information from a
neighbor space and it needs it
before starting the update which is
impossible so in this case we have to
accept some small violations of this
general simulation rules of this of the
simulation model which leads us to the
little simplified equation where the
state of one space depends only on a
previous state of this space and
previous states of the neighbor spaces
so we accepted the information needed on
a border will arrive a little late and
we'll incorporate it later on this leads
to a very small issues on these borders
but it turns out that they are kind of
acceptable what I try to find out is is
it possible if we accept one step and we
can kind of accept the errors or even
remove the errors in such case is it
possible to go a little further to
accept a desynchronization between these
spaces which exceeds this this one step
so we simply accept and the steps of the
synchronization between these these
spaces so it turns out that it's it is
possible with one one important factor
in mind so we can calculate this state
without the knowledge about incoming
cars because the cars will just move
forward they will never move back we can
accept it as long as these cars do not
hit any crossroad in this area so we can
accept this desynchronization level as d
x maximum velocity this is the the
distance between the entrance to the
space and the first crossroad this is
what what we can access
as a delay and then we need to block
lane changes on this on this malaria
because how it's working each space
publishes information that okay I have a
ten free spaces on this road so the
neighbor space knows that in a time T it
can publish ten or send out ten new ten
cars to a neighbor in T plus one
at least ten in T plus hundred at least
ten as well unless it sent some cars
before if there were ten free spaces
they won't disappear because cars don't
move back right but if a car changes
lanes then it can block free space on a
line in front of it so this this led to
actually violations of the model oh so I
had to block this this small feature
okay so having this this model with with
the synchronization I just prepared an
implementation in Erlang it was quite a
nice experience quite a short code
although it's later intensive so I
implemented all the model in maps which
kind of well know they really work since
are long eighteen this version of our
Lang is already available in our
supercomputing centers so it's work
really nice and this whole this updating
was like four hundred lines of code
which is probably too many I will
probably be able to reduce it a little
bit but what was really nice and what
was really interesting was how it works
in distributed and parallel environment
so each process each actually each cross
road was executed in a single Airlink
process and each of these processes just
communicated using the native airline
communication between processes and I
used normal distributed air long without
any messaging core or
libraries or our tools just a
distributed airline but using hidden
nodes only so I didn't allow our long to
build a whole graph of communication
which is not necessary here the
processes communicate only with a fixed
number of different processes so these
connections were established but there
was no full network of connections
between Erlang virtual machines there
are quite a few notes up to 800 actually
so I didn't wanted to have such a huge
network of connections because there
were at least a few reports that it just
breaks quite soon so this distribution
and this communication was all like 100
lines of code in your language quite
quite nice now this is our little
computer here in Krakow
it's called prometheus it's still on top
500 actually 50 thirds this year it has
41,000 course and something Lu 216
terabytes of RAM I hope to use it all
but it's unfortunately impossible they
have like 30% of broken nodes on average
that's normal so they just bring new and
take them to replacements and also this
this cluster is split into four pieces
because of some network issues and
getting access to more than 500
something notes requires administration
to work so so the experiments were
tricky with with bigger configurations
okay so the results this is probably
quite interesting starting from a single
node with a growing task size these are
the results of the performance with
increasing number of spaces per core so
if there were
actually each space had from six hundred
to two hundred to two thousand four
hundred cells and with a growing number
of cells per core which means that more
processes were executed by a single
scheduler it turns out that the
performance doesn't drop that badly
so this context switching doesn't take
much much effort actually if there was a
one space per core which should be a
perfect situation turns out its it is
not because the number of computation
different spaces will differ depending
on the number of cars to process so no
actually in none of the cases this is
the best performance situation the best
performance was when the number of
spaces per call was between four and
eight this is actually the number of
processors per scheduler so between four
and eight is the best performance then
it drops and and then it's just the the
the error grows if the number is greater
but we can see that even if there are
256 processors per core it's still quite
holding the performance so it's it's
quite good if a growing number of course
we can see well the obvious case if
there are only twelve spaces then adding
more course doesn't make much sense of
the performance drops but in case of 48
spaces the performance is pretty
constant so it scales really nicely with
new course and this is still on a single
node so now the most important part yeah
19200 course in total and it scales it
does so these are the results for a
performance of a task with 240 thousand
spaces and more than 11 million cars and
up to nineteen point two thousand course
in respect to well these are these are
just values so so the speed-up in a
moment
this is the zoom of this this part of
the chart so as we can see it it grows
and it grows nicely there is actually in
in this particular case there is almost
no overhead on any kind of communication
because it's only local so this is the
speed-up chart it's not as it's supposed
to be presented because it's not in
relation to a sequential version on a
single chord this is compared to
execution on four nodes which is already
96 course up to 19,000 course and we can
see that it's even super linear at the
very end this is actually because of the
number of course the number of spaces
per core there were 200,000 processes to
compute and probably 19,000 of course
which gives this this optimal number of
processors per core and the best
performance for around eight hundred
nodes running simultaneously okay the
test synchronization and the influence
of the synchronization this is very
interesting that it's it really matters
and it gives nice results even more
important than proper load balancing we
might say I tested constant task size
versus random task size so the size of
each crossroads differed within well the
bigger one was four times the small one
and this size was random so in case of
random task size of course the
performance of the whole system is a bit
worse this is actually on 100 nodes and
but we can see that increasing the
desynchronization are actually
introducing it so going above the number
of one can give better results then then
making sure that the tasks are on a
constant size so if we exceed the the
synchronization of four then the
performance is above the performance in
case of constant size and lack of the
synchronization
this is probably quite quite interesting
about also predictable
whatever the future steps well for this
work for this paper that's we are
planning to to publish to compare it
with
sequential version to compare it with
implementation different technology
because obviously okay it scales but err
Lanka is not designed for computing this
kind of computing which is only an
integers and not to not too demanding
it's probably not that bad
but anyway I would like to compare it
with implementation in Java
probably not in C because I tend to
think that it's not the point
so the the Erlang is not to overwhelm C
in terms of performance on a single core
it's about the time of development so it
was like three or four days of work to
get this running on a supercomputer I
can't even think how much time I would
take to do it in C real-life scenarios
more precise models and different
problems and these shells are not by by
accident these are actually for a mini
ferris which are small creatures sea
creatures which indicate oil so they are
of great interest there are billions of
them in the oceans in particular parts
of the world and people want to know how
they migrate and how they behave so
people want to simulate them so this is
the problem we are aiming at this scale
this is what what what we want to do
next
alright thank you very much we have time
for questions any questions in the
audience
hi I would like to ask if the purpose of
the model is just to simulate the
traffic or if you are also trying to
observe certain situations in the
traffic like traffic jams or something
like that that's actually another next
step I like to mention obviously we can
do it we have the whole road system we
need to make it more realistic because
right now it's just a synthetic bunch of
identical cross roads we have to load
real city you might say into into this
model
then yes then of course you are able to
get the simulation results within a few
seconds to see what will happen next if
you're available for instance to collect
the data from a real city loaded into
this system then within 18 seconds we
can get one hour of simulation of
Manhattan that that's the scale so you
can predict and you can replan what to
do next is we are planning to this is
one of the applications actually to have
it in real time you might say I think
now that there is gonna be atomic
vehicles you can get the real driver now
you don't have new psychology anymore
you can get the neural network that's
doing the driving and put a million
neural networks there and get was really
going to happen yes we know the
autonomous vehicles are almost there and
they also need planning in a whole city
their behavior yeah and no one even
knows how they will behave when there
are ten million of them in India Cydia
so this is even more important great
thank you one final question do you
check how precise your prediction is
verifying the models so collecting the
data simulating and comparing to reality
and actually this is only possible to
have some statistical relevance between
the model and the reality we never tried
it but the model we are using is proved
to not to be correct but with proper
parameters it can be correct
I mean relevance to reality right so
that I think your own show check for an
interesting talk and look forward to
chatting to some more at the break thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
