to come and speak here and of course you
know Alan's a great guy and he's very
famous for many things one of which is
which as I've absolutely believed in and
he said it best and I'm envious is the
way to predict the future is to invent
it and it's our job to invent it the
other thing of course that he did which
is marvelous in small talk was he really
did the first browser there at Xerox
PARC which has been the forerunner of
our IDs ever since Eclipse etc so so
basically I have I used to be at MIT and
now I visit around here with the
companies in the universities and I'm
chair of two things we'll get into in my
talk of I robust which is the
International Society for inconsistency
robustness and you get to say what's
that sounds mmm
and also I'm the chair of standard IOT
which is a new international standards
group that we're setting up to
standardize IOT for the open source
community so let's get into it how long
do I have no no
okay an hour okay thank you very much
okay yeah right excellent
okay so everybody's heard of the
Internet of Things basically Moore's law
marches on and Moore's law means that
things get bigger in this sense they're
more powerful but physically they get
smaller and get embedded in anything
everything so in our homes okay control
of the energy our cars the security and
my focus is on the consumer side of the
Internet of Things
there's also us a whole industrial side
okay but my focus is is is this area and
so even the fridge it's gonna have a
Wi-Fi in it and we'll leave it as an
exercise for the break think of the most
creative thing that you can use Wi-Fi in
your fridge for that's actually useful
and then of course our TVs and and these
little these little long black boxes
with their Chiclets on it right black
Chiclets that nobody can ever figure out
right or going away and we're going to
be controlling our TVs and our home
entertainment systems from our tablets
and from our smart phones all connected
up wirelessly and don't forget our cars
okay that is our future now the current
plan is something called datacenter ISM
data center ISM is to put all the
information in the data centers all the
electronic information is stored in the
data centers okay but there's a little
bit of bug here namely data center ISM
in X Rolla B becomes cyber totalism so
what is site of our total ISM and we're
having a little bit of feedback here so
I'll get the audio/visual guys a chance
to figure out it everybody here the
feedback
no oh just me just me so I get to listen
to myself talk twice just me who knew
okay okay cyber totalism all electronic
information is accessible by the
security forces from the corporate and
government data centers and
unfortunately we don't know how to
prevent this from data center ism
turning into cyber totalism
so we come to our sensitive information
and this is non-public citizen formation
that can be used directly or indirectly
against the citizens some people can
they don't have any so under cyber
totalism all the sense of information is
accessible as security services so I
don't mean to pick on Facebook here it's
just that they had the misfortune out
there under the Google images to have
something called a Facebook the data
center as a as an accessible image but
it's the same we got the same problem
all across our current economic model
for the internet and then a little image
of a data center down here and up here
we have the Utah data center the world's
largest data center built by the US
government to hold all the information
that they can gather which is quite
something so there it is up in Bluffdale
and what's going to happen and what is
has happened and what will happen the
future is this is the middle image here
is a fiber optic cable is the cables run
from these commercial data centers to
the government data centers and that's
life so this is growing issue in the
United States because the NSA and the
FBI have a mandatory backdoor proposal
in which each country will have its own
backdoors for the internet of things
that means that all the personal
computers all the cell phones the
televisions in the bedrooms
your doorknobs they all have back doors
because that's what security services
claim they need to operate and basically
massive pervasive surveillance will
become the name the norm and the
government security monitors will become
more powerful this is a two-edged sword
we kind of want them to do some things
these government security monitors right
like prevent explosions in the middle of
City Hall there are other things we're
not so happy we're doing in particular
yes I need to make a warning you have to
be careful not to be too extreme or
you'll upset people and some people find
maybe not in this audience but some
people will find the next slide very
upsetting okay because they feel that is
disrespectful of authority and they
believe that government officials cannot
foment terror by definition okay
so some of you might want to close your
eyes and plug up your ears we have this
problem with state terrorism okay this
is this is we're gonna fish holes
achieve political objectives by creating
a general climate of fear and
unfortunately we have examples of that
in the United States we have J Edgar
Hoover were the FBI who terrorized
everybody the gays and anybody you know
the commies simps and the
fellow-traveller isn't anybody else that
he didn't approve of I mean it Joe
McCarthy who did the same kind of thing
and over in Germany they really carried
it to a fine art with a Stasi under
Erich Mielke II right and as a very good
film about that called other people's
lives and a very good very good book so
the Germans are acutely sensitized to
this problems in fact the current German
Chancellor lived under it okay so the
basic problem is installing backdoors
assists the cyber terrorists of all
kinds because they can now control
modify and otherwise operate the
citizen's Internet
imagine the chaos and they can steal the
citizens sensitive information so the
basic thesis is that we got a problem we
got a big problem okay because the
government has discovered a few things
that's merely siphoning off the
information from the Facebook and the
Twitter and all the other data centers
it's not good enough getting the bits is
not good enough what they really need to
do is to run the corporate data mining
tools to really do a good job of what
they're trying to do for better or worse
now this means that the executives and
these companies are going to be
complicit because I have to become
complicit in mass surveillance that's
kind of their fate maybe in some
countries like some of the Far East
before other countries but it looks like
you know this is the inevitable
consequence for all of them and this is
in some ways not so good for the
companies because they will face a loss
of competitiveness because there's
inflexibility once the government puts
the pipes into your data center right
they don't want you to disturb the pipes
and the other problem is the government
says well you know having different ways
to do surveillance for all these
different corporate data centers is a
giant pain and very inefficient so then
they won't want these these corporations
to standardize the operations of their
data centers so on this not so cheerful
note let's look to see what we might be
able to do how can we in Silicon Valley
escape the trap okay
Silicon Valley must once again reinvent
itself it's done it's many times in the
past and now we need to do it again so
we need an alternative to data center
ISM this doesn't mean the data centers
are going to go away
or they're not important okay but what
was previously thought to be an asset
namely are sensitive toxic information
is rapidly turning in to a liability so
there's this alternative which I called
cyber localism under cyber localism a
citizen's information of things
information is stored locally in their
own equipment without mandatory
backdoors so that's the alternative
we're trying to develop so we're
basically at a turning point in humanity
just as we were when when nuclear
weapons were invented if we had the
political will we could have banned them
right but we didn't and now we're making
a similar significant decision mandatory
backdoors yes or no and the United
States for better or worse still has the
economic power and the influence that if
we mandate against backdoors and awed it
against backdoors we can probably get
the rest of the world to follow if we go
the other way and then we live with the
consequences just as we had to with the
nuclear weapons so the idea of cyber log
ilysm is we have things called eyelets
it's a name weak ones just have a name
for this thing and the idea is that a
citizen's information of technology info
information is contained within an
eyelet now an eyelet is not an island it
still has to deal with all the current
services you get all your current Google
and Bing searches you still have to be
able to work with your friends eyelets
and you will have eyelets so that this
is this eyelet does not mean isolated
but it does mean that not every all the
information is not available in the data
center
now also you still have to be the
purpose of the eyelet is enable you to
do coordination among your cyber things
and so you ask what is a cyber thing we
need a name that encompasses your cyber
stuff so in the name cyber thing it
includes your light fixture because it's
on the internet now in the future it
includes your email it includes your
refrigerator includes your voicemail
includes your cell phone includes your
SMS includes your electronic door lock
okay and we're gonna model all these
things as actors and communicate them
with them using messages so our slogan
is on your cyber things now if your
house burns down you don't want to lose
any information so it's very important
that it be backed up in data centers
because that's cheap so what you do is
you take the information you encrypt it
with your public key and you store it in
the data center that way only you can
read it because only you have the
private key similarly you want to deal
with a friend you encrypt the message
with their public key and then only they
can read it no middleman in the middle
middle person sorry don't be sexist here
no middle person in the middle can read
it and the same that way the people
communicate with you they encrypt the
message with your public key and send it
to you and only you can read it so
eyelets are not islands isolated islands
okay now islets have important
advantages
apart from surveillance Department
completely apart from the surveillance
issue they have important advantages
over data center ISM economic advantages
and operational advantages one is in
terms of
coordination effectiveness so you're
sitting here with your internet of
things right your cyber things right and
if you've got your refrigerator from one
guy and you're like fixtures from
another different competing corporation
and your heating system for somebody
else basically an eyelet can do the
coordination more effectively than
trying to get the data centers of
competitors to work with each other
that's really hard also in terms of
responsiveness basically your eyelet is
local and can respond immediately and
you don't have to rely on load down
Singh back in big data centers now right
now the data centers make sense okay
because they mainly run stateless
protocols the OU all the state is held
in a relational database and it's not
very much state but the coordination of
your cyber things requires a lot more
state and that's a lot less economical
to do in a data center and also there's
the issue of responsiveness right run
reliability that the idea you'd like the
thing to work even if communications
back to the data centers go down however
guess what folks in case you hadn't
noticed we live in a capitalist society
and the eyelets will never happen unless
they're profitable somebody's got to
make a lot of money off of this they
have to make even more money than
they're making now so how can we get an
alignment of interests to make this
happen well the idea of a commerce agent
the idea is we right now the merchants
are not happy and the consumers are not
happy the consumers are bombarded and
they're annoyed and they're pestered by
irrelevant advertising and pop ups and
other junk the merchants are dealing
with an incredibly inefficient
process by which to reach the consumers
advertising is just willfully
inefficient in fact that's how the media
through these middle people like Google
make their money is just by slightly
increasing the efficiency of advertising
you only have to do it a little bit you
can make a huge amount of money but it
still remains tremendously inefficient
so the idea is instead have commerce
agents and they they'll gather offers
from the merchants okay and they receive
commissions when the deals are executed
so it looks like this here you are in
your islet and you have various agents
you'd like to have more than one agent
so they can compete the agents talk to
the merchants and then if the consumer
wants to they can reach out and this is
the the bottom arrow here can reach out
directly to an emergent write basically
consummating you know picking up up
picking up the offer and do business
that way so that's the proposal of how
to try to make these these islets make
money and try to entice companies to go
into the business to make this
alternative okay but to make this all
work we have to have standards because
in order to make your eyelet work
somehow we have to get the country the
products from all these companies to be
able to work together and talk together
so the eyelet has the purpose the eyelet
is to do your cyber thing coordination
the coordination among your light
fixture your email your fridge your
voice mail your cell phone your SMS your
door locks your auto
now doing this requires massive
concurrency within the islet this is a
turbocharged many processors system and
actually many cores system okay how do
you program these things we have an idea
Erlang has the same idea so we have
something called the actor model which
is a mathematical abstraction of
concurrent execution and one of the most
important things about the actor model
and as as Joe likes to mention is that
it's based on physics it's based on the
physics of computation originally we run
the actor models Benna bang bang 1973
the competing models of computation were
based on mathematical things or other
other kinds of things and they didn't
pay attention to the physics of
computation for example in Petri nets
there's something quite remarkable for
those of you never encountered Petri
Nets they have things called places and
transitions so you can have these two
different places in one transition and
guess what you put tokens on the places
and the way computation happens as you
move the tokens around on the graph at
two different places
with two different tokens the tokens
disappear instantaneously and
simultaneously very difficult to do that
physically but it's a mathematical idea
you can't argue with it okay but we took
a different approach okay so there's no
operational overhead you know we can't
impose any extra bits on storage we
can't put any extra padding bits or tags
and the communications we can't put any
extra overhead in the processing so it
took a while to devise a mathematical
abstraction of that power and capability
but it's just what we need because we
already have
different standard groups and the
Internet of Things and company
proprietary standards and we need to
operate with all of them so we can't
dictate to them any bit formats
whatsoever we have to be able to
accommodate whatever they have done so
the other thing about active systems is
they can be extremely high performance
in fact using actors you can implement
islets that are exponentially faster
than the parallel lambda calculus so
like all things functional programming
is good in moderation it is not the
answer to being a fundamental model of
computation for everything an airline
recognizes that that's why they have the
separate processes they're kind of
functional within a process but between
process its message passing so I'll give
you an example here to illustrate the
underlying issue how can you see me the
parallel lambda calculus is already
exponentially faster than the Turing
machine because it's parallel how can
you be exponentially faster than the
parallel lambda calculus so I'd like to
illustrate that issue here and we'll
take a very simple problem we'll assume
that we have a graph with trillions of
nodes in it and what you do is you pick
a starting node and a finishing node and
each each bucket from from each link to
the next link there is so here we say
have a link we have a link from a node
to another node with a cost of 4 so
between each link along each link we
have a cost and then we can have a path
we have a path from node we have a link
from node 1 to node 2 a link from node 2
to node 3 the cost of going from node 1
to node 2 is 3 the cost of going from
node 2
to node 3 is 5 so the path cost from
node 1 to node 3 is 3 plus 5 equals 8
provided that there's no other shorter
path so now I'm going to give an example
of a program this is the only program to
do this and it's it's turning on a row
lead on the next slide the only programs
I'm going to present but it's a Doozer
what this program does is says using
special symbolism when the goal is to
find a path from start to finish with a
cost
then you assert that the cost is the
minimum of the sums of the next cost
plus the remaining cost which the next
cost ok is the cost from going from a
start node to a next node and the
remaining cost is the cost from going to
the next node to the finish so there we
got it four lines of code and this
program is massively concurrent because
when you come from a start node and you
go to a next node you want to know if
somebody else is already working on that
next node and that takes concurrency in
addition to that in addition to working
forward we're concurrently working
backward from the finish node so the
ones working forward from the start node
want to notice when they meet up with
somebody working backwards from the
finish node and that also requires
concurrency so using these kinds of
concurrency you can work exponentially
faster then you can do it with just the
pure parallel lambda calculus
so let's think of more about these
islets in addition to have there having
to be a highly performant they've got
another big issue they're distributed
your eyelet runs on your cell phone and
in your refrigerator and in your home
Wi-Fi and in your car and in your
television these are distributed
they are intermittently connected
they're chock-full of persuasively
inconsistent information from your
devices and from the web so that raises
us to in the issue of inconsistency
robustness which is this scientific
society that I mentioned I'm sure the
board of and inconsistency robustness is
information system performance in the
face of continual pervasive
inconsistencies the assumption is now
the information is inconsistent it's not
that it's consistent because that would
be a lie so what to do about that well
turns out classical logic has a bit of a
problem with inconsistent information
namely if you have a single
inconsistency the whole thing blows up
well Stanford we've got a logic group
right what are we gonna do go out of
business I don't think so
so P not being the most modest people in
the world you think to yourself two
millennia of legacy
two millennia of legacy going back to
Euclid we can do it differently that
turned out not to be so easy all you
have to do is do two things modify the
laws of logic lots of people have done
that it gets harder so that it's still
useful right and it doesn't blow up if
you have inconsistent information that's
all you've got to do oh and by the way
just one more thing as somebody said you
have to teach it to software engineers
because we want them to use it to make
eyelets for our systems so that means
there's some point we've got to preserve
as much of the legacies you can't have a
chance you always have to do that so the
stuff that they know stuff like not not
PSP stuff like the Morgan's laws take it
all almost all there's a little footnote
on that okay so that's your first big
decision then you have to carefully pick
over the legacy and see what's actually
causing the failure logic has this rule
it frumpy you can infer P or Q totally
useless already new P right I'm gonna
for P or Q throwing this nonsense and
it's actually damaging so you say okay
get rid of that rule cross him off write
another one going back to Aristotle P or
not P right that one causes trouble too
not very useful throw it out
and so you do that right and you end up
with a system that's nice and it doesn't
blow up but it's got a problem because
you've left out something really
fundamental you're still one hand behind
the back you can't get there you still
need proof by contradiction that was the
hardest one to figure out how did that
in because ordinarily you'd think that
contradiction would immediately lead to
a blow up but it turns out the clever
folk working deep into the night can
even put in proof by contradiction and
the trick there is that implication P
implies Q is much stronger than P infers
Q highly technical distinction but there
are papers that you can read that
explain this and you can keep proof by
contradiction for implication even
though you can't keep it for inference
so you can actually succeed in in in
revising Euclid and having something
that's a that's quite useful quite
usable so we wrote a book about it
500 pages and it's just going to press
this weekend and it's edited by myself
and John woods assisted by a very able
editor Jane spur at college publication
she's very very good but as always
there's always a fly in every ornament
why is that so we were were publishing
this stuff on archive but they are
librarians and their initial thing is is
physics and in physics right you publish
a paper and then you're done with it
whereas we software engineers are into
revisions
and so right now we have a problem that
we have electronic versions on archive
of these articles that I've written
because College publications is very
nice they let the office keep the the
copyright to the articles but the
problem is that archive ok has become
annoyed because we published too many
versions of the articles so we need help
now in getting in the version that we
really want in which is the published
version which will be version n plus one
but right now they're annoyed at us so
we'll see if we can get them to do that
but the only reason I mentioned it now
is to mention to you that there on the
versions on our archive today they are
not the published versions and they have
bugs and right now temporarily we're
unable to fix the bugs but we hope to
fix that ok so we're setting up the
standard organization called standard
IOT so creatively named right and its
purpose is to promote cyber localism
using islets and to unify the existing
standards by the consortium and the
corporate de facto standards ok using
the actor model that's what we're up to
and what I'd like to do today for those
of you who are interested we can go off
to the corner get a table by yourself
and have something called a birds of a
feather I don't know whether airline I
kind of mentioned it this morning birds
of a feather is something that that
Erlang is kind of into it I think a
little bit so grab lunch find our table
and everybody is welcome questions
I will I will repeat the questions yes
questions and now we can go back to
previous slides yes yes okay that that's
true that's a very good question is what
is this logic that's inconsistency
robust
its official name is direct logic and
it's stronger than Parra consistent
logic para consistent logic which was
actually invented by a very famous
logician that you've never heard of
called his name is okay can I remember
his name Stanislaw just Kowski a pole
and then it was named it was then later
named para consistent logic they took as
their criteria that if you have
inconsistent information you cannot
derive everything and that's too weak
that is far too weak for example
intuitionistic logic okay it you can't
derive everything but you can derive the
negation of everything so technically
it's not para consistent but it's not
inconsistency robust so in answer your
question what is this logic it's called
direct logic right and their papers
actually the version that those versions
of the paper on archive the ones on
direct logic are not seriously obsolete
the one that that's out there archive
that is obsolete is the one on this
programming language which I showed you
called actor script right and that that
paper really needs the published have
the published version out there because
because that's the kind of thing
programming language design as you guys
know is incredibly difficult and some of
the best people in the valley have
contributed to designing actor script
right and it's just now been finalized
for the published version but it went
through many iterations it's just
incredibly hard to design a programming
language that meets all the requirements
of the actor model those are severe
requirements for example
I'll show you a bit of that because we
still had a little just do a couple
minutes here so here's here's an example
so let's talk about actors so here
here's a little bit of actor script
here's an account an account says well
we got three con three messages get
balanced deposit and withdraw so it's
the purple is for the messages and green
is for the is for the types and here's
an example example of the operation you
send in a get balanced message and it
returns my balance you send in a deposit
and an amount it updates my balance :
equal my balance plus amount and returns
void and accounts a little more
interesting you can do is draw so the
two cases either the amount is greater
than my balance in which case you throw
an exception withdrawn or it's not the
case in the my amounts greater than my
balance in which case you update my
balance by decorating the amount so
that's how these things operate but it
gets more interesting let's start into
something more interesting called the
readers writers problem but many of you
have probably heard of the readers
writers problem and the readers writers
problem is you've got some kind of
database out there and you have two
kinds of messages read messages and
write messages but the deal is arbitrary
many readers can be in the database at a
time without interference but only one
writer okay and our job now is to write
a scheduler for this database that
transparently schedules the reads and
the rights and for that we need Swiss
cheese Swiss cheese has holes in it
because don't you know when a read comes
when a read read message comes in read a
query right you may need to wait in a
queue for the writer to come out so you
have a hole in the cheese for the queue
and that's the readers queue here when
you come in when you go through the
reader secure when you come out
you update your scheduling variable
number reading becomes number readings
plus one and now you've got to give up
control of the critical section again
right there you got to give up control
of the mutual exclusion so you go into
another hole where you do the resource
dot read with the query and then when
you come out of that hole you Decorah
get decrement the number of a reader
number reading becomes number reading
minus one and you exit and you do a very
similar thing here for the for the
writers and so this is mutual exclusion
with holes in it and it's issues like
that that make the design of actor
script quote interesting end quote
because you need linguistic support for
doing these kinds of things because you
still have the requirement of absolute
efficiency as the bottom line it month
must not be possible to write a in
machine language that runs faster you
can't impose any overhead what so ever
so sorry for such a long answer to that
question and next question
yes yes right that's a very good
question let me repeat the question the
question is well how are eyelets
different from the current aggregators
like hotel comm or travel velocity or
all those guys out there the main
difference is the way it works with your
eyelet your eyelet is the one that's in
charge of your attention and your
schedule and knows what you're doing it
has all your sensitive information which
you don't want to give to travel
velocity and who knows who else right so
it so it can it can make a better
decision right and it's the one that
actually takes in the offers and doesn't
use popups or whatever you don't have to
go and visit travel velocity if probable
velocity wants to submit as an agent
wants to submit some offers to your
eyelid your eyelet variant says thank
you very much we'll take them under
consideration so it's it's having this
this this intermediary who works for you
the eyelet okay that will present the
the the the offers to you under your own
conditions and when you're actually
thinking about traveling and without you
having to wander out to know which
particular you know is Travelocity
offering better deals than you know
then fly-by-night com these days or we
don't know so it's it's imposing that
intermediary there that I think is the
key difference and is the value-added
proposition for the eyelet is to try to
make a better life you can see the
airlines what are the airlines think of
travel velocity right they don't what
you going to travel velocity they prefer
to deal directly with you so it's you're
trying to make a better experience for
the merchants and for the consumers to
the benefit of both
thank you very good question question
yep very good question the questions how
are eyelets actually actually
implemented and we were thinking the
same way the questioner was maybe you
have to go buy a box we say it the way
that's a huge speed bump to go over I'm
gonna persuade I don't think so
so our current thinking is that the
eyelets will have distributed
implementation in the phones in the
refrigerators in the TVs in the homes in
the in the home heating system right I
actually have a distributed
implementation and that's what we're
working on and that way you know the
boxes can come and go and but of course
you know and then if you don't have a
really good system for inconsistency
robustness you are proverbial dot dot
dot it's a very good question thank you
ok so now the these these hold from the
chains are quite interesting because of
the requirement for absolute efficiency
and what that means is that when a
reader is actually queued
you got a reader queued the only way
it's ever gonna get out of that queue is
somebody who is leaving the cheese says
you're next and allows you out so it's
not like one of these conditional
testing things with condition variables
that have to be tested and retested and
retested because that would be that
would impose an efficiency barrier
and there is a fair amount of
indeterminacy here because you see
you've got guys her reader who's who are
coming out of the database and a writer
who's coming out of the database come in
asynchronously with new read and recent
and write requests from the outside
world so you have to deal with all of
that efficiently and that's the job of
the the programming language implement
next question yes that is a very good
question and ideally of course it would
it won't have an open source an open
source implementation but it can be a
competitive you know well none of the
other thing we can rely on is
competition among amongst various
vendors but I ideally I would like to
see the annihilate implementation at
least one and the other proprietary
other companies are perfectly welcome to
make proprietary ones because I think
that the great political and social
question week 8 we face is creating this
the cyber localism because otherwise all
our civil liberties are going to
disappear so you don't want to
discourage proprietary companies from
doing it but ideally there will be a
none and then one of the purposes of
standard IOT is to create an open-source
implementation so that people can look
at and and and an increasingly software
is going that way anyway I mean even big
companies which used to be very
proprietary and once said that we
open-source guys were communists has
come around to our way of thinking a
little bit at least they can
increasingly right so but I i cretin
completely agree we need an open-source
implementation
question okay that's a very good
question the question is how far along
is standard IOT right well okay so so we
got a couple trademarks and just so that
we have some place to stand which is
what you have to do in this country I'm
starting to talk to the big foundations
the big open source foundations about
making it an affiliate of them we have
the book out now which provides a very
good theoretical and engineering
foundation for what needs to be done and
now we're looking for recruits just to
see who can do that and that's that's
the process that were engaged in thank
you
let's take somebody back back here first
yes
no the security eyelets is going to be
paramotoring but there's some very good
research that's been done now so that we
now we now know how to make very secure
endpoints we're gonna be able to make
very secure endpoints and the way that
you make secure endpoints since the
software systems are too complicated to
ever be made totally secure we need
Hardware assist and there are two very
important developments in hardware
that's going to assist us one is RAM
encryption and what that means is you
encrypt all the traffic between the
processor package and the RAM this means
that an operating system will no longer
be able to read the memory of an app and
one app cannot be read the memory of
another app and that is guaranteed by
some very simple hardware and this is
even going into some companies products
like Intel now to do that the next thing
you do is you use every word tagged
memory architecture and what every word
tag architectures do and an endless
machine did this is it means you cannot
Forge a pointer and you can never point
into the middle of an actor and you
can't point into their inside you can
only thing you can do it enforces the
only thing you can do it an actor is
scented a message and this is part this
is protection within a process so they
all the actors in a process of which
there can be billions are all Hardware
protected from one another and can only
affect each other by sending messages so
if you make those two changes you can
dramatically improve the security of our
systems and the security of our
endpoints and the security of the of the
eyelets so that's the answer and so I
think the security forces realize that
that that's going to happen and that's
why they're demanding the mandatory
backdoors
question we in the back
yeah well eyelets ideally eyelets like
all security should be completely
invisible then unless you're trying to
do something totally stupid right you
will never see it that all the natural
kinds of things have just got to happen
naturally for example if you want to
send an email to Fred then you just do
it just like you didn't compose the
email to Fred it looks up Fred's public
key in your contacts and automatically
encrypts it ships it to Fred Fred
automatically decrypt it and when he
sends the message back he automatically
encrypted with your public key citizens
none the wiser right you have to make
two things you have to make it totally
invisible extremely secure and very
efficient because we can't we have to we
have to get to be just as efficient
basically if not more so than the
current legacy systems or we can't get
it to move forward there can't be any
noticeable slowdown and it can't be
visible and so basically the eyelets
basically when you get your eyelet right
you just do business naturally you you
have this coordination of your internet
of things in the natural kind of way
right and it's it's it's it's up to us
to do that job we can't have turning
these people into computer managers like
at home my and my partner we both have
PhDs in computer science right we do
backups we debug hardware right we
install systems we install patches all
that's complete craziness we can't do
that than populist it has to happen
automatically
yeah the question is first of all as a
comment saying currently we live in a
dismal state of affairs who here we're
just not doing a good job for our for
our consumers we really aren't I mean
we're making it very hard we're too much
event too many of us think that they're
like us that because we can do it they
can do it first of all we can just
barely do it and second of all there's
no hope that why should they want to why
should they be concerned with doing
backups right or encrypting messages or
anything like that that is just complete
craziness we're just not doing our jobs
folks we got to step up our game yes
that's a good question the question is
will the appliance makers put in
backdoors right well the answer is if
they're forced to by law don't do it
that's why this the current proposal is
so dangerous second of all if you're
making room for a refrigerator right and
you have a backdoor in your product okay
the question is why was a security flaw
that got it in there the manufacturer
introduced it deliberately right they've
got a problem they've got a big problem
and in fact US manufacturers now have
this huge problem with backdoors because
now the foreign buyers don't trust the
US manufacturers particularly for the
Internet of Things how is the United
States going to have any exports at all
if they don't trust us and the problem
there is that everybody knows that the
US government's have ways to coerce US
companies even out we even without the
new legislation so I think what we're
gonna DAP to do and this is already
happening where Apple has agreed to be
audited in China by the Chinese against
backdoors they've agreed to be audited
so you know it looks like everybody is
going to have to be audited against
backdoors because even if we go to this
regime where every country has its own
mandated backdoors the Chinese don't
want to have products that have NSA
backdoors in them so they still have to
be audited so I think we're gonna see
auditing I mean we had this guy this
happened in finance over a long period
of time we have all these embezzlements
and chicanery and faking the books and
right and we finally went to a business
where a public company has to have a
public auditor that actually looks at
the books right and the corporate
officers have to sign on the dotted line
that they're liable for any fraud that
they're personally signing personally
then no corporate shield they are
personally signing for the for the for
the public statements
I think that we're gonna have to move to
the same kind of regime or the respect
to the back doors the cybersecurity it's
just as important
right so that's the question right how
is it going to be possible to do this
oddity right well you can look at the
financial thing do they do the auditors
look at it at all those billions of
transactions no the auditors when
they're auditing a company they're it
must as much about auditing the people
as they are about auditing the
individual transactions they're auditing
the process and the auditors aren't
completely dumb they know standard ways
that you can be fraudulent and so the
same thing will happen as in the
development of cyber auditing is that
you'll be auditing the people as much as
you are auditing and you'll require the
the the the companies to have certain
processes in place to maintain the
integrity of their supply line for their
products just as in the case of Finance
there's a certain process that you have
to go through to maintain the integrity
of your books so it's it's it's gonna be
a slow rollout it's gonna take time
but I think you know over the course of
the next ten years that's where we're
going it's not gonna be easy so but
that's it so last question thank you
