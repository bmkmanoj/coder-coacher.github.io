introduction Jerry but perhaps you could
just introduce your son Joe I'm Joann
Barracuda airline programmer number one
- my fins we're curious to hear about
what's been exciting UAV in the
languages well I'm working with samaram
and the Masonic payaso program in Ruby
it's a it's their live performing music
and it's the teaching kids program
things are going to be playing some some
Beethoven and some bargainer and some
Adele and kind of oh well it's a very
looking and looking at the musical
structure seeing how we can decide them
for 30 days a lot of really tough
problems there is going to say that I
mean describing moving is like I worked
in telecom Shinobi figures making
telecom systems music far more difficult
and very arm unit is really cool really
cool and the ways composers have free
writing is of hauling Lea back if I can
make some progress in ten years I'll be
overjoyed respect so they could do one
good bit of music in ten years
it'd be worth it yeah major I mean I
don't think you like how if you could if
somebody said to you if you spend the
next 20 years of your life to do
something like a Michelangelo painting
would it be worth it of course it would
be a review is big nerd the rest of the
most we had a million people it'll be
worth it just for that one thing you
know for things to be worthwhile they
should they should be difficult I think
people want to hear about airline and
everything I don't want to talk about it
particularly talk about music and do
stuff ready to do that's what I'll be
doing whether they like it or not so Sam

airline scheduler in an and Sam's got
the respect a foundation to bundle our

raspbian oh you're kidding oh my god I'm
not kidding are they in there which is
really good bye you didn't tell anybody

really cool so he's running around mean
he's got I don't know hundreds of
thousands of people downloaded on acai
and refused loads of school kids order a
artistic yeah and fam does this live
coding stuff producing music with
computer programs which are changing at
us as they execute and as a new art form
that's a new musical art form that
hadn't existed before so he's like
Mozart or partner or something he's
inventing a new art for many probably
one of the best people in the world of
