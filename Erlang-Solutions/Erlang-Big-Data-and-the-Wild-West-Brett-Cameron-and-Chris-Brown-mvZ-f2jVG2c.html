announcement that we're mostly pulling
the choir on that platform so there we
go so as I say as far as today's sport
coat or whatever the exhausted local too
much now neither grid and Greg a
Christian seem like a really good idea
so talk as I say about how we became
involved in first place the role of big
data and the role that it has to play
and they're all really miss playing with
respective big data and so but first up
I want to do is talk a little bit about
as I say how we can involved with 11
this place and work I've been causing it
and some of the challenges you face
doing their their legs depreciable code
base it's well written code the falling
into a and platforms presence in Andrews
each other so what significantly sto who
remembers all these funny dates and
times so courses now tell us what
modification is the fourth loading the
2008 I'm any good view sorry Chris and
keep you to you our they I'm sorry i'll
stay close for microphone now so it's
the same Stephen Lewis thinks they're
under proper you know you
for these things you know what money he
was making partner musketeer interest
and ranked third or fourth of ember 2008
well what happened was Obama was elected
that was one thing the other thing is
that Chris and I were on assignment we
were we were in a little town for folsom
in California which is about 40 minutes
drive from Sacramento and we decided
that we would save companies the money
Kristina rental car but we discovered
that it costs like about two dollars or
something to eat on the light rail and
go into Sacramento false about a
40-minute train ride who will you oh is
that Beatrice a week we can hear you
fine can you hear me Chris now come now
don't think only you in right okay well
we we can we can hear you fine so our
hockey talking and and hopefully
everything will come right well oh but
anyway so we decided that this
particular evening that we would say
that piece of money and we would take
the light rail into Sacramento and we
went to the old part of sacramento and
have a lovely dinner I
have seen that was thinking just sits
there and water and floats like carol
singers do and press enter a tuna steak
and salmon table and I think we've
actually Christmas dropped out but
hopefully you'll come back yeah yeah I
was a good champion Kingdom Johnson ok
but we'll little without pictured
foramina that might work near but can
you hear me dress anyway I'll keep
talking and hopefully they will sort out
there all right anyway socal very short
so we got second me know everything's
fine then you had you know we had been a
lovely Neil the air on this battle
steamer that just the subsea vlogs up
there water of the river and I suppose
was about dusk and we decided that you
know we've been hit back he back to
hotel in folsom and we warmed it up to
where the train pound from there do
these individuals still standing around
and this individual came up to us
instead of trying to focus train tickets
for a higher price than what you would
actually get my lunch in fall that's
alright that's fine within vibrating
really maybe you point out he would you
be alone yes so not necessarily require
just of sales people there anyway so we
got we got all the light rail and that
was fine then we notice these
individuals exchanging these packages of
strange white substances with one
another things like that and they seem
very sort of self-confident and they
were
world and everything was going to be
well good and Chris and I sort of set
the alarm Ian silence for about 40
minutes wondering when these people were
going off the train no we're looking out
the window we look at each other we're
just not making eye contact with theme
because it really did not seem safe
eventually we got to a point of relative
safety and well actually we got the
Engel of a lot made the train stopped
before it got back to where we wanted to
go so we didn't any choice we just had
get off at that point and we thought
what are we going to do remember nowhere
was Friday knife fighting like literally
in the middle of nowhere of the United
States the only thing around is like
some of the store told petrol and
various other things and groceries and
so forth that was about a shock we call
a taxi taxi never arrived didn't know
what to do we discovered there was
another train anyway what we were
standing around and so for this puzzle
sorry quickly people young and call the
donkey but we were looking around at
home we were sending around for about an
hour their phones were running down with
about zero on battery because we hadn't
taken a lot of the attachment for we get
out and what we were standing there on a
spoiler the good old boys driving around
like Chris will tell you he's convinced
that they had no shotguns on the back of
their around their flags and they seemed
quite intrigued by us standing here on
this planet so we wouldn't feel terribly
safe in the middle of
the usl all this nonsense going on
within came to realization that we get
another train even though we didn't ever
take it before they try to attract black
recaptures realization another train the
hotel so we can set their way before and
we've noticed off in the distance there
was a strange individual walking around
where it's incredibly bright orange
being banner nothing on earth leader
anyway he will note on sat down beside
us and started rolling up a joint and
offer the joint to us that's that's fine
thank you very much we'll go south let's
check wreath of Cologne anyway anything
started explained to us that in this
particular hotel your pile of girls
always about 18 I've just got a new one
today that they call Pamela Emma ransom
this guy doesn't know then what are we
gonna do now so we've had the good old
boys we've had the drug dealers forgot
he was very friendly as you expect them
to be that's fine as in focus to go over
this so we go I anything was really
quite confident even get some business
out of us we just wanted to get back to
the hotel but anyway he can help us to
some degree we got to the summer hotel
somewhere
finally pulls cakes and he got back to
the late tiger who say fuel and have
been a bit of a long day so Krista
license at the errand so talking and
this is the next few slides I'm covering
for more detail press but the net result
of our drunken conversation was that we
started getting there late I mean really
gory details that you'd like to
embellish a form which Forrester the
evenings of means go now what I said by
memories coming over lunch because the
guys yes he had guns the people on the
train kept how knives and the guy and
Jack are not fat Danny are gone stood on
that I could be exaggerating ever than
nothing ever just to me I love to see a
couple fingers missing forum eat it yeah
and then the the week behind kinda Billy
dinner at America so in Canada gonzo by
the time we got dr. Paulson would spread
by the names awesome jail birthday cash
about Davis sir and closet so my time I
got a stillbirth be punished I remember
ideas out there still even develop ring
and then
that time that's exactly what one I will
see the breaking news an album for some
reason decided by photographer better
talk about technology which should have
sound refining when we were married and
I was the director of strategy so itself
is really in my mind what can I do is
make the platform more attracted to
people and we recently just ran out of a
lula which kind of goes in conversation
and brandy one table that one yes I know
these slides are trying their car video
so Chris and I were sitting there
drinking in Christmas drinkin beer I'll
be filling wisely dogs drink wine and
hand and we were sort of philosophizing
what can we do here as Christie's to
improve you convenience but one of the
things we wanted to do was to get a MTB
implementation last message between
protocol implementation up and running
high over the bees I would previously
looked at porting over mu which was
developed by our lab so he put me know
Peter entrance from 0 and Q faith for
example so Peter and the suspect had
created opening you the first day of the
implementation and I imported that to
our openvms operating system platform
but for various reasons that probably
then you can tell you or I probably
properly divulge over a few more beers
Peter Dianetics pulled out of the amqp
working group and that left us in a bit
of a bind because you know we've pulled
it open and view the eastern thought or
you know engineering and support there
this is all well good and that would be
really interesting to our own penis
financial services customers we have we
had a problem we didn't have open
there was no support for so I was
telling Chris Chris had read a little
bit about early I was time for us about
this thing I was going to call rabbitmq
which was another in the implementation
and Chris essentially as you do I had a
few beers for my case wines Chris
basically deadly deport the length of
own convenience it's like if I could do
this then that would mean we could run
rabbit it would mean we could probably
run other any applications which
christina regular strategies learning
for the Emmys platform thought this was
you know pretty good idea this would
give us lots of cool stuff on platform
and be of interest to customers so you
know the last point on the slide been a
few wines how hard could it be well
early if you look at them and you look
at the associated components go around
the core pieces of billing software
comprises about 400,000 onesie curtsy
curtsy files like Peter files things
like that the ocean people i agrees
themselves are about 2 million lines of
code now when thankfully OTP of courses
is early so that's essentially portable
but what i should point out there is if
you actually go and look 0tp there are
places in that cobra it actually checks
for platforms running on their branches
depending on what the platform is so you
know it's an appreciable code base and
it's not like business logic code this
is quite challenging code to deal with
it does lots of system ii call stuff and
fancy things but you know undaunted i
pored over name Q and other open source
software to be any stuff how hard can it
be well open be nice if anyone hears
familiar with it is not at all unix-like
not at all it's totally proprietary
operating system i think they spear to
say Crescent Ramesh I oh yeah and what I
would say though is it
Philistine standards-compliant c
compiler see your own time I agree so
and so forth so theory what I was trying
to do should be possible I've included a
little photo here which unfortunately
Chris taxi rank videos are coming
through me on holiday in New Yorker
working on the port me with Mia yes when
you've got to you've got pepper key
ingredients here left half beer I'm not
sure who took that photo but needless to
say wasn't popularly working on software
demo anyway so the bottom line is I
achieved it it took a reasonable amount
of time but some of the key things that
you sort of face that I won't have to
say is the early encode nice to see code
so forth actually really portable you
guys have done a nice job writing it but
there are a lot of preprocessor
directives in me I mean it's important
to a lot of you that forms there are
several differences between those
platforms as far as the in East Coast
the sorts of things I had to watch out
for a few familiar with you next unit
walk function VMI's has never had it
will never have a unix-like fork
function so you can't just go sort of
you know do a fork in TX equal tambien
es it does not work thankfully there
weren't too many of those and it's
possible to substitute and be forking
taken the only problem is donated to
kind of end up with more processes lying
around it's not not not saying other
sorts of things I'm just going to go
through some of these
but fraternal of Venus they're just
silly little things like William in
you're dealing with sockets blocking and
non working on most units both forms you
can use the EF cntl system call on being
nice you can't do that poland saline
companies only work on sockets they
don't look at other types of file
descriptors so basically in total i
found i went through a little bit of
achieving the other day before preparing
the slide i had to make that changes in
91 areas at the c code for that code to
the ennis to run ln so this is sexy a
reasonable amount of work most of those
changes i would say were relatively
minor but kind of identifying them when
they figured out what we need to do to
take some time so sort of sit here took
several weeks on and off that's probably
several weeks of my effort but probably
over several acts months i do before
actually having a major breakthrough
whilst drinking a can of fosters what i
found now of course is having done at
once it's kind of quite easy so in a few
weeks ago diddling 16a across the be
nice in a matter of a few hours because
i just replicated the changes I made on
the original fork which was 430 may also
the note their little bit for the remedy
you guys a while back to do quick duty
for the length i 0 X and we've got a
team with an HP routine
in Cuba hp-ux itanium and everyone so
I'm also important across two hp-ux
itanium for them probably the biggest
challenge with all these ports is
actually not getting something going but
it's dealing with things like mustard
down by here one of the nasty ones is
supply kissing p support because that's
quite processor specific and you've
quite quite often find yourself missing
with some machine code and philly
exotic-looking bits and pieces as far as
the viennese port goes it's all pretty
much fine and dandy but as I say you
know unfortunately we're retiring
platform so you can add new us it's kind
of not going to go in further wasted
effort but as I say it was a fairly
useful learning exercise what I've got
mill events like though is is one of the
things that I did to make my life as
easy as possible as far as the sports
concerned as far as the label the amis
is concerned it thinks that deviance is
just another variant so if you something
like a race column type it's going to
come back with unions car open be nice
that mean that reduced hugely in our
code changes I had to make to the only
code itself but there were some sort of
changes to the OTP code you just
couldn't avoid so for example if you
look here so this would be the farm they
probably Oh
you know so if you wanted to run an
operating system commando is colton
command string what Papa commanders and
so forth I needed to implement you know
quite a new chunk of code and centrally
for penis and I needed to write you know
a little piece of C code or whatever to
actually perform the command of VSM pipe
were dating back through early but for
the most part was there are too many
lines of OT code number of changes their
fear in the eyes and I was quickly go
through this and in Christian can do
this but they've done all about but as I
say the whole whole object of the
exercise here is to trying it really
cute and a cube the implementation
working on VMS the slides a bit blurry
but basically what this is is a dcl
which is like scripting language of the
evenings it's like shell script us both
the startup script of rabbit lots of
command line arguments that as in a
program is you'll recognize the annoying
thing is obvious because it's not really
it's kind of funny about case it's a
little bit k sensitivity a lot of the
stuff ends up being a double quotes so
looks like a horrible pilots beginning
that the magical thing is it actually
works a godless not thing in here
defining what's called a logical name a
little blow-up out beside this is you
don't really want to know what this is
for the sea runtime library on vegan is
not elect threadsafe at times so
including that little command in here
actually tells the beginning c runtime
library to be three safe which kind of
stuffs a lot of things breaking when you
actually say run up something like Revit
into this is where I least before I
can't do
sequences able to do be four so this
process down here which is gravity in
camera sees is actually you know it's
it's it's not being running rabbit being
runnin rebels is the subprocess I can't
just kind of you know start up with
other process if that might disappear
into oblivion does it doesn't work these
other two processes would be right the I
need get host or whatever it is
processes and so forth and then it will
work as well and we can I don't know we
can do probably around if you look at
rabbit performances maybe they're half
of what I've been on a comparable Linux
system a lot of there is as I say hey
Mia but he simply support and also ahead
put in place and special functions to do
things like Poland select around holding
on sockets be able to Colonel palm and
things like that so it's a bit slow but
it runs a trance pretty well also going
to support most react which was the
biggest jump really was not pulling the
early they say actually dealing with
things like we will be B which is
written in C but cows again written and
see actually porting those components
but was amazed chances over here okay so
Chris with anything else you know you
can't see here well I can see what's
importantly reporting that's not what
you'll see okay well we'll just have to
do this
Michael first slide which is the thigh
two liquids on that's the way good soul
of estate ok so I'm such as kind of star
value what I'm reading 10 just
introduced in there from the EMF so if
you say introduce think there is
probably something white chicks big data
anomalies all the past years always
being a lot of people dealt better but
actually most people commonly don't
really understand what what what it is
why are you talking about what's
involved and one of those who said we
won't give this message this is one of
your members declined to come and make
comments about something about I don't
wanna come see bargaining try something
like that which I took improved with
phone rather spend winter what the
hell's going on you invent I did a
presentation too rich to be the Society
of in Glasgow last week and send the
card commented there is a perception and
big data is evolving exercise and to a
certain degree is except that most
products at world have a lot of
marketing at Sur the IT products he got
more money than them on acid I know
Brett's involving cloud cover number ten
ten years ago so an actor's got Volkov
would it be out of all significantly
away from what original concept awesome
and most of those
marketing deploying Amazon Google and
Microsoft companion kind of change
people's perceptions so marketing is
there what we call you are not marketing
is there but underneath there is general
required the big data and analytics and
hopefully you can occur that idea by the
end today I southeast prep sho thang
grata what's problem what's the problem
so that's the problem this is lots of
data and I don't know I kind of workout
with all those numbers l so I'm in the
pedal bikes at the moment because we
just solar systems got a bad about it in
an acid versus numbers not adam said ass
good system in moment but not stored
digitally sir not hang glider is is
generating one petabyte a second and
thin enough mean I've never the old
ideas was talking about reimburse me and
today eggs goodnight folks on is named
after his neighborhood of the
conversation because entire going to
crater aims something over there earlier
and IBM again will examine both because
I think involve money joinha and if you
then not do that exercise what what gets
me Fred try to be told a local
university people risky enough can just
trying to be people and the world I need
one
but it will be told is what we will
involve the square under rain and the
square hunger is essentially what she
tells up much of them receivers no
telescopes involved in Australia's
alafaya career will you please work on
their own off and then their section of
the US as we see it and then get that
one by the end of the day I not just a
friend on commander is just unbelievable
now they complete all kinda the net only
generates from 1x1 data then just
described Scott tell supposed to do
cells just huge amount of data people
are we excited let us know what we're
going to do now not just happen because
we know what we're going to do with
these colouring and what we do those are
the data to generate by mobile borrows
by social networks just by all kinds of
thing and our site level of chosen
dryers of Lyonesse my device has been
created a people something only you can
edit and one of my goal is to speak to
people now big failure its own know
about the steady woke up I show a livid
how's the rolls-royce last week an ugly
and the aero engine people and they make
a lot of the collected data from their
engines and what tickle me was that the
scarves on semi with one of the worst
data on only on regular basis while the
place
one of the entrances hip is gonna be
problem and i said above it are absorber
one of us no really I plunder amount
sandwich bread and said a week ago one
you be my great things quite up in the
air but only problem the end we want you
to be able to tell me one of advanced
that is possibly got your problem I
don't you want to know we are going to
fix it out of my mom is coming transfer
me I said all that will be injustice so
we go all this daily not even thought
about building a predictive analytics
I'm and the happens so that's the kind
of conversations I get into I think a
lot of people that about Big Data
everyone knows about buses are in one
hand is aware of all muscles and then it
around more structure than structure one
new next time yeah okay what is it what
is it yes Natasha government out of them
so this is all the kind of scum out and
in the top right on I actually has how
to use this slide presentation PDF so
when I mentioned upcoming about one of
the old colleagues it's at the top right
hand side with all due respect I'm
talking about your desk on marketing
trends like big data and many as I
understanding on an eye on despite one
said I it's comin over and more
technically minded Basquiat alone
cooking their own bargaining is part of
our way of life our nation and special
item is ample parking and probably
willing to admit and what does he s
theresa j
is actually something solid in the
mutinies be discussed and these are the
kind of comments about it then I got no
idea what we then asked jump shot yet
it's a pony keg from South Africa
Australia but no ID on the motivation to
find out that's one yep like that came
from using yes so just to come down with
the size that one marketing this this
was studying a bigger bomb and it's not
a huge study in the numbers of companies
the good people of very significant
coming to those kind of God BTW a
well-known be an expert on I've heard of
it also livid you know it's a good
research company for research cash but
then go it no longer and what what got
me is that 67 scent of the people who
really big bed is marking I insane group
797 really big day is a new generation
database done with its technology so
this confusion you know yet a type who
think inside were all oh yeah it's also
database but actually be good mr. net
investment the users their base is a new
generation of losing then they sew
together stand of confusion and I'm
hoping my drama this world is to try and
take away the columns in the midst and
make some sense of this computer next
library
right so so if anyone doesn't know what
that stands for for instance these three
days of the common definition and it was
easy this definition was quite like the
lady who we should work the men who 2001
came out with this definition he cannot
establish because he was not saying that
the structure of Delhi was changed among
the living under their doors changing
speed and variety then change and all of
this camera because of social networks
so you have these three B's which are
the accepted standard definition I think
there's a rap about 60 fitness I think
Alice Trevor will sell bigger be you
know think the word that starts with
being that sticking out so rusty you
politically volume which are all very
valued on it attributes that they are
qualities that not defining qualities of
ended their operational bodies and we
all wish the deadly ours was online
pokies first one in velocity / idea our
defining qualities by be coming on that
is the volume about a dead when people
talk about new volumes not every
organization
one asking volumes so I'm saying as I
need all three knows that all needs to
be in big data environment it could have
a bright young people but Brian they're
quite you've got lasse not necessarily
huge volumes of that and that's I'm yep
so you got the heart eyes and I'm doing
that I was gonna call the high side of
the video based on regular occasions and
gave our God and what they are doing
well god it worked and in HD further
search bar owner people around the world
take notice of God that God is the lead
honest I don't care what anyone else
says so what they say people listen to
and if you notice them turn what they
say is the big day that's now just about
the peak of inflated expectations and
just about to go on to the trough of
disillusionment which I mean they're
wonderful terms at the K over there
though is that it's going to take father
content will take private area august
employment opportunity which is what
actually something becomes useful just
like the ground yeah conscious now the
top of this movement of aunt Greta just
about just to be a bit of a geographer
so I kind of disagree with that I don't
mean it's going to take part in 10 years
and it's probably gonna take to the
three mins and we're just when we
understand the customer now people are
selling take apart my sneezes are
working with organizations it big and
immediate start to take off this this
whole concept about growing
it is may be strong outram mother always
says all nearby stream yeah well you
know 20 would be would be on the right
hand side of the doctor let me do have
some pizzas under the dryer to make that
and I'm actually gets this time but from
the perspective when we buy structural
economic change that 10 20 years ago
this is Jackie breaks apart of that
paper the assets of the company under
coming nowadays is a little missus kind
of economy love them is not on the brick
smaller than these know the assets
righty so it's a lump all day are going
around prolly the brakes bottle of a lot
of assets and camisa harem of based on
them happy a leftover parts vocalization
talk about things like Ghana so I muscle
in the States versus to deal with a lot
of our health care
ization States comes idly cerner and
HIPAA regulations came average which men
really healthcare organizations instead
an addict a drug will buy understand are
keeping records on utterly everything
sold David just expanded in terms of how
much data store and immediately also
have a cam and then I'm involved with
them a company with doing the sky a
potential skying project and my scans
and other medical scanners they have
killed in Las computer so then he kept
all over the place so there's a lot of
commercial cannons own ethics to are
some methods are treasures 21 days such
as normal Damian credit and that takes
me home economics is just a ton more
deadly predators a radiant one or a
saying XY today across international
just huge this place two pockets of too
much 5 x.x place in a couple of days now
it's just huge massive den of eek
available but uninterested me that the
hardware and software to track she
tilted his head sugar is living at all
the storage will be going in on it costs
buttons now our great side my 70 were
bred on these days are great picture of
distance enough there things now be able
to the tutors and many notable digital
anyways and cost thousands and thousands
of pounds adding it compared to it was
dropping it by USB drive through to dot
the talismans was absolutely stunning
restore ballad and software learn the
software 92 actually store analyze there
is also some wahoo is the well-known not
a little bit of software as well so they
are the tools to do do anything with
this data are you an altar to them and
sometimes none of your resources the
supply my teeth will coming out of India
and China right now more than risking
our value and unless and you will notice
if you have I got along big their forums
and then important and i would say 97
the people who are active on these
forums are educated and working in here
the walnuts you would go there is that
all of the work density in Western
Hemisphere and all resources or at least
answer in our common area and that there
is there's a lot of people coming on the
market there's long enjoy to create
these kind of IT seconds well
not sound asleep not driving some down
as well and then we get there's a
protocol so the developing people like
ourselves of your Nana the also skins
driving venoth so yes there is not
behind the actions of the earth the gun
came from another's even now he is
driving and driving Benden and then we
start against as situations where he
would help stop two couple new faces and
how we use Millie under the stream see
as I mentioned before people get
scratched at seven oaks then what we do
uh now come down the new spaces use
cases now user engagement we want you to
bring out regularly device over the
internal so this many times mom brings
out a new cloud our Volvo man myself
it's just for dead in general is just
incredible amounts of data and then the
expanding our medical system which is
called sleep in the oven sauce that
that's involved medals of projects life
and then a seat one with a life in the
men and the way I'm powerful linux but
they'll see what like Olivia's go away
from it all and we're taking off so far
we're happy was becoming synonymous with
being there and actually going to get
undercover site say what nice house in
the case don't eat blue probably then
gun it is what's considerably standing
it's not absolutely necessary so nice
i'm ok kappa i remember there's a nice
little cartoon to open it with mobile
market right
they'd end up in the same sentence again
started what graphics is in I'm going to
be dellwood and then photos because
we're gonna make a times with VMs
premieres and grab those B&amp;amp;S and other
day on your announcement and BMS and
when we talk we talk about disaster
talks tough dog collars and they were
quite arrogant because we'd better start
people who serve me then in sustems no
can tell us anything about mountains and
fault-tolerance consistency government
assassin comment so i have a kind of
growth over this so the common person to
my fault tolerant very strong toxic
waste by replication and distribution
that this is something about the Menace
are talking person because most of the
servers any gun violence are also no
sound it's a particular in the Sultana
you could lose it the one explosion on
151 I don't nation on people because
that would be nice at all that's what
means those Chinese fine p sorry you're
a believer Satan does just understand
what you're looking at that I far away
on the third book sense scream yep right
so one thing I wanted to find an example
of of wherever I was used in a
can't be there in violence and now
there's no anyone got setting up a spell
ourselves and I think that's because
it's a bit a dolphin be people see how
you must be the answer to everything
when it isn't necessary so I did come
around and I'll show you guys what know
that it could across this example alan
 all over sense is in the u.s. in
California whether they do this they
want Patrick's above us and they are
read the wrong turn we can find a clue
time there as well so everything
real-time data and they did the dogs
howl environment and as I'm think I
don't know why didn't run thankfully
they want to do the wrong thing they
were lovers there in California but I
know an exclusive people in so the value
nails and do you know what they want to
pursue my masters as a nice job not been
here culture in California suspect i
just want to do their own petrol
intercept or maybe use existing
infrastructure and expand on them away
they excite inside too sometimes the
problem that they are t know they 12
they won't have an Oakland a government
requests they have a father
Robin join all these things and they
didn't want to spend a huge portion on
service or one of the drawbacks the
puddle is it does dictating the new
buffalo or servers and probably need to
build number of is really not matter
which is Microsoft's cloud environment
and then comment of an intuitive
emmaandemma days and they'll might come
up what they did communication between
the nodes of the living looking for
aesthetic transported in superb form
from the font or environment dashing
theater they prevail against except kind
of a comment and sound ramen or anything
else it was already there if you've got
the next slide which is the architecture
side it shows how the news yeah I'll be
like if you comment on on the back seat
project later on Chris but I will need
to jump in oh yeah I'll even tell me but
I mean I think it's good example where
we reinforce quite nicely in this space
in terms you've mentioned fault
tolerance for believe in terms of the
concurrency and the ability to sort of
basically cluster things together you
know you talk about in more tolerance in
their customers out there running
80 or 90 yards you know the 40th
birthday that blew up a puff of smoke
probably not going to lose data thanks
much going around Aleppo necessarily
this is kind of an account situation and
these are the sorts of things that you
know the audience here we are doing just
provides out a lot so it's kind of
logical in terms of what the vaccines
guys did image yeah I'm not quite like
the architect of the information twisty
it wonder how she does the job what in
the is you can't go obviously would
be grateful to none yet I near want me
to tell not what me it's it's it's a
part of we we push I'm here comes a
nanny cam other person I on the inside
cosi you makin out nettles on deck
maximum velocity great whatever I was a
more open conversation and where there
isn't some of our young people much
older adults take in all desis era nino
are complex because how do you promote
very good it's actually attached a big
there there is a very generic title
search and it's it's not necessarily
scalable in the way to the water users
in breeding a lot stuff in an email of
servers and all kinds of stuff at least
skipper Lauren it really is focused
quite often on what you want to do so
roll your own sushi which this one is in
many cases is going to be the better
suit it's got me more focused it's going
faster it's going to be something that
you understand it's not necessary
how the kind of generic environment and
how it gives you so I think the wii
group relatively simplistic example of
what you can do with the right products
in the right space now same although he
do you going goodness it's not just
young come and do this but yeah ladies
NT no sex in ok well yes no from
bleacher supplements cover the
conversations I've had with customers in
last week's where you know we talked to
casselberry get off work and be nice or
the sort of thing and obviously one of
the targets is try and leverage open
source yeah which-which you know these
guys are doing here and early normal
service or technology but basically we
were sort of got any compensation for
customs without developing software from
the ground up and overriding all the
code for the same although notice it's
more about you know finding the building
blocks and then sticking them together
right sorry sweetie yeah so that I won't
disagree without bread what I was saying
is that the Hollywood one which is is
mentioned Lana space comes with some old
building blocks and you could quite
hostage and enrolled early last burger
and a nod to suit your environment well
the same lightly you know with what guys
boxing's done here he tell me what out
they got out and if they blew together
symptoms of open source voting blocs and
pretty need active way yeah going down
to Georgia right move on to the next one
yeah just I'm swingle do a little dig
tunnels down
first examples in our people are we
talking to now I've kind of this is the
sales pitch I'm just going to talk about
some of the things we living in health
care of the company names out of it and
what the companies were working with
actually for do medical imaging MRI
scans actually Scott and all that kind
of stuff saintes guns and what they do
this is a league of ireland you can't
have the East devices opening on regular
basis once a year so happy then only
stands to use transit center dinner and
the guy who runs this country came to us
said we think of mighty good idea do
something in this data and because
there's no standardization UK a
conversation out of them and those
goblins and radiologists that he knows
you know my rice guns and he was saying
that for a particular process i canna
which one what we know having a look at
someone right wrist or something he
knows what particular radio still
wouldn't bend because no one does
exactly the same processor takes 10
minutes he says has no stab knives as
you learn this there's no level of
quality signal any on this so in other
they're the reasons there wasn't any
process in place where the NDA chest in
this particular areas and you've got to
achieve the separatists and he said this
is no standardization and i'm telling
them it's just not using the dead so
then they get almost any off which which
is pretty interesting when
and then we mean you know we might be
over and then the day was lost to go to
any good so he's what he want to do was
make some kind of standardization to the
UK eventually underway scans of them and
he said it this way we'll get a level of
quality across covered medical imaging
and also if we can cut down the Yuuzhan
certain things because you know some of
the bones that they use these scammers
are extremely expensive cost thousands
of pounds i said at the end we
particular scan end of the challenge we
know he needs to take dominant as admins
for use of the moment any doubt we can
cook down use it we can save money but
the bigger one from our perspective is
that we can take us fishing anybody
start getting kind of gets inside only
violent just throwing ideas are Roman
whether it dimension other vital
information but a medical information
and star Charlie gets insides out them
so we can start determine if this
particular areas were when said addition
to the seeds are more prevalent because
of animal with gamma racial survival
they were we
no the problem is with this density
normally I don't know we won poder de
gonna stick it up said we possibly do
some on Wellington's so that's quite an
interesting and project there x1 Fred
yep Gino yeah and then grab mentioned
before our get involved in lots of
things do with this pizza this is an
education university as an earlier
Senate protest research currently the
dark purple genome sequences which I
would to what fault i wrote a tariq
assad yummy our turbines they're not
every coming out of these things and the
kind of all they they they go like that
at all fingers that thought way
sometimes the professor who's leading
this this whole process and at the
moment he knows his car not today but
not only from his own researches that
they're also linked to other researchers
are particularly he meticulously in
China which has character sequences so
what he wants to try to find all this
all this you know research and again
start getting some insightful advantage
now then most questions are going to ask
yet you know what half esta muerto
but 20 possibly a new summer holidays
the gold it is young people but they
want it to be satellite abohar Nicholas
so they've got remarkable things going
on that you don't be naughty run I'm
going to be much of their own birthday
will be conservative and they're also
working on research and the commander
any medical diplomatically versions on
our animals Scotty homestead how do you
know she said people's don't be hard to
the dinner table then you get naughty
sharing their observance the chocolate
coming to an awesome again I
accommodation different types to the
underside onion it would perform a
heavenly an absentee it would be fun how
can we do something and some way gotta
warn diwali is fabulous and be bothered
so
Hey yep so yeah you my go d
bball objects which are we going above
all go pro football capable penny in the
pan cover them Gingka sit again because
the candy shop they did but then my
companions declared and after guided me
to equality and all we've got they've
got a lot of money open handles that
ball be gone wrong room to get me done
professionally now that we got laid
which again that knowledge of cuddling
on the dirt away so that labels are
played 40 tons God repeatable segments
we call me things all be grateful final
so they can think doubles you're down I
think I'm getting go with them and eat
the neighborhood the old Volvo they have
uh blue can run in he's not lying to
cover them but she'll be aware go get
involved with the program lovely exact
depth in sheer volume of air I think the
woman bomb plane and the environment and
the one I said I slices the fish I your
own lives would win not only when he
going to their use to realign the big
and colorful words and really looking
called the island and they're the
problem ever don't get my degree okay
thanks Chris excellent point yards for a
few slides to sort of finish off these
deep lacerations but you've already
talked about back seats
mosaic scenario there you know je crois
leave early for tolerance and currency
distribute distributed processing sounds
opals like you I found a few projects
I've got one out here on the screen
evoke the disco project I'm having
flashbacks to the late nineteen series
which I'd rather not be she's tuned
running through my head Donna Summer
they put sort of good stuff I go so yeah
well none of us even element that was my
favorite believe but there are some kind
of things that came out here but just
what you were talking one of the things
I sort of thought about it really it's
like the guys here today who you know
storm through their programmers who do a
lot of good stuff for language what
you're doing is a lot of incredibly
fascinating stuff there and I mean I
think the world's our oyster if you're
lying about that you've got the right
tools to do some pretty damn good stuff
in this space and there are a small
number of organizations back scenes the
Chris mentioned disco project I've got
here there's some kind of commonality
coming through in the case of backseats
they've got this in there and if you
look at the Disco project if you
familiar with react you know write
queries and we're in like JavaScript
work early the disco project which which
is basically a MapReduce environment a
sense of you right on your map produce
functions the things you want to do with
your data itself so forth you're writing
you know in pilot which probably is that
similar to demeaning developers that
writing something and early but it's a
solely in the mind and graphic from you
is one of you we de ontem right exactly
exactly so you know product technologies
like the disco project I've got here
like react and so forth that fully
support may produce in all its glory and
provide some sort of simplified manners
and third for developers python python
intrigued me as i say i work for HP
Cloud which is based on an open steak
and a lot of what goes on all the
orchestration some so forth an OpenStack
is all written in Python and chuckled
like my friend food inventions zero here
thank you I said I was talking figure
about this item here discussing hyphen
the basic of the cloud which kind of
news then I do enjoy some italianate to
our Python developers that we're going
to be plan but but the disco project is
a good example I think is
the data proteins that's using early and
some others have started to expand on
this and they don't talk to do in
factories and so on so forth i'm not
sure about dancing with big data for
disco infinity and through now i think i
need to draw a line and the analogy with
with disco because it just really makes
a color on me chris has already talked
about the bucks each project which i
think is another really good example of
weary limbs being used to the big dose
based in memory database and then doing
some cool stuff with their LSA using
something like this maciste Python
JavaScript in the case of reacting disco
further implementing your queries and so
forth some of the sorts of concepts
coming through some other interesting
ones I've found in let least like more
react of course which is a fine product
I selectors love it I've been sort of
telling me its virtues to customers
around around Europe's I've been trippin
around over the past two weeks I sort of
insane person in terms of like you know
be nice is known for its fault tolerance
and so on and so forth I think react as
easily in the same league if you want to
store a lot of data at a no sequel
database a very sophisticated keynoting
store something like real reactors just
about impossible right and I've done
more about a very bad alternative you
coming like age came together than home
exact
people around and you know we've talked
we've talked that it's a shame Academy
and talk to the guys really about the
NHS soft G of youngsters IM occasion
done yeah yeah which is a really nice
word for rare guys the bachelor guys
also uses rabbit which of course is
another area based application so it's
really good to see you know some monkey
named Chester almost in sort of like
basically non open source actually don't
something here which is a essentially
autopia open source based solution I'm
commentated only know we will yeah some
other ones I've got their company I
think they're basically journey but they
program gain our Linux developing here
probably fits into the big data you know
Christmas talk about those bees and so
forth in the case of what name analytics
are doing probably got more of the
velocity carry on going on and streaming
the air stirring and analytical engine
but faulty be of the adopting be is
actually implemented in Java
predominantly although kernel is written
C and it's probably more transaction
processing in this particular example
the big data but it's interesting here
you know leveraging the capabilities of
early in terms of concurrency and so
forth to achieve is a pretty fantastic
transaction rates and will they got here
the 77,000 TV years that's the Philly
spectacular number as I say maybe not so
much big data that as opposed to a tee
but oltp but interesting under this one
last thing I want to mention about Big
Data really is the Internet of Things
now Cisco CEO recently sort of the news
was sort of saying the internet of
things you know connecting your fridge
and other household appliances and just
about everything else in the internet
he's quotes quoted as saying that that's
a 19 trillion-dollar opportunity well
you know the next sort of number is kind
of silly and is probably not right but
in any context you know Internet of
Things as far as Ben that's like HP as
far as chris is concerned is very cisco
sincere it's a big business opportunity
gives me of things is going to happen
we're going to be more and more
connected it's not just that you were
directing of the screens and so and so
forth into back home anything else being
hooked into the entity and information
being staged in various forms it's all
going to come down a big data and I
agree with Chris totally about pagar
type curve I think things are going to
move the hell of a study and then what
our government or maybe suggested and
there's a lot of opportunity I believe
the languages such as early namespace
after you guys to make it happen in
summary and Chris can do a bit of a
summary here as well I mean this is sort
of Queens and some stuff that Chris's
said really I guess that big data is
really about extracting value from data
it's not necessarily about hammock babe
you've got this about extracting the
data from the value from their
day-to-day timely fashion you've got a
lot of information lying around the
place getting the most out of it okay
it's not about not about how much data
you've got early i think is very
powerful to all of the space we talked
about its tributed processing to talk
about currency so on so forth I had a
bit of a steal so the talk about owning
millions main platforms good
introduction for me to the airline
programming language it probably means
whether I like it or not I know more
than I can't think about about the
internals and Athens like being works
arguably that's useful for something or
other fascinating exercise and
absolutely wonderful spending time for
us talking about these sorts of things
photocopying the Chris made which
unfortunately couldn't see some toasters
this slides as well as it doesn't matter
how bad you know spleen which I think
was pretty bad back in my humor 2008
good things can happen with the addition
of a little alcohol company good friend
over you press to wrap up thank you and
one point of going
prep the Internet of Things nothing up
top CBC I will take all kinds of devices
being connected me to be connected now
this with the other by giving six so we
get more Ellen the whole thing we get is
the board editor and most of us of what
is community tow the biggest academy
opportunity there is forum for the lungs
and develop what is any guide my
sleeve t see any conception Holly movie
for their both solid copper beech
becomes so I think I do a thing like
this reassess would want to be everyone
look after the day basis for event
bracelet charm the catechol pain because
I do clean offer great future as well
once I am shocked to compare my god when
you walk out there anything so now now
from human when it collapses and
gardening and we're able to be there and
what
the only told you you are we going on me
there and share via handle food revenue
with you but you mean up hold one body
okay Lenny take a few questions in an
ultrasonic way between you and dinner
and a beer break money or oh yeah haha
so maybe we'll just keep it short of me
if anyone's got the questions Chris will
take them now and stephen from do a
wrap-up and we can wash off these going
to be you know Curtis different
questions if I'm looking that kind of
processing petabyte data stores I get
very nervous about being able to do that
or cluster with early in terms of my
experience or as hand in your data is
nowhere near what I see big clusters are
familiar okay I not reviewed Christian
Chris but yeah it's really about you
know if you want to embrace this
petabytes of data and you know such a
cluster using your leg to kind of do
that no I think if you look at solutions
like once we get up near the disco
project vaccines and even if you look at
things i create it's not entirely laying
this is what I come back to you before
about I only know about plugging players
regards to open source technologies in
all necessarily just going and grabbing
one
grabbing a part of the new blocks
blurring together and what early i think
is really good for us it's things like a
distributed processing currency felt are
things like that if you look at say
something like react and put intense
data storage the task they will DD these
are things of the rippln see social I
mean after I find a man yet and drop
down yet because I find their
communication right well you probably
need to talk to see in here about games
and consultancy services to to address
that common but you know I think the
boilermakers it's not you're not going
to have an undersea la situation from
top to bottom I mean you know in the
story is about a game of lying right
building blocks and glowing
any thoughts on their tablets both in
Jerusalem ocean what it is and i think
the Prairie Francesco were here come
back the mantra that is the right tool
for the right job but it does begin end
there and if you think right back to
it's sort of its invention it was it was
the control plane for telephone exchange
and there was a lot of other code
exactly looking off and I think that's
that is it sweet spot that's when it's
very good at it's very good at managing
and organizing but as you say there are
other components and other bits and
pieces that you have to blend it into i
think what you just have up with is
probably a very good argument for saying
wall put it forward to a ot Peter don't
put your message here the trouble is
they they still very much focused on
doing small systems to go in that's
effective HD in that vein thats their
sweet spot then I won't get it all
including all this space yeah this is
lender is employed i I don't know it may
be smilin artist was obsessed people
like Chris as well being out there
access like should invest in some
circles and I mean a lot of the cemetery
the ice is about joining the dots I
increase purse was talking about genome
Christmas doing their own feed from
Derrick virgin right and from
netherlands and garrett is taken early
retirement from HP has become like
essentially a DNA detective you know if
you're not sure is that just really my
father and garrett go and research it he
has a background in this face
theoretical chemistry biochemistry and
things like that but and he was
explaining to me they're all these sorts
of projects we I wouldn't say the public
domain away but but it kind of reminded
me what what's that project you know be
aware that search for extraterrestrial
life and you can fire up on your webcast
yeah safety that's right the kind of
sound of it like that where where
anybody can get involved in this stuff
Chris you know and a lot of it is about
joining the docs making sure the white
people are talking to each other and
you know if you so again the hybrid
solution approach I do that yes I smell
tired and then party right we are not
restricted to be writing very few notes
saver is that you are you're not alone
from expressing the desires and may not
the apartment there is a round one of
people trying to put more pressure on
Erickson to be work
manifestation this is the industrial I
musical which is the body that
Sunderland central which does include
both on it it also closed Florida I
think other amazing property AOL some
larger corporations you've got vested
interest in trying to write if you like
never Rises yeah probably not not
something you want to hear american i
think its last week or so invested in
something that we've been working on for
quite some time with a Latifah in the
parallel part of our many systems with
the university working as a plastic ITP
the Wallenberg development on that
across Republican Erickson and along
with others have come up with a second
funding of thinking is reality / to pour
some real clout 40 games it's a better
run hi there big bass there's a problem
to subject isn't
moment you're very constrained faster
it's due to chassis epic science Dustin
ok well let Chris down is there a way we
can chat over dinner later you should
have seen your mind no no no sorry got
another one not on the first night I'm
sorry thanks very much for the time for
us something is to be much appreciated
now my mother it would be kind of on ok
don t say i give them by then there's
another guy that you have some synergy
with massive system to massive a
computer systems they phased out of
Malta are actually Slovenian but they
did the controller software for Lamas or
something Moscow University
one time the largest in the world and he
had exactly the same problems you but he
stripped out the ttp communication from
the eggshell to avoid a lot of the
unnecessary messaging so the control
myself in a manner that was timely to
actually manage cause sister so if there
are people are going to do it but
dangerous you say my name is you end up
pretty much out on the lid so you've got
a lot of work firstly I left that being
said you know but community can
influence considerable challenge yeah
why only does he plan is the part of the
quest with every every six extend what's
the other going from Eric's they are
open committee you can write them and
tell them they go through sometimes
involve a list of all these are the
things that we want to put our priority
it is reasonably open but as I saying
you just your user is there to try and
force some static i will create a
separate branch that's in addition to
whatever X but you know what the saying
that the change classes mean iid drebin
bueller why should look at their money
back thanks to changes and see what we
do well thank ya but any other person's
neck sleeve they're going to be within
dynamics in hockey prospectus yes it is
but he wasn't scale well ok so nature
would be the distributed bills and a
face was in early how does that scale
well why else would be recently well but
I think it's kind of a salvar in
question if you look at safe products
like like really encircles that they
have a say in that room where they
looked at providing alternative back in
those stores and so forth so for example
my revin accuses in either for its
configuration data
that's right because when you create a
class the realm of anonymous American
replicated certain controls around there
and Everett 5s whether i will take it
two sorts of scales chris is talking
about no it's not that's issue i was
talking to somebody yesterday they said
exactly the same thing they've built
they've gone ahead and done pretty much
what you said bill ground control
mechanism using earlier but they said
their criticism or their problem with a
lot of time overcoming was if you then
make distributed in general terms they
mean cross continent distributed and
there was a split for some description
it took a very long time isn't very
complicated recovery yeah for exactly
that reason I'm sure what these are it's
not because never that'll be a critical
tell me true and as we were creating
you've got moles with a multitude and
their meanings come on two different
begins and while the memory option it is
basically using building components but
of course essential start talking and
everything your constraint is just as it
go I just like that really
because that's gonna drive your exact
some Soviet so even think which was
making those poor little TV is going to
be exactly up and looks like start your
game well it comes to me looks like this
very little pics are left unfortunately
how you'd like to thank you ever read
and risk the torch has been very
interesting it could ears and some
questions pack you overcome always
welcome whenever we all these events
some of war open and others I think it
was quite interesting to hear some sort
of otherworldly and external type tool
rather than people pressing ahead with
the manager that is the solution to
everything okay oh it's a practical
world as you say and if people use the
right thing for the right solution for
that to get a problem so probably what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
