the thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and
Babbage if you've taken computer history
101 these are probably familiar names to
you and sorry I sound nervous please
give me some rope because I don't do a
lot of public speaking and I tend to
shuffle my slides around and forget what
I've done with him so this is me I draw
comics on the side generally
professionally I'm an animated I started
as a hand-drawn type animator starting
with Aaron giant moved into digital and
i just finished on the jungle book
that's coming out this spring and i was
a very reluctant convert from hand-drawn
to computer animation I've generally
speaking resented and disliked computers
and didn't understand much about them
which makes it very strange for me to be
standing here in code mesh talking to
you the reason is these guys it'll louis
charles babbage they came across my life
and changed it dramatically about six
years ago a friend of mine susharma
anderson started a web festival called
ada lovelace day which you might be
familiar with encouraging people to blog
and tweet about famous women in tech and
the sciences and she asked me um she
said the problem was people didn't tend
to know who Ada Lovelace was and could I
do some sort of short introduction to
her life and I said of course and then
realized that I didn't know who else was
so I ran to Wikipedia looked up did a
little research and drew a very short
comic it's physically quite short it's
about this tall the first one outlining
their lives a little kind of catch up
for those of you not familiar with them
Ada Lovelace the
the only legitimate daughter of Lord
Byron um the famous poet her mother left
the marriage when ADA was about one and
she never met her famous father her
mother was very concerned that ADA would
inherit the Byronic temperament which
was called the poetical temperament and
as a sort of a corrective to this she
had her educated heavily in mathematics
and logic which was considered to be the
opposite I suppose a poetry and
therefore would be this countervailing
influence on her psyche the other person
in the stories Charles Babbage and just
to remind you what he looked like okay
Babbage was the occasion professor of
mathematics at Cambridge chair held by
Newton currently held by Stephen Hawking
so it was a pretty clever guy and he set
himself the task of trying to correct
errors in mathematical tables back in
the days before calculators if you had
to do a complex calculation rather than
getting out a piece of paper you would
have these enormous books of logarithmic
tables basically and you would just go
down the line and look up your
calculation and the big book the
difficulty that these tables done is
that of course they were done by humans
that's the only computers they had and
they were full of errors so he set
himself the task of inventing a machine
that could do mathematical tables and
print them without error and he called
this the difference engine because it
solved sums by the method of differences
he said has successfully built a small
model it's about this big you can see it
in the Science Museum in London it's a
beautiful machine I recommend going and
having a look at it and that's all he
ever built he spent enormous amounts of
public funds 17,000 pounds pop which is
commonly described as the price of two
worships without ever finishing the
machine because he had come up with an
idea for a better machine which he
called the analytical engine
which I will introduce you to in a
moment he net love us at a party when in
1833 she was 18 he was 43 and she fell
in love with the difference engine and
she had always been very keen on
machinery even as a child she was
drawing diagrams of machines and very
fascinated in how they worked so she saw
a demonstration of this little adding
machine and asked him to the for the
plans and she she was very excited about
it and this is for my initial power and
what she was she was interested in the
difference engine of course but what she
was really fascinated while I was the
analytical engine and this was a machine
that Babbage had added a storage system
to and had a conception that possibly it
could be controlled with punch cards the
other kind of complicated machine of the
period with it was a jacquard loom which
was quite a new invention at that time
punch card operated loom and beverage
was trying to figure out a way to
integrate these punch cards and storage
into his adding machine so that it could
run through more complicated
calculations and it seems to me that
love with in front began to study
mathematics quite seriously because she
wanted to help Babbage with the engine
specifically her tutor was Augustus de
Morgan if anyone studied logic you might
be familiar with this name de Morgan was
the father of mathematical logic
basically he was one of the first
person's to have the idea that you could
take logical prepositions as familiar
from Aristotle and turn them into
a mathematical formula he wasn't hugely
successful himself but one of his other
students was George Boole our whose
birthday it was yesterday's 200th
birthday so I feel we should all a
little hooray for George blue and but de
Morgan took love eyes through his course
by correspondence at University College
London and he did not however really
encourage her oh I should sorry I just
heard the saying cuz it's very cute this
is de Morgan I should say this idea of
symbolic logic was very controversial at
the time and not a very popular theory
of mathematics the idea that symbols
symbolic logic could be used with other
things than numbers was a really unusual
thought so this was his reply to an
objection to the idea of symbolic logic
put at the end when N equals infinity of
course anyone could destroy this
argument with her to dance infinity plus
one but anyway and so after this study
with de Morgan while de Morgan was
developing symbolic logic Lovelace
became convinced that this these
operations of symbolic logic could be
applied to Babbage's engine she was very
obsessed with this idea and as part of
kind of her studies into the Machine she
wound up translating a French article on
Babbage's engine it Babbage himself
never published anything about his
machine in his own lifetime the only
publication on it at the time was a
transcript of one of his lectures by an
Italian wrote it in French she did a
translation into English of this French
article and began to add footnotes it
was not normal for women in this period
to write scientific papers but they did
sneak in to the publishing pipeline by
doing translations like her other mentor
Mary Somerville
who translated the place but lovelyz
kind of snuck in by adding footnotes
which in the end became three times as
long as the paper that she was
translating and in the footnotes to the
paper is a lot of the most important
concepts of computing the idea of loops
several programs and most importantly
general computing in enabling mechanism
to combine together general symbols and
successions of unlimited variety or
extent na the link is established
between the operations that matter the
most outstretched mental processes the
most abstract branch of mathematical
science and this is the first appearance
of general computing theory this is in
1842 paper unfortunately de Morgan did
not really encourage her in her studies
he wrote a letter to her mother shortly
after she published this paper
expressing concern that her mathematical
powers were too much for her frail
woman's body to contain so I thought
that soon the struggle between mind and
body would begin and as it unfortunately
he was a bit prophetic lovelyz did
inherit some of the mental illness that
her mother was worried about from her
father Byron and she was probably
bipolar a few years later she died of
cancer as well so that was the ending to
the studs very sad story babish never
did build any of these machines there
was no computer for another hundred
years it's a bit of a dead end um in
computer history so I thought this was a
terrible ending so at the end of my
comic that's her in this gang um I
should say when I drew this I had no
intention of actually doing a comic
about Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage
fighting crime this was a joke and um so
I do this little biographical strip I
containing the information I just told
you put it up on the internet and went
to bed and the next day I woke up and it
was in Wired saying this person is going
to do a comic about it um so I succumb
to peer pressure pretty easily so i
started dying yeah this topic i think i
was thinking of Avengers pretty uncanny
okay so we kind of guy is a bit like
this actually it adorns the official
t-shirt for code mesh and I drew it
sporadically online and they fight crime
badly I should say and and their
definition of crime is unusual of course
the package was very famous in his
lifetime for his massive 20-year
campaign against street music and he
tried to get it outlawed and was mostly
fix at the end of his life for these
freca he would get involved with on the
street and a lot less of course was
brought up to destroy all poetry and I'm
a bit of an obsessive nerd about stuff
so in addition to these sort of fantasy
adventures in the comic i began to add
footnotes I was extremely fortunate
because the start of the comic coincided
pretty exactly with the launch of google
books and the google books project was
the scanning and wholesale dumping of
all of human literature at Stan and
libraries and one of the wonderful
things about it is that takes all this
text ephemera minor journals you know
little books that nobody would ever read
and dumps them online and make some
searchable by any random clown and so
you can discover all sorts of fantastic
things especially on a subject like
Lovelace and Babbage because Babbage was
very famous he sometimes described as
this
add underdog who everybody ignored which
was not true Babbage was extremely
famous he was specifically famous as a
super genius who had invented a
wonderful machine you can see his
calculating machine was an endless
subject of monologue tells you a lot
about Babbage and so there was a lot of
appearances of them in newspapers and
whatnot so I could find this treasure
trove of stuff lavish the loggers
medical frankenstein and he's described
actually this is the write-up of a
conference much like this this is
garbage and punch alright I'm not a
hundred percent this is sure that this
is garbage he's not identified in this
cartoon but this is someone who's
extremely angry and having his carefully
having his invention not featured in the
Great Exhibition of 1851 and Babbage in
fact wrote an entire angry pamphlet why
is my Difference Engine not in the grand
tradition so I'm pretty sure that's him
and you could also read a lot of
Babbage's own writing Babbage wrote a
lot about every subject except mostly
his difference engine this is in fact a
weirdly from his pamphlet on the Great
Exhibition and he's described kind of
describing how brilliant this machine is
and why it should be in the exhibition
and this is the first error pop-up ever
described if there's a conflict in the
engine it will pop up a little plate
that says wrong
uh a bit later on in his autobiography
he adds the continually ringing round
Bell resumption would be delightful with
your recoding I use this in the comic
Lovelace is the programmer obviously so
she's constantly a war with his wrong
pop-ups in the Yolanda she's swearing
here this comic is meticulously sourced
every single part of it is if not true
at least truth II and Lovelace was
described by the New York mirror in 1833
probably can't leave this super blurry
it says Oh fie it is said that ADA Byron
the sole daughter of the noble Bard is
the most coarse and vulgar woman in
England and she does swear and her
letters very unusually for a Victorian
women she was she was an unusual
character in a lot of ways I'm actually
used this in the comic let's see how ot
Lovelace is getting on that's a special
language we're developing just for the
engine they're showing it to Queen
Victoria who is of course their client
um so long as you know all this fun
stuff I did have the opportunity of
making some genuinely marvelous
scholarly discoveries on google books
and this is a letter that appears in the
southern review from 1864 it was an
extremely obscure journal published in
Maryland it's very much like a church
circular it was only published for three
years so we're very fortunate that this
was in whatever library Google was
scanning at the time and there's very
little vivid direct cottage of Babbage
and Lovelace a--'s relationship with
each other in the sort of popular press
there's a lot of other relationship in
their letters of course but what's
really wonderful is this is someone
who's coming across Babbage this is a
letter home from 1854 two years of after
Lovelace had died this is
American writing home about his visit to
Charles Babbage and I think this is
might be one of the earliest
descriptions of programming Babbage says
knew intimately and spoke highly of her
mathematical powers and a very peculiar
capability higher he said than that of
anyone he knew to prepare I believe it
was the descriptions connected with his
calculating machine then he says he
didn't actually understand what beverage
was saying which is very common with
Charles Babbage related things and so
this fellow's a failure to understand
the analytical engine is widely shared
and one of the things that I had a
really hard time with when I was doing
the comic which as I said I wanted to be
very accurate in every way except for
actually containing a different engine
is that there were very few good
descriptions of the analytical engine
it's a very famous machine the first
computer everyone's heard about it
everyone sort of Babbage everyone
studies them in comp sci 101 and but
what I did find was there was very
little description of what the machine
actually looked like and specifics of
how it worked I tended to dry it in the
comics as this enormous labyrinth of
gears the machine in the comic obeys
Moore's law except that it doubles in
size every two years so it's slowly
taking over in London and but this is
quite vague it's cartoony and I wanted
to know what it actually looked like um
you can get some impression from The
Difference Engine and Babbage's plans
for the difference engine were never
completed of course in his lifetime but
in our the year 2000 a difference engine
with printer was actually built by
durance right at the Science Museum this
is a replica in the Science in the
Computer History Museum in California
and they run this one and you can heat a
wonderful flower that makes
oh if you can hand it a shot at sorry I
started vertically like a nude and so
that one was finished whoops mmm but
that's the difference engine um the
difference engine is a very very
different machine from the analytical
engine the difference engine is a tiny
tiny fragment of what the analytical
engine would have looked like it doesn't
have programming storage loops any of
fancy stuff the main thing that I think
you know everyone if a cursory knowledge
nose is this this is planned 25 Babbage
produced many many meticulous plans of
the engine I should stress that this was
not a theoretical machine in the same
way as Turing's machine in a sense it's
an the opposite of a turning engine in
that the mechanics of it were
meticulously worked out all the weights
you know the pressure that you need they
lift the weights all the tiny levers all
the cams were worked out it was actually
the theory part that Babbage wasn't that
interested in he was primarily a very
intense hardware guy and so there's
thousands of diagrams I should say this
is by one of his assistants it is
definitely not Babbage's handwriting
which is nowhere near that neat so that
the machine is very worked out but I was
really startled to discover that no one
had ever done an elevation of this or a
visualization um for me at least I look
at this and I go woo pity and then I go
oh it's just a bunch of circles that I
have no idea what they mean and so I
sent to whip to build one virtually I'm
very lucky in that I work in visual
effects by day so I have access to the
equipment and knowledge and whatnot so
this is my visualization of the
analytical engine and
I should hasten to say this is a cartoon
version for one thing most of the engine
would probably be invisible because you
would have to frame the entire thing in
extremely solid structure the analytical
engine is a whole bunch of tiny gears
any one of which being out of alignment
will stop the machine so you'd have to
basically surround the entire thing with
a cage I very much doubt it could be
freestanding like this one but that's
accurate sighs and hopefully accurate to
mechanism and I assume that this is a
crowd that I can talk through quite
quickly the operations of the machine
and the long columns down the back is
the store each column is a number
basically the difference engine held 20
digit numbers so it's a column of 20
gears if you turn a gear 25 that holds
five then you turn above it 2-1 then at
holds 15 Babbage wanted the analytical
engine to have 50 decimal places which
is a lot of decimal places that's why
it's so tall but the mass of the machine
is actually just the number of decimal
places and I did to an explanation in
the book of how the whole thing works
but it's actually very difficult to
describe without just as a static image
baggage himself describes this
difficulty of describing or even
understanding for himself how the
machine would work and because it's in
constant motion fortunately I'm an
animator so I could start doing some
elevation so basically what I did is I
just took the plans did an elevation
from studying quite technical papers i
should say most of my knowledge of the
engine io entirely to allen bromley the
late Alan Bromley unfortunately who in
the 70s and 80s wrote a series of papers
going over Babbage's papers and
explaining how they worked and
actually i'll skip that so this is an
operation run through the whole machine
now the green bits are driven the red
bits are driving the operation so I'll
just go through this piece by piece you
can see this sort of lollipop shape the
big grand thing at the end is what
Babbage called the mill Eric the
processor and the long column down the
back is the store so each column is just
a number and the storage goes back an
ambiguous distance because Babbage was
never clear as to exactly how many
numbers he wanted the machine to be able
to store and he said maybe 150 maybe
more maybe 500 maybe 5,000 because it's
imaginary so he could just keep adding
columns to the end and it took three
types of cards to run a program and the
first type is the number card Sokka well
the number card is just a card that
holds the 50 digit number that's going
to be fed into the machine basically
it's just a card it's got 50 columns of
10 places each where you have the number
you don't cut your hole so it's mostly
holes except for one bit without a hole
and if it doesn't have a hole when it
pushes against the lever it pushes the
lever all the other levers remain static
they just go through the holes that's
how these punch cards work it's exactly
like a punch jacquard loom card ah sorry
I actually put them up here because I
knew this was having issues with the
overview number card there we go alright
so you can just watch this loop happily
yeah um so the number card there we go
the number card reads the machines into
this reads the numbers into the store so
you put the you program the number onto
the card it pushes the levers those
leavers hook up each a bit of the store
and it reads just with a series of racks
so if you have a 5 on that position on
the card it just turns the it turns the
rack five places which then turns the
the position in the store five places
the number card would also hold I'm not
clear a mnemonic Babbage was clear as to
whether the address was on the number
card or on the variable card which is
the next card that we're going to meet
and that um Oh Ashley there's my
variable card sorry there we go I might
just open this up in Maya the variable
cards are here so this is the addressing
system the number cards hold each number
the variable cards I think it's clear to
call them address cards they just hold
the location in the store so location
501 location 26 location whatever and
they work with the number cards to read
numbers in and out of the store so the
number card puts the number in and then
once you need that number you get that
address from the store the third type of
card is the operation card look at this
one here um the analytical engine could
do four functions that subtract multiply
and divide that was it and the way that
worked was you would put what you wanted
to do on the card lets he wanted to add
two numbers you would punch that or you
would leave the adding whole unpunched
on that card so we push a lever and that
lever would then engage the barrels and
the barrels of the way that Babbage
found to put a very complicated series
of a dozen steps activated by a single
card so once you once the operation card
activates the bears can run through a
whole sequence of things so the
operations cars will turn the barrel to
a certain wedge of instructions and then
the barrels go through automatically the
barrels I can check are controlling
different parts of the stowe of the mill
and each operation had special items
specialized machinery in separate
sections and what the machine would do
for an operation was pick up a card from
from the store and then use these big
wheels just to send it to a specific
mechanism so if you're adding it would
just it would hook up the addition part
and get ready to receive the numbers so
once that's ready to go hooks it up
addressing system picks up one number
from the milk from the store picks up
the second number from the store feeds
it in and then the barrels run through a
wedge of instructions so in a sense the
operations card are higher-level
language that's controlling the barrels
there's a lot of extremely sophisticated
computing concepts in this machine which
is astonishing because it didn't exist
and it was fairly clear through his
designed that it never would exist but
managed sir put a lot of work into
making sure all this stuff worked then
at the end once you have the number
you're ready to spit it out so you just
hook up the output to the addressing
system and it reads it out I should say
these three cards are not coordinated by
the machine in any way the programmer
would have a fairly miserable job and
making sure that the variable cards the
operations cards are the number cards
were all pre strung together in a way
that made sense this was all manually
done by this imaginary programmer and
Lovelace's program does not go into the
detail of their the variable cards for
instance it just runs through the
operations once you're actually sat down
and had to make a workable program you'd
have to figure out all the addresses and
string them together with the operations
card and then hope you cutter right
otherwise you get those error pop ups
and there's one final bit of the machine
that's actually probably easier to show
in Maya this is
after I use to build these models and
this is actually the software we used
for film so it's handy that I have it
and the final part of the machine that
makes this a working computer and
definitely the part that Lovelace was
the most fascinated by because its most
relating to logic is this condition
alarm and the barrels could also control
the cards so the machine could loop if
you had a certain result from an
operation this little arm so here's the
arm unengaged this peg does not touch
the lever if the arm is engaged and
there's a peg then it will set the cards
to loop back whatever number of places
is determined by that particular peg so
you could set up eggs go back three
places on the operation card and then if
you get this particular result so it's
that if then that is so unique to this
machine and that Lovelace goes into
great detail in in her paper to talk
about how this machine could potentially
be a logic machine so that's the
analytical engine I do have more
animations and bits of it I am slowly
working together to build it just for my
own understanding there is a plan plan
28 if you go to plan 28 org to actually
physically build the machine and so if
you want to give them your support that
would be fantastic although I hope your
patient because it might take as long
possibly as Babbage to building his
difference engine so thats analytical
engine that's my comic which i think is
being raffled off at some stage night
there are diagrams in the comic and
these videos are on youtube which might
be the clearest way to get your head
around it and so
are there any questions at this stage
oh ok yeah I think we've got 10 minutes
for questions dunno yeah anybody have
any questions yep oh kudi goggles calm
if you google flow place and beverage
comic i'm pretty sure it's about fit but
the website is called 2d bengals.com
most of the comics are online although
in a somewhat shambolic order yes oh no
that's uh oh if we build one now well I
don't know they built the difference
engine package actually spent the cost
of two battleships on dev with her and
only succeeded in building that little
thing although I mean he gets a lot of
stick for that but he had to develop a
lot of new techniques for precision
machinery which are believed to have
really helped the Industrial Revolution
in England at the time that was the most
precision parts making that was required
so it was a little bit like a space
program in a sense that it was something
that might not have had that much of a
practical purpose but making the tools
why not being really helpful when they
built this the Science Museum's one I
think cost a million pound or something
like that the second one only costs a
hundred thousand dollars and that was
bought by meijer hold for his living
room although he's lending it to these
computer history museum in California
for some unknown amount of time he might
reclaim it for his living room at any
moment in terms of the analytical engine
I have no idea how much it would cost a
lot but not too much 3d printing is a
thing now we could probably do that with
yep so to the person who want to find
your comment online it's brilliant
nearly is really anticipable that's true
you should definitely buy my book which
is available find bookstores and a lot
easier to read I'm sure than my comic is
one thing you didn't mention about the
book is that has many other characters
that it besides Lovelace and Babbage yes
I mean lovers and beverage were hugely
social people and I think something that
I hadn't realized when I started the
comic was how tiny the intellectual
world in the 1840s was everybody knew
everybody else they both knew Michael
Faraday they'd had dinner with you know
Grinnell I mean there wasn't a single
figure in science in that period who
they did not know intimately go to
parties with to have dinners with go to
house parties with so it was a very tiny
intellectual circle except for boo hoo
I've actually just been reading de
Morgan's correspondence with Boo and
they failed to mention Charles Babbage
even once in the entire correspondence
or lovelies I'm really annoyed about
that much but pool was in Ireland so
that's too far I guess other questions
yes
I'm doing it one frame at a time oh
sorry when's the film coming out is the
question um I'm actually I mean I'm fun
and playing with some animation myself
of it and they're undisclosed plans that
I can't talk about of some kind I can't
really talk about it but I mean I've
worked in development for a long time so
sort of a patient lack of expectation is
probably the best attitude to take
oh my gosh they have oh sorry what's my
favorite piece of correspondence between
Lovelace and Babbage they had during the
time that she was writing those
footnotes so which took about nine
months they exchanged dozens of letters
which are enormously entertaining
Babbage and Lovelace for both huge
personalities they weren't polite you
know Victorians who only ever talked
about math they were they were both very
eccentric very arrogant very opinionated
I think actually for me there's some
there's a wonderful line they kind of
connected with the swearing of fit with
Lovelace that there's a beverage had
lost the big program which is this
enormous fold-out Bernoulli number
calculus thing and when he was doing our
Corrections so there's this little in
his he writes this note to Lovelace
saying you know no days with me no beers
with you know see is a no G where is it
? ? ? and then Lovelace writes back you
know I I guess I'll have to do another
one I'm very inclined to swear at you
however about so they're very very
informal with each other and there's
there's tons of really fun stuff in
their correspondence
um you have to do a lot of digging there
is oh sorry is the correspondence online
there's a book called enchantress of
numbers which is transcripts of ADA's
correspondence unfortunately it doesn't
have Babbage's replies if anyone has
access to ie computer history annals and
if you're an academic of some kind or if
you want to trip over to the British
Library as I did and there's a wonderful
article oh gosh it's from 1973 mmm good
no no it's 83 and I'm completely
blanking out husky John husky just
basically transcribed their
correspondence back and forth during the
writing of the notes and that is by far
the best source you know if you're not
interested in just the gossip of the
love life and blah blah blah that's by
far the best source of Lovelace and
Babbage letters they're just wonderful
and that's the whole thing it's about 20
pages and it's just great it's all you
need there is a plan to put Lovelace's
letters online but all of this is very
difficult they're they're privately held
by different people and people are weird
about digitizing stuff so it's people
are trying to do it but it's not easy
other questions we've got to write for
time so I don't want I don't want to
send you out early because although
there might be drinks sir oh 2 minutes
left oh ok well I can show you my
beautiful so these are some of the bits
of build which is probably a good and
there we go so these are some of the
parts of the engine that I've done so
this is basically what i do i have just
take a diagram online put it in my do an
elevation which is not straightforward
ever that gets very very
clear what they look like from other
angles this is how the operations card
reader works more closely it's got a
little tab it drops down if there's a
hole in the card the tab drops down and
hooks up the leaver if there's no hole
the tab doesn't drop whole barrel which
is just seen there's also oh it's not
there uh let's see if we got one minute
I'll show you the last although it's
totally too hard to explain the most of
lab Babbage's favorite piece which is
why I should show this by far Babbage's
favorite a bit of the engine is the
anticipating carriage to carry the ones
and this took me ages to figure out but
he's got he's using all these little and
pegs basically it's what we would now
call a rod logic and if the if there's a
nine let's see how can i zoom in here so
this is the original number that takes
that takes the addition and then this is
the carry so if there's a carry that's
probably too hard to explain yeah I got
this on youtube so you can have a look
but this is sort of the level of detail
that Babbage put into this and it's very
typical Babbage that he actually spent a
year designing this thing when he had a
perfectly good a care one carry although
you had to do it one at a time going up
if you look at the beautiful arms that
go around the back of the difference
engine if you see videos of that they're
carrying the ones one at a time this
carries the ones all together saving
eight seconds off a calculation and he
spent a an imaginary calculation which
didn't exist babish spent an entire year
designing this widget to carry the ones
all at once and save eight entire
seconds on the carry so that's Babbage
all the loo so yeah that's the five so
barbecued be very pleased for me to show
this as
as a final parting word but thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
