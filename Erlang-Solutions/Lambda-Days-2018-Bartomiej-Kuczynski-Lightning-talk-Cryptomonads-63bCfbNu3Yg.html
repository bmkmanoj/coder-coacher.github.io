think it will be about the blockchain
and functional programming okay about
the cryptography and functional
programming somehow meet with you okay
I think we okay not important it it will
not be about this two things because you
are trapped in the buzzwords this
presentation is about the buzzwords okay
who remember that brilliant buzz word
called saw
you know what doesn't mean
yeah what what does it mean no no it
doesn't mean service-oriented
architecture by the way nowadays we have
a second buzzword for this micro
services yeah so amines cells oriented
acronym we read the some buzzwords to go
to Wikipedia you will see this is a word
that is popular in some moment of the
time because blah blah blah we have a
buzz words because they sell
what they say so they sell a business
value of our product yes
so nowadays if I create Creek
cryptocurrency Lambert modular something
it's a quite a big chance that I pass my
eco and earn the money yes okay but who
will who buy the software based on the
buzzwords
managers exactly exactly because well
but what Eric why
yeah they only know the buzzwords but
there's a one more thing nobody never
lost the job because they buy software
from the IBM yeah yeah
their business by the software because
based on the buzzwords because they
focused on the market s market by a buzz
word so we buy a buzzword not the
problem solution power yes
but the real word we could take many
buzzwords combine them together yes and
what we have yeah we have a cartesian
products of the buzz word yeah
strictly category Tori I think that
maybe there is a chance to the see what
happened when we buy the buzz word
combination please Internet yes yeah
crypto monitor in Polish Krypton inada
not important do you know what is script
Amanat it solved it could solve the very
important starvation from all around the
world because this is a group terminal
yeah you buy the buzzword completely out
of the IT yeah
trolling his art and this is real
solution of the real problem yeah but
completely doesn't much do crypto Amanat
Bitcoin blockchain cryptography
functional programming yeah most of you
by the buzzards take a look because you
are taking all the guys and ladies you
should ignore the puzzles you should
know them and ignore them yes because
you could make you could hurt yourself
because you will maintain maintain this
password driven development software
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
