climbing paragliding and by cycling and
prior to airline my favorite programming
language was perm and the reason I might
permit a postive it wasn't very very
short Rock route to get started the only
had to write a few lines of code and use
some sleep and modules and you have some
basic you know duct tape application
that the day so but now i'm going to
talk about switching to airline profile
profit so what is company company is a
company doing search engine optimization
software and we're solving the problems
we're solving problems to big advertiser
advertisers who buy a lot of click
clicks on internet we have a minimum
customer-facing dashboard so we don't do
much interaction and you eat stuff most
of it actually seems back in the back
end today we may be used airline and
we're about 20 full-time Memphis and we
have moved into the office and we are
expanding and also hiring but that was
not how it started so it started like I
think most sem companies start such a
drama company studies and that is as a
Productivity tool because it's a very
manual business because it in swindon
amalia revolves around google uses our
champion and buying fixing googly and
this is google it wants to automate as
much as possible what's left is all the
kind of manual tasks and that's how how
things started out my friend
working in internet marketing agency
building advertising campaigns so
selecting different keywords that were
relevant for certain sites and then
writing ads to go along with these
keywords so when you search for a
contact lenses online it will be an ad
it says something like why should
contact lenses she being within 24 hours
kicking or something like that and that
was very boring so they started writing
his own program to kind of help him
ultimate this and when i joined
disposing maybe october november two
thousand seven and I going sometime
around the end of november two thousand
seven we were focusing on a very very
short time to market and we wanted
really really shitposting because we
have no revenue what server so that was
kind of our main considerations not
having to do work it shouldn't cost be a
short time to market so the period
between 2007-2010 we focused on the SEM
productivity we try to solve me guess
its needs or you know not having to work
very much we did catch each customer
just bringing in new customers making
demolition be happy and then buying more
tix in a forever because that's kind of
how I my picture of the traditional and
mediators world is that you know you
build the basic advertising networks and
then we just little bit to run itself
and you take on the next customer and
that's why I want to have lots of
productivity in that area so even and
start building a software client in on
the platforms like ramen windows that
where you could very efficiently copy
and paste keywords and ads and feed
campaign structures so so there was also
kind of repetitive tasks that are
eliminated if you used it and it was
summoned for a vacuum and so that I
started building on the lamp stack
together with some part so my skirt
drawing of linux and apache and PHP and
the frog this period were about to to
freely food scientist but then and i
think even even at this point we started
encountering to two problems actually
one of the problems was data and the
thing is that you know a matter if the
advertiser can have you know first we
had okay so that an advertiser has five
thousand keywords and then we got
another attraction that had 10,000
keywords and each keyword generate
statistics so for all the year you get
365 statistical data points per keyword
and then you give to another taxi with a
hundred thousand keywords and this all
starts exploding in the big you into
being very big tables so so we have a
fairly large data sets the queries that
we wanted to run against the database
we're hard to pre-compute because you
give you statistics every day and in
some cases you want to think about
seasonality which is you know even
finding 3x in summers so we can't take
the statistics for the win three eigen
system when we try to calculate value
obviously word in the summer so that
makes the mall so hard to pre-compute
and since there's new data every day
there's not much used in caching the
course as well and we found that my
bicycle was very hard to scale for our
use cases and the other problem does
kind of comes from this is concurrence
it because i think for one advertising
east kind of inherently parallel because
there are lots of lots of people
clicking around on the internet all the
time and they do
same time and also with the slope course
on the databases it's you know a very
good approach to do a synchronous i/o to
kind of try to handle that and that most
other major problem that kind of have
and that led us to the story about how
to switch to Ireland so the first menu
change that happen actually most of
google introduced something called
preferred pricing so before they have an
API and we've been requested API all the
time to get more statistics or add
keywords or a new humorous or manipulate
advertising in different ways but the
preferred pricing and the API each day
be like all costs a little bit of money
so there was a big penalty for doing
when the API calls and this may be
program in a certain way but then in the
people in jun 2010 actually google
introduced preferred pricing in which
basically means that if you have enough
money you will get a guy calls for free
this really changed the rules of the
game so we could start focusing on doing
more rather than less and then one month
later we'll actually assigned our at
that point biggest customer to date
which is a site called up into the air
goo so it's a Russian site that's sort
of like locate our craigslist is a
classified site where you can list use
items for sale same and you can buy used
from other private persons and that they
were very honored I sensed in Lawrence
so that introduced a very immediate need
to scale our
resources and David a system and stuff
like that and what happened after often
kind of cope with that whole challenge
to say the next one here imagining on
simply yeah it was a big shock there to
get optimizing board all the Signal
Corps is making sure that we were able
to handle all the clicks and stuff like
that and then the kind of decor is that
we used around for the old small and
customers became much much slower much
bigger customer so we needed to really
start to address our two big major
problems and our first attempt that kind
of attacking the synchronous i/o part
was actually no yes and let me tell you
a little bit about our hopes when we
kind of selected node es as a
prototyping platform for our new
synchronous a synchronously driven
product so we wanted we realized since
the javascript is probably fairly easy
to get started is copied from internet
and pasting them if we made it work and
at the time we also have the idea that
we wanted to really kind of maybe we
weren't really sure what we were doing
so we figured if I maybe wanted to be
able to tweak it as we go along and
that's introduced in it can't run more
or less untrusted code that was more or
less custom or we thought we had an
endless so that person
you know it's very easy to run
JavaScript without exposing yourself to
a whole area of security holes that
would arise in other languages if you do
ask you know again I'll some random code
so and then you know internet said it
was fast so we're like yes we hope for
that and we hope that it will bring
short time to market and I guess it's
very easy to be charmed by friendly
friendly stuff on hack idiots and stuff
like that so maybe the lighting as well
so we started coding away and it would
happen was actually rather a
disappointment performance was not
really about what I don't know for and
when you write the liquid kind of a
synchronous course for the send a
request this was kind of a risk based
service and then you get called back
hell or it is to date back them or the
way we did it the shortening call back
hassle most is a call back another
function that gets the data from the
first one many many mr. glimmers of
callbacks and that was a big frustrating
to working in that kind of setting it
work I mean but it was not nice and then
the error handling wasn't very good
either and I'm actually going to show an
example here so this is kind of the
basic issue to this server that you can
run using no dias so we import some
modules there's a simple debug function
we create the server will start
responding to the request we collect
some post data and that's so assumed
that the clients is doing a party bus
or something like that and then we can
find rid of the data and then we return
the JSON output hello world and then
here is on arahan lokotes here we're
trying to kind of catch errors that may
occur during this request and we find
which port to listen to the way we start
the server and this is like starting the
server and here we start getting a
request and then in the other kind of
books I'm doing me curly requests and
I'm sending just freely characters as
paid out but I forged content-length
Heather so it says that i'm selling more
than right I am NOT doing it and then
current weight is starting to wait for
more data from the server but nothing is
happening so I pressing composted and
then current terminates the connection
and what happens here is that I first
get the kind waiting for day to the bag
then called a pedagogy and then it's
waiting to get more data but then the I
retrievers because the client has
disconnected and and then we can obtain
client error coolum and error in the
heiress's parse error error khoobam
parse error so that most is very helpful
I mean it didn't tell us that that the
client terminate the connection or
anything like that so thank you yeah
that was you know there's lots of
scenarios where things can go wrong and
it is the error messages aren't always
very helpful in oh yes that was also big
big disappointment so how could we solve
so if you maybe name is commenting help
us replace no yes that was kind of makes
the next finger we start look at me I
guess there are several good reasons to
just consider the JM and what we hope
for was that you know we would get
better at handling them
javascript and perhaps better support
for multiple course because no guestlist
what we try to do at the wrong one
instance a core and then you have to do
load balancing in front of that sand
that I get well and hopefully we get
better performance from the day via and
when it would be more mature because 90s
wasn't very mature time we tried it it
was new in failure and also there is no
there's lots of libraries use in the
chemical in caninum ecosystems that was
I guess a good good reserve in my mind
since it and it wasn't Java so that was
also being trust and we started doing
some prototyping and performance them to
be much better than than with no GS I
mean some and I one problem that we
actually run into most obscene are some
examples in Java is rather hard to
translate into scholar i think this such
a complicated language and I mean I read
the book in and then there's you know
yeah it's not no straightforward to kind
of just try to understand how to use it
and you need lots of lots of classes to
get things going and stimulant kind of
fit it into the framework java and I
didn't dream like that so so I was you
know more happier than with no but not
really happy and but then sign you know
I random occurrence happen so in my
spare time I trained something called
Krav Maga which is a self-defense
discipline that's the event in Israel or
or at least fine-tuned bye-bye but
Israeli military and it's a very good
way to focus on something other than
work and there was one day we would have
been training in Krav Maga and summer
they have the
elbowed me on the inside of my elbow so
I had lots of him and I couldn't sleep
so I was laying awake at night and it
was four o'clock and I was like okay so
I'm not going to slip tonight but what
are we going to do and I think of it I
might as well do something useful with
my type so so I started surfing around
on the internet and I found because I
have a friend who I've been talking not
about Iranian it was really impressed by
what they had since so so I figured you
know why not the syntax it's really
really weird but but maybe maybe I'll
give it a shot now that I'm just you
know sitting here in in lots of pain so
I don't know the tape recall with many
being reliable distributed systems in
the presence of software errors and
started reading it and by morning when
I'm going to work I was coincidence I
should give it give this a try it seems
really really really interesting
actually and this was some time in
February and here is the first commit
message on our first product with Aaron
so it's actually in the sunday in
believing but this is what it looked
like and the first impressions that I go
to marilyn is that you know hot cold
learning is very very useful for false
iteration I was really impressed by that
and the modules are so much more simple
to classes so that was also a great
great great joy it was so much easier or
more synchronous to understand how
airlines working them the truck and
realize how the fool you know how to fit
something into the big kind of gamma
ecosystem and we did you skin event
actually but it was mostly pure Harlem I
don't know if that's because I didn't
even read enough I just got excited
advanced that kind of time do we wait or
if that's kind of how most mostest
using airline people don't kind of go
and kind of formal education when it
comes to language no yeah Jen I'm noti'm
starters yep and you have to go back and
remember this day for meet them you can
look at ya and then kind of in wash with
the second prototype using hmmm this was
another product and it's a very
informative commit message this was
actual more normally working hours but
after we kind of try to build that
product and it worked well that I was
too we started realizing that you know
airline sweetie seems to think kind of
problems that we have with currency
concurrences so so after the two
successful pilots we started to have air
long as the preferred language for all
our new products or almost at least at
companion and then in a premium we kind
of got started with a dirty meat on a
third product which is another way of
making profits of Campania and here we
can see we didn't do religious and stuff
like that of course we just started with
using transcripts so so here we're
starting the units somewhere in the
supervision trillion you either on right
perhaps I don't know but that's how we
really got started but during the first
year there was some surprises actually
that from from given what they had read
about airline and my first impressions I
was really really kind of surprised
about and I guess the first one is
actually HTTP client that is that it's
in the main
distribution because what happened when
we started making more concurrent
requests was that we realized that there
was about switching the responses mgc
spike is this even possible so that was
a really kind of scary realization that
you know maybe maybe not everybody is
using HTTP as heavenly as we do or
volatile if you have done it however the
switch to LA hpc or some other kind of
eyebrows or for other library to do that
because that was people i do believe my
eyes first when I kind of started to
realize this another kind of issue that
we ran into was with my sequel and it
was we later discovered that some other
people had run into this as well and
this is when we have multiple connection
proofs and two different databases
perhaps and you start running lots of
course so you start putting words in the
wait queue as well because there are new
connections it freely in the query for
me and then what happens before they did
the past creation of a country which is
resolved now so so that was kind of the
conclusion you know you should follow
hip-hop very closely about it but what
happened was that in my sake what was
starting to send the wrong party on
their own connection so all of a sudden
we would get like this table does not
exist in this database in what Cody am i
tripping now well what's happening but
ok but really it was
messing things up so that was also
really a surprise and I didn't kind of
expect that from Ireland and in another
library also from people everything is
from guitar cases random code of the
infinite and it was the most mm cash
clients that was only using one
connection and that made it camera kappa
that's 400 blue cups per second were
like oh how can really isn't a
faster you know what focused the
concurrency in airline is infinite but
there we have realized the case we did
something with the connection proof so
we switch to our episode which solved
that public and I think a third kind of
example of of the immaturity or some of
the libraries out of England I think
this is kind of perhaps a general
problem for people trying to apply a
line in non-standard use cases outside
on telecom and with more in weird
perhaps or less less government
databases and stuff like that I think
the issue is that kind of not so people
doing that I was learning having at the
same time and and that has some funny
effects so so here in he said k which is
the supergiant library for Herman we
found this bug that when a zookeeper is
terminating the connection to the client
then where we want to get notified but
before they have kind of before they
trying to send the message from they
have added first day or there can you
see
nserror frog so it wouldn't work anyway
I guess if they are just taken the
people tagged and try to do the bank now
they are also putting a cloaking and
kind of tag in front of that so this
code I guess have never been exercised
during testing since the rewrite and
that I think is also one one problem
that you know lots of lots of the kind
of fairy fareal technologies in the
airline world are or not our little bit
more immature than I expected I was
really like a smelly one night this is
the mistake of library it has 19 issues
and it probably works perfectly this
part with pitting edema and hacking very
good but that is something to think
about and I think you know and as we
grow as a community these things would
become much better and more people doing
you more and more crazy stuff for their
like the better so this kind of things
could hopefully go away but but that
post was some some of our experiences
and kind of where we have the whole data
problem our concurrency problem at risk
because in general i think erica has
helped to solving very much about
concurrency issues we wanted to start to
look at how we could get rid of my
sequel as well or it is large extent as
possible and the first thing that we
will start looking at was right actually
and it was virtually no that's 14 at all
and this was actually before we start
using airlines so so we were kind of
evaluate me tuscola so this is what
happens when we did kind of a simple
test because we have so much debt
wanted to to insert the hungry billion
and this in right so you kind of what
happened and before we managed to do
that we actually ran out of memory on
the testing server but one thing that's
interesting here is that sign of the
right rate which is soon yeah in the
beginning of the parenthesis is like
4,000 to 300 requests per second that's
very good but then we don't get replies
and this might be because I'm valid
right let's call our haven't really
understood that but it seems like we
just go for applied for about ten
percent though our requests and that's
what really kind of surprising so after
some 15 million requests sent to write
it is crushed because probably Scala is
waiting for this other ninety percent of
their requests that we don't get any
reply from from write about but both
often is you still try to kind of figure
out you know what happened them and he's
right a good fit for us and we started
trying to kind of get all the kids back
out and see how far we are fulfilling
the rights and what happened was that we
have got like fifteen hundred fifty nine
megabytes in 30 minutes of them I kind
of lost my patience and the discarnated
it and unless you can sit up in the far
right corner it's still kind of
allocated night two gigabytes at least
so apparently some day to have him story
in there that it was very hard to kind
of get it out again and and here's kind
of running talk while trying to get the
kids and we're running in a hundred
eight percent scipio and
and fiercely most the memory and most
scope as well so that was kind of in a
big disappointment really because we
agree we diligently right and wanted to
use it but I guess it wasn't faking our
use case very well and this is something
that i actually discovered afterwards
when I was kind of preparing this talk I
wanted to go back I didn't really do
things correctly and then I found this
kind of interesting error message as I
don't know if you can see it but here it
says right chord you team C hash key and
so I guess it's been consistent hashing
function the triack uses cookies summery
drink and what we get back is bad match
not so maybe we were using the wrong I
don't know the next kind of candidate is
a no cigarette the best replace my
sequel was big couch which is Calvin's
version of cafeteria it was also the
iron base so we thought this is going to
be awesome but it didn't really measure
up to what we wanted to do as well and I
guess I guess it wasn't really affecting
our use case either and we still had
this idea about about server-side
JavaScript that you know maybe shouldn't
should be considered in our case so what
happened next was that we switched to
hbase and started trying that out
instead and HBase actually worked out
very well for us so I want to kind of
tell you a little bit about the HBase as
a technology and so each piece is a
distributed databases was developed by
power set to mimic Google's bigger table
database and it's a top-level Apache or
juice or product today and on their
website they promised random and
real-time
access to be dead atop clusters clusters
of commodity hardware with videos arose
x videos and columns and I guess what
they mean by this is actually the
millions of columns they should have a
little bit of a star by it I think
because most of HBase seems to be
designed not to have a billion million
columns on the same row but million
different columns across this video and
rolls rather and they kind of when you
design your steam iron with your data in
HBase you should really try to do
terrorists that are tall and narrow not
short and wide so so lots of rows and 2
columns and not few rows and many homes
but it's still a very very powerful to
me and this is kind of a picture of all
their architecture there is a master
that controls different million servers
and all this is written in Java so that
was why we were some kind of trying to
avoid it in the first place but it
actually works so so now we were pretty
happy and the real name servers take a
couple of a distinction these religions
are ports or the table that consists of
a range of rows that's why you need to
have I kind of do so the partitioning is
only done Roland that's why you can have
no Williams or columns on the same row
because then you won't be able to spread
that across different videos and then
restoring in Hadoop and distributed file
system and what we each place enables us
to do is rinse rights the lids atomic
increments that is the context which is
very useful
doesn't exist even dry yet and also
scout so you can really do the rose in
the water so that would be question was
how can we use h base and Alan together
because we weren't at the helm you kind
of the concurrency problems and them two
big data problems and make them Wow and
so the first attempt was actually trying
to access HBase using fixed but the
conclusion that we came to most at this
at that point was that it wasn't really
fast enough because you're talking to
the trip server and the free survey is
actually java client and the fixed
server has only a limited set the
workers i guess and and i think you
configure them to you know it's very low
not growing independence but and then
that isn't are talking to the different
video service so the performance wasn't
really what we call for me we'd leave
actually managed to put lots of that
diving we today we store i thinking in
the low hundreds of millions of rows in
our HBase so it didn't actually work to
put lots of death there and we managed
even using fifth to put in more and get
it out again but we wanted more
performance then we kind of tried the J
interface and the traditional java
client from HBase combination so that
the J interface can can emulate in
Ireland know that we do some messages
your client us to look ups and that work
much better actually but there was still
kind of problem that he did the one or
more gay games attached to airline and
also the java client isn't Fred safe so
we have to not
fretting ourselves or have lots of JM so
that was kind of the best fit for our
our use case so then we continue looking
we found another kind of interface
client written by stumble upon which is
called a single HBase and they have more
synchronous access pattern 4 inch bass
so that's actually with that we could
increase the performance of our access
to HP's the defeat the mobile of Aaron
I'm much better so that's what we're
using today but there's still some your
fear in there actually so this is kinda
distinctive of code from from a sink
hbase and you know when you find look
messages it says you know what the
shouldn't happen lost two races and
found in the least of something our
pieces then you're like okay this might
be scary cold actually so actually we
had this morning one incident where
we're kind of looking at some statistics
in our system and it was to countered
atmosphere and when we're like okay so
what is happening here because these
usually it's about unity the low
hundreds of thousands and now it's zero
and it's increments one at a time so we
have lost a lot of increments and then
we started kind of tracing this down in
the code and what we found was that some
place in Ireland we started rolling out
these counters and then we apply the
counters in Java typical increments at
the time and the kind of robot counter
under the 50,000 were like oh so we
haven't done a right in a long time
obviously and then this was kind of a
Friday afternoon we were drinking beer
and then things were good so we're forth
like the kid maybe we should wait until
Monday to the resultant issue we should
just let it keep incrementing in Epsom
and see what happens and then when we
return on monday the actual counter have
been incremented in HBase so so maybe
there is a very eventual consistency
thing going on the inside the Java black
box that we have so so what I deliver
all the future is that you might
actually want to implement pure airline
H bit client and this thing hbase
repository is about twelve thousand
lines of Java code so so my question is
how many lines of airline adapter and I
Fame 120 yeah first feeling anything we
might get that much better kind of call
it the app of that as well so so summing
up I think that you know there's there's
lots of Kedah we're more or less mature
software out there to solve problems
other than telecom problems and and the
more people will start using those kind
of libraries together that they think
there is lots of potential so really
hard problems using air down yonder and
I'm really happy that we that we did
this which card I am and it has helped
us really solve most of heart problems
and it also have a bit of fun and makes
a profit and we have found you know a
really good team I think and to to kind
of the
there's also a great iron towns out
there and that's also really positive
thing so so you sent it from spilling my
support what probability do you have so
one of the problems is you know when you
start inserting loss of rows in table
the kind of I guess one of the problems
was just you know lots of data that we
store our arbitrary nature so we wanted
to kind of schema free tables and we
have done shortly on database level per
customer so we could just do the altar
table per customer but then again you
steam it and when you have a big table
and develop table statement it takes a
lot of time but you can kind of work
around that to make cocoa to tell you do
the altar table then you switch the
tables at some point but it's also kind
of pain to maintain I think I very
beautifully kept up with my secrets you
have to do replication more or less
manual or automated but but still you
get to lowes and then you can have other
slaves but you can't promote them to
master reset and we maybe you can but
there's lots of kind of
were involved in that that we didn't
really want to do this like I think that
was kind of the main the main problem we
can get distributed and highly available
great because it's my second question
for you have any big huge bass so high
you'll need a villa teenage days if
we're going to go back to the kind of
slide here so there is actually one
single point of failure it is not in
HBase but it's in the ability to view
the file system down here so so the
other this video file system consists of
two types of notes it's the name server
name node and the data notes that
actually hold the data and they know
this is you know in vanilla setup I do
it's a single point of failure there are
some kind of more or less experimental
kind of applications that help us that
could help you make it high available
like the avatar name know from from
facebook but that's that's really I
guess the main the main kal or problem
but then the Dominion servers they kind
of split all reducing between them and
if one goes offline the other really
asleep the other regions the radio setup
name server holds will be released buted
by the HBase monster you can have simple
a bit monsters working on the same
cluster and they synchronize for zoo
keeper or you can have until the
monsters so that's kind of it working
fairly well I'd say it's only kind of
the name of that little bit scale of the
experiment
notes hospitalized with higher variable
my nose no yes so you won't be none and
yes we have started fishing tote Italian
I think maybe you might tell you know
some little hardcore it's not official
yet but the term is really done a great
job might change switching our toes
billion i also realized after sometimes
that it was actually a very very very
powerful thing about our like to do and
that's kind of made us switch direction
so the eyelid say yes pirattitude
everyone's two oxygens programmer for
the using champion corners we have not
tried to access HDFS directly from
Ireland but I think already kind of
first approached it were to do that but
to be build another in light very very
thin job just and then integrate using
yeah interface
any revision so there is no question we
completely stalled thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
