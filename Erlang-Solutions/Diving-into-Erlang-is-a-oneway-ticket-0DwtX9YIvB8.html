introducing the next speaker but
unfortunately it's me so let me let me
tell you a short story but well actually
why I'm doing our Ling and how I landed
here so how I came to her Ling and while
we'll stay there forever well as long as
erling exists of course so just a brief
introduction i'm Padma
I probably only live on Twitter at the
moment but not that often I also write
books which is a hobby and whoever tried
to write a book will know that this is a
hobby but anyway also loving all of them
are German so are also what an ailing
OTP bloke a German one I will explain
why because Jean Paul introduced you to
the great literature and I'm getting
asked this question all the time and I
have an explanation yet the current one
is something for IT decision makers
probably there is no single IT decision
maker real I to decision make I aim with
this book and this audience today so but
anyway it's also hard technically yeah
this one is well actually if it even if
it's German it's 80% darling code so
anybody is welcome to read it
okay so if this whole thing began
somewhere in the 70s that I as a learn
tinkering read someone to the sandbox
playing around and tinkering things
together and well I'm not the greatest
speaker so I'm the natural speaking it's
not really my thing
and so some time later I just discovered
the most expressive language around that
they could imagine
so try I started taking this thing and I
was programming well actually for money
I was programming we had printer drivers
and stuff like that well and then at
some point I guess it was just growing
up and you know I realize there is C
around right it's a cool thing so I
started also also started tagging C
it's a start that's what he just can
enjoy the stress well see was cool right
and I did a lot of C programming as well
I was still doing a C program but anyway
the puberty was over I was like 18 me
and said hey there's a higher level
programming possibility so some C++
you can imagine what
so the next thing the next big thing
well I actually started late for that
somewhere by the end of 90s it was this
Java Enterprise Java stuff it was
rolling on and it was advancing and it
was well it just wanted to conquer the
world right and so well I just just
jumped in for the money I mean I'm
homeless right there are people who are
not honest about this but I did it for
the money I still do it for the money
it's okay I still need some bread and
some butter so yeah I love coding Java
at this moment so any any Java
developers around just to not you know
you don't need to be so shy so actually
what it does it say it just lets a
shared library end and it's Chennai and
natively imports a function I can call
it and I could do assembly in there well
this is just a side story somewhere in
the middle of mm mm however you call it
somewhere came around and asked me to
program ace a tiny footprint database
for this palm PD is to remember these
things right different ones and you have
code warrior like pretty far from a
printer for compiling for different
platforms that like three or four of
them whatever Sony has it had it out its
own one and and HP has added someone so
slightly incompatible so they'll just
 myself programming again and see
and I have memory like 64 kilobyte
because you couldn't from the shared
library there
it's built you couldn't really access in
a performant way you couldn't access the
cop memory so I just had to program that
with a well we are part of that Lee
pendant well whatever
so that enterprise Java was of course
the place where money lived sure I think
it's still that way so I was working for
a company on um well my job titles were
like Enterprise Architect and and
whatever architect and whatnot architect
so at some point someone somebody came
along and we did some financial
calculation so I have interest
calculation interest calculator
what would the interest calculator do
well you have well 11 or 13 iterations
were trying to iterate over a set of
options in order to find the best
interest for the customer and well
actually people didn't know at that
point that they could paralyze different
calculations you cannot split this
iteration process but you can calculate
it based on different options so you can
parallelize this so somebody came around
and said hey we have a there is an
interest calculator and let's try it out
we have a Java platform let's take it so
the next thing was what the is
there it's written in C
and it doesn't do parallel calculation
at all so this is an Asian so the
question was of course on the
architecture level in the enterprise
Java well should we do some messaging
some message driven bean sand JMS and
whatnot well so here the official
 part of this presentation is
ova and the idea of the first slides was
that I'm also always looking for the
best solution on the lowest level which
is possible which is so comfortable and
then well I'm not afraid of hacking in
Si and whatever if it solves the problem
so what I did for this interest
calculation stuff I spent three months
of my life mostly nights at night
researching yelling I just didn't do
erling by that time so I just wanted to
dig into it and learn about it and
concept of the concept I just realized
hey cool it can help it can help
paralyzing this weird C code that I had
that it actually could on one machine
and several machines I did a lot of
tests then I went to well you know in a
big enterprise if you work for a big
enterprise had like fences and fences
all around and one way to work together
is just throw over the fence something
and the other way to work together is
actually go over the fence and try to
convince people to use something well
I'm confronted this Ops guys right
and those UPS guys are telling me a it's
not y'all we don't take it
I mean look at people like it people
like Martin Thompson those know what is
Java programming for many solutions that
don't even use the standard library
because it's so fast so you can do a
real cool start on the JVM but they
didn't know it that didn't care about it
it's just a confront zone right so well
they didn't take it okay so I could just
say forget it what well I do
this I just started learning our Elling
more and more it was difficult because
you don't have a real project for that
so you need to well to implement
something out of your head and and
experiment with that I just started to
learn and at some point that just said
hey what is the best way for Pablo to
learn things
I'm not into speaking I'm not into well
being verbose in any way so the best way
for me to learn things was writing books
I have four of them out there and when
you whenever you write a book the first
page you start with the first page you
realize you have no idea about this
topic really even if you have a contract
with the publisher even if you did a lot
of talks about this you have absolutely
no idea about what you want to
write about so you have to learn this
stuff so this one this one
took two and a half years of effort to
write starting actually starting real
from scratch because I realized that
what I learned about early and what I
want to write about early are two
different things by the way I have three
copy with me free copies with me so I
have the German speaker any any German
speakers here on well remember it's 80%
early so first three guys who will
appear this table by the end of the
stock would get the book I'll make it
very simple you can do it in a
concurrent way if you like however I
will not take this copies with me
so yeah it's absolutely worth it because
I learned a lot of things about this
platform and I just looked deeper and
deeper and oh well it's all explained
some experiences so what we also did is
just talking to people who never heard
about this who even thought that Erlang
is actually a rolly written name of
Enchantment City
some of them actually also also knew
that this is a great love mathematic
stuff it's it's a measure unit for
traffic actually if even network traffic
war while car traffic so anyway so I
went to German user groups I will not
tell this one I will not tell about this
experiences again well actually they
liked it most of them really liked it I
didn't defend anybody I just showed some
some interesting stuff and I did just
life hacking so I just I was in front of
my MX even if you don't like he makes I
do I was in front of me makes I'm just
hacking around and showing how it works
and it was an interesting experience so
let me tell you about things that have
changed after I've learned about erling
during this two and a half years and
after that every day because right now
I'm also doing our linked programming
I'm not doing the are linked programming
all the time but for some cases I have
to do like working with react or
rabbitmq if they want to go deep into
this you will have to write plug-ins you
will have to write your own hooks and
whatever so anyway
just look at this line
sitting in front of you Java code and
just start popping it typing into static
compilers or even the background
compilation Eclipse whatever so it
didn't compile it's a way of thinking
what actually happened is that I did
some functional programming before but
it was well during the studies it wasn't
very serious I didn't have use cases for
that yet or at least by that time so
what happened to me now I don't even
want to touch a language that doesn't
have list companions and loved us I
don't want to touch it it's just too
verbose for me I'm not into this related
into this high-end functional thinking
but I'm learning everyday and I see the
concepts I see how I can use this
concepts and there are languages around
that don't have it one of them have even
mentioned and also for example even if
by thon has lambdas and list
comprehensions it's a cool language I
use it a lot or anyway pattern matching
can all about pattern matching it just
you just describe how things will come
into function in a very declarative way
this is a perfect thing this is
something that I miss I can completely
avoid lots of ifs and dance and whatever
I just have a declarative way to
describe what will happen when something
arrives so what actually also happened
to me this early made like code Bella
in any language it just helped me a
little thinking concurrently thinking
distributed lis distributed learn
whatever how mental distributed systems
I'm started this stuff intent I tried to
build some with them with different
technologies
Ellen was the first one where I say hey
the distribution well it has its price
of course it's all it always has its
price that is but is this is a sort of
implementation where I can start with 30
40 % of things that are prepared for me
and I can concentrate on the rest
so making the code better means that I
don't pre-assigned variables are done
reassignment absolutely
I also block with deep copies just to
avoid any side-effects in any language I
use I started using recursion this is
pretty weird because people who are well
comfortable with with loops and and
stuff will look at my code say hey why
do you use recursion here where this
effort and like this is a way of
thinking that prepares you for things
that not that are not imperative that
our net more natural for you to
understand to get when you look at the
color I also cut everything into very
small pieces like functions methods
whatever it is not parallelizable the
concept the basic idea behind early and
are links leathercraft principle and so
on and so forth it just cut your problem
into small pieces everything that is
parallelizable is just a small piece of
code and it can spawn it as a process
you still have to take care of forks and
joints and whatnot but anyway this is a
different way of thinking and I'm using
it in different languages as well
what also happened to me I just I'd I
really judge a platform when I look at
it or one simple thing can I
can ask Paul to to the 27 well
theoretically access on it and pass a
synchronous messages between them that's
a very good question because then there
are definitely use cases when you need
such a platform even you know and when
you start programming into small pieces
it will have more and more and more
processes and there are long VM it's a
real great thing for what it does with
the actors because of schedulers because
of all of this this reduction based time
sharing and then so on and so forth so
it's it's not really for number
crunching and things like that it's for
extremely parallel systems
what also happened to me when I probably
when I look at the zookeeper
you know zookeeper might have a look at
zookeeper and I touched zookeeper a
couple of times during the last year
well yes it is a distributed system it
implements a couple of things that are
normal that are typical for distributed
systems that tries to solve this
problems but the question that I always
ask looking at that is why the
reinvent the wheel can really have a
role in that with its built-in
distribution you can build on it
okay so for very specific use cases such
as messaging distributed data management
especially when I look at the Erlang
based technology it just gets more
credit from the beginning for me because
I know that it builds upon well an
implementation which is solid which is
proved and where many people have tried
it out and that are implementing the old
technologies based on it so you need to
take it you want to take it what also
happened to me is I made some real smart
people in the community around the
community as well I mean starting with
people like Francesco or giant and and
Robert or a John Hughes or a crescent or
poor Steven auskey all these guys are
well not only smart but they know that
Erlang is a is a very specific thing for
very specific problems and of course
Arling is not perfect things will get
really dirty really hairy when you well
when you try to debug problems in the
distributed systems in a distributed
system which is not I see a problem of
early it's a problem of the complexity
or whenever you get down tune if it will
get dirty if you don't know what you do
there but anyway to be honest I didn't
see a perfect technology yet
I just didn't so it's so based on the
same concepts it's like implementing
this part of the concepts that part of
the concepts whatever earning in my
opinion is just aiming a very specific
use case and it's the only considerable
platform to implement those
so now I have early the whole thing I
had it in my toolbox well it's a precise
machine it's a real good thing but it's
very sensitive to doing things wrong
well everything is but you you know you
in the in the other world you can hide
behind RM frameworks whatever and just
say hey Ops guys you need to solve this
performance problem you just down to the
bare metal you're responsible for
everything so you can really kill things
if you want but I'm glad I learned this
and this is the main message here so
even if you just well not sure should I
should I not attending this one or
anybody around you should really even if
you will not do our link programming for
a living you will learn a lot from the
platform how the platform is implemented
you might or might not like the language
itself if you didn't do prologue the
syntax itself but anyway the concepts
the abstractions over we are low level
things they are great in my opinion so
that's basically my experience yeah
thank you very much
so do you have any questions on this
well probably once again not tip
non-typical talk
the foreman from
you find find easier honest
Oh can you define now is it does it
depend on early on a release or oh my
eyes I understand the question okay so
what what has happened is Erlang comes
to two companies as an absolutely
necessary platform I mean there are many
use cases where you will not come around
you will not be able to avoid a rabbit
or react or things like that and the
price you pay for that is you have to
know early you have to know how operate
on it it starts with reading the logs I
mean not just in the current project
I've experienced people looking at the
locks and saying uh-huh
what is that my eye just catches within
a millisecond what is wrong there and
since they have introduced they finally
introduced line numbers
but I didn't need them before as well
you may have money in you you probably
know where to search for what to look
for so I wouldn't say it's easier now
but the necessity is bigger and those
implementations building on top of
erling are doing a great job for that
the guys are smart and the guys aren't
real experts they know how to use it
some more work needs to be done to push
it into enterprises but I think it's
just a matter of probably two three
years before they realized hey there are
technologies around we cannot avoid and
we have to work with them and as I said
the price you pay for that is Erlang
so whenever you go to an enterprise
customer and make a big react
installation whatever take care of
teaching the knurling because other what
otherwise they will hate you
any other questions how do you feel
about the limitations that pointing to
like this yeah time world yes
I wouldn't yeah if you like just get
yourself the copy of the book it talks
about the limitations as well I have a
whole example there with with calendar
and how how much it sucks
so actually what what you don't want to
build upon maybe some people will
disagree with it but you will not build
a classic and the price application on
early he will build a messaging system
of early he will be the chat engine
built chat Angela darling who will
probably build the first mile the first
connection point for your web
application and go behind the scenes
this is my honest opinion but other
people are doing also a great job in and
simplifying those things things as well
so yes I'm I'm very absolutely aware of
limitations and you need to deal with
them whenever you touch them but
probably what but I also what was
interesting in John Paul Tsongas you can
avoid them
you know you you need to avoid them
because what you buy with are like the
distribution the massive parallelism
it's just too tasty not to try it out
and even if the price for that is a
little bit of string handling there so
probably you will find a solution for
that
I know it's it's difficult you know
but I don't see I really don't see a
point to re-implement a whole complex
distributed system in in Java for
example right now there is a couple of
them around they are pretty cool but
anyway I'm not into reinventing the
wheel it should should just use what as
what is around there are much more
limitations trust me it's like any
single thing in this technical world has
its limits
right it's it's not a fully proposed
library saw the full purpose ecosystem
that you could use for programming any
possible solution
go away
limit yourself say like just go for
messaging but at every point in time you
can control the situation that you
really have to deal with things and then
just skipping your language and skipping
to something different yes you're
absolutely right it's a it's an
interesting point I think that what has
happened actually is that this
development of using our link for things
that Erlang wasn't originally thought
for it just has completely overhauled
the developers the maintenance and for
example - I did a great job and then
pushing new stuff into that because
because it just needs some more you know
just need some more fat just need some
more bacon on top of your bones and I
think it will evolve but I'm not really
involved into this this development
process I'm just the user of the
platform so in order to have this
platform distributed spread more widely
around the world I think those those
pretty simple things should change
really but right now we have to deal
with them this is the current situation
they'll probably just just gotta get up
just check out the code just just sign
the contract and you can try to change
this
I think it has to change some means the
students know that everything is a fire
everything is a telephone exchange well
yeah it depends again it depends I mean
it's when you will you deal with massive
concurrency real massive concurrence you
don't have like four actors that
exchange messages but you cannot predict
how many you have have like millions of
them things will get real hairy so
this is a very good fit from what when
you try to project the telephone and
network thinking onto this problem and
try to solve it what this means it's not
it's not only about that I think I think
it's it's just it just needs more
well reusable implementations on top of
it that others can use it should do a
better job probably for bid for the
beginners to get in because well you set
up the environment and here you start
are like programming probably after two
weeks if you just write read the book
and and that's it but you didn't touch
the the VM yet he didn't touch like
100,000 different switches there he
didn't touch them you didn't yet
understand what are the buttons you need
to understand the patterns in your
program probably have one single process
that gets flooded with messages so you
can tinker the queue and whatever it's a
little bit complex it's just it's just
coming from different use cases probably
there is a way to combine this with with
something different for a string
manipulation or whatever just web
applications because those people will
not get that deep into the problems but
from the history from the story point of
view this was necessary and still
necessary for you if you build a real
complex system on top apparently on top
of early
just one remark for similar and one some
improvement regarding stability
occasions for example you should
definitely take a little easier and he
can use it basically like airline
library maybe not in tiniest library but
you can use it just for one small tiny
concerned and by the duration of the
other complications very question that
the said about the surtax st. in
Galveston Texas finalist years of our
life having a better ATI introducing
like making things more straightforward
with introducing some more life still
pretty stable transaction to language
instead I rotate my usual nothing at all
and improve this
yeah it's an interesting approach I
didn't check out Alex here for URI
rushkoff ski pushed me a couple of times
into that his butt but anyway I will
check it out I just I just need some
time for that but probably some things
behind the scenes also need to to get
better or well to get more open
extendable and so on and so forth this
is say this is not a general purpose
platform you should be really aware
about it but in the modern world of big
data however you call it of things like
that it's I just didn't mentioned in my
big data book everything in about big
data just the big data term was like
every single time mentioned about
thousand times since like all the time I
don't like this term at all
it just says nothing about this so
anyway you deal with a lot of different
data patterns how data arrives how how
you have to process it at some point you
will end up using early for some use
cases or in Erlang based technology you
will
just for fun
no well I mean yes of course if you are
on the JVM you you end up not having a
tail recursion optimization whatever but
when you when your base case works it's
fine but well you're absolutely right
it's it's a fun comment there I try to
use recursion for things that I can
predict are not endless what I wouldn't
use this for example guava for pseudo
functional programming on the chair in
Java on the JVM because actually I did a
lot of several talks on that the coat
you end up with this longer actually
than the imperative variant and the
question is why it should get shorter ok
so if you don't have any questions I
think we have a break right now so don't
you remember about this concurrent book
how getting thing three persons in front
of the table thank you very much again
well this is unfair</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
