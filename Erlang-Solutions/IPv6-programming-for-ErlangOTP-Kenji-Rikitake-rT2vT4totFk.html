a professor of Kyoto University my day
job is about the internet security at
kyoto university but only is one of my
research works for the password plus
three or four years and this is actually
my third time to be a speaker and i'm
very honored to speak about the network
technology at this time again to
everyone of you on this stuff on the on
the in this presentation i'm going to
give a plot the brief introduction of
ipv6 programming for our own OTP so let
me talk about the debrief I mean the
presentation briefed on the summary is
that ipv6 owner it's very very easy so
you just you just try it if you don't
have time to listen to this chance whole
presentation just try it answer how home
the manual is there the operating system
is there and everything is there and if
you don't even if you don't have this
connection connectivity of ipv6 you can
try it on the Iroko host or no local
networks so my presentation will be on
like this on first brief introduction to
ipv6 the next around 100 100 a way of
hunting of IP addresses and I'd like to
talk about the other oltp tcp/ip
architecture forward for a little bit
and then I will talk about ipv6
advocating examples and problem in
football pitfalls and there's a little
bugs and issues of alternate renounce of
all 15 be so I am going to explain that
as a as a what is a future issues of the
presentation to conclude this
presentation so first of all to
summarize on this presentation I trying
ipv6 on Ernie it's very very easy
because are all 15 we can handle ipv6
services very well the only thing you
have to worry about is that address
format which I'm going to explain in
this
citation and about FTB six it's already
ready on major operating systems for
example master breivik's distributions
including boonton and Debian now of
course freebsd or net PSD or openbsd or
whatever bsd and windows 7 of course and
even you can do it on the Vista or
actually I'm running it I'm running XP
and on ipv6 and and it's a little bit
limited but it still be capable of ipv6
to and most of you have we have problem
of obtaining our external connectivity
so I recommend you to try free trainer
honoring services for up for testing
tunnel ring means are transporting a vb6
datagrams over ipv4 packets so I
recommend a hurricane electric stronger
walker it's a it's a free service you
have to register yourself with your user
name and address or other contact
information but hurricane hurricane
electric is generous enough to provide
you on frito no ipv6 journal for
experiment and I've heard that from
Twitter that one one of the person who
tweet it to me that there's another
service called google net Go Go six net
so you can you can try out you can
investigate yourself a little bit more
about the all those services so what is
ipv6 ipv6 stands for internet protocol
version 6 um 40 for the trivia there is
no version 5 and there will not be
version 7 I don't know whether we watch
or 82 version 9 may be some kind of some
other countries will make it their own
version but its version 6 anyway and and
it's been a very very long time since
the inception of ipv6 the original
recommendation of IDF was in 1994 on
July it was called I PNG new generation
of an IP and the code base of ipv6 of
protocol stack have already stabilized
by 2006 I put the name of them
for total in Japanese and it's Japanese
based project and those pioneers put the
ipv6 code into a lots of protocol stacks
for example PSD and there's another
example called code Usagi Usagi for
rabbits and it's for Linux so anyway
it's already ready and the big
difference between our PB 6 and ipv4 is
about address space that's a core
difference in apple before we've only
got 32 bits but I on ipv6 we have 128
bits and I'd like to emphasize that ipv4
address blocks have already been used up
by februari 2011 all books have been
assigned and people who still depend on
our PVC v4 have to recycle the existing
space and the price of IPP phosphate
outer space is getting higher and higher
every month so if you want to explain
extend a large scale I mean if you want
to deploy a lot of scale applications
you should migrate to ipv6 as soon as
possible because the new users will not
be assigned ipv4 addresses at all on so
them they will they may be only able to
use ipv6 and this and especially for
server-side ipv4 address is getting more
and more expensive so you have to think
about the ipv6 service what here you'll
be ok
okay thanks all right um let's talk
about how I PVC works on ipv6 the
address structure is totally different
there will be a two parts one network
another one host and the the network
part will be spread it into a two part
48 bit of global ID which represents
your own organization or on the
individual identifier and the subnet
which can be assigned at your own
discretion and there will be a host part
host part is on ipv4 host bar is solely
assigned by the administrator through
dhcp or whatever static statically but
it's it's not as wide as ipv6 but on
ipv6 hosts ID is supposed to be first
automatically generated generated from
the hardware derived address such as mac
address on internet so that everybody on
ipv6 can communicate with each other at
least on their links links means on the
base networks without any configuration
this is a there's a technical term on
ipv6 technology code its stake result
configuration and this is required for
brute I'm name neighbor discovery which
I'm gonna explain later and of course
you can assign your own way of our PVC
clatters by state stateful configuration
through dhcp version 6 it's uh it's
different it's different from my PB for
so long implementing dhcpv6 cells
totally different things and I'm going
to explain I'm not going to explain it
further than this presentation but you
can you can search web search web or the
other related documentation of about
details and since host address is proper
to all hardware this could be discovered
by the malicious people so that the same
Hardware connected to two different
different networks could be discovered
by tracing the connecting connection law
so IDF has
already standardized the host ID the way
of randomizing the host ID for to an
enhanced privacy so one machine could
have multiple addresses lots of
addresses maybe not not only wanted to
maybe 100 or 200 or maybe more that's
way how r pv6 works and this is a very
the most different part from ipv4 on
ipv6 on my GPS six addresses are 8 16
bit hex numbers so I'm that this example
is the 20 21 dv8 this prefix is for
documentation only this prefix doesn't
exist on ITV IV v 6 30 network this is
guaranteed by RC and it's a cafe babe
Facebook or whatever not though the yeah
this is the this is a you can find this
example a lots of this kind of example
on the internet but and of course on
like in ipv4 there's a net mask and it's
usually / 64 so that this part is
network part and the right but this part
is host part and but this is not there's
not there's no standard about fixing
this 264 this could be 56 or eighty or
ninety six this is as variable as as as
in the ipv4 yes so just but just
remember 64 is the typical value and the
consecutive zeros can be abbreviated as
double cone so if you want to talk about
the network part only and the rest of
these things are 0 just say something
right kappa babe and trash 64 it's
almost almost as the same as ipv4 and
local host address on ipv6 is there's no
127 anymore you just put zeros so the
double colon 1 this is all co-host and
this is another example when you put the
two when you put these zeros between two
nonzero numbers you just you just take
out all the zeros and substitute with
double cone and and the next next thing
is important if you want to implement
the young browser
or other kind of a HTTP based software
on url url Collins Collins can be
confused by the discontent actually
specifying the port part of the URL so
RC 5952 and RFC 38 6 specifies you have
to use brackets square brackets to cover
the ipv6 part of others so if you are
going to make a program I lappy vista
compatible I'll think about this
produced do keep your mind about this
and reverse fruit cup format of ipv6 is
even more complicated if you want to
make a reverse address a reverse look up
zone for this network you have to put it
back on the reverse because it's a
reverse lookup button all the way down
like this so and put every dot after
each digit so it's going to be a EV a
something something something ip6 dot
alpha this is a reverse look up zone and
one things i have to tell you is that
it's really hard to manage manually of
this kind of stuff so i recommend you to
make some sort of automatic 0
automatically management's off for this
thing and for the further details you
can see my v6x module which is on the
github under my under my repository on
it's 400 those hex digits so what is
ipv6 are different for I actually
different from the ipv4 it uses
expensive usermod cast multicast and
every broadcast on the ipv4 are called
Monta cast and you use ipv4 what is a
dumb ipv4 broadcast on the link level
and that is substituted by a link level
multicast if the address begins with FF
0 2 it's all multicast address and every
multicast scope has the different
address odd I mean others numbers
assigned like FF 0 150 or two and
there's a protocol called a neighbor
discovery protocol in ipv6 it's
so it's discovering your neighbor once
you're fired up in on a network once
your host is fired up the network and it
does all the shore station advertisement
of routers and hosts just solely
dependent on the RP v6 only you don't
have to use others are or the others
reservation protocol anymore and this
NDP is part of icmpv6 so you don't have
to worry about up or anything on 956 and
this is the complicated one but I have
to explain this on ipv6 routers no
longer make packet fragments so if you
send a very large pocket to the router
router just discard the packet exceeding
them MTU which stands for maximum
transmission maximum transmitting it and
this message called hey your packet is
too big so if you send a very big packet
to the router the router if the router
don't accept it the router will send
back this message and your and you have
to make a your packets a little smaller
or even more more more smaller to make
the make it fit into the MTU value so
and one thing good about ipv6 is that
that many minimum MTU has been extended
from 500 76 rights to 1280 bytes this is
sufficient for most use unless you are
going to handle very large diagrams like
50 or 60 kilobytes per Datagram or
whatever well but if but if you are
going to make a ROG UDP packets
connections such as a network file
system or secure dns I mean the DNS sack
but this restriction because you can
expect operating systems will negotiate
about this what is a end-to-end MTU but
sometimes operating system goes buggy so
every application may also need to be
aware of passing to you I i I'd like to
tell you this because from my experience
on investigating on the DNS security
programs so of course in the
specification this is the operating
system protocol issue so you don't have
to be worried about this much but just
keep in mind that it's about the host to
host them to you and you the routers
will no longer care about the empty use
anymore so one more there's a there's a
special I part of ipv6 addresses called
ipv4 mapped address and this it's sort
of mixed notation or you see this is
ipv4 address and if it comes after
something kong-kong something double
column ffff this represents ipv4 knows
within ipv6 address space and that this
can be used when you want to treat ipv4
and ipv6 connection on the same server
socket so that the the receiving program
can handle on the ipv6 and ipv4
communication simultaneously but I'd
like to tell you that some operating
system disables this functionality for
day for the right reason right reason
means ipv4 and I that are not Sofia of
the separation of ipv4 one ipv6 and the
separate programs this kind of feature
this kind of address can be very
confusing and could call security breach
so so there's a lot there's a to our
seats I'm on state here but those I have
seized we can't
reasons and all I can tell you yes yes
Joe I'm not saying that your stack is
not desired it's dual stack your stuff
means ipv4 and ipv6 coexisting in the
same operating system I am done this is
about the treating on the same server
socket serversocket about the ipv4 and
ipv6 connection but simultaneously and
that is not recommended on the current
internet operation ok so now finally
goes to Allah okay on Alan ipv6 address
format is eight element couple of 16-bit
unknowns on the unsigned integers this
is this is a familiar type declaration
and ipv4 address is 0 to 255 and it has
fallen elements Oh ipv6 address it has
zero to 660 65535 and it has eight at
888 part and there's a address family
type and you have to remember i knit and
inet6 adams these two atoms are very
important on distinguish RPV ipv4 and
ipv6 connections and there's a very
convenient function that converting your
address into the proper format of topple
and even decide whether the address is
ok or not by prepending this and but one
one one thing you have to be careful is
that these are written in decimal so
it's not hexadecimal so it's very hard
to read oh if you if you are dealing
with the app store network configuration
so there is a tip thanks I have to say
thanks to fight about whether well for
telling me about this idea you just put
16 6
team pound 16 hash into every
hexadecimal numbers so that you can
convert this part manually just typing
it without using functions so that the
result is same I mean that adding
16-pound fixed for prefix to hex numbers
will ease coding ipv6 address with our
own topics and so if you are if you have
to hard code all the addresses addresses
and doing this will ease you a little
bit okay so and let me let me explain a
little bit this hey yeah and actually I
ran it on my own elana interpreter I
mean I mean our own vm and the it's
converted like this and the oh my i i i
made my own program called v6x atop
topple to converting this stuff back
into the 16 something and actually it
gives string because there's no other
way to do representing this but you know
just feel free to use this program
because I'm a licensed it I license all
this program based on MIT license so
let's get back to the presentation yep
all right so let me explain about the
LNO TPI tcp/ip architecture before going
further I was actually astonished and by
reading the source code of an entire ed
thinks but oh of course and there's a
user application on the highest layer
and the user application called jen tcp
or jen UDP ojsc tips thing density
functions and these functions even
calling the lower layer lower layer
functions like I net I need TCP or I
need UDP or inet6 TCP or in its six UDP
for ipv6 and these functions even
calling though even lower level program
called free minute and this
function is the the lowest module lowest
layer module written in allah and pre
mine it what prima and it does is
actually calling inot drivers of the
link to in drivers of island virtual
machine within c code so this is only
the interface module and the the other
sequels finally cause portable stack so
you have to go to all these two layers
to do the iron networking so and this is
there's a pros and cons but good thing
about this is that jenti CP and jane UDP
this stuff have already been already
been a very high abstraction layer so
you don't have to do with the details of
the ipv4 and ipv6 on here other than
addresses so let me tell you about this
in other way in other words you need
very little modifications after all and
because as I said before I Allinol DP
network code is very highly abstract and
OTP lot but the OTP library once this
really was distinguished between ipv4
and ftp said those families because of
reason that they are implemented in
different modules so you have to think
about the which address primary you are
going to use exactly of this because of
the same reason about the to avoid the
confusion of the draw I mean de at the
ipv4 mapped ipv6 address and if you call
connect and listen functions you have to
put inet option in gen TCP function so
that the so that the function will use
the ipv6 facility on the island OTP
system and the good news is that's
almost all you need to do so when you
put the ipv6 address
just lean into the existing function and
set the proper address from a parameter
into IP I inet6 that's all you that's
that's all you've got to do and they
then the pre my net or lower lower level
driver will let you connect in the ipv6
so i am going to quote mochi web code
actually i'm still are stealing a little
bit of code and then it's in the multi
WebSocket server module and multi
naughty well in multi web there's a
function called ipv6 supported and this
function is to determine whether the
host supports ipv6 it's doing a very
simple task that if the name localhost
is resolvable to double column one which
represents the ipv6 address for the
local host and there's a convenient
function called inet get get addr get
address which looks up the dns and
return the address for the specified
family so at this part this function try
to look up the v6 address a local host
and if it exists and returns ok as a
first tournament of the topple then ipv6
will be supported but if it gives you in
an error and then ipv6 will not be
supported this is the young the simple
example of the heart how to deal with
the ipv6 on the LA and on Jen TCP
connect you have to think about the
other other factor I I write I write it
as an earl I natasi and this is a file
name of the option options given to the
island virtual machine at the start of
time and you can give a lot of options
such as default modules for tcp or UDP
or ctp and as a default value they are
all you
all set to use ipv4 as default but if
you want to use the ipv6 as the default
you have to set the on this line tcp
comma 9 a-6 and over tcp for I for ipv4
so that the am if so that the default
connection mode is ipv6 this affects the
the action of gin TCP connect if the
address is a hostname since the since
there's no information about the house-
house name represents ipv4 address ipv6
address you have to decide and you you
have decided by the external parameter
about this so yes and if this party if
this function is given an address it is
automatically decided by the length of
the top of the of the address if it is
for it is ipv6 if you did 28 it I'm
sorry if it's for if you do we'll be
happy before but if it is a it would be
ipv6 so if address is a top o this
problem will not occur but if the others
is a hostname are you have to set a line
at RC appropriately so you you can do
what you want and you see the same
behavior on Jan UDP and Jen sctp as well
and i'm going to introduce more
convenient functions there's a lot of
functions listed here you can convert
other string into top o or top o enter
the string that's in nine eight parts
called n to a number to address and you
can you can convert I mean you can look
up multiple address for the same
hostname in the same host family I mean
I'm sorry same address Flannery called I
need get addresses and there's a another
generic function called top oh I get
host by address which is which
represents a pretty much terminal name
of
function i'm in c library function of
unix and this is another module called
Annette Annette rest- reads over here
and there's a 2 dns back end go get host
by address and get lost by the name and
to use this you all you have to do a
sign it our i Natar see if you want to
return inet6 address as a primary
address and in this case if you set this
flag in the IRI net RC o ipv4 records
will be represented as a ipv4 map to
ipv6 address you know you have to be
careful about this arm and yes so our I
just take a brief look at the various
programs to find out if the O's programs
support ipv6 and the easiest way to do
is just grab mine at six it's very easy
grip minus six and you find the you you
find the the code specific to ipv6 by a
grant by the searching the ERL or hrl
files and i find i find that most of tcp
based web servers are ok multi web is ok
and we also okay to you also is ok to
and including ssl and TSL those those
modules are already ipv6 capable so you
don't have to make a measure a measure
what is a modification on running these
and on network testing tools such as
tune and each and the java d those are
provided by the process one these for
these programs are also ipv6 compatible
so you can try it out of the box but if
you are doing something some sort of
black magic such as a hand ring I PVC
mpv six you have to rewrite the Soho
code for example
was a very convenient code called prop
cat which is written by a person person
named Michael Santa's which he
contributes a lot about the networking
in general on Ellen and this is circuit
TWiki in told and you can generate
whatever kind of data datagrams
including ICMP or whatever onto the
network but his program did not support
icmpv6 because the protocol number of
icmpv6 actually 58 is different from IPP
mcmc be four which is one and so you can
see my experimental example for can
github for photo for the details and i I
just I don't I didn't make much
different I'm much modification I only
put a few lines five or ten lines about
this but you can you can do you can
experiment very easy on on this pocket
code so we I recommend you to take a
look at this and the try this by own you
buy your own hands so let me tell you
about how to choose ipv4 or ipv6 on the
actual running server as I told you arm
serving ipv4 and ipv6 on the same socket
is sometimes is often confusing and it's
not recommended and it's me it's even
disabled in the some operating systems
so I recommend you to use them simply
use multiple instances serving the same
same way to say same virtual server
server on the web or TCP servers and use
at least one for each protocol that that
would be the simplest solution and for
the DNS you have to choose whether ipv6
first or ipv4 first or you don't care on
you have to have a preference strategy
and there's an hour see called RSC three
484 and in this RFC lots of different
strategies are described but they
generally
recommends ipv6 first then ipv4 for an
obvious reason that I ETF once ipv6 to
be used on the actual networks but three
on the reality now very few sites still
less than 1% I think use our ipv6
capable so you have to be very careful
on make a dns resolution ipv6 because it
blocks it will block the whole operation
until it finds the ipv6 address is
non-existent and it will take 10 or 20
or even 10 seconds so I I wrote a piece
of code with with simple workaround like
look up looking up code a cadre which
represent ipv6 address record called a
resource record first with time out
approximately about 200 milliseconds or
even shoulder so that the ipv6 add this
limited-time ipv6 Gibbs is given a
preference and if this is not found
looking up a a means ipv4 resource
record after that so that it can fall
back to ipv4 great free and you can find
the example code in my VC exact viscous
module in this function so take a look
at this they take a look at this code if
you have any interest and i would like
to I'd like to tell what I found during
the during this experiment and
investigation for this presentation
about our 15 be there this is very
unfortunate but distributed iron ore on
pc v6 doesn't work in our 15 be for a
very simple reason that EPMD does not
support ipv6 listen ipv6 socket on the
server side i trace the packet exchange
between the two distributed knows on
ipv6 you with
the provided module called inet6 tcp
extra line at tcp 9 a-6 tcp dist module
but actually on the two virtual machines
try to exchange only on ipv6 packets and
the EPMD doesn't listen on ipv6 thought
so so they note connection did not
establish and there's a patch existing
for this but unfortunately this is
rejected for our 5150 p.01 and the
person rejected this told it I did it
crashes windows implementation so if one
of the if wanna live in on Linux or a
previously like I do of course I I'm
nothing against windows but windows a
little bit hard to acquire thing so if
you want to try this page you can find
it by searching it on google it's um
it's written by michael santos and he's
his i think he's very very very good at
this kind of thing and what i'm
expecting no on the EPMD the future
direction about this is to put the
multiple demins my inventory for the one
for ipv6 one for ipv4 so that the two
protocols can be handled independently
of course this is just a just an
assumption and this is just the proposal
or I'll see a proposal or my wish but
handling multiple transport on the same
one server is a kind of confusing so I
don't know how OTP team will be dealing
with this problem but they should be
dealing with this in very soon if they
want to deploy I've deployed ipv6
networks with Alan and there's another
issue called interface identifiers
interface this interface identifier or
IEDs is not supported on the current
rollin because because our current I'll
implementation of ipv4 or ipv6 do not
support any kind of Monte multicast
address as well and if you want to
support the app multicast properly you
have to specify what
the scope will be applied and for the
link layer I mean sorry ring scoped
multicast such as FF 0 to wo 1 i've
represented in a few slides ago and you
have to specify the interface name like
this after the percent this is specified
in error RC and this is not supported by
the other than I'll 15b now it's simply
ignored so somebody has to write the
code for this I think and of course
there is no raw socket support for icmp
as in the OTP and I don't know whether
if it's good or bad if OTP is going to
suppress such a black magic but
inventory if you want if you really want
to utilize a multicast or any cast
capability of ipv6 this functionality
will soon be needed I think so I'd like
to conclude this presentation by ang by
showing my acknowledgement and my and
reference actually it's Francisco who
suggested didn't make to give this talk
human he he told me that some old some
past audiences of his event wanted to
listen to listen about ipv6 so I i try
to do I try to do this at this time and
Michael Santos for all his code on the
pocket and various other patches and
Frederick and Fred for 16 16 pound
prefix which is obvious but I I didn't
have this idea until he told me so I
created his name and and all of you
participants who kindly listen to my
presentation today and last but lost but
not least these are the URLs if this
these are too small just search my name
on the on the Google or whatever the
search engine and pick up the github
page then you can find it this V success
stuff and of course you can find mochi
web and the prop cat and mine is forked
under my repository and if you have if
you have to
investigate by yourself the key word is
I knit I net configuration is described
in Earth's user's guide and there's inet
module on the colonel reference manual
and there's a lot of named prefix why I
net I net resign address or I need DB or
whatever and of course if you want to
add read the source code you you you can
you should read all these stuff actually
10 or 20 of source files actually
printed out all those things and browse
it about 100 or 200 pages over over this
this size of paper but then reading the
source code sometimes saves you a lot of
time so I do recommend reading the ion
source code it's not see called it's
short other than its articles shorter
and easier to understand sherry and I'd
like to show you three reference books
number one is the tcp/ip illustrated
this is an old book the first edition
was published in 1990s but the latest
edition published in 2012 it's
completely revised revised and wrinkled
includes details of ipv6 so even if you
own the first edition I recommend you to
take a look at the second edition and
that there's another book called unix
network programming this is a this is
also an old-school book but this is also
revised in 2004 as a third edition and
this includes a lot of new stuff such as
an interfacer interface identifier and
other stuffs and there's an introductory
good inductor II reading book called
khodam migrating applications to ipv6
which is from O'Reilly and you can buy
it about five dollars on the e-book and
it's not the thick book it's a very same
book and it's written by our expert
called down yoke and I think isn't he
his in Paris for ITF now oh and he's his
he actually explained very well on the
generic issues
on the migrating any kind of
applications of any language from ipv4
to ipv6 so I recommend you to take a
look up this trip and take a look at
this book so okay just conclude my
presentation and thanks any questions
yes yes in some functions the address
family is required not it's not an
update required it's not it's a
mandatory requirement could you repeat
question are you you cannot sign it I
986 Pam option simultaneously the
question is that you whether you can pop
a sign at an analysis 6 fashion
simultaneously to your same same
function and then just take a look at
take a look at the document as well as
long as I took take a look at the
documentation on you can't pass you
cannot pass the time these two
simultaneously um ok the question is
that our own illness suppose ipv4 and
ipv6 sockets ipv4 to ipv6 office but
that's what you said um duck on that
kind of notion I think does not exist in
IP in Ireland you have to on the old the
only thing on the only hace d for v4 and
v6 circuit socket you can have is that
they are they on the receiver side I'm
in the server side which only accepts
ipv4 either ipv4 or ipv6 socket at the
same time
can't pass you can't paso forward ipv4
to ipv6 or something like that and back
and forth I'm sorry I haven't tested the
moment by myself but as long as I read
they all the are only all things on the
internet I think I think I think you you
can do that thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
