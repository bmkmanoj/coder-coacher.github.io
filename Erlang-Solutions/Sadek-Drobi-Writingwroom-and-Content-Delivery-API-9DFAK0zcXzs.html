problems
right that's why that's why I spent you
know last year maybe just working on on
trying to see how can we solve that
problem once and for all and the pretty
much that talk will be about about that
so it fundamentals of fixing our content
management problem they don't see like
all of these are obvious surprisingly no
one has done any like all of these
together so let's start by well myself
I am sorry Ruby I worked I co-created
the pipe framework which brings
functional programming into web
programming to the CDN and regular
programming to the Union for Scala and
Java and for a year now I'm working on
prison acai oh I found it for everything
I wrote together with a founder of white
primer and we're trying to solve all the
problems with that so what is a problem
the problem is manageable content right
it's basically a lot of suffering and
other because of exactly the management
problem now what does it mean that
management corner the manageable content
well first what does it mean complex
welcome it is everywhere right we have
websites we have positives all the lives
you know Web Apps any kind of forgiving
TV at all then they will have put it at
some point right some like I would like
to change that that when we get into
into the manager what I want I'd like to
be able to change that content great new
content modifying 60 type was all these
kind of things that a manageable
manageable content right and then
whenever we get into this kind of demand
so imagine that you have your web app
your website whatever you
and if someone asks you put it for for
having like manageable content then you
get like one of three choices that all
of them are very hard choices so the
first one is like okay I'm going to hard
put content in that application and
anytime you change anything I'm going to
redeploy complete push new files
whatever kind of process that is
completely not adapted for this kind of
thing right anytime anyone has to change
anything or fixing typos you should
contact a developer or anyone that can
put that content into obviously that
doesn't work so the second thing you get
to think of like okay I'm going to use a
content management management system
right CMS's are all wrong they try to at
least they claim to solve the content
management problem and then once you
download that content management system
try to work with it use you slowly put
your application inside that put the
management system and abandon your
ecology so basically you are your
developer web developer and whatever
kind of developer your technology base
like your programming language could be
on the JVM Scala or Java it could be
aligning with the Haskell any kind of
language that allows you like to Ruby
JavaScript and then at the time you
decide that you want to integrate a
content management system
exactly it's exactly the time that we
will abandon your technology slowly
because the content management system
comes with its own technology its own
framework its own way of building things
so there's a problem out there and this
is exactly what right now is like what
what is the problem with content
management system and why don't they
solve that problem of course there is a
third a third solution which is also
very greater than full of that like I'm
going to write from scratch my my stuff
I'm going through my own current
management basically I was
some editors and I will try to make some
interface for my users to be able or for
my content writers to be able to change
the content and seems in the beginning
seem like what what is it like it's a
database and we pull that data and put
it in forms and that's it and you can
start with these kind of ideas to build
your own from the management system
until you discover that it's really not
that easy it's much harder than what it
looks like so there are there are
problems actually we need to solve them
so now we get into the question like why
why CMS don't leverage their promises
they promise to solve the containment
problem what is the problem with with
content matrices and all of them that we
know today
well there's a fundamental focused
problem okay it's an existence on
problem if there is little flow in the
design of every CMS that exists today in
the industry and that that is so they
try to help you design websites they are
trying to help you build up build iPhone
app build whatever apps mobile apps they
try to do kind of the wrong thing right
and they try to focus on constructing
and this is a historical problem
but basically like a much area when we
started doing like websites and so on
building a website was something like
not that common you know like you would
you know you don't know what the
technology to use for doing that now a
long time ago and then like same as will
tell you what I promise you you just
drag and drop things and I will get your
design your your website design right
that started with a lot of tools by that
I mean we still continue on that
misconception content management system
is about building websites or building
things where it's not actually so
basically that if I take that since
first promise and acquired today it
means like CMS's today should be
designing more violence and they tried
today that's their marketing like we can
do mobile apps or we can do flat design
we can do whatever you know we can build
things just by driving and drag and drop
so basically when you you try to like to
hear these promises and try to implement
with that you'll find yourself losing
your applications inside the CMS you
know take whatever team has existed a
proposed rule whatever it is and then
you will start being your business logic
inside that CMS with it CMS technology
and as image technology which this
modules is complexity you spend all your
energy trying to understand their way of
doing stuff because again they they
focusing on the wrong thing it's a
problem of focus they focusing on
building stuff instead of that the focus
that you should be doing it which is
managing content so and guess what
designer designer developer is a
full-time though I mean building things
is what they've offered up designing
things with designer does so they got a
management system should not be solving
these things okay and the you know
design like a developer will pick like a
finished favorite technology whatever
like it happens to be in that in that
particular day that is adapted to what
he is trying to do basically if I'm
writing for iOS and I don't want
right anywhere I can I could just go
ahead and write native apps or you know
Ling Java with Android yeah I could
write in hostile and at the same it
should not be telling me what signals to
use that's my choice I'm the developer
and I'm in that building and I will use
what I want for building my stuff and
also designed in the design side that
the problem is similar because every
month we are giving about new things in
design like we started like we were
doing like a lot of shadows and panels
and we started saying like it should be
flat designed and like long shadow and
whatever every day and you know parallax
design all these trends into designing
will keep changing now the CMS by
claiming to do the design they will keep
from trying to run behind these trends
right trying to run behind the design
trends and they will never succeed
what's happening in the browser the
JavaScript and CSS it's impossible for a
CMS company to run behind that and
suggest you to for building website that
leverages all these opportunities design
opportunities right so as we talk it's a
fundamental focused problem and
basically they should be rather doing
one thing and doing it good which is
managing code right and that's what the
name is made for like content management
it's not website building systems or
whatever other thing is content
management so they should be focusing on
content management now we need to define
what content management because since
everyone forgot about how how to define
content and what is content management
right and that's what we are we talking
about like later so the first thing we
need to do and it's obvious by now the
first thing the first very thing that we
need to do for solving the content
problem is to decouple content from
presentation ok presentation to
something and content is something else
all right
and whenever whenever I have content
then I can put that content and display
the way I want okay
you think my favorite technology of
course right because we separated that
okay we don't put style into the content
with a structure we give it a structure
and more structure I give more
manageable content more flexible the
content will be for the presentation
side it's very simple
while decoupling these things and
structure our content we give a lot of
opportunities for presentation even if I
want to change the sign I want to change
things I go present in different places
structured content can help me and we
will see even like more about so again
we structure content and manage it and
let developers integrate that content in
their product whatever it is okay and
that's where the title comes from comes
from so basically what what we should be
doing not rather is having the content
management side which is a writing room
where content managers or content
writers will go and write their content
modified instrument where they do all
what they have to do in that particular
place and then open an API that allows
developers to query that content in all
different ways and put that content and
display and present it with their own
technology right very simple so
basically the first thing with it is
abandon the presentation with content
management system should not be doing
presentation and the first thing and
then we should be rather caring about
how to manage content and so content
problems for content writers and put an
API which will be an interface between
the presentation and the content
repository
whatever we want to call it okay now
there are different things that we need
to solve with that concept right like
the content management problems we need
to solve the content management problem
so as I said here so writing room to
help content writers write and expertise
experiment with content ideas and a
powerful content query API that will
name the proper to do all kind of
queries on that point in because we
structured it so so here are the
fundamentals that I think are very
important just so that content
management problem the first thing so
what we're saying is that we need
anytime we have content okay involved we
need to try to structure now what does
it mean to structure content basically
instead of having your WYSIWYG that just
will have everything inside some HTML or
something we'll break it up into
fragments right so we have content we
break it up break it down into into like
different fragments so if we have I have
a product let's say I have this product
okay it's a cupcake now of course I can
have all that in some way in a queasy
way that whatever
HTML mixed with style but also what I
could do is break it into fragments I
could say like okay in this guy in this
product okay what I see on the screen
and I have a title okay and I have a
short title and I have short description
a flavor and a main image and the
products moving okay by doing that okay
I structured my
broke it into different fragments every
product now if I say this problem is
exactly like we do in programming right
we do document on so basically we'll do
a document I'm out of this thing the
first thing we will do is do a document
up that was saying what exactly a
product is for me once we did that and
we give it to content writers to to like
you know now of course that doesn't mean
that content writers should be filling
out the forms I mean we should not it
doesn't mean that content writers should
be writing into a database or something
right
we should also suggest for Roger content
writers a good content writer that still
favors structured content okay so
basically where we're at with structured
content but yet we provide a very nice
uncomfy editor for constant writers to
write their content basically they
wanted writer he will see this say okay
I need to write the main information
which is a product name write the
description and and then the image now
someone can ask you like here you got
some style or whatever it's like link
one here we got ball isn't it like style
well actually we could have metadata on
the text for instance by saying like
this is important for me and this is
link that's okay that's still structure
we're not talking about style here we
say blue or black or whatever it is we
said this this triple chocolate is
something important and this chocolate
cream is just like
again we just structured our content in
some way we give it give it
Twitter that they could or could not be
used by by someone that is credited in
the presentation
all right so basically here if we can
see in this text we don't see the link
we don't see that dad and I important
what's supposed to be bold in here
because we chose to ignore that method
and we just show the text as is okay
because I structure something we can
choose whatever we want to do but not
only that I could it's nice I could
write down what whatever I want and I
want it right now but also when I will
be adding this image I need a image
editing right because again try that I
should give them a comfortable content
factor content editing tool so basically
here I would be able to choose what that
image only a to be able to profit but
we're talking about structured data even
image and instructions in some way so
basically I could I could in my document
type I should be able to say well the I
need an image and this is the product
image our that image I need it in three
formats
okay I need it in like 500 5 500 by I
needed also add icon 250 250 pixels more
and more structure even on images like
on anything you should be able to
structure because once you structure you
give a lot of opportunities for for
designers and you know the boppers due
to use that structure ok so the first
thing is and once I did that I could
present the same product that I
presented this this way here I could
present it in a different way just the
icon for instance
and I pick up whatever I want from it
okay so here I'm presenting all the
products in the same way that I is the
same product that I only wrote once
right
pre obvious okay so the first thing is a
complete writing tool and structural
content and a content and coffee
content editor the second thing we need
to do is you know to version so
basically for managing content correctly
we need to allow again content writers
to experiment with content now what does
it mean to experimental content means
like I have any document or any product
I should be able to think about
different ideas of common law let's try
to describe this color product different
and see what it looks like let's try to
add a different image
maybe crop that image in a different way
and this should not break the work of
anyone right I could just make a new
version and since like if I'm versioning
everything I'm making a person out of
any modification then nothing is lost
I can experiment I will not make
anything lost everything will exist
anyway right
so that's my own version I can do a drop
I can save it I can get back to it or I
can just completely drop it and go back
to what was happening is everything
should be version that's that's how you
allow you enable a content writers to
experiment with with content ideas and
also we need to be able to see what
others are experimenting right if I if
there's another team of content writers
that are working on something then they
need to be able to collaborate and see
what what each other is doing right
for instance here I'm working this
document I would like to see what
happened since the last time I visit
and I will see like this guy here he
added a few things here correctly a few
things and so on and so on I need to
have a full history a description of
what happened not just the versions I
need to have a comparison so that people
can experiment with ideas so very
important to have versioning and change
tracking tools for for a content
management tool to be useful now we
talked about like a different thing but
like what does it look like you know am
anything fun basically it's more or less
project oriented and most of these
problems they are so for us developers
because you know basically we give
ourselves that so that we don't give to
our users so what does it look like
content management it's very uh project
oriented basically someone will get into
like the commentary press room said like
today I'm going to write a new release
there is a new product the new iPad from
new whatever and I want to make a lot of
changes in the old website and all these
changes are related to one thing is the
new product or imagine I'm opening a new
song for my change and what oh what I
need there is like I need to make a lot
of changes all over the website maybe
some links some modification of subjects
all over the website but all of these
are linked to one project which is
opening a new shop ok or maybe my
project is just fixing tacos and that
would be a project on its own so we need
to organize changes not like in the way
they are done today in a content
management systems but rather not in the
in an exploded way but rather we should
group them into process that make sense
that's what management management should
be right someone will start the project
and everyone work to it pretty much I
guess most of you guys know about git
and github it's pretty much like a
branch or something right we have a
branch and we worked
and once it's ready now we publish all
these together right at once you don't
need to like schedule 10 10 changes each
of them schedule it for Wednesday at
noon because then I have to change that
date I have to change all of these
things should be one project that
contains a lot of changes and I push
them all together at once so that's it
basically this is what we have here you
have for instance and the San Francisco
grand opening so this pastry shop is
opening a new a new shop in San
Francisco and then everyone will be
working on on modifying all these things
there are all kind of contents in the
website to integrate that I got good
they are opening that thing but until
they publish that and that's that's also
at what means experimenting with with
content it's like exactly what we do
developers right we do a branch we work
on it making we abandon it we publish it
that's very I seem to be very volatile
for us but with no one ever done it for
my sister not only that now if I do that
it means I can see how my website will
look in the future right because I have
all these versions of document versions
or all these changes are linked to one
breath or of relief or the branch or
whatever now I could tell my website
well well big changes from that release
and then I can see my website in the
future that's exactly what what happens
here I go I go to the to the base
website and I say I choose that
particular release well of course with
authentication all what it means and
then I can see that website in the
future of course because I'm keeping all
these versions and I organized changes
into projects happens I could see also
some points in the balance anything
right I can even do a DNA test right
because I can have two or three or well
Tamar how many I won't release it and
then I can do some maybe testing to see
which which modification is the best for
what I'm trying to express that's very
easy right because it just you organize
content and content changes in a nice
way
and now we do have a lot of
possibilities right all these releases
if I can access all these sorry yeah all
these relations if I'm realizing this
way then I can do any testing between to
release imagine like that some physical
grand opening I start by distributing it
to some limited user like a base of
users and whenever I decide which one is
the best and I use it right and then do
anything special for that just to
organize your content in a way that
allow you to do so many so much with it
okay
so now that we got all this also we need
some kind of collaboration so we're
different and we already explained a bit
of this but you need to be able to
collaborate it it means like you need to
first experiment new things and they
need to suggest these changes to someone
and then to have some kind of approval
you know most content management system
will but rather focus up I was having
like 10 rolls of our hierarchy of roles
with 10 levels and you know one has
tools it's kind of a process goes from
one person to another I think it's a
educate validates but there is something
that again and developers we always do I
mean what developers always do with
github and solution like that it's
produced which means like I could hear
it might in my example I could have a
release okay which is a project for my
let's say like the new San Francisco
opening and then content writers will
change things and we'll push it into
that release or suggested because they
don't want to push they would say I
suggest that this could make it well
into that into that project and then
someone could approve it or not and
that's that's all what you need for
workflow right people to experiment in
you to do in their own versions of any
document and then stretch it out someone
will be reviewing and commenting on
these changes so basically if I have
that cupcake I will just start a new
track from that and whenever I am ready
I could push it into a release some of
that is my naming the release will be
able to I see notifications see the
change and approve it or not and maybe
even comment on it asks for more more
changes
again there's no magic there just the
fact that we organize things into
releases and you know what change it
into release it it allows us to do these
kind of things very easily right someone
pushing the release any way would make a
new release and then we can comment on
that or or include it into that okay now
we were talking only about that the
writing room fight off of the concept
right basically how to solve the content
management for content writers now we
said that we have also the ad I also
have to do some some sort of things at
the API level so that the integration of
that content forth for developers so the
first thing we for developers of course
I mean it should be like a VI but also
which we should it should be very
integrated into into that you know Ruby
if you do PHP JavaScript scala ever like
whatever issue you should just have some
kind of integration to unity technology
because the nurse API will allow you to
get that content but then these tools
will allow you time to present them in
some way for instance we showed that
that takes that we had into into the
description that had some metadata if I
did I can do some development kit I
could make some function that function
rating to that basically get it Astro
text basic I don't so you get that data
that is structured data a situation and
then that kid would be adding more
features on top of that like something
like if you just give it to me as a role
text or give me the first paragraph or
give me the third title
what have you you know anything that you
could add as conferences on top of that
data that was returned by the server and
that basically you're not solving the
presentation problem are you making the
presentation problem much easier by
integrating to simplifies the
integration of that content okay so I
was thinking about okay so so we're
talking about an nei browser and D for
magnitude M the whopping his level have
not integration but also let me maybe
like yeah so if I go for instance to
Eric was three-year okay
the API is basically I have some kind of
brother for that API I could search all
documents that I have is not repo and I
don't have like these pastries since
we're interested in the cupcakes in
cupcakes I can just choose to see top
case and we see we see like we have some
predicate oriented queries and if I
search it okay I'll see these cupcakes I
will be able to browse this chocolate
cupcake and see all the information as
you see here it's really structured so
we have like name or description and so
on and so on and even the image we got
in different sites and even I can go I
don't think that's it here
but I can see it the JSON that I get out
of the API now why is that interesting
because the copper should be able to
experiment with fewer queries until he
gets a query that is really good looking
for for for that kind of presentation
because if we get into the website for
instance that integrate this content so
we see here like we are only showing
macarons and here like we are showing
only cupcakes right there are queries
like I want you to do a query that only
gives me the cup cupcakes or what
happened here I should bring all the
products that are featured in this page
I'm looking it's also a query I'm
looking for all the jobs that are
available I can do even more sushi I
should be able to do more sophisticated
searches right for instance give me all
jobs that are around around my
geolocation or in my city for instance
or that open at that particular time and
in my cities we need to be able to do
all kind of as sophisticated a query
sacred and also you should be able to do
some full full search like friends that
I could do it for something like
chocolate and then I will find some
products but also I can find not only
products but some job offers and a blog
post because you looking for all
documents we get this content and then
we structure them the way we want
magically here one search gave three
kinds of things three types of documents
and we can present it the way we want
okay and and you need to be able to mix
basically basically two database where
you can mix like full search and
factor queries into each one into one
period and that's exactly what we see
right here basically you are we saying
like I want a document which for which
the type is product and it's tagged as
cupcake and here I will add another
which stays I will I would like to
full-text search in document any
document I will see I want to search
chocolate so this is exactly what we
need right there right we want dessert
so so all what's happening here is that
it is exactly that more or less the same
well here we have more more queries but
you know this is just mixing several
kind of predicates and you can even
Bonin and these others
so you just we have Rico some
pre-configured queries that bring these
things and I add the full text search on
top of that we see that all these things
are cupcakes products and they have
chocolate in them okay so basically as a
developer I will go ahead and express my
queries and that's someone I'm all
satisfied I will copy these words and
put them in my code that's it I got my
query now I just need to get this
document and to look through them and to
present and that's it
whatever I got my quality right there is
nothing but technology related so that's
you know why an API browser is important
for for this kind of content management
solution
yeah we saw we do this yeah we saw like
a full-text search query and basically
the more structure your content is the
more opportunity to give to your
developers and designers okay because we
seem like I could just pick up the image
and put it at some place different size
I cannot I could also even become the
bright side that I want for what I'm
trying to do because we see in this
example exactly the example that I was
showing right here we show that the same
product this product is presenting in
the search result as well as well as in
this space we can see it here what we
don't see it here because it's featured
here but if I see
products I will also see it in here so
it doesn't matter right don't matter how
how many times you have that product if
it makes sense it makes sense so even
for instance if I can open maybe one job
I will find the same product in there
there are some some jobs that will be
relating some some products
okay now this is whatever it is right
it's connected data that should be
connected and that's since we are
linking these data not through your like
external URLs but through document URLs
and it gives it the opportunity to
present in that particular way the
official okay and if we see like even
even the editor if we see in this
example in this example I got if I go
back to my editor
this one the interesting thing here is
also that any document so any really so
link it so here I have metadata and
related products are links to documents
inside the same content repository right
and the way you link them afterwards is
the frontline now here just we saying
that this product is has related posts
this blog post and how they have related
products these two products right and I
can go ahead and for instance if I want
to change I can go ahead and change if I
mean the draft I can change this and to
point to any other document it's
connected data is extremely important
for managing content it's really crucial
for doing like new modern commitments so
now we got all of these things right for
the API and the right and wrong side
that will help us like make it much
easier like to manage content for any
kind of product whatever it is website
web or whatever it is close your
deployment constraints are but that's
not it because we know that content is
central to anything basically if you
don't have content
you can't display what you're poor you
want to display right if you have a
website you don't have content the
website is down with content right if
you have a web a web app or mobile app
content is not there you can't show the
content is very central it's not like a
service like Twitter or discussed or
anything
you can just ignore the fact that it
doesn't exist is crucial it's very
central to what you do and that's why
you need that service to be very
scalable okay basically you need to be
ready to have very low response time
okay if it's so your website is slow it
is slowly a web app or mobile app is
very slow because whether that service
ok and and it's not just words
you know because everyone's using
scalability should not be a word that
using your market it should be in an
architecture should have some guarantee
in the architecture that guarantee for
you that this will be the case that
response time will be low no matter what
the situation is and there are a lot of
tricks out there I mean most of I guess
you guys already do it or heard of
people doing this kind of thing for
instance a lot of people I came more and
more people doing static content
basically anytime they change something
they go go ahead and read the whole
website they do that because you know at
least that this will be fast forever
until the next change happens ok but we
can do this kind of tricks ok for making
dynamic content almost like static right
but that's an architectural problem yeah
is not very clear so basically we did
all our upholstery as release oriented
and that's the key feature here for us
for response time because anytime we do
a release you have the opportunity to
zip that and these content changes ok
and deploy them as static content as if
they were self searchable and all that
but like they are not a moving content
so basically we deploy
each time we have a release if we
we have a belief that we can guarantee
any of these releases it is basically
almost static so we just have these data
in memory and we're serving it it's not
something that is changing Chinese
real-time
even if changes will appear immediately
happen basically anytime we push a
change in the release you have time to
merge that these changes index them we
use you can use whatever indexing
technology out there and then zip
somewhere and make it make a backup of
that index and somewhere in the is-3
okay and whenever someone wants to talk
to that particular release given the
earth there is a reference of a battery
like that identifier of that release
then we could get from the cloud we got
that get that that index loaded into any
server and go ahead and service once
there were on multiple servers since we
we function and we function by release
and I mean it actually is you get the
opportunity to do all these things and
you see I hear it's scale no matter how
many servers
no more how much money I'm not stopping
you god you can spawn new servers I get
this a kind download them and start
serving it right there okay
and this time of course I pictured a
solution that along but you know it's a
little little tricks that we did in our
organization of our repository that will
make it a much easier life to scale this
map okay now of course what one one very
very nice side effect of having
everything immutable basically we're
saying I will be giving all the versions
of all the changes that happen actually
everything is immutable so basically any
time you make it change its a new
document doesn't have anything to do
with the whole document it's time you
make it changes in your document so
everything is immutable okay so
everything has its own ID that never
changed okay once you create an item
whether the document will 90 it
never changes when we say never changes
it means you can catch it forever like
the case you have case semantics that
lasts forever basically I can tell the
browser go ahead and catch catch this
forever ever reverse proxy on the way
we'll be catching it forever all the web
is working for you because we've got
this kind of also organization of our
imposter all right so yeah so also the
release is our immutable themselves
because each time you change the beliefs
you get a new ID and the same thing so
it's also immutable and also as a case
forever semantics there's only one thing
that is not case forever that should you
should be checking quite often it's
basically the main index is basically
the thing that gives you all this IDs I
think that will tell you I there's a new
release for instance and that's the only
end point that will not be capable
although they are if nothing changed
everything is case forever not only from
the side of the service but also from
your side from the client side you could
go ahead and engage them never go to the
server again if there's no change and of
course the chicken for changing and
doing a synchronously so you don't have
to worry about that so finally yeah of
course we talked about like high
availability which I explained already
like we have this anytime like you you
want more more more traffic you spawn
the new servers and and you get these
releases energy like next releases and
you deployment that server on your way
and of course when we talk about content
if your life serving different triple
streets for different clients or
different project you need to be to make
sure that you you're handing security in
in a very serious way not only that
actually in the same really possibly
we're talking about different releases
for different let's say different
projects okay so the fact that I I have
a release for the new product that I'm
going to reason very super secret
product no one should know to know about
it from the other things so basically
it's basic notification that you need to
have there to give certain resistance to
certain developers furnace the copper
will have the right to see only the
master which which in turn the main reg
but you have to you need a special
authorization to see that particular
release right needs integrated in your
in your front leg and once you got all
of that so once you organize if you've
organized your content in that way
there's one last thing that is extremely
important to have is basically to get
every to integrate everything around
content so basically if you see that
without power editor with the design
okay now you know you need to have your
analytics next to that document you need
to see like how did that description of
collect do when I released it how much
that product fall right I want that
product so how many it's or sales
analytics keyword analysis so like
Google what's happening on a search
ability of
you need to have some kind of
integration into that tool that content
management of all other aspects of your
apps around everything should be
organized around content you know
because like today in this content is
getting really central to any
application right the way you were the
wording of the thing the images they let
you use and any tool that is claiming to
manage content should integrate all
these aspects around so that's basically
it I was planning to show you some may
be I mean a little bit of code or also
some some demo of our implementation of
this kind of this concept but basically
I don't arm guess I have any any more
time or take questions and then maybe we
could chat about it after I basically
felt all of these things you brought up
absolutely things missing are super
important but I wonder if if you aren't
taking the idea quite far enough in the
sense of you talk all about getting the
content out but it seems like there's
just as much of a laugh and a kind of
need for ability to put content in so
the New York Times and one of the big
problems we have is every single desk
wants to be like edit the content
differently our photo desk right they
wouldn't be able to edit captions but
they don't really need the fine-grained
control over things but they need to be
able to go through hundreds of thousands
of photos very quickly so they need a
different set of tools right for the
content editing right then say our copy
guess which needs you know really fine
brain track changes on the letter you
know field of change font sizes this is
a big thing they want you know like
integrate with our style guy all kinds
of things like that right so what we've
done is not four four parts and each
part of the
so we build individual kind friends for
the different debts to copy a kind of
cater to their needs so I wonder if you
know you could have 13 things or
something like that right that content
management systems need adding one the
idea of a rich API for other apps now of
course something like new time or BBC or
all these kind of companies of course I
mean this is extremely crucial to have
some integration into what you can
suggest is it's always limited like your
head says it's all some kind of problems
but then others will barley be rather
internet content with some graphs of
some different ideas because not exactly
makes sense to Twitter in that way so we
need some some way of defining different
primitive data permitted you know we
have of course here we have colors we
have the thing but then there are lot of
things lacking we can't provide all that
you need some kind of extensibility to
define new primitives a new editors for
these primitives or for existing
parameter so that's I will add it to
that so the element is extensibility for
anything but that's exactly I mean when
you get a low enterprise and it gets
like much hardness a problem it's much
harder but and more interesting of
course but of course like web and
integration with web integration and the
extensibility can't solve all of these
so we have
