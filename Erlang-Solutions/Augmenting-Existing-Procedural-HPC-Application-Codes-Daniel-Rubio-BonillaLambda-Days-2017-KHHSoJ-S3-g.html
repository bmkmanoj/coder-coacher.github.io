the introduction so as many of you may
know in hpc we are mainly using still
like C and Fortran to program our
computers so in this talk I'm going to
to talk how to introduce a functional
semantics into this procedural code with
aim to improve the programmability and
also improve while keeping the
performance and also improve the
portability so during this talk I'm
going to discuss like what are the
benefits of functional programming I can
bring to us and how to make how to make
it as protocol in our hvc machines well
first I would like to introduce like
what r h VT machines so they are really
big computer much bigger than the usual
desktop that you will have at home and
they're used usually for solving
engineering and scientific problems so
the kind of problems we usually solve
with these machines are limited by the
hard work that we have so before you
have school wait a bit one or two years
then you bought a new computer and it
will just bring new cpu which has much
higher performance than the previous one
but in the last like 10 15 years the
frequency of the cpu cores is not really
increasing anymore and also the
instructions per cycle is really slowly
increasing nowadays so how do we get
faster computers more powerful ones well
easy we just add more and more course or
we use a specific accelerator such as CP
and such as GPUs or fps to offload some
particular parts of our code so this is
for example the kind of machine that we
have the HLS at the computing center of
the University of Stuttgart these are
gray machine which basically has 2,700 a
computing note it's a note has a
different address space so you have to
communicate them through a network
it snowed basically has 24 cause real
physical course with 128 gigabytes of
RAM the network is quite complex so
depending on how far you go in the
communication between neighbors you
might need to go up to three different
levels of network with different
performances and yet you need a very
special big case to keep such thing
because it consumes like 3.2 mega watts
which you also have to cool down so that
this mix makes sense at all if you want
to accelerate a program is it enough
just to add more calls so probably many
of you are already familiar with I'm
dance law which reflects like what is
the performance and speed up you can
gain depend on how your program looks
like and how many curves you have so
basically if you have some sequential
part in your program that you can never
paralyzed you will taste a moment we're
adding more calls will not improve your
performance anymore in fact even if you
have parallel park there is a moment
that adding more and more calls will
start grading your performance this is
because classical programming models are
usually year to RM reducing the kampala
the computational complexity but they
also not take into consideration what is
the cost of memory accesses and the
network communication costs so what we
want to do well and this if we are lucky
that we have a machine that just
consists of CPUs if you have
accelerators if you want to use them
then you need another specific language
you have to determine which is the part
you're going to move there establish the
communication with the rest of the
program and basically you have a machine
that is very difficult to program and if
you want to tune your application for
that machine you will
probably have to rewrite it again if you
want to move to a different computer so
what we want to have is kind of a new
programming model that is covering
enough information for the compiler to
be able to paralyze the our programs
that will be able to split our a
specific hard worker statistics of our
machines and at the same naked portable
to other supercomputers with different
Hardware celebs you know how we
introduce parallel lines in bowery
machines they are like three basic
approaches one is directly introducing
it using the linux pthreads you can also
use an MPI message passes communication
through the network of the supercomputer
you could use I already some in hays
programming languages such correo
fortran or UPC which just show the whole
memory of the computer as a global
address space or you could introduce a
structural information of your
application this for example would
people do with openmp which is basically
used to paralyze loop to describe how
your loop is and it will detect if how
can it be paralyzed and how many stress
to confirm it another language is of
these families on developed by Barcelona
supercomputer in which you describe
staff with respect to their input and
output data with this you can you can
deploy that owns has is that you have or
even opening piece that you treat the
Colonel's your body of your loops or
your task as a black boxes and you have
no controllers it has no control of what
is the computational waste on it is just
relies completely of the information
they promulgate to it so we want to
sproul new ways of a strutting we want
to go this way is with the structural
information and
but we want to make it better so for
example is hot on screen just a few
tasks it connects them through the input
and output once it has a scheduler that
is moving the executing the task when
they are like once they can be executed
that means when their input is available
and it can grow into something very weak
or even bigger than this but it will not
fit on the on the screen but it's just a
very flat structures you and nobody has
any controls if want us is much more
computational requirements than another
one so we are going to Stratus in what
we want to do is track this structural
information not through the input
analysis but annotating the code with
higher order functions to give some
functional characteristics of our code
they will describe the mathematics and
allegories we're trying to execute and
let the compiler reason about what is
going on why hire the French of this
because they have a simple at beer
execute una structure they are
independent from the operator that is
using them and you can combine them to
form a real complex structures at the
same time they can be transformed into
other higher order functions that are a
killer band equivalent from the
computational point you will get the
same results but they have a different
and non functional properties so
basically we annotate we hire the
functions we spread the total
information we reach on over what they
are doing and then we can transform the
underlying code that we had well you can
everybody knows in these audience so
this is a map which has a very nice
graphical structure or fall L which has
a different and nice graph and simple
what is going inside is not a problem
you don't need to care about it we can
be fine like for example these let this
one is another higher-order function
that this is not the standard one we
define it ourselves because it carries a
special information / week over the one
we can later reason about this is for
example a stencil operation in one be
very common in hpc where you're
basically you go through all the
elements of your list or your array in
case of three and the values of your new
list are dependent on your current
position and the values of your
neighbors an example of transformations
we can you can do with higher order
functions is for example default L you
can you may be able to paralyze it and
get the one on the top you can partition
it in different a smaller fault else and
then the result make another reduction
of it if this transformation is valid or
not it depends on the mathematical
properties of the operator you have for
example in this case to be able to do
this transformation to be correct the
operations in this case is this plus has
to be associative and we also need to
know what is the neutral element which
is the one that begins each of the
partitioning it looks like simple and
you can never know if this operation is
going to be associative or not because
for example in a floating-point
operations the plus is by definition not
associative interchanging the
computation over even if mathematically
made sense you will have slightly or you
may have a slightly different result if
this result is valid or not for you
depends on your coat and your model so
you need a way to let the press this
kind of information into your
programming model
so the transformations have to maintain
correctness and we want to use them to
be able to paralyze or to split other
custody seekers as memory usage maybe
you want to make sure some part of your
code or your data feeds into cash maybe
you want to find the communications
through to your accelerators so so the
high order functions basically you can
combine them into different ways as per
as they happen with toms you can combine
them from the input/output dependency or
you can use them as operator these lists
two hierarchical structures where you
can go in different levels you can
reason inside what is doing so your your
nodes in the graph are no longer just
simple black boxes that you don't know
what's going on so combining these two
two ways of matching them of combining
them you basically enable the modular
construction of a graph of basically any
size and complexity well so this is
basically whether i call the flood
structure which is the output also a one
higher the function is the input for
another one so you have one node outside
of the previous one also we can already
written about the operator say I think
that could go to with all a pyramidal
well this is the code but I will skip it
and this is a hierarchical linking
between two higher-order functions where
the map is using the phone as an
operator with at the same time contains
and other operators which could be other
higher order functions so your notes in
the graph are something you can return
over at different levels
so how to make these really work so you
need a very strong binding you can read
these annotations you can reach on over
then you decided more or less how to
manipulate your grass now you have to
reflect this graph on the C code which
is the one which is actually going to
execute so you have to make a very
strong binding between the annotations
and the C code in this case you have to
indicate for example this loop in this
function which is called at all is just
adding all elements of a better as you
have to indicate which is the higher
order function and you have to give a
name of the operator which is the body
of the loop is defined here with the
plasmid and you have to say which is the
the input of the falls and where it's
going to store the result in memory of
your computer at the same time you need
to express and you have to be able to
express the mathematics and not only for
the simple co-operators but also for
functions you will define because you
might want to just define functions that
operate through matrixes for example or
any other that the structure as you want
for this you will need custom functions
we are thinking of different ways one
possibility is a ring where basically
you can set a set of operations which
have certain proprietary properties
between themselves and well I'm not
going to enter into here because it's a
bit complex mathematical thing probably
some of you are mathematicians and know
more about this than me and at the same
time another thing you'd need to make
your compiler aware is about how the
data is a structure on the hardware
memory of your computer
and you need to specify things like well
or the system to be able to make the
transformations on the data structures
it has to know like what is a bit order
in what is the Indian s how is the like
men of the data structures if you are
using a better of a structures or
structures of vectors and as it's
usually communicating through a network
you have to be able to settle Isis
digital Isis and partition it correctly
the usual operations that they are
provided by the operating system are
very poor for example malik you can just
say the number of bytes you want and
there is no information about how the
data is later going to be a story in it
so a simple example of how this is
intended to work is for example the heat
we can use a sampled a one dimensional
heat diffusion equation we're basically
money you have one D string which is hot
at some point and you want to evaluate
how it's cooling down hold it is premium
as a time goes on the same will work in
2d or 3d but wendy is much simpler to
see first you have to discretize size
your equation to be able to compute it
here is like this essential operation
that we saw is like the a certain
element at some point depends on it's
the same position in the previous point
and the neighbors so this is a
simplification of the code where you can
basically annotate it you will be fine
your kernel which depends you see here
in the erase the temporal heat map array
array is storing the information of that
point well it depends on that point in
the another array plus the neighbors
this is defining a stencil operation
around the whole array and this is
executed
number of iterations which is each time
step from it we can see a graph where
you can go through it and you call
reason and for example you can paralyze
your data at the different levels so we
could have the renal vector running in
sequential mode we can say partition it
in a logical way without still going to
any specific Hardware this process
partitioning we could partition it again
as many times as we want in this case we
can for example 22 partition is the
first partition is going to message
level so that you can come in different
notes and then inside is no 24 sample
can paralyze it again with a openmp to
exploit the many course of each node for
opening p once you have the partition is
is quite simple just I have to use tell
you the disapproval for in case of MPI
is a bit more complex because you have
to to cut the the erase introduce the
neighboring front the communication to
store then a poor values of data that is
in other nodes so this how they look
code looks like adding the MPI and the
openmp and other things you can do is
this annotations are break near another
functional language that is called class
that are developing some of our and
colleagues that basically can convert
these annotations that are very similar
to classical into VHDL to splode FPA so
that's all of what we are working right
now and exploring thank you very much
for your time
and thank you very much custom knows I
get it correctly but you you produce
this pragmas to paralyze the code yes
I'm the stragglers are in functional
language so did you compare the
performance of such paralyzed code by
your pragmas advice for example MPI so
this pragma so basically the we use the
these annotations to know in which point
we can paralyze and then this is
transformed to MPI so what it is accused
in at the end is MPI we just use the
functional annotations to be able to
evaluate the program and analyze it do
you have some results of any parallel
program you you measure for example
speed up or effectiveness of such
paralyzed program by your tool we have
such a use case because if so I will
show this heat and so how how it it
really paralyzes did you measure
effective speed up or effectiveness well
right now we don't have a complete
working tool so we have paralyzed it by
hand following the steps the tool will
do the code is quite fine and scales
well so I could show your results or
thank you
one question 1 comment the question if
you say say pragma ring something you
just promise to the compiler that the
structure behind this behaves like a
ring yeah yeah so it can assume some
things and and so on and so on and that
it applies to the data type it could be
a custom data life by a user but you can
say like in a loop you cannot reach a
the code inside a loop it's something
you can split and apply fault in
parallel so I can imagine you can do
something on a higher level like this so
you promise something to be a wink so it
has some properties you can use and in
some commenters with previous question
it's very tricky to compare compiler
with a human because a human can write
better or worse code and compile error
can be better or worse so it's just a
case who is the battery and to generally
we want to save programmers time and
keep the efficiency reasonable rather
than write the best coach ever I make
our you exciting response from the well
I didn't really understand what is your
question what is wouldn't what is not
clear for you
yes so it means that these operations
from this type has some properties so it
will enable or disable certain possible
transformations last question so yeah
the the D directives you are using they
look very similar to what we can find
already in OpenMP so and generally
speaking you have to test like to test
like the Desai's based on the data side
and so on you have to test and make sure
that it actually improves performance is
very something kind of knew that who's
like techniques provide overall openmp
like to like better optimized also gives
better results
well up to now open in peak and well I
don't know the latest version but I
think it can only stay inside the anode
so it cannot go through different memory
addressing spaces of other nodes and the
other thing is that openmp is actually
doing I'm paralyzing in the place you
tell it to do is not able to reason like
you cannot put like if you have three
different loops nested you cannot
annotate them all and it decide which is
the best word to introduce the
pollination probably will just paralyze
all of them maybe you are paralyzing
something that is very small and your
performance will degrade here is you
don't force to paralyze you have a
system which is able to to evaluate
through the whole prom where are the
best point where it means that they are
the best points to introduce the
polarization and the communication yes
it's a compile-time you decide it will
meet also a description of the machine
to know to be able to match the machine
to the program you are trying to work on
thank you very much Daniel the final
