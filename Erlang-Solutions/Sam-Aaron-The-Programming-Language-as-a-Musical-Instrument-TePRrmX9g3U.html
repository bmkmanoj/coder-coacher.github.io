right there hi it's really interesting
that you actually introduced it
different languages no one language
after another F sharp and C sharp than
their music I think that she I was
expecting to say closure and I think no
no no don't say close you because
actually all I'm trying to say isn't
about a specific technology and I think
that people who try and sell specific
technologies are people to sort of be
careful about because I think that we
lived effing in a very much of fashion
LED industry and so having sort of a
skeptical eye on things is actually
quite a sensible thing to do so please
place your skeptical eyes on what I'm
trying to say now because it's obviously
a strange thing why would I talk about
music why is an interesting thing to
talk about it developer conference and
hopefully I'm going to convince you
about actually that there are many many
interesting things to extract from a
context where you're considering music
and music interaction at the forefront
and again in the same way we might look
at when we program different industries
or different contexts of programming and
we can learn different things from that
I think this this provide us with many
opportunities for exploration before I
start I should probably introduce myself
so I am actually it's quite funny on my
badge it says meta X so i'm a member of
this band called meta x but actually i'm
a research associate at the university
of cambridge and this is the building i
work in its always pointed out where
we're really really lucky because we
have a beautiful cycle shared it's it's
lovely to be able to have a place to
park your bicycle i'm also currently
funded primarily by the raspberry pi
foundation so a lot of the ideas i'm
talking about i'm also working with in
terms of getting them onto the rasa pie
and also into children's hands so this
is another aspect or we go into this
detail later and i'm also a philly to
this thing called lambda next where we
offer clojure training so if you're
interested in any sort of closure
training stuff and actually i'll talk
about this later not the way of selling
it but actually there's a lot of
associations between music and training
like why does that mean anything we will
do soon and a lot of the techniques i'm
describing we apply in our workshops and
finally i'm also core developer lead
developer of snuggled overtone so if
you're here last night you might have
heard some crazy sounds some of you
might have appreciated the sands some
certainly didn't it was quite funny one
chap came up to us and said it's too
loud can you turn it down and I pointed
out that you're standing right next to a
speaker so I thought that was a quite an
amusing I didn't like that so okay right
context seen sets laser beam that's
quite good i'm selling front of this
projector my eyes sort of getting
blinded this is quite good the laser
beam slice through the watts of smokers
a subwoofer pump base deep into the
bodies of the crowds what a great start
the atmosphere was ripe with a heady mix
of synths and dancing you know however
something wasn't quite right in this
nightclub what was happening projected
in bright colors above the DJ booth was
futuristic text moving dancing flashing
this wasn't fancy visuals it was merely
projection of a terminal containing
Emacs yes the occupants of the DJ booth
weren't spinning discs no they weren't
DJ's they were writing editing and
evaluating codes this was a method ex
gig the code was their musical interface
and they were playing it live hi this
might sound like a really cheesy start a
sci-fi book me and an obviously it could
be but actually it mean it describes a
real scene but also interestingly it
it's the start of an article I've
written which to be published in the
prag pub and for the sems edition
actually and so you can actually you can
actually this is righteous read out here
and it goes on about describing how you
could actually implement some very basic
sequences and since and and do it all
live in the rat portland's and get us of
a an experienced incredible experience
what it is to do live coding and so this
might be a futuristic scene but it
actually says here today and so I want
to describe to you what that what that
might mean and what we could extract
from that so of course this is what this
is why I'm all about matter X my bands
this is us playing in a warehouse in
East London this is quite notable for us
because it was the first time we ever
got people dancing that was great when a
great experience a lot of the time you
spend on the controls and you look up
and there's all these people dancing is
just a beautiful experience so that was
like first it was we'd spent a year to
get to this point where for most of that
year we're making musical sounds that we
quite embarrassed about this point was
sort of gel together into a point where
we could actually get people dancing and
of course this is this is something
called live coding maybe you've heard
this before but it's an interesting new
phenomenon but it's not necessary even
new it's been around in the academic
world for quite a long time as
specifically in the music side of the
academic world and the general gist is
you sort of program on a desk you might
use artifacts to project data structures
or elements of internal processes which
are executing and then also you you
project your screens so that the
audience has some kind of way into
understanding some elements of what
you're doing of course you tend to also
obfuscate the text by putting crazy
visuals in the background and so the
goal isn't necessarily to communicate
all of the semantics of the code they're
executing in a way the audience can
understand because they're dancing right
they're not going to be looking at the
code there's some people are one of the
goals here it is sort of a community
where I believe what we are trying to do
is to communicate the fact that this is
live well actually there is real risk
that all could blow up and it isn't all
pre-recorded you're not purchase
pressing play there really is in the
same way that a guitarist on stage is
hitting the strings we are hitting the
keys and we're actually generating the
sounds there's obviously a lot more
mechanics in between hitting the keys
and hearing the sounds but there's
similar cut away when you're playing the
piano you're hitting the keys and
there's mechanics going into play we're
just get bit more sophisticated
mechanics and I can go into more detail
about that kind of thing in a moment
this is us we've played on this boat
called the stub nets what an incredible
experience that was so this was an old
old fishing trawler that was going to be
sold for scrap metal and this German
hippies bought it and then turn into a
nightclub which sails around the world
so here it was docked in London Canary
Wharf they're not allowed back because
they obviously were too loud and we were
playing on this thing here so this is us
it's not very clear but you can see the
lights and the flashing things and the
screens and this is a bit closer up but
again you can sort of see how you can
put graphics on the screen and the text
and we are projecting the code this is
it an actual music festival
we were performing to a crowd of people
who weren't actually at all programmers
I lists offered many interesting
insights because I mean that we had a
really good review in one of the
magazines which talked about the music
festival and said meh directs crazy 70
sounds and lots of paid a lot of homage
to x y&amp;amp;z composers which I never even
heard of but obviously paid how much
them and so it was a really positive
review and then it ended with a lime
just quite unfortunately said great
visuals great video that that's our
interface it's not a visuals I mean it
is it also visuals but this is this is
trying to communicate they were actually
live and a lot of the kind of issues
we're facing is is that when you're
performing coding like this for many
people who aren't programmers and
typically we've performed in conferences
like this so everyone here has seen
programming to some degree by all to a
lot of degrees general case when you'd
format a music festival most people
haven't actually seen real programming
at all now they've seen it on telly
where it's the matrix now it's like
crime scene investigation or one scene I
saw which was the most amusing think of
a thing I've ever seen was was it was
one of the standard seems like they're
the all the windows are popping up on
the screen oh my god someone's hacking
us and the windows are popping up all
that through the firewalls there into
the router all this kind of nonsense
jumbo like any already like that's
amusing right they know that's obviously
completely on sense but it gets we've
got much worse so this person was
hacking away trying to like fight off
the attackers are now I've got them
round the head another and then the guy
behind is watching you thinking this is
not happening i need to actually help
this person hack the hacker and so he
sort of knocked him to the side think it
was actually and not away and replaced
them but actually took half the keyboard
and they were both hacking on the same
table at the same time like this is what
people think programming is right i mean
i'm probably probably not helping by
showing them this this is not
necessarily real broken but it's more
credible because we actually are using
code to generate the audio and it is the
kind of environment i use to actually do
day to day programming let's see this
environment without the visuals which
are quite annoying to be honest when you
growing is the same environment I used
to actually develop the system itself so
there is sort of this there's actual
credibility going on so yep sorts
interesting and he rats us playing in
Berlin and sea bass a quantized pitch
because it feels actually you sort of
see these pictures and I feel more and
more that were actually becoming more
like musicians this feels more of a
musical picture and then before way of
sort of sitting there going to holla II
racks here I feel like the body
positions is a bit more credible as a
musician so and and why am i showing you
all of this and worried what are the
interest things we could extract from
this and I think that's we should start
to ask these questions we need to ask
these questions what a hell is
programming we talk about this as of
something we all probably don't even
talk about this is an obvious thing what
actually is it and and I think we need
to start to charge these things and this
is actually a nice picture of where i
live in new castle and I'm reason why
I'm showing you this is because there's
a lot of engineering this picture these
bridges no structural engineering this
is the sage gateshead there's the Baltic
big engineering projects and when we
talk about software often we have a
quite close correlation with engineering
and in that way we can start to talk
about testing and unit tests and all its
going to stuff and specifications and
yes the bridge is not complete unless it
spans the river time no it's halfway
across it's a failed project so you can
sort of define sort of the criterion and
we'll do this kind of thing when we're
developing software when we're
developing software which is engineering
like which is one star of software and
it's like it is the predominant Sol
soccer but it's only a style of software
and if we need to start to question
these things is all is this all software
is and what can programming be does it
just have to be an engineering pursuit
that's I think that's a really important
question to ask and maybe if you're all
you're interested in is making money
programming then yes that's a great
pursue to have just go and work in the
companies build stuff have a acceptance
criteria be ticked off get the cash move
on to the next project but I think
actually we're in an interesting time
today where we can start to actually ask
these questions we have amazing tools
which can allow us to explore different
aspects of programming
so one of the ways i like to think about
programming is less like in engineering
things let's like building things a lego
or a Meccano we or in the actual
real-world no big massive iron girders
and things i like to think of it more
like clay making like actually on a
wheel and I've got the clay on their
spat it on and I think I'm going to make
a bowl and sort of sort of form it out
and as I making the ball well actually
today I don't want a ball on a cup you
know I modified or while still making
the couple thing well actually that bit
I didn't think that was gonna be
interesting oh I didn't even expect that
but it's really awesome and keep that
bit and I modify this bit and so with
this gradual molding process of shaping
observing shaping observing I start to
create the software that I want and and
for me this is important because after
the kind of software that i personally
build isn't software that i can upfront
ahead specify this is the solution and
so this is kind of difference between to
the venue where in the newcastle tyne
bridge the clearly a solution is a thing
which spans the time which vehicles can
cross over right that's just solution
whereas the color stuff why i'm building
like what is a cool environment to
actually make some music in a nightclub
I don't really know yet and I haven't
really got the answers to all those
questions I've got enough answers to
have it been able to perform a nitro but
it was amazing but there's a lot of
other problems were the kinds of
software we build and the kind of
interfaces and interactions we had and
so it's still very much like this as I'm
using it and as I'm practicing it with
it and that's then in forming new ideas
and then that's gradually this process
of coming to a place where I have an
idea where it might be but I don't know
precisely where it is and I think that a
lot of software is like this this is my
hunch and we and a lot of software is
also specified engineering software but
i think this we'd sort of challenge but
what we think about development is and
we can start to make interesting
analogies and with things like agile and
XP and i gave a keynote of the XP
conference a week or so ago and they
totally understood what i was saying it
this is all about feedback now it's all
about being able to project what you're
doing into a way that you can actually
observe it and then use the observations
to then modify your next step your neck
and so having that tight feedback loop
is a key to what we might describe as
agile processes but here it's much more
it's not really the sort of the software
develop raas s and a iteration of weeks
this is kind of an iteration of moments
this is me interacting in the rep all
who are interacting typically in a
buffer where I'm growing my codes and as
I'm growing it I'm evaluating it I'm
seeing the results musing those results
enter modified it's the next version and
so actually when I code it is very much
like this I do start with an empty but
for a throw a bunch of nonsense in it
and then just bash on it for a bit and
see what it looks like and if I don't
like it throw it away and try again and
then if I got something which sort of
seems to stick then I'll start a polish
it up sort of quite similar to this so
how far dairy push programming into new
territory this is of a challenge right
so if we're talking about programming is
an engineering principle then clearly
the challenges to make sure that we're
able to define projects have the
specifications be able to know that this
is a time limit and box it and had this
is how much you're going to cost and I
mean these are all tough problems to
solve but but that's that's the
engineering side what I'm as if we want
to look at other places where could we
push software where could we use
software where could you we use
programming specifically not just
software so when we build people
graphical user interfaces wouldn't be
interesting if they actually had a
programming language well I wouldn't be
interesting if instead of having a
slider or a widget they had a console
what could what affordances of that
offer where could that take us so and
again as I go back to the music thing
like what I'm is it programming goes
like this you know what I'm safe
programming was something we're really
you just wanted to use it to express
yourself they just want to be able to
use the programming as a new form of
communication I mean this sounds really
hippie but I'll ground it down in a
moment but it's actually important
points right when we speak we're using
technology we're using language which
has it evolved over many many years but
it's really just a form of Technology
moving your arms as a similar technology
programming's another technology and
there's no reason why we can't use that
technology to help us communicate more
effectively and what are the affordances
of that of that technology to allow
to what are the kinds of things are we
able to communicate more effectively
with it I think that's worth exploring
and making the music is part of that
actually so let's have a thought
experiment what I'm as of programming
wasn't engineering I'm not saying it
isn't I'm just saying let's just assume
it isn't for the moment let's just
imagine a world where programming wasn't
engineering and we think about what it
could be so first for that to happen we
have to go back in time and sort of good
to this point when we had a NATO meeting
and the term software engineering was
coined and dykstra was there and we
pretend that didn't happen or maybe it
did but no one knew about it Brian
Randall didn't write up about it and
then announce it to the world so let's
pretend that didn't happen with a
virtual of a side reality what could
programming be and I think it's
interesting to the explore multiple
things I'm not saying this is
programming this is for me a important
direction for programming programming is
a form of expression as i said before so
it could be a form of communication or
as i'm using it form of making music and
what could that do for us and where
could it take us and so if you've seen
any of the talks are given before I you
often use a slide so bear with me if you
see this before but it's a really
powerful way of explaining the power of
programming as expression so this is
Kasparov losing the rematch in deep blue
and this is this interesting turning
point in a chess specifically but also
in terms of how we perceive artificial
intelligence whatever that might mean
certainly in terms of computers versus
minds in certain domains so this is the
point where computers were stronger than
humans in the domain of chess which is
an interesting point in history but
what's super interesting to me and
kasbah for it was really interesting
article what what happened afterwards
super exciting so much sneezing so yeah
I mean imagine sneezing and blowing the
chest piece no so what happened
afterwards was catalog didn't start
playing chess okay he didn't stop
playing he crazy changed the rules he
didn't he created a new kind of chess
called advanced chess when a great name
for a game of chess and advanced chest
it's not like the Star Trek Chester they
were like three levels of this no oh you
haven't got actual they can't morph into
or something you can go like I'd no
massive n dimensional space advanced
chase it's just normal chess but
cheating alright so you'd actually play
the game of chess then you have a laptop
with a chess program on and you'd ask
the chess program what are some good
moves it would give you some strong
moves and then you would choose the one
you wanted that was your move advanced
chess now there's a couple of
interesting things that came from this
the first one is with with the advanced
chess style he could beat deep blue
right so the most powerful chess thing
isn't a computer or human it's a cyborg
now it's a human and a computer right
that's that to me that's pretty
mind-blowing right so we can go into
detail about this but it's there is some
interesting thing about the interplay of
creativity of the plasticity of the mind
and the ability for computers to explore
state spaces very effectively and
accurately and when you combine those
note in a decent way then actually you
can actually create things which should
actually be more powerful and chairs
well this has demonstrated that so
whether chess computers being able to
only really suggest very strong moves
and then Kasparov being able to use his
creativity to choose good moves this is
the kind of thing he talked about he
said it freed his mind that he was able
to focus on tactics and gameplay and the
psychology and the aspect so he found
most interesting and for some reason
that gave him more power to be able to
beat the computers currently maybe this
is going to change but what what
happened afterwards was even more
interesting to my mind because he had a
competition where anyone could enter and
two random guys so America one right
they beat Kasparov the beat cast off
plus the computer the beat deep blue and
why was that how did that happen you
know how does these two obviously pretty
badass chess players but not require
masters beat the Grandmaster plus a
computer and an Kasparov was completely
bewildered by this and and he sort of
thought or maybe the deal is that's the
strong process is a really important
aspect in here so if you have a weak
human plus a strong process in the
domain of chess it's more powerful than
a strong human plus a week process so he
says he was sort of suggesting that
maybe these programmers have built
awesome software that gave them better
selection better choice
better ability to explore the state
space and then because of that software
because their ability to choose a thing
they could beat Kasparov this is amazing
right and so this is to me about the
important of programming as expression
we're not building get an engineering
solution here we're actually building a
tool which allows you to communicate
with a chess program and say what are
some cool moves right and that's that
interaction be able to make that
interaction as high bandwidth as
possible being able to explore as many
options as possible and having a really
decent conversation where you could ask
things of the system and it can give you
responses and you can think okay well if
I went that way and this is that going
to be strong a week and you have this
conversation and the more detail that
conversation can be that maybe they're
more powerful you can actually become
and so this is to me an importance of of
seeing software not just as engineering
but maybe is a form of expression so
here we are moving from Casper half to
two to Cambridge and wising so this is
me trying to explore what that might
mean in the way that I can so I'm
working with some artists here and i'm
using the Raspberry Pi and I'm teaching
them aspects of programming and were the
challenge for them is to build a well
sisters design an exhibition or an art
piece using computing as an element's
where the programming is a key part so
the idea would be or was that they would
put their program on github so that
people could be if you were inspired by
their artwork then they could actually
take that program and we match it up
with other things and so this was an
interesting experiment and one of the
things that came out of it which was
really nice was with this chap called
rob smith and he built something very
simple i mean he just basically this is
Rob here he's a stoker a ratty part of
the window with a big stuck a thing and
it took a photo with a raspberry pi
camera every 20 seconds I think it was
and then it turned the photo into a
really low res grayscale mosaic and then
scan through the gray scale and then
turned each large pixel into a or do B /
specific frequency which was correlated
to the pixel size and then played out
the beats down here so essentially you
sort of heard the image and then you
also wrote software the other side which
then turn it back into the image again
and this to us is necessary very
sophisticated and
this is the important part actually
about when I try and talk about these
kinds of things is it one of the
challenges here when we're talking about
programming to expression isn't just
about giving you the ability to see that
program it could be expression is it
giving the world's the ability to see
that program it could be a form of
expression and so this might be a very
simple system to us and we probably
knock it up in a few hours or a day or
whatever it might take but for
non-programmers this is really exciting
what you can take a picture and you can
turn it to sound and then you can play
through speakers and then you can
receive the sound and turn it back into
it what how does that work right and
that's a cool because a kid will ask
that question any connection explain it
so actually this is data representation
I can represent a different colors with
different numbers and gray scale is an
even easier way to think about that you
know you can take a bunch of cards you
can call them with different pens with
different grades you can look at the
number on each of the pencils for
example that's already a a code of
mapping no colors to two numbers and so
and then you could actually give them
agreed and you can actually tell them
which and they already do this already
this kind of thing you can say put the
code in each of the boxes and they get
to color it in and the pitcher comes out
and in fact rob was inspired by one of
the very early communications from i
think it was Mars not entirely sure or
maybe it was the moon but NASA we're
getting this information back faster
they could render it with a computing
power back on on earth base station and
so one of the first pictures was they
got the numbers and actually had some
painted out now with the squares using
exactly this approach so this actually
did happen that's super interesting so
you can actually see this really low res
vision of the trees outside here yeah
and these one of the things I'm talking
about really have any kind of novel
novelty I'm not saying that I'm
inventing any of these things at all I'm
just just trying to express things which
I've observed and only resistance I mean
you can look at all papers like this
this is galen kevin sullivan talking
about exactly the same kind of things
about how we can perceive science and
art and as actually very similar things
and they go into quite a lot of detail
about how we might have these specific
categorizations of scientists and
artists to set
things were completely separate ideas
and separate ethics and separate
approaches actually there's huge
correlation and really instead of trying
to make the separation we should try and
collaborate more and and in the UK we
have this sort of term called stem
science technology engineering
mathematics no I know people try and
talk about steam instead science and
science technology engineering arts and
mathematics and actually trying to make
this this inclusive thing I think it's
much more interesting and this is
exactly the kind of thing I'm looking at
so programming is a way of thinking so
how how can we consider programming not
just as a way of building things as an
engineering principle not just a way of
communicating and expressing itself but
as a way of thinking and we all have a
sort of a tacit understanding of this
when we have a problem that's
represented in a certain language that
can have effects on the way we can
actually manipulate our minds around
that problem and often we all think all
this is not the way the best way to
represent this I'll take it on two
pieces of paper or I'll translate into
more of a mathematical notation or I'll
take it out and draw it into a diagram
okay and then we also translate it to a
different context or form maybe that
gives me different properties to be able
to reason about the problem and they
explore it no so programming languages
are no different in that sense to my
mind and that certainly certain
languages have certain affordances in
terms of your ability to think about d
structure restructure manipulate
abstract problems and I think this is a
really important way to think about it
and and we all know this i think at
least i hope that i'm right and be able
to say that we all know this in that
when we talk to another engineer another
programmer to who has the same kind of
domain same what kind of context the
bandwidth of communication is incredibly
high look like a brother oh yes blah
blah blah blah and I when you try to
talk someone else who isn't in the same
domain it's really painful and really
slow and a lot of that is because you've
loaded yourself up with the programming
language in the context and abstractions
and then you use a lot of the language
you're talking about isn't just English
it's also a mixture of English and
programming constructs and that's using
programming as a way of thinking and
destructuring and communicating and
we're not actually there there's no
computer involved at this point we're
just using these things as a way of of
destructuring this
and this shouldn't be new either because
mathematicians are beating this since
day one now when actually mathematics is
really a way of communicating and
exploring and discussing these ideas no
and one of the reasons why the notation
is so terse is it it can often help with
this so let's put some quotes up because
that's always good to have quotes it's
good Dykstra who I just earlier for
being an engineer a programming language
is a tool that has profound influence on
our thinking habits make this is a
really important thing to consider can
back programmers spend so much at the
time their own heads trying to look at
the other world from small size
viewpoint is a big shift you mean this
important thing you know guy steal a
good program these times does not write
programs a good program builds are
working vocabulary in other words of
good programmer does language design
though not from scratch but building
from a frame of a base language so this
is exactly the kind of point of trying
to make is that we can actually start to
use programming languages of weight is
structure new languages which could help
us explore a model the world and so
programming isn't just about engineering
it can also be about thinking and
destructuring and understanding and
programming can also be a learning tool
right so this is this is interesting so
I built this thing called sonic PI which
is a very very super simple version of
overtone which runs on the Raspberry Pi
and these are children like obviously
pointing at the raz like fire but
actually they're about to load sonic PI
and they're going to make some music by
writing some very basic Ruby commands
and then hearing the resulting sounds
and then having a very interesting
iteration between what we would do and
this is interesting we what we do is so
called scaffolding so the teachers have
this idea if you're trying to impart
some information to somebody you do it
through an allergy so it's like that
thing but were these differences but
when you're trying to do that with a
group of people it's really hard to have
it it's like that thing that everyone
has in common you know unless it's like
some social thing that's clearly shared
but then even then if you have one
noticing it's like The X Factor but
we've even then some people haven't
noticed it but they even then do you
think about what actually is like the x
factor that's going to be interesting
nothing so that's really useless analogy
so what you tend to do is you build
energy in the classroom so you get them
to act apps
thing on the passing paper around and in
this case to the first lesson they see a
programming we do because this is a
curriculum computer you could computer
curriculum likes just to see things in a
very sort of simple structured way
empirical way of of programming and
sequences of operations so we actually
line them up the pass cards between each
other and they perform their operations
as as their turn happens and then once
have acted that out then you go and take
them to the computer and say here's the
syntax this is what it looks like and
it's like when we acted out but with
these slight differences and so they can
understand that and then once you've
told them that one concept for that
lesson they say to them well spend the
rest of lesson playing if there isn't a
structure there's no more like specifics
of what you have to do it so more about
what would you like to do like you've
got this new tool like you could now in
this case the first lesson is they can
play a notes and they can sleep Steven
example it's the sonic PI website yeah
here's an example actually so I'm
playing you this but actually I should
be live coding it so this is what this
is what the application looks like when
it's running on the Razzie pie but I am
I built a sort of a mock version to try
explore different ways of doing it which
uses the browser as an interface so
Dropbox codifying sit and get it ring so
Ruby run so it uses the the browser as
an interface and I have WebSocket
communication between there's running
ruby process and the browser it's all a
bit hacky fun
right four five six seven every up so
this is it so i can write play 60 press
the run so now make it right so this is
a school children that's all they need
to do to make their first program and
have an interaction with it and they can
hear the results it's all like all this
is the Fibonacci sequence and Paula
means nothing to them here they're
making some crazy sound and you can even
say well okay well you'd like the spell
sound so if each a few run this command
first with synth FM
different sounds you can change the
number to be different numbers different
different sort of sounds and you can
describe it about you don't have to be
musical in this sense you have to talk
about MIDI numbers or or pitches or
anything like this because this data
they're just experimenting you just say
hi number higher sound lower lobe number
Louis and it don't even have to say that
they just play with it and they figured
out pretty quick and they figure out
that if they are try and play your needs
too high they can't hear it or notes too
low they can't hear it as well like it's
broken I can't hear the net so you say
well actually it's really really low no
like then say that's an interesting
conversation to have so in the first
lesson they have the ability to play
things I sort of that pretty bowels the
original sound and then sleep for some
number of seconds right that's all you
teach them the first lesson and then
spend hours with this this place think
place to eat place to eat place to eat
place to eat plate they just go on and
on and on and it's really they really
have a lot of fun because they get to
choose which numbers to play they get to
choose what times to sleep and the ones
who get it like this selling the same
all the time you tell them about the way
to change the sounds and they've
actually put the widths in two different
places and they can start to play
different sounds they have a lot of fun
with this and and this is about this
throughout this feedback thing about
programming as a form of expression a
form of thinking form a reasoning it's
not we're not engineering anything here
we're just using programming as a way to
engage people and in this case we're
using the music aspect as a way of
motivating them to go forwards and
interesting a bunch of things came out
of this which I found super interesting
was one was that when I started building
this I thought this would be cool to
build on overturn than the roster pie
it's going to be great it's really good
fun it's gonna be really creative and
then the people above me said right Sam
it be careful to make sure you do
computer science only I go to minimize
the music increase the computer science
like turn the dial down and minimize the
music right so okay I'll do that then so
I I had a bunch of lessons there's a
whole bunch of lesson plans that go with
this one of the lesson plans we tried
which didn't make it to the final
version
was a lesson on abstraction like then
you could have variables and you can
have methods you know and their ways of
grouping things or naming things and in
this lesson they were naming things and
they're like what are we naming God I
don't know so they're naming things like
justin bieber phi equals 5 and coca-cola
equals 9 and you know and and they were
like why we're doing this as like
actually don't really know why doing
this it's an important thing in computer
science we do that a lot but I haven't
got enough tools to explain to you why
this is useful and the interesting thing
there was it until they've written a
massive program with a lot of repetition
these things are actually pretty useless
to them when when they've got a lot of
repetition then you start to give them
structures to say well actually this is
a way to sort of having all those words
you can just say five of the words and
you can say do this five times and so
the iteration is quite a pretty fun and
Ruby so you can just say like five times
do and then end you know and off we go
an interesting way to talk about these
things I can say well why were those
notes playing at the same time so well
actually it's coming off the end of this
loop and going back to this one but let
us thinks between them and they start to
understand this because they can hear it
and see it and so for them so this is a
great way of exploring and what was
super interesting and know that maybe
this there's audience probably
understands is already is that by less
than four they wanted to know about
threads but basically it's saying to me
tell me about threads they didn't say
those words they said well I could play
the bass and I can play the melody at
the same time but no individually we're
out from there but how do I play in at
the same time so okay I need to teach
you right throughout so lesson for my
instructor e course they can do threads
and because there's no coordination it's
actually pretty trivial to teach these
things and that's a lot of fun I also
built this this thing in the browser can
do things like draw circles Rand's I
know 20 rounds 40 this is the
implementation this is so hideous it's
unbelievable this is Ruby in the browser
right that doesn't work is it 19 is
there's enough parameters
narrow is not what am i doing wrong you
know I'll see what I'm doing wrong odd
number of arguments for hash comic comic
oh I'll have to give up no I can't see
why that's wrong these parentheses are
different than different colored than
that well that's X Y and then oh yeah
you're right yeah then then then so they
could start to actually draw things
whilst they're doing it and obviously
you can start to easily imagine how you
could add have these numbers here rather
than random be associated what they're
playing so they sought to actually see
these visualizations there's quite a lot
of fun this is much better if it's sort
of much bigger that's fun so that's
actually yeah there's always weird
WebSocket coordination between I to
implement this weird sort of promised
stuff and Ruby so I knew when things
were happening so I could schedule and
coordinate it but you hide all that
right so how long we got left how long
is this talk for I don't know tennis
after I ok so I whip through the last
two slides to do oh yeah so this is them
doing homework though this is a program
happy birthday in the program and with
sleeping and words this is quite nice
and then this is actually this is this
is a thing which I want to try and
communicate to you guys because you're
all program is right and so you should
understand the tragedy of this so this
is a beautiful card I got from the
children saying thank you very much for
teaching us the computer science stuff a
bunch of nice things in here you can t
read it very well but thank you for
helping us with a Razzie pie thank you
thank you very much why was it really
was really funny thank you for teaching
us everything we need to know so that
was clearly Daedalus on that but then
this is the one which is a really
poignant depressing thing right look at
that thank you for making dual life as
computers interesting and almost reality
you know it's like how do we start from
here right
so this is this is your job right it's
to convince the wall it's not dull and
lifeless and that it is interesting it's
more than reality it's a new kind of
reality the letters explore new spaces
of new ways and and has on total
excitement you know and this is the
thing that we always talk to each other
about but the world they don't know that
it's our job to communicate that to them
I believe so get on with it right and
also when we talk about teaching this is
the land of next stuff where we do the
closure workshops this is me teaching
professional closure developers or will
be closed developers I'm using exactly
the same techniques and ideas are used
in the classroom okay and these things
actually apply everywhere scaffolding
you know live coding so we turn up to
our workshops three days workshops with
no slides I imagine a professional a
workshop people coming in with no slides
I think that's obviously not they
obviously don't know they're doing but
we go in we have a rough idea the kind
of things you want to teach but we go in
and we say okay what we'd like to know
and then they'll ask some questions then
we live code them up now and then that
live coding of exploring it on the
screen will then provoke other questions
they go okay I didn't think about that
well how does that work with that thing
you did an hour ago yeah well let's have
a look oh there we go it doesn't work at
all though it fits Burghley no no and so
you can sort of explore this the way
that they can see and I think that
actually is really interesting as a form
o of teaching and learning here we are
this is people acting out lazy sequences
with string yes sounds fun I'm
programming is a form of dialogue
programmers and experience liveness this
is a really interesting thing when we
were programming in a live situation
we're doing this school exploration we
need to think about how our programming
languages can represent liveness no it's
not necessarily about write the code to
do things compile it run it no in the
start again what I'm as if our program
is the thing which is running all the
time you know and we're just
communicating with it and like an erlang
process and it's running for ten years
now and we sort of update it we say to
it how do we how do we think about
actually just modifying these bits or
those bits or and all I system so large
it doesn't fit onto one computer
and it has to be alive all the time
these are actually interesting things
it's not just about music it's not just
about teaching in schools this is about
large-scale industry systems now we're
live and it starts becoming more and
more importance where we can't afford to
shut down our systems and bring them up
again no we really do want to start have
a dialogue or where we see our systems
like we have talked about this big data
nonsense all the time Big Data right but
the way I if I'm controlling what I
think about Big Data it's about data
which people I imagine it could be big
but isn't necessarily big but it is
unstructured and there's possibly some
useful stuff in there and so they want
to ask questions of it to find useful
stuff out of this lots of data which is
often log files right so that's not
again it's not an engineering task
you're not building a bridge you're
having a facilitating a conversation
like to find me all things which have
this relationship to this thing oh no
that's not useful at all okay find me
that thing they're all that really oh
that I didn't think about that oh that's
good ask I'm going to now think about
asking other questions I never even
thought of and if that turnaround time
for question two responses days then
you're going to not be able to explore
the territory you could normally explore
and maybe there has an impact on your
business and maybe actually do you lose
against out competed with a company who
can explore more territory and when we
live coding one of the things I talked
about before was the importance of of
communicating risk or maybe I didn't
mention that I should have mentioned
ever didn't that when we live coding
we're showing that thing's alive and
they can go wrong right and so we're
projecting risk and risk actually is a
very good thing right when you're
learning how are your understanding a
risk as an important thing when you
learn to walk you don't learn to walk by
avoiding falling over right you learn to
walk by just falling over learning to
fall over knowing that's going to happen
so you understand the risks can you
accept them right you know the things
are going to go wrong I experienced this
when I used to do walking in the hills
and the mountains I used to walk down
the hill like a nutter but really
quickly knowing I was going to fall over
and when I did I had a strategy for
falling over to fogo embrace and then
carried on again whereas all the other
people in my group were like gently
picking themselves down and they would
fall over just as many if not more times
than me and her themselves because they
weren't expecting to fall over now when
we think about lioness actually this is
the risk thing when you're in a business
context
extern you've got a deadline of
something all you've got to answer some
questions and the call to the answers
can have an impact on the outcomes of
that specific business aspects using
very abstract terms your ability to deal
with risk can be quite an important
thing in the sense that if you're
unafraid ask questions which are risky
as in they might not yield good results
well you know that the time to get them
back is short so it's okay you're going
to be more like to explore more risky
kinds of questions and areas and then
maybe yield great results where's
otherwise maybe you constraint are only
doing things look plausible and maybe
that just really doesn't give you the
ability to intro to go to interesting
places so liveness and programming
starts becoming quite interesting thing
feedback is all about all the time
exploration fail early failures positive
I've seen these things already and
failure to perceive failure is failure
that's what a silly thing to say but
that's really what i'm trying to say and
one thing i like to talk about is that
we always talk about efficiency of
things or efficiency of what's so a fish
computational efficiency can be quite an
important thing but so can conceptual
efficiency so can modifying your program
of your language such that conceiving of
ideas communicating those ideas mulling
them in your head can be an efficient
practice you know and that's just as
important in certain contexts if not
more important in certain context it's
important to be aware of these things
yeah and it was to finish off until the
slides here's here's me performing it a
really quite fancy art gallery called
the arnolfini in Bristol this is like
one of the most famous live art
galleries in the world and I'm something
there actually this case I got this
thing called a monome with buttons
programming and this is interesting for
me because I started this I I'd like a
metamorphosis justice and tireless
experience as performance for me I
started it as an engineer no I built
this software that made this music and I
had built a workflow of evaluate this
evaluate this right this bit of code
violence this and then practiced it okay
so I went into this situation knowing
exactly what it's going to do and I
thought if I just did those things and I
didn't make a mistake then everyone's
going to be happy I've done my
performance
and as I was doing it I'm saying this is
a wasted opportunity I could maybe I
could actually maybe I can enjoy this
maybe I could sort of try and sit back a
bit feel what it's like to do this now
and actually and to Percy the the
interactions of the program as something
which isn't just a mechanical set of
simple manipulations or in this case
finger manipulations and so I did that
and I had really felt beautiful I really
felt that I was seeing the code or
seeing the interaction in a new way now
it sounds really hippie and ridiculous
and when I went back to the computer
labs and I was trying to explain this to
people they were like what are you
talking about this is not what
programming is where we're an
engineering or mathematics or a
functional semantics so and and I think
actually we're all of those things and
there is an important part in the
experience of programming the actual act
of doing it which which often is
neglected and here it was massively
emphasized and that was an opportunity
to explore that as as an aspect which
which we all know about now we all know
that certain editors for us are in more
enjoyable or certain languages have
certain interactive features that we are
like using we know about this and it's
important to actually accept that that
she is an important part of programming
so I got any minutes left was it just
time for questions what's it was it also
scratch sorry type of questions right
okay well I was going to do some live
coding but it's all gone last night was
it was the live coding so hope you
enjoyed that and any questions the stage
yes
so are you describing their that
audience heard the question or the turn
the camera didn't was try summarize all
of that in a small snippet was that it
seemed to me that the crooks it was
about having environments where you
would throw random stuff and then you'd
be able to try to perceive patterns in
that and use your ability to throw
streamed of things and then a destructor
diet or fine patterns and then use that
to take you to interesting directions I
think that that's absolutely something I
do all the time so when I'm designing
you synthesizers I'm just mashing sounds
together and listening to one sound
interesting and using that as a filter
and then you finding interesting
building blocks which you can apply
later on but also the work I've been
doing certainly with the circles and the
notice or before that had to fit
specifically into a computer science
curriculum where that kind of approach
isn't even recognized you know it's
actually an important part and I'm
working now on a bid to take the sonic
PI software make it more live make it
more like over time where I have this
interactive experience and I'm using
that specifically focus on music
I'm not a computer science one because
it's really hard to see how certainly in
the UK the current new computer science
curriculum could deal with things that
live pneus talked about algorithms and
data structures and functions of doing
do this do this do this and so the kind
of draw circle player note fits
perfectly with the with the curriculum
but this throw random stuff at it you
know when we worked when we collaborated
with choreographer who's in it and very
famous going for random dance Wayne
McGregor one things he did is he got the
dancers to just to do random stuff right
and he'd actually the whole game of the
game was to get in to do the most random
thing possible so he'd be drawing
geometric shapes on piece of paper get
him to imagine the head and then to
dance around the geometric mean I can't
do very well and maybe watch them to all
these crazy ridiculous movie on my like
that bit all right and any do it himself
and then that become part of his actual
final piece so that's exactly what you
described like have a lot of noise
figure out the interesting parts and
this is definitely part of the creative
process and and ways to actually get
more people to actually experience that
as an individual phenomenon would be
wonderful yeah I computing starts off of
that opportunity as well it's great to
find those opportunities any more
questions yep
okay Craig could hit the children bra
yeah so the question is old computer
games used to have a you could press a
key in like a console will come down
which allow you to interact with the
game and these are being phased out so
are there any ways we could not do that
well tower game companies who want to be
able interact with these things yeah
totally we want to console for
everything absolutely and so that the
approach I've taken with overtone and
the matter X and making music is to have
the programming language as the
fundamental like if you can't code it
it's no point then if you use these
sliders of faders whatever that's fine
as long as they are a thing on top of a
programming construct you know and so
may the console is the environments and
then the other stuff is actually just
fancy just nicer ways or sugar
essentially on top of the programming
languages and I think that as we as we
starting to communicate to people the
power of this approach more people are
going to want to I think but until we
can do that communication then still
going to happen and that's that's that's
the interesting thing how do we do that
and society can't even perceive
programming only they see two people on
the same keyboard and think its
programming it so that's not credible
right and how can we communicate even
that you know yeah I mean the fact that
I get so people can get away with that
nonsense is that should depress us you
know we've obviously failed to
communicate what programming is to
people if they think two people on the
same keyboard is a is a faster
experience unhackable zor the rooters
yeah any more questions that one more
so the question is how to get involved
the classroom so I was given an
opportunity to have a three-month
project because my contracted extent as
it ended at University and they had some
money to for someone to work on a very
quick gorilla project and I said well I
can take my music stuff and maybe I can
build something and I thought that they
asked me this is least my communication
to build a prototype which could be used
in a classroom context in three months I
thought I was quite feasible but when I
agreed to it and I had my first meeting
you turn out they wanted me to build an
actual real thing which could be used or
should be used engineered completely so
the children can bang on it and not
break in and a lesson plan and cabrillo
teachers angle it in classrooms in three
months so it was a was a nightmare but I
managed to succeed you answer a lot of
fun that's why I'm using Ruby because I
used to be Ruby programmers I just use
the language I knew how to build
something very quickly in the more
questions so hopefully you're going to
go away and we think about what program
might mean to you and to and to take on
the challenge of communicating the world
what programming is and what it could be
because I think that's really important
