talk about a project called vendee it
started some of you may have seen a talk
I give a few years ago at early DC on a
program called wingman and this has been
the evolution of that so the basic
premise is a three years ago friend and
I you know we realize there is a major
problem and that is ordering beer at a
bar and you know if you're if you're you
know a college grad or you remember
college going to the bar or even you
know here in Stockholm some of the bars
is like you have to fight your way to
get to the front you know you're yelling
your name sometimes they get your tab
correct sometimes they don't at the end
of the night you want to go check out
but that's another 15 minute wait maybe
you're sitting there and you're like I'd
really like another drink but you know I
want to stay with my friends I don't
want to deal with all that stuff so we
decided to write a quick back-end
prototype in Erlang we also wrote a
front-end application for the patrons
and basically thrown from there so I'm
going to basically be telling this story
of vendee and if you're wondering why
the name changed from I don't know if
it's a colloquialism internationally but
at least when you're in the US the term
wingman means basically someone who's
trying to help you find a partner at a
bar so the whole concept was all you
know this applications your wingman is
going to help you get drinks and stuff
but once we want to go get funding we
realized you know people were a bit
hesitant about that obviously you know
there's probably you know some sexist
undertones who never intended it to be
but just to be safe we decided to
rebrand ourselves and and since I know
there's also been a lot of process
improvements so I'm going to go in and
talk about that but the big question is
can you build a successful startup in
your spare time and my answer to this is
yes and the question is you know how do
you do it and so let's talk about that
but first of all now what's the who what
when where why and how I'm Jordan is the
nice things for the nice introduction I
currently work at chef
I've been doing distributed systems for
quite a long time I've always been
interested ever since I was a kid and
Erlang was kind of a natural fit for
that I started i think my first
derivative system was in c++ or
something then i messed around with o
camel and Haskell and then I found this
cool language that kind of combines juba
systems and functional language and it
was beautiful so that was back in my
freshman year of college and now I'm
here so it was kind of dumb luck that i
stumbled across the language that
happens to be very popular now and it's
kind of exciting so now I'm talking here
today so I've also worked at 59 which is
a it's still called the startup but it's
fairly well funded self-sufficient
generates a lot of money and it's called
59 they're basically telecom back-end
systems company before that I worked at
mitre and Fermilab and again it was you
know these big distributed systems for
those unfamiliar Fermilab that's the
particle collider that was used to in
Chicago now it's been replaced by large
hadron collider but with any of these
systems you know you have these like
kind of real-time systems are
distributed you know kilometers in a
circle and it's always been a lot of fun
for me but what I'd also like to know is
who are you so first of all can people
raise their hands if they kind of use
Erlang on a daily basis or that's their
job cool how many people here are
evaluating Erlang is maybe a potential
solution to a problem they have or
they're going to be having awesome how
many people here have brought a mobile
application on some kind of phone
platform awesome and finally how many of
wrote a web application doesn't have to
be Erling awesome nice mix that's good
we got a nice crowd so just to quickly
introduce the rest of the team just so I
can give them some credit i co-founded
this with Lionel Levine basically the
way we met was from a mutual friend I
met him the day before I was going to
kilimanjaro in the day after he'd gotten
in a fight and so we both had
interesting stories and we started a
bond he's like hey I'm working on this
cool idea I just won this grant at
Carnegie Mellon to develop it and I'm
like well hey I'm a backend engineer and
you know let's let's combine forces and
see what we can do since then we kind of
have like a
our team of about six people but then we
also have about 20 to 30 other people
kind of around the country that help us
in different markets and so on and just
to be very clear this is a like this has
all been privately funded it's been very
low cost we've just kind of like
utilized or college network and that
entrepreneurial spirit of people have
just graduated now they want to apply
this new business knowledge as marketing
knowledge and I'll talk a little bit
more about that later on again if this
is kind of focused for someone who has
like kind of a big idea and they want to
kind of do it at a low cost and you know
what are the resources available for
someone like that so to go a little bit
more into the product it started as
simply as being able to order a drink on
your phone your phone tells you when
it's ready so it's asynchronous just
like Erlang and once it's ready you get
a push notification and there's a
special part of the bar that you just
walk up to be like here's the code on my
phone bartenders here's your drink and
you're good to go the application is
already has your credit card in it it
takes care of charging it and at the end
of the night you can just close out your
tab if you're with friends you could
split the tab you know it's the whole
point of this is so just make it as easy
for the customer as possible on the same
token this actually helps bars because
it removes an inefficiency right these
like everyone knows in queueing theory
it's always good to have a single line
right then you disperse them across the
people who can help you instead of just
having everyone flood to all the
available bartenders and so we're trying
to use technology to in apply in that
manner since then we realize you know
like wow that's a cool problem it's not
necessarily sustainable because when
you're talking about mobile applications
mobile payment ordering goods and
services the margins are very slim right
because the credit card companies and
the monopolies and everything else they
have enough power and enough breath that
they can you know just basically push
down the prices so it's very hard to
make money the other thing is one of the
things we learned as we're going through
this we did a bunch of studies and
analysis and maybe if you learn nothing
else from this talk realize that
customers do lie to
so if you give them a survey and you ask
them a question on one of the main
questions was kind of the foundational
question was is someone willing to pay
money for the convenience of ordering a
drink by their phone and so we posed the
question would you be willing to pay
fifteen cents per a drink if that met
not having to wait in line and
everyone's like yeah sign me up sign me
up and you know it sounded good in
theory but in practice people become
really finicky when you start adding
these like little charges if they can
say fifteen cents some people will wait
ten minutes there's a shop in let's
start in Chicago butts in the u.s. is
called jimmy johns and they had this
promotion where you could get a sub for
one dollar is like this big promotion
there was people waiting in line for an
hour and a half you could not pay me
money to wait in line just to get a
sandwich but you know people they like
good deals they like values and we were
also dealing with kind of the the
Facebook Gmail effect where everyone
expects these services to be free so we
had a kind of change in realign a little
bit and start focusing on you know have
a good experience for the customer but
at the end of the day we're going to
have to make our money from the
establishments so yeah why we got this
kind of cool base system in place how do
we make the life easier for the
establishment because also they're the
ones that have to adopt it initially so
what we do well the way we started was
we gave them a free tablet had our
software on it we gave them a free
hotspot and the way we initially got
them to agree to it even for the slight
inconvenience because you know
everything is free to them they're still
adopting a new system the way the way
we're able to at least at the end of the
day maybe help them on their margins a
little bit is a scenario where you're
out with your friends you go to one bar
and you're like yeah I'm kind of tired
of this let's go to the next bar and by
the end of the night maybe you've gone
to four or five bars so in a normal
scenario you swipe your card at every
bar so you pay the you know there's
always an upfront cost on a transaction
fee and plus you always pay a percentage
now imagine instead of paying you know
five different upfront costs if you
could pull those together and have one
charge at the end of the night which
we're able to do with our platform then
you're only just paying that one up
front transaction costs so you still
have to pay that percentage but your Lea
saving
little bit of money and we can pass
those costs on to the bars and you may
say well like you know does that really
add up and it does because you know
we're talking about college kids who
have like you know they're buying cheap
drinks and they keep ordering through
boring and you know they go wherever the
fun is so they move around a lot during
the night and we have found that it
actually does work so that's one way you
know at the end of the day we can say
worst case you get these free services
and you'll probably save some money so
that was our initial cell but then you
know we wanted to make their lives
easier so we started looking at
analytics inventory traction inventory
tracking and point-of-sale systems and
so on and I'll talk a little bit more
about those later but that's essentially
the product also I guess just one ground
rule for my talk I do like a dynamic
talk so if you have questions feel free
to ask it any time and you know I always
have the right to you know delay that
answering it if I feel it's better for
later on so again just this is just a
I'm not as much on the business side
that's my partner but there definitely
is money to be made here and I'm going
to go over some of the you know other
people are kind of in mobile payments
there are people who have also tried to
do mobile ordering before and so far
there's no clear winner it you know it's
hard to tell if it's like you know the
red ocean or blue ocean or what have you
but there's a lot of money right so even
if you get like a sliver of that you may
be able to you know at least
self-sustained yourself and for people
who are programmers and engineers that's
kind of a dream job right to
self-sustain yourself be able to do what
you love to do and that's our goal so
these are just some of the recent ones
the most interesting case here I think
is tab down they were the competitor we
worry most about but they failed but
when they felt they did us a huge favor
they posted why they felt a huge
write-up about all the things they tried
all their mistakes all the wasted money
and we were able to learn from all that
and depending on what product you're
doing there's advantages to competitors
beating you to the market initially for
like a new niche that you're trying to
develop
the positive is the consumer has now
experienced mobile payments so they're
familiar with it they're maybe not as
scared of it just like when cellphones
first came out you know like people are
like wait a second but now that it's
become a little more accepted but at the
same time like for the most part all of
these services that kind of targeted you
know the bar scene they all failed and
that can also leave a bad taste in the
mouths of the people have use those apps
before so you do have to kind of balance
that as well so if I were to you know
give some advice I would say what's
what's happened now is that you know
some of these bigger people like Google
paypal they're starting developed mobile
payment systems I know Clara is here in
Europe we're not like you know
necessarily directly competing with them
in fact you know if we we plan to be
able to use them as payment methods as
well and we're more focused on ordering
but you those those companies as soon as
you know there's always the risk right
as soon as DCC someone else is making
money from the application of their
product you know they may try to jump in
there so it's the way our approach was
you know instead of being out on the
west coast with all these other people
kind of beating each other up we started
in the east coast in Pittsburgh by
Carnegie Mellon on this area called
Oakland and from there we were able to
kind of be in a bubble like no one knew
about us and this allowed us to like
learn from everyone else who's being
very public right like all these big
companies for whatever reason startups
like they want to make like you know
hacker news and all these different
websites because they think that's
helpful but I think a lot of times that
almost forces you to go too fast too
soon and then you feel like you just
have to go you know go for bust and they
go all out and they fail so we got
really lucky in that we were we're in an
area where we will not worked a lot of
us went to school in that area so we we
know all the bars we know the bartenders
we know the owners we know the students
we know all the organizations and so we
had a very friendly audience while we
were testing this for the first year and
you know we had around
I think at most two hundred users and a
night we never publicly launched this
was all again we controlled everything
because we you know it's like a study
that's you know kind of the lean
methodology right you you have a
hypothesis and you test it and you keep
iterating over that and in doing so we
found out that you know we're not going
to make money on transactions so we have
to offer services right we have to use
this data we have to basically sell
something that doesn't exist already so
what we what we do is we have basically
two main income sources one is ad
revenue and it's not a typical at right
it's not going to be like a in game ad
it's going to be you have your phone you
walk by a bar all the sudden you get a
pop-up you're like hey if you come into
this bar you can get two for one drinks
you have your your GPS coordinates and
they're able to do like live deals and
the best part is is I get this
notification on my phone you're
essentially assured that they see it
they either click it or they don't so
like you definitively know if that ad
worked on that person or not also if you
do different specials during the week
maybe you have ladies night you have
different happy hours maybe trivia night
you can see you know what clientele
comes from these different types of
specials and now you're allowing the
establishments themselves to you know
use these analytics to test their own
hypothesis so you know we're in a sense
empowering them and of course you can
aggregate all this information and
probably resell it to people like
Budweiser who are trying to also target
the demographics and learn more about
them so there's there's lots of
potential again it is like you know why
did we choose colleges right because for
us to make money to get more data we
care about quantity not necessarily
quality of the booze if you will so like
the more people order drinks and like we
can see the type of drinks they order
and you know naturally these are going
to college students so even if we decide
to charge the establishment maybe five
cents per drink that everyone orders
that is a very quickly you know people
can drink 12 beers in a night if it's
like a Budweiser right I know you guys
you know in Europe that's I don't worry
I don't like it either but
so where do we stand presently so as I
said before and I'm not saying this has
been the best method but we're still
alive and we're still very viable so
it's you know in as far as I know
there's no existing competitors or at
least public that are still out there
competing against us so again we had
kind of this trial period over a year
and this was essentially me programming
everything in my spare time so this is
doable it's achievable I did we did
outsource like a little bit to design
work and things like that but you know
it depends on your situation how quickly
you have to get the market or not but
we've been lucky so far so now we've you
know we've we've done all these studies
we found out the features that bars need
and we've developed our product over
time and now we're you know we're
actually my partners in New York City
right now working on funding and we're
planning to do a full public launch in
the first quarter of next year so it's
you know it's kind of exciting kind of
cool and it's all been in erling so I've
always been very happy so that's kind of
that's kind of the business side of
things and I'll come back a little bit
more about kind of the future and what
we're looking to do and and basically
show you all the things that are
possible in Erlang but for now this is
also an architecture talk so i am going
to give a high-level talk but as i said
in the description of the talk i should
hopefully be understandable to most
people so it's very simple we have a
rest interface right now it's
implemented in web machine you may ask
why not cowboy why not something else
this was literally started three years
ago what machine was the big player at
the time cowboy was out but it was a
little bit buggy it's gotten a lot
better since then and if I you know if I
had the time I probably would put in
cowboy but also we have I have a bunch
of modules for different payment
providers like ogen is one in Europe
off-net is obviously the US and there's
also you know I'll talk about some of
the other modules and stuff that are
going to be part of this and if you
didn't read the description all this is
going to be
and source today so you'll have access
to all these different modules for
interacting with all these different
payment providers and a bunch of other
services that will make a life easier
but i'll talk about that a little bit
later then on the back end the debate
database is postgres i actually started
with couch and for whatever reason it
just you know I did some early on
testing always a good thing to do early
testing and found out it just wouldn't
hold up the response times would be kind
of weird and it was never consistent and
I just didn't feel comfortable with it I
will admit I just like used a hosted
couch provider and I used the free plan
because you know I'm trying to bootstrap
on nothing basically an didn't work out
so I talked with my friend Tristan
solder he actually works at Heroku also
a big user of Erlang and they also offer
hosted postgres so I kind of told them
my situation and it's like oh yeah why
don't you just use postgres so I'm like
well I already have everything JSON and
I can just store that immediately couch
you know it's kind of annoying he's like
well you know I actually been thinking
about writing this application to you
know facilitate that right be able to
read and write JSON to postgres
efficiently and that's what we did so we
came up with a program for doing that
and that's also already open sourced and
I'll talk about that also a little bit
later but this is just kind of a
high-level view and it may see simple
but it really is i mean once you look at
the code it's you know a couple of
applications there's not that many lines
that's the beauty of Erling right you
can rapidly prototype these things so
going a little bit more into the the
interactions that this you know kind of
framework provides and I should be very
clear like this is still kind of at an
alpha State you know I haven't had you
know the the time and the resources to
make this necessarily enterprise-ready
so it very much is a work in progress
but it's you know it's it's held up for
me and I've you know I've tested it
fairly well something like if you look
at the code it like not everything is
completely spect out there's you know
little craft here and there but for the
most part it works well but i think the
the biggest benefits is you get you know
there's a client for urban airship a
client for pub nub that you can use an
urban airship is push notifications that
were
for almost any phone great service pub
nub is obviously a publish-subscribe
provider so I interact with all those
and this is actually the full list of
the technologies use so I already talked
about Heroku I talked about postgres i
use jsx i provide alternatives for some
of these this is just kind of a
high-level view for if you're trying to
approach a project like these are kind
of the the libraries that I've used and
in some cases that I believe are kind of
the best that exists now where i provide
alternatives i think it's still kind of
up in the air just the one note on peeps
out this was actually another startup
and they were kind of our first
collaboration so the premise behind
peeps out is they put a webcam in every
bar and the goal of that is like I can
look at my phone and I can see what kind
of activities going out that bar maybe I
want a quiet bar so I can just have a
nice drink with a friend or maybe I want
to go dancing and I want to go to a
place that's packed so we've combined
peeps out with our applications so they
can you know find the bar they want and
go there and now they have all the
ordering capabilities you know
everything's on their phone and that's
all great just a couple of other things
if you're going to use Heroku even not
these these services are also usable
outside of Roku but blitz is really
great for doing load testing it's like
basically load testing from the cloud
paper trail is a really good for Heroku
it just a nice view of a quick view of
your logs so i definitely recommend
those and now i'm just going to go over
a quick demo of the code and then just
show you like you know kind of how easy
it is to go all right so it's already
built so i'm just going to start it
okay so if I cat user one as you can see
you just have a user idea I will for
this kind of like talk I've kind of
simplified things a little bit so this
isn't like the exact actual code I just
wanted to make it a little easier for
the talk but we can go ahead and run
this command and you'll see yeah it
worked we got a key awesome now let's go
ahead and do an order there's also log
in but we've made it so when you
register you can also just generate your
key at the same time so i'll go ahead
and skip that so if I cat order
basically you'll you'll see it's the
user and these drinks are mapped to a
menu that's on the server side we
support things like pick up or you can
also get service to your table these
were different things that evolved over
time as a request came in I don't want
to actually charge my card and it's not
a real card anyway so it's zero dollars
the other thing is we also force them to
supply both the key and the password
just as like kind of a make sure someone
steals your phone they out there like
retype their password before they can
order a drink onew bad argh oh well it's
not too important yeah I mean this
wasn't meant to be too much don't know
but it worked before anyways the other
thing I want to talk about the two main
points that I've this is this is things
I've learned in the past three years
like when I first wrote this code I
think DevOps was just beginning and you
know continuous integration was around
but now we have this like coal
continuous deployment continuous
delivery they're finally becoming
popular we have lean methodology of conv
and all this cool stuff but I really do
recommend that if you won't have any
kind of product that you're during on
you do need continuous integration at
the very least and you also want to have
some kind of continuous deployment and
it doesn't necessarily have to be like
one button that's the ideal in my case
it's like essentially two buttons so if
you have an erlang project and it's on
github you should be using Travis all
you have to do
is simply add this file in your top
level and you know replace script with
whatever builds it if you're just using
a general rebar application Heroku is
going to be smart enough to know about
it or sorry Travis is going to be smart
enough to know about it but you can
specify the all the different versions
of Erlang to make sure everything's
backward compatible you know like they
change the types of like dicked and a
few other things so great easy freeway
to test your open source software now
Heroku eyes so again you don't have to
use Heroku you don't have to even use
you know a provider of a hosted platform
you can you can do it yourself there's
open source tools to spin that up
yourself but you should you should be
setting it up in such a way that you
have a reproducible way to deploy your
software and Heroku is really easy for
that i'm not sure if erling is still
unofficially supported or officially yet
but again Heroku uses Erlang very
heavily internally so it it always works
i've never had an issue and now they're
also working on being able to let the
the different notes talk together it
used to be you had your node you
couldn't talk outside of it but now you
can create these connections where you
can actually you know spin up EPMD and
have you know two nodes talking to each
other and it's actually pretty cool so
and a lot of you probably know people
from her oka in the community to and
they're always happy to help so it's
it's been really nice so I'm going to
basically show you how to basically make
this work on Heroku I say from local to
hosted and 60 seconds I maybe you'll be
able to do that we'll see i think i
could if i wasn't giving a talk so the
first thing you just want to do is I
like have the depths and the beam files
and stuff so I'm just going to go ahead
and get rid of those i also just added
all the files with get made an initial
commit and now everything's just in a
nice little local get repository now I
can do Heroku logon and through my deets
cool now I want to go ahead and create
the project so the way you do this with
erling is you have these things called
build packs and right now I think
there's there was like an original build
pack and then it kind of fork to a newer
one i'm still using the older one just
because it works and there's you know
little differences of the new one so
anyways this basically told Heroku I
have this project I want you to it's an
erlang project I want you to take care
of it when I push it to you so if a rock
is like okay so you also want to add
your keys and her oak is very nice if
you don't already have a key would have
generated it for you now we're going to
go ahead and add the Postgres database
so again this is completely free at the
development level and I've had no issues
if you pay more money you basically get
more caching okay now there's just this
nuance thing to promote it to being the
primary database
so if you run Heroku coops not dash run
ho karoku config it'll actually print
out these are going to be the
environment in variables that you have
access to once your software is on
Heroku so this database URL is something
you can actually parse out when your
application is starting and then use
that and connect to it and that that's
your database I also will mention that
you know her Okla has these like other
cool features like you can have
databases that follow each other which
in essence creates mirrors of the
database so the other thing is I just
ever hold on that makes sense okay so
need to go back and get the this URL and
I need to go to place the code is
already built because I deleted all my
stuff that he needed
alright so I'm just sitting at local
leave now this is just this is spinning
up dick dick and then just creating
users establishments and orders table on
the database again normally like this is
all taken care of behind the scenes but
I wanted to at least expose some of the
stuff so that's all cool now we just
commit everything routine whoops have to
add everything first
what
maybe I already had oh that's what it
was all right I need to reinitialize it
I was practicing before and I forgot to
clear it out so go ahead and redo that
okay that makes more sense
ok so everything's committed now we can
just push rope it is not appear to be a
git repository Oh since I redid it have
to do this part again I apologize
okay then add this again
to give me a dog gave me a bronze one
this is one a knight's it seems to just
randomly decide which type of database
it's going to give you
okay so now we can go ahead and push it
so this is literally pushing to Heroku
github server and once it has a hook on
in server side that recognizes we
specified Erling build pack gets the
build pack it knows how to pull down the
dependencies using rebar and now it's
building it and it usually takes you
know around 45 seconds or so
anyways we can go back to it so that's
kind of just a quick tech park I don't
want to get involved too much because
you can read the code for yourself but I
did I did just want to again kind of a
lessons learned thing so one thing we
did we outsource a lot of our logos and
stuff to 99 designs that's a great
service for the establishment
application it's very important that you
realize you know who's going to be using
your software so if it's a bartender
they're very busy so you need something
that's responsive so having a native
application was very important but for
the phone application it was just going
to be way too much work again without
money to support two separate platforms
initially so we use the phone gap which
when we use it it was again we were kind
of an early adopter of it and it was a
little slow a little buggy but it's got
better over time but even with that if
you had to choose and you have the
resources i always recommend building
native apps because what we've had to do
is basically pay a ton of technical debt
we've had to do a lot of JavaScript
weeks on the individual iOS and
individual Android and the phonegap
pieces are pretty much non-existent now
and once we do get funding we do plan to
rewrite both to be native we also have a
web portal this allows the
establishments to look at their menus
update them and so on and so forth and
one thing we also are starting to
integrate is inventory management so you
know let's say you want a vodka red bull
or something but they're all out of red
bull and now I order a drink and I'm
like why isn't it working i go the
bartender it's like oh yeah we're out of
red bull sorry you know i had to cancel
your order if we were able to track the
inventory and integrate that we would
know when they're out and then the menu
automatically updates and again this is
kind of streamlines their process makes
their lives easier and in the end it
makes everyone happy it's kind of in
every one win situation so the future so
my biggest goal is this is somehow used
by someone else to do something I don't
care what I've had two ideas that i
would like maybe to do one is everyone's
probably familiar if the Starbucks app
with this you could easily make that for
any independent coffee shop you want I
think you could do it in a week I just
it's not my priority but it would be
really awesome if it's just a private
coffee shop wants to have their own
mobile application they could use this
the other thing I've been looking at is
I have a friend Eric merit who's also in
the community and he he married a
Peruvian woman so i was in peru for his
wedding and one thing there is not it no
one has credit cards you pay everything
in cash and prue these days is becoming
a bit unsafe so it's not always fun to
carry cash but it but it would be nice
if you can basically use this as kind of
like a mobile bank so like I could
literally go to a bar that supports
fendi give them you know ten dollars or
ten soldes or whatever it is and they
could credit that to my account any
essentially the bars become like you
know mini ATMs right so I can just take
my cash to a safe place I get credit on
my account and now it's on my phone
which you know maybe that's not
completely safe but you can obviously
you know have encryption and different
mechanisms so if someone steals your
phone they're at least not able to use
your money and it's it's better than
carrying cash I get my friend Eric was
actually held at gunpoint in Peru so
it's a very real threat and you know
I've been in you know and and Tanzania
as well and it's like these aren't
places that have credit cards they don't
loans they don't anything like that so
being able to make their lives a little
easier because everyone does have a cell
phone you know they they came late to
the game but that means they had access
to like they got to decide how to build
their snoo infrastructure with the best
available technology so their technology
is actually really good and could
support something like this as one final
kind of teaser before I answer questions
there's another project I'm working on
with Eric merit again and ROM sing you
may know them or you may not but it's
called vote raise calm we're basically
going to be a Kickstarter for political
campaigns so let's say you want to test
the waters you want to see if you can
get enough money to be a viable
candidate if you get a thousand people
to pledge a hundred dollars crosses a
threshold you automatically become a
candidate and life is good so this
allows you you know this is makes a
little safer for me as a constituent
maybe like I'd really love to support
this third-party candidate but i just
want
money Adam if he's not even going to run
or doesn't get enough support we've
partnered with Trevor Potter some of you
may know him from The Colbert Report
he's the one who helped with the super
PAC he's so that's kind of cool he's
basically the expert on pax and to be
very clear you know in the u.s. there's
been a lot of stuff around you know
don't the campaign laws and stuff we're
basically trying to make everything
transparent right so like there's these
laws now like basically banning limits
and all this stuff we're not I want to
be very clear we're not trying to take
advantage of that we're merely trying to
like we want to show like you know is a
good money is a bad money that's coming
to this district and so people can you
know have a clearer picture but the part
you probably care about is we're doing
everything in a camel which is a really
cool language it's another functional
language obviously and we're going to be
open sourcing that in September will be
giving a talk at cfb and we have a
integration with dynamo dB amazon Donna
would you be amazon SQS we basically
have complete support for I management
roles and ec2 everything like you like
you literally compile your code and if
you want it to go it goes through all
this testing uses all these systems
they're all scalable we have libraries
for all of that and right now the kind
of last piece is the bank integration
piece I think once we solve that problem
that'll actually be also be very helpful
to people because right now for most
banks there's no api's you're basically
ft peeing these different types of files
and it's a mess so we're also trying to
clean that up so if if you're like you
know you love Erlang but you want to try
something new I think the stuff we're
doing 10 Campbell is gonna be really
exciting for a lot of people and I do
want to just you know give credit to the
people at mirage us because we are using
some of their work and they're doing
some really cool stuff to with deploying
these like minimal virtual machines on
bare metal and all that cool stuff so
you should check them out as well so yep
basically lessons learned or legs
awesomes testings awesome automation is
awesome you guys are all awesome I
appreciate you for listening and I
really do hope you know someone does
something with this or some parts of it
but if you don't you know like
definitely try doing stuff
oops it's fun it's a great experience
please open source your code because we
all benefit and you know we're all
communities is still very small
community so it's very appreciative when
you give back and if anyone's new to
Erling it hasn't learned i justjust give
a shameless plug we do this thing called
Erling camp once or twice a year and
it's a two-day course and then basically
assumes you know almost nothing at the
end of the day you can write an erlang
program that said the code is going to
be there I just have one last scrub to
remove proprietary stuff I'll do that
like an hour and thank you Andy so we
have time for a few questions I think
they're one first of all thanks very
much for your talk I have two questions
first question is do you think you can
grow your startup organically because
you mentioned you're now asking for
funding and as you mashed your also self
sustained some confusion how I make
money out of people's money and second
question is held the bars manage their
menus so when a new barman introducing
you drink how do they push this to the
to the applications yeah so we have a
vendor portal it's actually it's based
on the patron code because it's like
when you're looking at a bars menu I
mean it's read-only we just made that
like read write and put a web interface
on that so yeah we definitely support
that we also support things like
specials like order modifications if
like you want to order pizza and have
all these different toppings we support
all of that we support like you know
that you want fifty percent off like
certain days of the week or two for one
all that and that's all integrated into
the vendor portal you can specify all
those different things as far as funding
goes it's you know I think I think we
could do it but I I feel like we're
maybe lessening our risk a little bit
and I think we're getting to the point
to where we've been ok with going slow
but I think now we kind of do have to
try to make that jump and we're not
asking for a ton of money we're just we
just want money basically to buy the
hardware like we give ever
rebar tablet and a wireless access point
you know just like just so we eliminate
any variables we control the hardware
and make sure the Internet's always
working and besides that then it's just
it's just pure marketing money so it's
like maybe like a couple hundred
thousand dollars you know compared to
how much money other people try to get I
think it's fairly reasonable and it's
also to develop these bigger features
like POS integration and stuff like that
which is is time-consuming ok we have
another one here from what I saw you
have you supports two payments providers
yes do you have any issues with PCI
compliance and such stuff yeah we are
PCI compliant actually the four off net
at least if you go through the whole PCI
compliance there's like different levels
but the if you go through the complete
process you get better rates and you
don't get charged these monthly fees
which are in essence insurance so yeah
it is violently though it's hooking me
probably a week to go through it all
okay and do you I assume you have
libraries or not like libraries that's
interface with Alf net and this yeah
those are actually on Earl we're right
now on github oh okay so they are open
because I open source some parts of it
earlier but now I'm like this is just
kind of the last core part okay okay
thank you okay here we have another one
thanks for talk I wonder how do you
compare web development which along with
other popular technologies because I can
I have an image how would it be with
Ireland because I have been home tara
and once you start the rolling if you
need to expand your group wouldn't it be
a problem to find developers for example
well this may i may offend some people
this comment but Erlang is a kind of a
self-selecting language so people that
know erling tend to be better engineers
because it requires a little more
investment in your
time and I would rather hire one really
solid erling engineer than 10 you know
kind of mid-level Java engineers and I
think by having smaller teams you're
more efficient and I think at the end of
the day you know like the the pros
outweigh the console like yeah it is
harder to find someone but syrup there's
still no furling developers yeah and
they're out a bit of a premium these
days but it's it's not much more than
for a high-end java developer and also i
think you know if like like with any
functional language you spend more time
thinking about the problem and then the
implementation just kind of follows the
solution right you you think of it in
your mind whereas I I always felt like
this maybe because I was younger but
like with Java is like you're struggling
more if the language versus solving the
problem and so I think you know the
benefits completely outweigh any
negatives and there are plenty of
companies now that I've proven that the
risk of using Erlang it's not that big
of a risk they've been successful so
it's mostly mitigating one I think we're
actually running out of time so I just
want to thank you it was very bold
presentation lots of demos and they're
not around applause and don't forget to
vote thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
