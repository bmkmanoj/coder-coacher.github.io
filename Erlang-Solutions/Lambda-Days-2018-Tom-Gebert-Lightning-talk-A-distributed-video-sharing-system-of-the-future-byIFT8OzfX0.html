calm and repurpose this from a
presentation I did at jet the sign said
disturbed I think I was a typo and I
wrote it and I thought disturbs a much
better name anyway so I just renamed it
okay so my project is effectively to use
something a distributed hash table
network to make a fully decentralized
youtube clone and to have a good
interface on top of that because you
know why not the name was originally
clobberella and apparently if I got to
change that so I wrote a library in
Haskell for academia which is the same
distributed hash table and network that
torrents use and while you know this is
nothing new Torn's has been around for
forever
the problem with torrents is that
they're kind of pain in the ass to set
up and you know if I have to tell my
parents to go you know set up you know
port forwarding and NAT traversal they
have told me to be quiet and eat my
dinner so the so so you have an
interface it's equivalent to YouTube and
relatively easy so the main value though
is that YouTube is really expensive to
maintain
I'm YouTube's great but the problem is
is that transcoding video is incredibly
expensive videos are giants of storing
them will take a lot of storage and
bandwidth is also expensive because
these videos are huge and there's got to
be a better way and III think there is
and the main benefit of this is that
there's no central storage is entirely
socialistic and the videos are
partitioned into parts of ten so even
when you upload any video it's spread
across the entire network and then
transcoded so your your so everyone's
kind of participating into the entire
group so the more people that join the
better it gets
um so just a demo of basically how this
works this is actually not a very good
picture of Cattleya but I also am not
very smart so it works the so I'm Tom
here and if I wanted to have a path to
Rita here
I would have to I could just easily
communicate to my wife a Stephanie then
she would talk to Jen and there's a
computer at least a local Jenny's and
then she would talk to Nancy and then
she talked to Rita so I'd be able to
grab the fire from there
what if my wife decide she hates
computers becomes Amish and then runs
away then we can simply find another
path by finding the next closest
neighbor and still get to the same file
that we need to so I have a quick demo
here and I'm pre recorded it because I'm
cheating so basically here we have a
list of videos that are public domain so
I don't get sued and so I upload a video
called Syntel and it's just a free movie
you can play with and it's you know I
don't know what I type there but I'm
usually I type faster so it uploads and
I am as you can hardly tell I'm not
really a UI designer so I didn't fit any
acknowledgments in here so i refresh
like a dozen times and that there there
it is and there's my video and the cool
thing is this is fault-tolerant this is
just on the on the cluster so even if my
computer shut off this just belongs to
the world now and I guess it's kind of
scary but also cool so sorry
so the future I would like to have it go
further partition across the notes like
1% of the video just goes everywhere and
so you have a fully stitched together
thing that everyone has to acknowledge I
like to stream directly from the node
because what happens now if I download
all the chunks and put them in memory
and then play them I like to have the
comments and likes and stuff that
YouTube has to give it a full social
social aspect and you know in my geeky
dream and also the guy who follows all
the gimmicks I like to use blockchain to
prove that certain people did work on
transcoding of the video so that way we
could reward them and you know and we
could have you know some awesome Tom Tom
Burke coin and you know be great and
also like it so you could have select
the video to share to certain people so
that other people can't get to it
that's pretty much it if you want to
bother me I'm on github that's my
Twitter I mostly just use it to make fun
of presidents so but if you want you can
tweet at me and that's it
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
