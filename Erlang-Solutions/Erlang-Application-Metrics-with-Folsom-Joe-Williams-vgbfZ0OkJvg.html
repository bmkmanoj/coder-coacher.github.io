fulsome today just out of curiosity
who's useful some already yeah boundary
oh fasho yeah okay cool so so yeah so I
do opposite boundary and and deal with
all the deploys and server provisioning
and all that stuff but also try to write
some Erlang whenever I get the chance
and if you haven't heard what boundary
is they are a sponsor and we do
real-time network monitoring and if
you're using Erlang and in a distributed
fashion this is a totally something you
might want to use so yeah so basically
that you're going to talk about four
main things so what the monitoring
systems look like right now and and what
our application metrics are and then
what how folsom kind of fits into that
and then and then lastly kind of how do
you use folsom so so there are a whole
host of legacy monitoring tools and a
group those together pretty much
anything that uses rrd I consider legacy
at this point because it's a terrible
terrible thing and every every single
one of those has a different
configuration format as it has a
different protocol and if you use any
one you end up getting tied into that
and have to if you want to use a
different one you have to write new
plugins and do all that sort of thing so
so yeah so it's always it written in
flexible and I'll show you some meat and
graphs here in a minute and if you
haven't seen me nor already and you'll
know what I you you will have seen these
graphs before and be disappointed as
always so and then so what I consider
like current monitoring tools are things
like open TSD be in stats d and Ryman
and hopefully these these tools will
kind of bring bring more real-time
aspects into it and and better analysis
of what's actually going on
systems and and and hopefully a lot more
new and interesting features and and
insight into your systems will hopefully
come from that so what our application
metrics and a coda Hale who most of you
probably have heard of before he he in a
talk last year said that code generates
business value when it runs and in the
end you don't know your code is running
unless you're actually monitoring it
right so so it's a an important thing to
think about and then so application
metrics are our code instrumentation so
you write code to measure code you
verify the code behaves as it as you
think it should using those metrics and
in the end you're you're you think about
how your system works and then you
verify it with code and then tests and
then you also can export results of the
instrumentation to your monetary system
your training and and then also get
general stats on vm and so what folsom
provides the Erlang developer is is
application level metrics and lots of
different metric types which i'll go
into and then statistical analysis to
actually get information from all those
stats and then hopefully it's easily
extendable to and has a clean API to to
allow you to do interesting things with
it so before we go any further I'm gonna
start a demo and I think you'll get a
kick out of the demo so so I wrote some
some code to read miok heart rate during
the talk so I'm wearing a heart rate
monitor right now and these stats are
getting pulled from there you go there
you go
so so all these stats are getting this
is a WebSocket in mistltein and it's
pulling stuff off the strap from this
USB stick and all this data is going
into Folsom so so right now and so so
throughout the talk will see i have moon
and running and we'll see what the
graphs look like at the end of talk
probably higher than normal so so so
yeah so i'll show some examples of the
actual data you can get from it near the
end of the talk alright so so there are
a handful of metric types so there's
there's counters gauges histograms
histories meters and then just generic
vm metrics that will all go into so-so
counters are basically what you expect
counters to be which is just a increment
and decrement kind of a thing and in the
API for doing something like this is
really really simple so you can
increment and decrement and create a
counter by a name and then there's
gauges which are like point in time
values this is like be a temperature
value in a data center or something like
that and so to create it it's very very
similar you you create the create the
gauge and and notify it of the new value
and then histograms are a bit more
complex and it's I think probably one of
the things that people will probably end
up using the most of which is basically
you have a long list basically of values
that you shove into it and and you end
up getting hit statistical information
back from it so and then you can also do
use them sort of like as a timer as an
example here so basically you can give
it a mfa and it'll time how long that
function takes in execution and then
return that value back into Folsom and
you can do the same thing if you want to
wrap your functions in and notify
they're so histories which is something
that I haven't seen many other folks
actually do which is basically a some
sort of basically a error log
essentially but hopefully not your only
air lug so you're showing this stuff out
into syslog or something else but at the
same time you can stick strings of error
messages or whatever and to folsom and
be able to get like the last x number of
error messages and so you do something
like that so as you can see the the the
API is pretty clean and basically the
same same API for notifying any sort of
metric that you have set up there are
there a whole host of other ways to
actually do this there's a ways to
create on notify so let's say you you
don't want have to create all your
metrics up front you can actually supply
more information to the two to a
different function that will create it
anytime that code is hit which is which
is helpful in certain situations so and
then there's also meters and so this is
basically kind of your your similar to
load average which everyone is familiar
with and same sort of same sort of API
so super simple and then general
statistics of the vm and i'll show an
example of of this but here's a bunch of
stuff and I've worked really hard to
actually get lots and lots of stats out
of the vm there's lots of stats in there
they're not in the most easily parsable
kind of you know format so and there's
lots of lots and lots of corner cases so
so yeah so I've tried to do at least a
reasonable job of getting lots of the
stats up some of these you don't want to
run on production systems so be careful
with these because like if you want to
list out every single process and you
have a million processes you're going to
start hurting things I think so so yeah
and I'll show some examples of this too
so so what's the statistics so so this
is mostly about the histogram
specifically but basically there's lots
of statistics that I actually pull and
calculate inside of Folsom and it's all
in one module so if you're curious with
all that stuff works I even have our
examples commented out in there so you
can see how it compares and there's even
so if you have two histograms you can
even get the covariance and correlation
between between two histograms so you
can find out all sorts of interesting
things hopefully so and then there's
also sampling stuff so there's three
different sampling types and folsom for
histograms so exponentially decaying and
uniform and then just absolutely nothing
just basically just a list all right and
so then extensibility of it so so as you
saw hopefully I think that's a pretty
clean API and the then there's there's
wrapper so the idea is you tap into that
API to produce some sort of other
formatted thing and the the only one I
know of at the moment is is the one I
wrote for web machine which basically
gives you a rest endpoint for for any of
the functions in folsom and as a result
i wrote mean and plug-ins for it so if
you're using meanin you can you can tap
right into those and pull information
and start graphing things and then
hopefully I hope there's a another some
folks have talked about SNMP and talked
about collecti and some other stuff so
if anyone wants to work on with those
I'm more than happy to help so and then
as far as like future work with Folsom
is I want to come up with some sort of
metrics rest and Jason spec so that way
if you write a single plug-in firm
Yunnan that plug-in will work across a
handful of different metrics libraries
and I've talked to koda and he's on
board if if we come up with something
that's reasonable so so at least I'd be
early
java both have would have a similar spec
44 the rest api so that would be I think
a huge advantage and then also
performance improvement so Folsom has
had a whole host of improvements along
the way anything from from actual you
know math calculation improvements in
the statistical library or even
basically getting being completely bound
by Jenny vent and half need to actually
gut it and talk directly to X that's for
all the metrics storage so there's a
whole host of things that have gone into
it but they're still I think some pretty
low hanging fruit that it can still
happen just a matter of you know working
through it and finding all that and also
better querying of like in slicing of
different metrics types especially
histograms like getting getting things
like I want to see them last you know
five minutes or metrics I don't want the
whole sample that sort of stuff i think
is pretty interesting and pretty neat
and and something that I definitely want
to add into pulls them at some point and
then more metric types I know the guys
at Opscode have a meter reader type that
they've they've built into Folsom as
well so there are a few others that
hopefully we can get added in as well
and then there's a whole host of of
similar tools as well so there's a kotas
JVM metrics there's Ruby there's some
stuff at a Twitter called ostrich and
and their offshoots as well so so if we
have all of these hopefully we can come
up with a rest spec that will will end
up making it much simpler to get these
this data out and use the same plugins
for all these different libraries so
okay so now we're back at demo and so
I'll go through and kind of show you
what what things look like in inside
pulls them so so yeah so here's my heart
rate luckily it's gone down since then
so so so yeah so we're looking a little
better now at least so so yeah this is a
just a mistltein WebSocket that's
pulling stuff off of a off of a
a seaport and that's talking to the the
serial pork that's this USB interface
and just grabs data from from the air
and so so basically the easiest way to
do this is so here's a list of metrics
that folsom is providing so this is the
web machine rapper from Folsom and so if
you just hit underscore metrics then you
get a list of of metrics that are in
here and so we'll look at histogram
first it's probably the most interesting
so here's a whole bunch of stuff right
so so we have the men the max all sorts
of different means because depending on
your sample and what it looks like
actually you may want different
different types of means and and then
median variants standard deviation so
skewness and kurtosis are two things I
wanted to have in here so you could have
actually get the shape of the
distribution and that sort of thing
percentiles and then also something i
recently added is is histogram bucketing
but it's a it's actually dynamic now so
it'll actually look at the sample and
try to choose a reasonable bucket width
and count so this will actually change
over time so as things update and you
refresh this may or may not update so
but yeah so this is actually actually
come up with hopefully reasonable bucket
sizes and stuff that code is a little
finicky but it's it seems pretty solid
at this point so something some of it is
that it's actually something you
wouldn't think would be too hard but it
it's pretty hard something simple that's
actually really hard so all right so so
let's look at a counter real quick this
will not be very exciting but so there
you go so that's how many times it's how
many times we've had a sample of my
heart race since I started this out in
the lobby so so yeah so
so yes that's a counter and and then a
meter which might be a little more
interesting so this is so you could
think of this as my my load average
during the talk so so there's my one
minute five minute and 15 minute load
average and then we also have
acceleration so so we know which
direction the load is going in which is
helpful in definitely in certain
situations so as a result you have all
this information and this doesn't do you
a whole lot of good if you don't have a
way of actually visualizing it and one
kind of poor way to do it is to use
something like mutant and so so here's
an example of the histogram you can see
that I started it over here on the right
and if I left this running it would
obviously scroll across and then you
have all the data here and obviously I
didn't have time to to actually make it
more and more pretty graph but yeah so
that's the main idea and then so yeah
it'll be it'll be fun so so yeah here's
a meter and here's a graph of a meter
this is when I was testing the other day
and then that's the the today's today's
load average and in addition to this
there's also mean and plug-ins for
actual Erlang stats so so you can see
here we have the the different types of
early memory of being used and then
graphs for those and then so here's our
the Erlang statistics which is basically
different information about run queue
and context switches and stuff like that
inside the vm and then and then also the
system variables which is like basically
logical processors and just like kind of
more static stuff but is it can totally
be helpful so and then as far as some of
the other stuff let's take a look
so since I got my ripple here well I'll
show you some examples of some of the
other things so
this might be a really crappy thing for
a small for a low resolution thing but
oops that's not wrong
yeah metrics
so so here's an example of like
information about every single process
is currently running the vm and if you
like i said if you have like a million
messages or a million processes is
probably not something you want to run
but you can get all sorts of interesting
information out of the vm and so and so
yeah so this is like some of the
interesting things you actually want
might want to know is is like how many
messages are in the queue for specific
process this is helpful and lots of
other things so let's see it's another
one so basically this puts this
basically takes that information and
sticks it into a propolis so you can
actually key on the process ID and like
and so it's basically easier for you
know if you had a library that one to
collect this information it'd be easier
to deal with then because like in each
of the different vm stats i try to make
it make it far easier to parse this
stuff because you can look at the code
in folsom it's pretty gnarly to actually
get this stuff out and get into a
reasonable format because there it's
it's kind of crazy i can show you the
code if you're curious i'm more than
happy to and so let's see like port info
so there you go so you can see what's
interesting about this one actually is
like the actual TCP socket information
will be in here as well so you can see
stuff like this which is awesome right
like I want to know how much you know
how many in packets I've received and
sent on a port that's pretty excellent
so this is all in the vm it's just kind
of hard to get to so and i think that
hopefully Folsom's made it a bit easier
to get this sort of stuff and hopefully
bring some some light to some parts of
the vm that people haven't seen yet so
you can get some pretty interesting
things so let's see so yeah i'll show
some code sure
so see it's be easy
so just as an example so here's the my
vm so let's see so just to deal with the
code for the the statistics function
call this is the kind of stuff that you
have to do just to get things into a
reasonable format that you know is
actually J sonable in the end so here's
here's the 14 here's a blip big block
for for system info to kind of convert
things and so it's convert stuff for CPU
topology for get port info there's lots
of stuff that wraps up the different
like primitive inet stuff to get actual
info from the sockets and that sort of
thing in here so so yeah so like if
you're curious about like what all sorts
of information that the vm actually
produces you can go in here and kind of
check it all out also what I find it is
which is nice I think in about folsom is
is that the two library are two modules
there's only two modules that contain
all the statistics functions so if you
want to write a statistic function don't
write it like come in here and if
there's a problem with it fix it and
then just steal my modules and
contribute about 20 changes because like
we there's a isn't much better to have a
maybe a canonical example of how to do
all this stuff so yeah there's all sorts
of statistical functions in here so if
you ever need a cystica function in the
air actual app code then maybe you can
use this
like possibly yeah I mean it's a
reasonable thing to do probably so I
actually stole some of this from from
scu toe which is uh which is a library
that I think it kind of like jungle
where it just dumped a bunch of modules
into the same thing and tart it up and
cold as a library and so so yes some of
that stuff is stolen from there and then
fixes have been contributed and that
sort of thing so yeah so yeah I might
maybe I'll do it Erlang statistics
library or something like that and just
just break this out into its own thing
because I think that might make a lot of
sense so there's a bunch of stuff in
here so but to actually add I'll
actually show the code to add stuff to
to your to your app so see here
let's see my own right branch yeah okay
all right so so just to to show you how
to add a metric is so so here's mine it
function and I have it creating three
different metrics so those are the three
we we saw earlier in the Jason and and
so I'm creating these and then once
they're created in my handle call i'll
have it notify each of these of new
information so so with the with the hist
i am sending it the actual heart rate
monitor data so that's the the actual
heart rate and then which is right here
and then and then for the meter i'm
doing the same thing and then for the
counter of how many times we've actually
had a sample or something like that I'm
just incrementing this counter right
here so so yeah it's pretty pretty easy
alright so yeah that's pretty much
folsom and its entirety almost so yeah
guys you have any questions
no sir yeah don't we don't plot those
it's mostly something you want to use an
illness and debugging sometimes just so
you can find out what what what things
are going on in the system we plot the
so the ones that we plot are the are the
so the system the statistics and the
memory and those are three function
calls actually in the Erlang vm that you
can call to get the same sort of
information just folsom makes it easier
to consume so but the other ones so like
the ports and in in the process info
don't those usually you don't want to
run on a frequent basis because because
you're just going to get a ton of
stuff and it's not going to be a whole
lot of help so but in debugging is
totally helpful so yeah it's it's pretty
light since I took out a Jinni vent so
for a while there Jenny event became a
real bottleneck and so you'd end up in
this normal Erlang situation where you
have a huge queue waiting on a single
process and so getting rid of gene event
and talking directly to ettes it's been
pretty low since then
possibly talk to the dudes at Opscode
because I know they did a bunch of
testing and one so the guy that's giving
the talk I think maybe today or tomorrow
about switching from Ruby and CouchDB to
Erlang and my sequel Seth he did a bunch
of load testing on folsom and so he'd be
able to better tell you know so whenever
you set up to the default sample size
for like a histogram is is like five
thousand events so so there's caps to
everything so and I think they're pretty
sensible defaults so as long as a you
know you're bounded by by memory on the
machine and and you know founded by the
the number of events that you set when
it recreate up create a new a new
counter a new histogram or something
like that counters and stuff obviously
won't take up much space but but
histograms and histories might so not
the moment is just right now it's just
like everything because it's going to
call a few different function calls to
to get those all that information and
combine it all together and so so and
the the I know at least one of them even
in the neural any documentation says
don't run this so so yeah but in
debugging situation is totally helpful
but the maybe maybe a reasonable idea
would be to be able to give it a process
ID and be able to get the same
information for that specific process
but but yeah well we can see it's just a
matter of again small matter of code so
so yeah so yeah as you see the graphs
are updating so that's cool so so let's
see so so they're getting a little wider
now so you can start to see some some of
the lines actually in the graphs so so
there you go see ya any other questions
most window size oh yeah all samples so
like meters and histograms are all are
all adjustable on creation so they're
not updateable later but on creation
they should I think I'm yeah I know
histograms for four hundred percent I
think meters to time stands for what not
at the moment so except for history's so
histories are sorted on epic time and
and so so if you stuff something into a
a into a history at a single point in
time you'll be able to get that back out
and it's a little to be sorted on on the
timestamp to Garmin so this is the
garmin thing and then this is the garmin
USB stick and so yeah they uses this
protocol called ANT+ which is like a
standard protocol for dealing with
low-power athletic data that's pretty
much the only place is used so yeah so
this uses a seaport talk to the thing
and the code is the C code is terrible I
found it on some forum because I didn't
want to write it myself and and so yeah
so but it does work I had to change it
so the C code so that our line would
actually understand it so but I started
writing a serial reader writer library
for her laying because there's not a
good one so so I'll probably convert it
to that because the the C code is
actually GPL so that's not really all
that conducive to actually doing
something with it so so yeah so that's
all I got so thanks guys
