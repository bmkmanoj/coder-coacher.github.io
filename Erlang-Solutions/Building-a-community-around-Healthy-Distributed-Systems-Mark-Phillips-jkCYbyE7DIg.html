if this falls I'm in trouble yeah so my
name is Mark Phillips I work for company
called bachelor technologies and I'm
here to talk about building healthy
distributed systems I'm particularly
passionate about a bunch of distributed
systems not all of them are made up
computers and I am actually pretty
thrilled to get the chance to talk to
everybody here about them today so a bit
about me again mark phillips my name you
can find me on twitter as FARC m'lip i
blog every now and then at the farm
sunni the mark phillips calm and then
market basho calm is my email address
feel free to email me hearing the back
yeah cool okay so what I want to do is
talk about three distinct distributed
systems one made up of computers one
made up of or actually two made up of
people and the two made up of people do
it's distinctly different things but I
wanted to set things up here with a
definition of distributed systems that I
hope we can all kind of agree on and
this is from Wikipedia I'll read it for
effect a distributed system consists of
multiple atomos computers that
communicate through a computer network
the computers interact with each other
in order to achieve a common goal can
anyone can we all agree that this is
kind of what a distributed system is
yeah okay cool because if you don't I'm
screwed
so a few properties of distribute
systems obviously they're distributed so
there's no central coordinator they are
very easy to set up their scalable so
you want things that are horizontally
scalable you want to add commodity
hardware to get more throughput
processing storage you know disk i/o
memory all that good stuff and then
their fault tolerant so they're always
available there's no single point of
failure and their self-healing we we
build systems at bash oh that do this
but we at bachelor also this and we
build communities at bachelor that
actually do this as well so I want to
start with with bash o accompany and
this is our lovely logo who John Newman
has built wonderfully on and taken down
the road ease or lead designers back
there so a bit about bash Oh raise your
hands have you heard of us cool so we
were found in 2007 at that point we were
a sales application company so we
actually made a software-as-a-service
SAS is the fancy acronym that help
salespeople prospect it was a wonderful
product it worked really well but
towards in 2008 the economy got pretty
bad as most of you I'm sure know and we
couldn't raise any funding we had a few
customers but nobody want to give us
money for it so we collapsed and 2008 so
then we pivoted I hate the word pivoted
it's pretty annoying but a 2009 we spun
things back up raised some angel funding
and we were about 10 people at that
point primarily engineers and one of one
of our VCS or prospective VC came in and
says listen you guys have a wonderful
product it works really well I'm sure
people will use it for sales but what's
really powerful here is the database
underneath it and CTO Justin she he had
rather dynamo paper and gotten all
excited and if you haven't read that I
highly recommend you read it and so what
we did was we decided to start selling
rioc right around the end of the middle
of 2009 so we open sourced it in August
we started selling it before that and
the first large customer
close was comcast actually a babaev
leader who had to just leave he was our
first first customer at mochi media and
those are fun times with your first
database customer so now bachelor is the
comedy that sponsors react the open
source no sequel database I'm going to
talk about that in a bit and we sell
closed source extensions to react in the
form of licenses so when you buy react
you're getting the obviously the open
source plus the end lines of code that
comprised the eds version and some
fantastic support by some of the guys in
the back here actually so year on your
growth we grew pretty fast then in 2009
we're selling react we had 14 people I
merrily engineering a few sales and
marketing and a few executives so things
picked up one pretty well 2010 we were
25 people we had some funding in her
pocket i think we raised one or two
rounds at that point we were selling
stuff might have had 15 or 20 customers
we had a kind of cohesive product
roadmap coming together things were
looking pretty good and in 2011 was a
huge year for us react hit one dotto we
grew the company in a ton of ways and we
were sitting at 60 people at the end of
2011 so a pretty huge amount of growth
there and we have three offices we have
one in San Francisco guys like that
little bounce down the arrow we have one
in Reston Virginia and then we have one
in Cambridge Mass with the last one here
being our our initial office but the
cool thing is that we are spread
everywhere and I apologize for members
of bachelor who see this talk there's a
few other people located in the middle
here orden have time to put on the map
but the key is at this point we're about
70 people and we're distributed over two
or three continents we have people who
are I mean bachelor never shuts down
we're always online in some way shape or
form we're about to open an office in
London and we will have some type of
stake in the ground in the form of
property and in Japan at some point
because we have customers and we have
users over there and so if we take a
look at this distributed systems
definition we can kind of adapt this to
destroy
any company so distribute company
consists of multiple autonomous team
members they communicating collaborate
through various channels the team
members interact with each other to
achieve a common goal so keeping with
this we need a common goal that you know
brings brings basher together a bit
about hiring when you hire where the
talent is which is what we've done we
hire brilliant engineers guys like Dave
Smith and Andrew Thompson and Joseph
homestead and an awesome sales
executives and fantastic marketing
people but they don't necessarily always
live in the same town and they don't
want to move their entire families or
you know their whole support network
across the country just to take a job
with the company they think they will
like so we decided early on and in a lot
of you are in the same boat as bachelors
you you are either Erling developers or
your company is composed primarily of
people who are writing Erlang and we all
know that at this point you know there's
maybe 50 java devs for every every one
person who could write Erlang
professionally so you're kind of forced
to hire where the talent is and so we
made the decision to do that but that
that puts huge strains on culture
because when you're not in the same
office with people you know sitting next
to the person who just broke the build
it's a lot harder to communicate with
them you know when you can't just go
down the hall and talk to your HR
representative about something that's
really really matters to you and how you
feel about the company you have to work
hard to keep that stuff intact and so
these are common goals at betcha we want
to we want to make fasho into a massive
powerhouse people who work for us want
to turn the company into I scared to say
Oracle we don't want to be Oracle we
want to be as big as Oracle but we
definitely don't want to be Oracle
professional development we want people
who work with us to come and learn
things every day you know we we entirely
expect that everyone who works for the
company will at some point in the future
hopefully not too soon leave to start
their own thing or leave to be part of
something that that was only possible
because of what they learned at bechtle
we also want people to be happy I
couldn't you know show up to work every
day and hate my job I don't want to do
that we don't want people to come to the
office and you know fire up
they're their computer and look at the
terminal and just throw coffee at the
wall because they hate what they're
doing and then we want we want to
deliver an exceptional product it's
entirely possible to you know distribute
something that sucks and people will buy
it you know this can happen with with
databases it can happen with consumer
technology we don't want to do that we
want to make something that works that
works well that people are excited to
run in production and so these are the
common goals for bass show so how do we
do this we have a lot of stuff that we
use for internal communication and
collaboration so real-time chat this is
absolutely huge we use something called
jabber and then the support team uses
campfire for internal support stuff and
also for dealing with customer issues
everybody hangs out in Jabbar all day
long it's kind of just this running a
femoral stream of messages maybe you pay
attention maybe you don't but you kind
of feel like you're part of the you know
the conversation happening turtling and
we log the whole thing and you can go
back and share the lot it's actually one
of our guys Brian Fink ran a pretty
interesting analysis the other day of
who was how do I put this delicately
using the most four-letter words in chat
turned out it was a guy named Ryan
senesky who's not here but would
appreciate that so skype we skype
constantly uh you know even if you have
nothing to do if you're waiting for
something to compile or if you're really
frustrated with a benchmarking run or if
you can't figure out why you know you
can't access something jump on skype
talk to somebody face-to-face do a video
chat with you know the head of sales
with the head of marketing if they're
not out closing a deal or something like
that it's huge it's it kind of brings
the the office closer together even
though you're thousands of miles apart
Yammer anybody use Yammer I know most of
you guys backed I do anybody oj awesome
it's essential we added about six months
back I was kind of skeptical on where it
would fit it's an enterprise social
network they call it and it's every bit
as valuable as you can imagine it would
be highly recommend you check that out
github bachelors an open-source company
and even for the close to our stuff we
use github and we you know it's helped
us collaborate as a company and it's
something that I believe we
we couldn't do that at this point agile
zen although this might not be true as
of right now although we have some stuff
in a gel zen we use Kanban system for
prioritizing work on react internally
and that's been super valuable email is
annoying but we use it and then
documentation we document as much things
as we can as we possibly can everything
from you know internal jokes and I think
I touch on this a bit later to two
processes for rebuilding machines etc
etc all these things contribute to us
being able to communicate as a company
that doesn't work anywhere near each
other and so I want to highlight
something really quickly Yammer I just
mentioned a second ago is something
super valuable to us so this is our if
you guys can see this this is tony falco
who's our CEO he posed a challenge on
Yammer the other day this is last week
he actually said people should post
pictures of themselves as a child to be
funny to see and so you know we had I
think 30 people respond to this and a
few examples here so this is Reid Draper
he's our he's a senior engineer on her
team and I think he's maybe 25 or 26
years old and this is Reid Draper in
high school which is what he posted this
is Annie gross who's our chief
architects and you might not be able to
see this but over here on the right we
have like a 13 year old Andy gross at a
punk concert and so this was posted
internally you know it doesn't seem like
a lot but it goes a super super long way
you know maybe if there's a product
launch or struggling to get out the door
and everybody is at odds and you can't
really walk down the hall and and and
talk to them you'll think back on when
or is it when Reid reassured the picture
of himself with a fro and you know it'll
make things a lot easier to deal with so
don't be scared to be corny good
meetings meetings can be really
destructive we try to limit them we've
had a lot of different meanings come in
and out of our schedule and I think
we've got in a pretty good spot we do
quarterly in person summits we can still
do this now the company is about 75
people at this point and where's the
next one I think is going to be May
first in Cambridge these are immensely
valuable anytime you can you need to be
you know working with your co-workers
next to them just kind of interacting
with every team sales talk
marketing engineering talking to HR it's
super valuable we do bimonthly not
mandatory company All Hands that's just
a big way of saying we open up a phone
line twice a month and our CEO Don
Ripert comes on kind of leads the call
but it's pretty much a big free-for-all
and those are super super helpful and
then we have stand-ups and scrum there's
I think they happen they vary from team
to team support does some engineers do
them there's a few teams under
engineering that use them and they're
short they're like 15 minutes ten
minutes once a week you fire off a few
things that you're working on and you
move on a bit about documentation it's
extremely important to document things
especially when you're talking about
code but in general documentation is
paramount to a team success i would say
inside jokes i mentioned that before
internal talks we do an internal talk
once a week at batch of everybody you
can offer up a talk we have people come
in actually think we have a kiss and are
talking about a week we should be cool
we record them we put them on the
internal wiki you can watch them
whenever you want design documents I can
show you you know 5,000 words I'm the
ways that we thought about implementing
secondary indexes all the way back to
when we started and these are incredibly
important for people learning both about
the company currently but where we also
came from product ideas the stuff we
just released two days ago reacts yes
you know came from Andy gross our chief
engineer kind of fooling around with
react and an s3 product feedback super
important new hire processes the
quickening at a new hire up to speed on
what you're doing obviously the faster
they're going to contribute to your team
that only gets harder when you're not
working right next to them so
documenting everything around a process
for new hires is crazy very very useful
and then everything else so you know put
up a github repo make it private use
their wiki stuff and then just everybody
go to town on open source your code and
use github I don't think this crowd has
too much to disagree with on that but it
absolutely contributes directly to
developer happiness bachelor at this
point and hopefully for the foreseeable
future is still a product and
engineering focused company
and I am a firm believer that open
sourcing code and being able to talk
about the code rewriting outside of the
job that you're doing is immensely
valuable it makes your company's product
better obviously was rioc that's very
true because we sell what our open
source code is so when somebody like oj
breaks it and fixes it for us that that
is just fantastic is great marketing
people see your code out there and they
you know maybe they're upset that their
company doesn't let them open source
anything and they want to kind of be
part of what you guys are doing and then
use a permissive license I'm a huge fan
of your Apache License MIT license bsd
we don't have to go into a flame war on
that and then open source almost
everything this is a blog post by tom
preston warner of github i highly
recommend it and then what your company
should have why your company should have
a permissive open-source policy that's
by a guy named Nathan Mars who works for
Twitter both super valuable I recommend
you check them out and then this is an
example of a company who's not
necessarily prioritizing they're open
source stuff but how they they do well
with building a community this is a
project called sensei DB which came out
of LinkedIn and the LinkedIn guys aside
from writing really good software they
do you know they have things like
Voldemort and Kafka and since a TV and a
few other very cool projects they're
very good about open sourcing and
building building communities around
their stuff immediately after its out
and this is a comment here from hacker
news on on the projects I'll read it
here i can't speak for sunset eb itself
but i think that linkedin deserves a lot
of credit for the technology they've
been open sourcing in the last few
months fantastic to see so i don't know
if you're familiar with the dynamics of
hacker news for better for worse you get
a lot of eyes on things that get to the
top of the page 150 points here top
comment i don't know six or seven
thousand people eight thousand people
probably saw this and so now they see
linkedin as a kind of a steward of good
code good open source and this does
ridiculous things for the branding of
the company and as far as i know the
cultural linkedin engineering is
fantastic and so hiring
hiring is tough regardless especially
now when you know engineers are at such
a premium if you hire in a vacuum if you
hire people without letting them be an
experience what it might be like to work
at your company you know your culture
will undoubtedly suffer you know you
need to have sales talking to
engineering you need to have the
marketing department interview people
you need to have as many people as
possible from a team to a certain extent
you know take part in the hiring process
if anybody can pull Dave Smith aside ask
him about his rigorous interview it is
absurd and that I I pity the fool who
has to go through that thing yeah so you
kind of you we've that I think through
all the steps of the interview and you
get really good at kind of technically
they might be qualified but culturally
you kind of get a sense of where they
might be and another thing I have a list
of people you want to hire at all times
like keep a list txt file on your
desktop and and just have it open and
just you know fire name is near from
time to time you never know who you'll
come across and and don't be scared to
you know keep people in the loop about
what your company is working on there's
there's you know ways to essentially
interview them for a very long time
before they actually know that you're
trying to hire them and if you know if
they want to work on stuff before you
even give them a job it's a pretty
powerful thing and then just a bit of a
statement here poor culture rats are
coming from within and lessons this
resiliency a successful company will go
through a lot of ups and downs and the
only way you will make it through the
downs and the up so I guess for that
matter is to have a strong culture that
can deal with it and I'll talk a bit
more about this in a second and then
company fault-tolerant so we talked
about a system being fault tolerant and
being resilient to failures this happens
with companies too so bashi we had a new
CEO Don Ripert
since 2011 and we had massive growth we
you know our revenue I think one up by
four hundred percent we went from 25 to
60 people but that presents new
challenges and our system system is
constantly improving I'd love to tell
you that there's no one who's ever left
fasho and that it's so perfect
culturally and and from a work side of
things that people would be scared to
leave but we you know we aren't perfect
i think two or three people have left
badger at this point and that that hurts
a lot especially when you pride yourself
on being culturally strong so you always
have to be revising your process for
both bring people on and and and keeping
them involved in the culture and so at
the end of 2012 we're going to be a lot
bigger than a hundred people if we go to
plan I can't actually say what this
number is exactly I don't think but it's
like more than 120 in less than 180 so
the point here is that you know all
these things that we do internally to
keep the culture strong and to keep you
no-good very valuable people coming in
the door will let us build to this
number and then hopefully I can give
this talk again next year and show you a
number in 2013 that maybe has another
zero around the end and we'll only be
able to get there if we do this
correctly so that is a quick look at
basho as a distributed system so the
other one is a react community so we
have a few people here from a real
community oj who's in the fourth row
here supply know so I I spend most of my
time with with the rock community my my
I think my official fancy title now is
director of community and developer
evangelism but with that what that means
is what that means is I spend my time
basically trying to build momentum and
visibility around react and the rest of
our open source products so i apologize
i forgot this guy's name but he is one
of our users based in leave the Ukraine
this is oj and his two sons and he is in
australia and then this is ryan says
esky at a party that we had last year in
San Francisco so you know distributed
community
made up of people and so if we go back
to this definition what does attributed
community consists of multiple
autonomous members communicate and
collaborate through various channels and
they interact with each other in order
to achieve a common goal so a quick
quick divergence into why we would why
we build a community for Bachelors kind
of obvious now we're an open source
company companies like Red Hat have
proven that you know you can take a
community and be good to them and give
them good software and build it into
something massive I think they just
crossed a billion in revenue for an
open-source company that's kind of crazy
so why why build it and this is going to
be pretty bachelor specific videos
you'll see how this kind of transfers
over into other companies so grassroots
marketing branding and awareness a few
Chung's of things from twitter here
thinking us for so the guy from a
company called drop what is a company
name I I forgot the name but came in the
office for about 45 minutes sat down
with myself and one of our engineers and
talk to your problem they were having a
production database any money for this
we enjoyed talked in them we got a
little little love on Twitter another
one here react migration finally
completed soon MongoDB will be a thing
of the past keep loves batch oh so I
don't know maybe two or three thousand
people saw that that's super valuable
and this is better marketing than our
marketing department could ever spend
money on especially when you're
developing open source software and
marketing to developers which pasho is
code contributions and bud fig bug fixes
excuse me we have almost 180 names in
our things file as of a few days ago and
I think that's even a bit out of date
and I did a calculation which is really
far off from the actual number but it's
a decent approximation between october
two thousand ten and September 2011 we
actually had about 1600 hours of time
contributed from outside of bash oh and
that's either through bug fixes features
bugs being reported or things like
documentation be it for code or for the
wiki on various things so this is super
valuable and the more time that the
developers using our stuff spend on this
the more time our guys get to spend
writing new core stuff and working with
our customers support this is huge this
is a screenshot of a stack overflow
thing
I don't really like stackoverflow or the
other things that are kind of like
stackoverflow like Korra and the other
Q&amp;amp;A sigh it's only because everybody
thinks that you have to get answered
regardless and they get pissed when you
don't get an answer within like 45
minutes even even if I went and told
this guy to go go to the react mailing
list he'd get upset whatever anyways
guiding by the name of surgeon hedrick
and i apologize i did not pronounce that
correctly but he doesn't work for us but
he spends a lot of time on stackoverflow
answering things that are tagged with
react and again this happens in other
channels to IRC Twitter in person at
bars in San Francisco when production
clusters crash and we're not there but
this helps us to spend more time and
what we're working on and also shows a
community that we have people out there
to support them and they can use our
software without paying for it which is
a huge right absolutely yeah and so then
revenue community absolutely contributes
to our revenue 75% of our new customers
in 2011 came from the open source
community so these are people who had
used us in production came to us and
said I want to pay for the other
features or the support is something
that's very important to us so it's
obviously in our best interest to keep
the community happy but you know we
build a community for the members as
well it's not just self-serving to bash
oh so few the reasons why people would
come and be part of what we're building
they just want working quality code
someone has to build a start-up they
need a database that can scale react
works and so there you go they want
recognition and praise this is a big one
people will write code for projects or
write documentation for wikis so that
they can get their name out there and
they can build I guess you call it
social capital a very important desire
to contribute sometimes people just want
to give back jobs with it like it or not
we try to hire people from the community
whenever possible without fishing the
pond too much that is Joseph blom said
who is here but not in this talk we
hired him about
maybe about a year ago at this point
maybe 10 months he wrote a brilliant
piece of code that's all right on top of
react and I was sitting in the office
with our chief architect in the second
he released it you know we looked it
over and then I said pick up the phone
and call that guy I make him a job offer
that's you know what happens and I've
talked to various other people who said
I learned react just to acquire skills
and and we definitely want people to
learn enough to be able to get a job
writing react somewhere else and that
ties redness skills acquisition people
want to learn something new they want to
be on the cutting edge and stay up so
these are these are all the reasons why
we want people to to come and be part of
our community so a big long list of how
you kind of communicate and collaborate
in the distributed community IRC milling
less Twitter recap which I'll touch on
things like meetups Q&amp;amp;A sets I mentioned
Stack Overflow blogs books conferences
actual meetings github and drinking
which is very important so I mentioned
the recap on a highlight this this is
something that i right typically three
times a week but travel schedules do you
make that kind of hard and it's just a
really simple plain text this is an
embedded link because it came from the
blog post it also does a recap it's you
know bullet points on what's happening
in the community everything from issues
that were opened and closed we try to be
very transparent about what's broken
with the software to news about somebody
speaking to let's see here office how is
happening at bash oh and a QA this is
actually pulled from IRC somebody's
question went unanswered and so I
grabbed it and I answered it so this has
been immensely valuable books something
called the react handbook and I actually
have discount codes to this if anybody
wants it we didn't write this this came
from guy named matthias mayer who
actually one point worked for bosch show
but has since left started something
else and is still using us extensively
and contributing to a few of our our
libraries this is this has been
fantastic for adoption i think this came
out about four or five months ago and he
sold thousands of copies of this and
it's it's been wonderful for us and then
meetups and drinking this is the react
when Dino party you have to meet people
face-to-face it's crazy how valuable
this is spend money buy drinks
give things away it's it's crucial and
then github I mentioned this before this
is just a picture here brian says esky
working with a guy from a company called
clipboard to get some code merge into
our search product and then give things
away so fasho is if you guys saw that
absurd conference booth we have
downstairs you know we'd like to spend
money on things that look good we we
like it a lot t-shirts away a lot of
stickers this is a guy who emailed our
mailing list saying thanks for sending
along a t-shirt and you know it's really
simple it takes two or three bucks worth
of shipping plus ten bucks with the
t-shirt a couple stickers but it goes a
long way and we have you know a
thousand-plus people on our mailing list
and this guy sending along two thousand
people who are using react or who might
be on the fence about it is going to go
a very long way to kind of reinforce how
special the react community is and then
build communities regard this is kind of
an interesting point which i think is
very important a lot of people don't
really think there's any point in
building a community around things that
aren't necessarily your core product so
this is a guy named forgot is actually
it's Charlie Robbins I believe he works
for coming at those no DJ s hosting and
this is one of the libraries he just
took a second to say not really an issue
but want to say stuff like this makes
writing open source software worthwhile
extremely valuable both for the the
brand here of Charlie's company and also
the people contributing to his code so
build communities regardless but things
go wrong right so the reason why you put
in all this effort to make sure this
distributed community functions well is
that when when things go wrong you can
you can recover and things can keep
moving on and things you know progress
nicely so this was an issue we had with
react a very vocal and very valuable
member of our community named Kyle
Kingsbury who goes by a fur emailed in
to say you know somebody reported it on
the list and I was asking what the
resolution was and we I think we waited
a few hours to get back to him and so
pal jumped in he said I was waiting for
bachelor write an official notice about
this but it's been there three days and
I really don't want anybody else to go
through this
and we had a problem I don't I don't
totally remember the nature of the of
the issue but you know we had to be we
had to do some recovering from that we
issued a patch we sent it out we
apologized and you know we learn from
this and I think what we ended up doing
is creating a critical issues mailing
list that would you know people who
don't want the mailing was traffic but
wanted to make sure that they knew about
all the critical issues can subscribe to
that so we're always learning always
getting better so that's a look at the
second type of community here a
distributed community building a chunk
of software and last one I want to look
at is made up of actual computer so
enough of this boring people stuff let's
talk about distributed systems that are
actually made out of metal so react is
obviously a database and then voxer is a
company who uses react we're going to
talk about and then lastly there's are
distributed systems quote can multiple
autonomous computers communicate through
network blah blah blah blah blah and so
a bit about react it's a lot of things a
database its key value stores tributes
fault tolerant scalable dynamo inspired
startups fortune 100 companies use it
three dependents primarily in Erlang
which is why we love coming to these
things so much to pronounce react
although the joke is if you use it in
production you can call whatever you
want and it's not the right fit for
every project or application so that's
that's a bit about react happy to talk
more in depth about it and then you know
it's been deployed thousands of times at
this point and you know we're seeing 10
15 20 new deployments a week he's a few
of our users we have people like AOL
bump comcast box here I'm going to talk
about Mozilla Swiper lead cloud Yammer
vibrant and Meg so huge swath of
companies who are using this is anybody
ever used boxer whew yeah so this is a
boxer up it's it's actually pretty nifty
so you can basically leave voicemails or
talk in real time with people it's like
the next I'll push to talk which which
some of you might remember it's a very
simple
concept very simple technology but it's
extremely useful and you can send photos
you can send text but the main thing is
the voice you know we uh we work with
boxer trying to think started June of
last year so they were on couch to be
that came to us and said you know it
works well now but we think we're gonna
have trouble making the system a bit
bigger can you help us and so we worked
we worked with them to move their system
over to react and and these were their
common goals remember we had the company
goals we have the community goals for
react community and this is the system
golfer boxer serving and receive app
traffic perform queries where needed
don't go down scale out to meet demand
and low consists in response times I'm
sure there's more but you know these are
the ones that are pretty much standard
across any application and so this was
the initial reactor that boxer head but
11 nodes decent sized amount of data i
think it was around a half a terabyte
200p concurrent fair excuse me 20,000 p
concurrent users and then they were
doing about four million daily total
request again this is not a blog running
on one node of my sequel but it's not
facebook but then something interesting
happened they kind of got huge this
happened around november of last year
this is the top one here is a headline
from from TechCrunch this year anybody
know who Soulja Boy is like two people
yeah so soldier boy is he has about
three million Twitter followers he did
when I took this picture he's probably
got closer to four at this point he's a
us-based rapper he's not necessarily
very good but he has a lot of followers
and so he tweeted about voxer three
million people thought and things just
kind of went to town and then there's
actually a few amusing youtube videos
posted at people rapping about voxer
after that and then and then this is a
CNN peace with the the CEO of the
company talking to I think one of the
reporters about what boxer is how it
came to be etc etc and then somebody
told me that they just ran a piece last
week in
like good morning good morning america i
think was doing it and so this this is
last night i took this photo on my
iphone this was boxers position on the
the social networking free apps in the
App Store they've been as high as number
one and actually last week they were
number eight all-time for uh for apps so
they went from this thing here they
jumped through this crazy scale scenario
shot up the social networking charts and
now this is what the closer looks like
and this is probably outdated because
they move so fast bigger than 40 node
cluster that's storing user data it's
they have a 40 no cluster just to serve
the app traffic they have about a
terabyte a day of user data coming into
the system and I think they're somewhere
up around I don't know making this up
100 terabytes so what they're working
with at this point hundreds of thousands
of concurrent users at peak this number
is a lot bigger than 100,000 I can't
actually share the exact number because
their CTO told me I couldn't but it's
really huge and they won so we went from
about 11 to 18 nodes in a month which is
crazy like I wouldn't wish that on
anybody only because it's a ridiculous
amount to do and then at one point they
were adding three nodes a day so they're
taking three physical machines and
adding that to the cluster that they had
every day which is really hard to do and
so it didn't all work lots of things
went wrong they lost a lot of nodes in
production there's a few guys in the
back here he'll tell you exactly how bad
that that was there something that
happened with TCP in cast and this
number two here's a reference to it it
you know was some of that we hadn't seen
before the level of traffic that they
had triggered this thing leveldb is a
local storage back end in react you know
we test these things extensively but
when you're going from 11 to 18 yo's a
lot of times we can't test that and then
lots of other went wrong but the
bottom line is is still running you know
they've had problems the system has
remained online for the most part and
and without planning for that growth and
you know I'll shamelessly plug rioc here
because I work there but without using
react they wouldn't have been able to
make that happen and so here just a
general what about scalability
scalability is the ability of a system
network or process to handle growing
amount of work in a capable manner or
its ability to to be enlarged to
inculcate that growth and so you know
whether it's a community of people being
just building a piece of software or
being part of a company or a system that
that holds up an application like boxer
scalability is incredibly important and
so present system health dictates future
ability to scale right now things
probably look pretty good when boxer had
11 knows where in bash Oh had you know
25 people or when the react community
was only composed of the 50 or the
hundred or the 500 kind of cutting edge
people everything was going well the
infrastructure was in place things were
happening code was making to the code
base pull requests were getting merged
you know people weren't yelling at each
other on the mailing list but without
the kind of framework that that I've
kind of talked about I don't think it
would have been possible and we still
have huge hurdles across so what we do
now will hopefully let us do that next
next phase of growth and scale-up and so
everything is susceptible to downtown if
you know your company or your community
or your distributed system things can
can break in half and your company is in
pushing a product out the door when it
was supposed to you didn't ship on time
or you know the initiative that you put
in place to make sure that the new wiki
was launched in a month take six or
boxers app goes down down time is the
worst possible thing for system and
capacity planner perish this ties into
that whole thing you have to have the
resources in place to bring on 60
employees in a year or two go from 11 to
18 notes or at least choose a database
that'll let you go from 1180 knows or or
platform that'll let you do that
and the final point I want to make here
is that everything is distributed now so
whether your company is located in seven
different places or your community is
working from every part of the world or
or or your application is using 55
thousand computers there's no way
getting around the distributed nature of
these things so you have to plan for
this there's really no way to get around
and and what I wanted to say is that
it's an amazing time to build a
distributed system so you know wherever
you're working or whatever or ever apt
your building don't be scared to kind of
lean into the whole distributed nature
of how things could go because if you're
playing correctly it really makes for an
amazing experience and this is a
ridiculous photo of me made by somebody
on the internet and that's all I got for
you thank you
questions
hmm so the question is how how ring the
scales would grow up the short answer is
I don't really know you know we're going
to learn from what we did before you
know add more documentation will tweak
some processes will change the hiring
process but it's it's an iterative thing
right so as you go from to 60 to 120 you
know you lean on the processes that have
worked and then you you try new stuff
for for you know maybe the specific
version of the Kanban that you're using
doesn't actually help people who are
working in 17 time zones away so what
are the biggest issues we face with
distributed team I personally think it's
hard to celebrate together we launched a
product on Tuesday and like the biggest
concern I had was it you know that we
weren't all in the same office to have a
drink together something like that
that's that's hard Yammer has helped us
a lot with that a lot of times I guess
difficult discussions and by difficult I
mean things where people are angry those
are hard to have in a distributed
fashion so you know we we almost renamed
don't tell anybody this we almost
renamed react like seven or eight months
ago it was going to look a lot like
react but it would have had a few other
characters on it and that was like an
incredibly heated discussion that would
have been so much better to have in a
conference room but was happening over
over Yammer and in kind of real time but
it was over Yammer and everybody was you
know kind of spread out and you know the
fact that fasho I think at that time
we're about 60 could still have a
conversation like the whole company
about renaming the database i think is
pretty powerful but yeah i would say
those are the first two that come to
mind
yes so how do you how do you balance the
open source stuff versus selling
software is what you're saying yeah that
is a tough thing to balance I struggle
with this because you know I come to a
conference like curling factory where I
would never know no Jay had I not you
know worked at fasho or got a mac liya
who I would never have known and so open
source has opened some some fantastic
doors I don't know you just you I guess
you build something that you believe in
and you build a sales culture that isn't
you know high pressure and we're
struggling with this to you you make
sure the the sales team and the people
sign the software understand that your
community is very valuable both to bash
oh but also the people working in your
community derive extreme value out of
the fact that your your software is free
and open source and you have to do a lot
of up for an education on things like
that but it's it's it's a struggle I
mean it's something that is on my mind
every day
uh yeah you it's always a small number
of people who who seem to be vocal about
it we to react reacts es as are as three
thing that we just introduced and I I
toyed with the the messaging on how I
was going to introduce it to the mailing
list there's a component about it that
there was a part there's a part of it
that that we have as functionality in
the open source community right now and
we rewrote as functionality for the paid
product but we left you know the the
component in the open source community
and I was expecting a lot more backlash
and I got actually I got I think two or
three emails that were less than savory
but for the most part it actually went
very well and I think that's kind of a
testament to the type of stuff that
we've put together but you know you
still obviously have to pay attention to
the vocal people because you know they
are in a lot of ways the most valuable
so I wouldn't say there's anything
specific that we looked at we have a lot
of people our vp of client services John
Hornbeck is very passionate about
reading up on new processes and new
technologies that people are using Dave
Smith I don't think Dave Smith sleeps
he's our vp of engineering he just reads
reams upon dreams of things and kind of
funnels that back into the process I
don't think there's anything specific
that we've looked too I I mean it's
distributed companies is still something
very new and open source software is
still something that no one's really
proved can succeed there's a few
anomalies like red hat but I think the
combination of those two make our
situation pretty unique so I mean
hopefully maybe one day you know bash
will write a book and how we did it and
people will look to us so nobody wants
to know why I'm wearing this ridiculous
suit bachelor party tonight call the
bachelor bash which you should all be
signed up for but I told the sales guys
I was going to address them so this is
why I'm wearing the suit also Francesco
pointed out that is the business truck
so we need to look classy cool anything
else awesome
I'm sorry oh yeah yes thank you but how
cool thanks for coming up appreciate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
