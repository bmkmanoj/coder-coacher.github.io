francisco about the event and i will
talk and he wanted to do he would night
when i was talking about the country to
southern forward Bay Area topic I was
trying I'm just trying to submit a round
on the top again the second time out
there Francesco it's just me to serve
that to the say that topic to Europe so
this is this will be the first round and
round up in the new rock bottom the
executive summer is simple it's like a
concealer model number is ready
cryptography so if it's really difficult
to puffing and lots of lots of failure
or failed rounded numbers existing
everywhere by hastings edge so don't try
to invent yours if you if you want to
speak to you sleep in this presentation
just we could just make this a new mind
and this is all dealers definition
ravenous and it's written that it says
that this monster is always over to
90999
and this says I shouldn't have fun there
with her ass liberty is asking and he
said that's the problem with randoms you
can never be sure this is true and check
out today is 2001 very long time ago and
the deadly to deviance truly hall was
discovered 45 years ago and this kind of
topic is repeatedly happening in the
history so if you if you think if you
are doing why not get the real real
careful it's as its essa as vulnerable
as photography and as vulnerable as
every other software so you have to be
young forever careful so it's not about
basic top what does randoms me on
wikipedia it says it means lack of
pattern or predictability on the vent
and it says no other known coherence in
sequence no intelligible pattern or
combination so it's it's about total
news and statistically random processes
still follow a probability distribution
like your old number will be a same
probability that is what it's called up
uniform distribution and in our in a
natural events there's another
distribution called Gaussian
distribution out of talking about it so
what's this pseudo randomness siddha
means if you are if you want to compute
something appear the random number you
can't really do that because on
computers everything is deterministic so
there's nobody runners for the algorithm
no random language so there's a lot of
questions at stack overflow how can i
compute how can you compete random
numbers the correct answers you can't
but in the pseudo randomness means that
pseudo randomness stands for predictive
sequence generator was a fairly long
period like the part 2 power of 1989 37
or even what's wrong this is a very very
very long long disability and this kind
of very long predictive seekers
generator can be used as a pseudo-random
number generator so long as the
beginning point is not know you cannot
you cannot estimate where it begins and
where it ends then that can be used as a
tsunami turn and each our run suhana
suhana prg these seats for determine the
starting point and this is called also
called initializes you better and it's
actually a function first you give a
value and very little f FX and then in
there will be FX plus 1 FX rs-232 port
it's a function of continuously integers
converting into something such a
grounder so then what is real and honest
we land owners will not be coming from
the inside computer or deterministic
both it will be coming in from outside
from the more like physical events oh
this is very unlikely to be predictable
consumer or randomness itself I mean
that I mean it should be coming out of
the world of the computer or computer
network so and if you really think about
the random to random environment you
can't really avoid interference
of exterior environment for example if
you use some kind of Simkin after the
level of light lever external me after
magnetic noise any anything else can be
affected into the camp camp can affect
the output come to run remember now or
one single so if you really have to be
assure you you have to think about all
the external possibility of external
affairs but um if you about the about
measurement of randomness this you can
statistically measure all the only
whether physical random number generator
one you soon generator is truly run
appointment or you can you can hope you
can change the you know if it's a bias
into somewhere something a little bit
plus or minus or whatever level you can
you can you can calibrate into something
more more like a still the most
statistically sound on distribution so
let me talk about the era about the
notion code and trophy the trophy is
unit erogenous it's a it's physically
totally different definition but in the
world of information subway it's uh it's
written to run honest and um this this
is a kind of this is a definition which
I put it here are from a good curve
cryptography is nearing its very well as
we can
read in love with you really want to
tackle into the cryptography engineering
and it's a realm also an e-book and if
let me let me talk let me assume that if
City to that world completely under
number exists it does sell it to get a
profit this is very this is very
straightforward but if but if you try to
do make this kind of thing this one this
thing won't be happening so easily
because um because a real random number
generation environment using a physical
device has a buyer has a bias or has
school or some some kind of an no
uniformity presented and there's another
example if the started to work bit work
takes only for different values like
that maybe I'm first two bits are only
changing randomly and the rest is saying
and and that means that Israel has a
twenty twenty-five percent chance of
occurring would this only reduce index
and incentives are in the world is sort
of it it's going to be two to this one
only has to listen and taught me so the
entropy should be measured by the real
change your values and not by the game
outside is not by the information given
literary and top are you talking about
the Dumas case is absolutely Joe same
signals a number alternate signal all
the time saying of all the time 00 world
digital entropy and means nothing from
the point of view rundles and I'm let me
talk about the source of real high
entropy sources on there's a thing
called thermal noise cymbal noises is
something you cannot get you cannot get
rid of any way if you put a register or
anything and you
you measure the voltage coming out of
that there'll be very slight amount
moves on its going also called important
ones it's it depends on temperature what
probably how the locals apart it's a
physical phenomenon and there's another
there's another let's say so events
called Avalon choice and easie it's a
kind of semiconductor event and I will
talk about it later and there's another
one called optical noise and there is a
device called lava can which uses dizzle
this device called very a fluctuating
lamp oh la la land and you put a lava
lamp into a very dark can and input the
CCDC she gave me as a video cam video
sensor on with that and you saturate it
all saturated so that the most will be
coming out to maximum then to generate
something something just gonna run and
there's another source of most radio
most atmospheric news or um or voices in
may be increasing is a smokestack and
there's a psycho run at war z which is
specialized on the generating somewhat
commercial summit volunteer based
service of the to run number available
through opting visit i suggest you to
visit Brandon go to war z you can learn
a lot of things from that side and there
is actually a messy rolling the dice
Alton experimenting down
and now and taking the photo of these
guys maybe your five cents each have 668
like 655 3113 super fun and that
generates the two random number I don't
know how how can you evaluate the extra
physical bias mechanical bias or
whatever but the this is keyword called
ice-o-matic and I linked it to a YouTube
site of the photograph everyone dies
online and I heard that it generates 1
million chickens per day per day I don't
know how it's useful but they are get
increment it's much better than 0 a
trope is really as maybe 6 6 to the
power of 5 I don't know maybe that's the
40s listen maybe 32 bits of entropy for
establishing and um I introduce those
things and those those things have one
thing in common these are very expensive
expensive means that one sample does not
give you a lot of a probe and very going
to leave it there you think you can only
get one cubed per second or even or even
if you try 10 megabits a second it's
very hard to obtain you have to have a
special hardware and I've heard that um
there's a japanese semiconductor company
trying to use a condom well the quantum
physics on generating around another
similar but even that will not keep you
one bit per second or something so those
things are not to substitute for sue's
random numbers soothe our numbers are
easy to generate it's just a computation
if you use if you make
correctly you can be terrorized or use a
month for nautical generation but these
fiscal number two not on fiscal random
number generators up that's great for
seeding from sonic and the seeding means
that giving the seed to the PR NC Slater
so that the pianos it could be more on
and once it one thing I have to say is
that these things do not necessary
statistically uniform or belching
because these are physically physically
totally randomized the mean value will
not be the center of the cuban whole box
then we going to this way or that way
this way or that way you have to
calibrate so this is he avin cells
generate example ah i presented on the
12 2011 other top three comforts in
there on san francisco and this is the
part of the dialogue um you put press
positive bias from here to the side and
see this see this direction is actually
on the back up but when you pry enough
voltage here this causes a breakdown
breakdown occurs quite frequently maybe
our a climate one minute house or even
more but it's just breaking down
randomly so and the current will be not
so lost so I put the amount of
transistor here to amplify this
amplified on the current and the matric
making is a a sort of switch and
put two circus here so that the this
could be used as a differential circuit
to reduce the environmental bias between
this tip and this tip so I aren't going
on with the deeper into the electronics
here this is this about your funny stuff
hey this stuff in 2009 and this this is
how do you know this is actually a good
seal and this is the decisive and this
gives about mmm some out sounds on 10
kilos per second you cannot expect much
because it's arduino arguing it's not
that fast no I'm now do you dream you
over recent Halloween using system with
cords very fast but this is a curious 8p
I bit poor and there no but anyway you
can make it by yourself and by the real
issue is that whether the output is
truly random truly during the uniform
uniform distribution warrior or Gaussian
distribution you have to measure it's
very very carefully ok so there are lots
of things try in the modern operating
system to get the entropy from the
various events in the computer for
example della there are lots of some
unexpected events like hard disk access
duration or mouse keyboard tiny you have
how you move the mouse or how it acts
keyboard or in select pocket arrival
timing this dissident intentionally
randomized remember in
each net has a photo book cdma CA and is
it supported the whole packet timing of
this and it is supposed to be randomized
and this are another source of um we're
saying so the sort of source of
blindness of woke up virus which is
micro second when you turn out when you
turn off the puter you don't even
measure but it will need to be a
actually 000 UTC or 00 British town or
something you will use that so that
could be a salsa band no but that's one
thing coming which is not running those
events can only happen after when the
system is booted and after as a boot
time there's not a trophy because
nothing happens nothing happens is not
learn of this so you have to be very
very careful depending on me operating
systems own random Marvin wants an
entropy sauce guesswork and there's a
website this website and paper about the
investing in hold stuff I put it in a
very small ladder and but not that you
can ask Andhra to get PDF and you will
be seeing this and then there's already
lots of vulnerabilities have been
discovered even though the shrubs Rwanda
on the wii u's so if you really want to
be sure that your seniors okay to do
with the physical model number you have
to boot up five minute or even 10
minutes before it's being used so that
the a little bit of salsa 11
or a certain and trophy is gathered and
I IE varied in a general phone the
solutions to pop this solve this problem
is to use an external entropy generator
like I presented before or wait for the
enough time to be with enough time to
gather entropy and filling into the Pope
okay so let's talk about gear and this
arm I me I repeated to talk about output
distribution um the one of the simplest
one is the uniform distribution if you
roll the dice if every one two three
four five six are coming in the same
probability of 16 that's uniform
distribution and there's another event
called Gaussian or normal distribution
this is a this is actually representing
the sum of those a uniform in
independent area code uniform number
distribute on distribution vets and this
is pretty quick pretty common in the
natural natural one thing um we're
saying a lot lots of natural events and
this and these two are very common and
almost all the other distributions are
calculated from these statement
artificially was the using the
comparative functions and um about the
prg pseudo aren t i was talking about
it's a fairly long sequence generator so
that the human being could could be
could could could be considering it as a
random random signals so the generation
children's should be very long
especially when sharing the same
organism
multiple processes if you share the
organism and same same algorithm will
see 10 poor the one core can be given
one tenth of the filler so if it's going
to be a 10,000 for 127 if it's going
1,000,000 my babies so um actually this
is not a big problem in a very long long
period of legs a lot of generator but
that you have to make it keep in mind
and so then to avoid overlapping me all
the signals I mean that you don't have
you don't want to see the same sequence
twice and when you when you do is
independent monitoring so you have to
master a scary guarantee that and this
is God's general distribution this is
what happens when you win a lots of
people taking it at exam and then and
the the score will be something like
this this is the mean value and this is
the standard deviation and if you go to
Six Sigma I mean a3c and the whole stuff
Oh penis it's go Sigma and 16 or 60
minutes plus plus minus three singles
and the ninety-nine point nine percent
were being this body and um
very good
alright
this is a uniform distribution I
actually carry using el uniforme means
this is uniform and the lines have this
at 429s here so late each this is the
bar of the possibilities it means five
percent and then I use it to a ten
thousand events so the value is about
500 to 498 486 474 lat sometimes
something I and what is interesting
is that if you make sense ah the rupee
repeating run repeating uniform uniform
a generators to run on numbers it's
gonna be more closer to the normal
distribution like this and the mean
value is about here and I'm sorry i I'm
sorry I will calculate standard
deviation actually but the smaller
developer so this is a tip on if you
they convert the issue I mean it um an
elite analytically conduit the bell
caucus is it's not easy it's uh it's a
kind of a complex mathematics options so
if you want to get the Gaussian
distribution on a random number just try
I use a 12 or maybe six is even ok the
six or 12 you multiple times of uniform
uniform on a number and adding it up and
Amina adding them up and divide it by 12
in this time and then you will get this
kind about any from our Gaussian
distribution this is a passcode
Oh 12 12 hi I actually picked it up
trouble for my wonderful article one
article said if you use a 12 the value
of the hoist a square bearing will be
one that I don't know I don't know my
mind I'm so my my rule 76 but I uses
this info if you use it I'm going to be
a large number let me try larger now
it's gone or it will be for example like
15 it'd be more like on like this
down the more you I thought not model
number it's more closely to the costume
of positive normal distance that killed
and let me explain about recent recent
bugs comment about Landrum uniformity is
very hard to achieve in the real world
um this one application called fifth cat
and the buggy PR and z written in
JavaScript there was a sickness right
here and this is a miscalculation of
rounding number just buy one to just buy
one and they thought these dotted part
were random but if you take a 1 million
or ten millions of random number coming
here this grid we will affect the whole
things and Ruiz the randomness of this
spam so they after they fix about they
changing this and this look like more to
learn about so if you were me if you're
interested in this suggested to read
this article but this kind of
programming here is so fun so gotta be
very very careful and this is the old
example I i presented enough london
factory to some Club eleven it's a very
I was rather astonished about this and
this is the PHP five windows run some
random number see this pattern see this
you see this this is great this is why I
was very very spasm this is this
gunpowder was another actually found in
a PhD wife and
this is a next game XKCD and some people
say sorry for and chosen by the Fed
after all and we're going to be drawn at
risk for once for once but this doesn't
give any entropy this has zero p10
trophy so if you think about the random
think about the entropy first and
remember that thou is very difficult to
do it properly so don't try it in
ventures if you are unsure what you're
doing don't try it so let's talk about
iron bernal TV radicals are OTP stranded
motorists the algorithm is actually
built in 1982 and he hasn't been changed
for many many years and it's already 31
years old and this is this is your one
and about the crystal module I'm not
going to go deep deep into the Crimson
also because it's after all openssl API
so if you trust openssl if you trust
this is this is this is the hardest part
because I recent I'm just going to dip
into that button recent NSA stuff and
other things make these ow established
crystal things sometimes not untrustable
but trust openssl crystallogr will be
doing doing everything fine so go
cheering and passwords and keys always
use recruit emotion please please
because there was a huge bug in this is
this motion which is discovered by Jeff
can't happier talented
roku he discovered a certain pattern on
ssh virtual keys which was not
initialized baited by cryptography
secure PRNG but what's using the random
motion he discovered certain adam could
be repeatable and a tackle and i think
this is the first ever cve on the Earl
lldp generated a very um I should say
it's a wall of shame but but it's barely
better be discovered rather than nothing
you are not being discovered so it's
fixed on Apple 14 b 03 so if you are
using our 40 p 0 2 or 3 free version of
fresno previous version don't you up
updating 2 are 40 beers Jesus yourself
and I by 2 years ago I measure islands
pair of the similar to the PSP span this
is good at least I don't know I don't
know whether it's random or normal but
this is this is a very intuitive way
whether until them to find out whether
this with a pair in front and this is
the source code only this only this
and this has me this has hasn't been
changed assists since out 14 v 0 2 or
even even much much in the earlier
version ah maybe you can track the
source code repository on github or the
history about it it only uses three
numbers in three prime numbers and seed
has screen on the numbers v1 v2 v3 and
they will multiply multiply them and
this remind it is remainder and adding
it and truncated that's it this is
enough distance variable ballast and
because this um I'm saying all things
are there but a smile h13 is a cool name
of the service and this has me this
parent has been known and some
deficiency for example the pier your
legs short that's about footprint per se
for these three bits and 40 students is
not knots wrong it's about how many
Tanner 10-3 runtime career means up 12
cases on the decimal and it's very easy
to count count on this event in modern
days of computing hold a little design
and it's not designed for parallelism
pal no design means you can't choose
many internal state because because the
the number of internal States will not
be larger would never
this number and seed has only three
16-bit integers only three 16-bit
integers this is that sufficient for a
very large scale simulation and this
algorithm is not designed to speed
either because you have to use a
floating division and four main offer
floating addition and now all those a
very hard boss computing and but the 112
thing is experimental and that is very
good so so think about this thick the
next generation or what I say rather
module should be influencing the more
modern way for example does your period
thanks prng should be accessed on for an
alternative and there will be a there
should be a new modern design things and
there will be a power is important
parison means using the same algorithms
massive number of processes of cores or
whatever and it's for computing entities
you can map into the urn offsets or unix
process of water but the number will be
massive and if you try to guarantee know
that gen the Seekers used by the each
process is not over wrapping with each
other I mean it is more difficult what
it says also know you have to use them
automatically puku not risen too so that
even like even those parameters can
ensure they also dirty and their work
there should be a large estate flames
for seeding which which is also which is
virtually the same inning with a lot of
your legs and I'm saying in online pure
code is always better for decision but
forces p mrs. scatter always better
especially for batch computing i'm
bashful getting in so doing it home home
one person Oh computing desiccant
getting something see and controlling
back into love
and doesn't require it suggests features
and parallelism HPR as you haz mat is
its own state and the independent also
comes in vanilla awesome orthogonal
sequences from st. algorithm should be
obtained in the mathematical way what
are things you can do is that's pretty
in the internal state if internal state
has certain certain hundred bit so to
the 600 vs or several bits you can
scrape you can use the first 10 or 20
bits for the process number and the rest
will be assigned a sign of a Division
one disease or if you or you can you can
guarantee that was used to use the
polynomials to use the random
polynomials I'm not going to get into
video because this is math and I'm sorry
i I'm not so good at math so I cannot
explain what's it but the also relative
of mathematical practice with
polynomials party what in certain
reasons twist quite a lot of numbers
polynomials can be obtained so using the
different or some non pronovias is also
important and there's another mass
message called seat jumping she jumping
means hopping millions and trillions of
calculation in very fast I mean skipping
skipping to the over / 13 year old or
even more so that the those in even
using this app reviews the very same
algorithm on by jumping abide by the
givingness chart she's on the each
process you can guarantee at least 1
billion or something like that seekers
will not be shared
these rich process so um there are two
alternatives i implemented oops I
intranet actually fairly safe um I mean
it's SMMT online and tanya mt elgon i
will explain those keywords called sfmta
Antonia and these are balls about with
github and I published the paper
actually to take us on the HTML workshop
and fortunately a nation has a paywall
but I say I I oh I also submitted a
almost similar version on my own website
for free so you can get by you can you
can name one thing I have to say about
this and these two algorithms are not
secure no sakura means that the knot
cliff to our cryptography
cryptographically strength strong or
whatever so these are just PRF is very
wrong she gets right and before talking
about the i-70 otay gnocchi the I'd like
to talk about empty part empty stands
for mersenne twister Nelson is a name of
the very famous mathematician of France
long time
and he's he there's a numbers novel
sequence called Nelson Nelson number
which stands for hours some some number
power of two minus one could is prime
and I think that I don't know how
violently lots of smells a number but
they small larger than this but these
this and the Nelson the personal nurse
and discovered this staff and that's the
only is a lot of mathematical
contribution okay now I'm back to
mention twister is one of the good thing
is that is vse Isis it's not GPM or it's
not even stricter like CPSC taxes so you
can do it whatever you want so long as
you mention well mention people also
also slain in softball and professor
matsumoto and professor is from out
these two people are real mathematicians
and they invented the Mersenne twister
in 1996 and it says very long period 109
is 37 it's almost 20,000 deaths of
number I'm you know integer so this ring
how to count maybe maybe becoming
counting these over there will not be
complete with a 0 or maybe our
civilization were extinct other than
coming this and it's it must not get a
proven that it's uniformly distributed
in 623 demon dimension cube you know qb3
only three guide manager and I cannot
really imagine what 623 that means you
cube it is but they say it's uniform so
it's in four infamous a Tristan
cigarettes 23 citizen Arbor that will be
in a little Terrace anyway this is
listen so this is a very good prng and
this like you use or implemented on many
open-source projects such as our it's a
statistic desert varnish and passing
this morning and used everywhere and
then a new google on keto bond awesome
well MLB is a modified version Ruby it's
an embedded Ruby it has pressing twister
as one of the 50 fault around
anniversary and SF SF empty is a
modified version of guarantee and to the
societal please now actually working on
empty and other stuff and professor Mata
Muto made it together in 2006 and it's
optimized for x86 and exhale ECC's x86
64 or in this important among
interocitor and they also made it for
whatsapp on PC a picture too and there's
a part very few lengths for it from two
powers 607 2206 291 I don't know whether
you are going to use this but these are
they have given test case publicize so
that every implementation can check
check the OD genuineness of you know the
sicknesses and there's another stuff for
the zero excesses of state 0 excess
insurance made music if you put zeros on
all these sweet see are the six hundred
maybe 600 or 700 32 bit worse it's very
hard to coming back to put into 10 I'm
coming
do wrong turns into one it takes a lot
of time but I sip on SF empty this our
recovery timing is getting more shorter
so it's i should say it's more suitable
to be used as a soup random number
generator and this if 51 is very
straightforward implementation FMT in
both purana and with nips and I measured
it in various feel your legs and i tried
i conclude that the dmt standards of
this thanks you see the Masters among
the most half the fastest one in the a
tassel which has least overhead so I
suggest you this though in the source
code there is already I I are putting
the virus appearance of the SF empty and
with nips it's three times faster than
on the motion so if you need a random
module in London number PR NZ was a fast
one on and from being called from now on
you teams this and um one of our friends
aw sis ahana's has chosen a set from the
other as a part of their testing tool
alternate captain random random motion
so yes let us show let me show you a
hard decision 270 code it's
but this Vivian understand what it's all
about but SF empty is all about
recursion recursion the wrist list click
on if this is list it choose volume here
very here for here by here and make the
exclusive or some memory of those deaths
and try to generate the out and this
happen and this this output will be
coming after from here so so it's so
think about this it's a it's kind of um
seekers first thing first first out and
if the old ones going to draw from the
left and the new way is coming from
right and distract assist register so
it's coming less than light in which one
goes out so let me tell you it's a this
is actually source code and it's a huge
amount of tickets but um um I the
original i SAT empty calling see was
totally optimized by the static mutable
with a completely different from the old
style called but i will i restarted the
original paper so that the weather the
Earl owns advantage of the having old
having all the recursion things could be
applied and I did it in a very brother
straightforward manner stifled manners
and I just i'm sorry i don't i don't
remember the whole stuff because it was
two years ago it's really hard to
remember but i put it on
so if you if you are interested in
detail and and there was a potent some
positives of cold from Seto the
reference code of SF empty was in c and
and it was threaded in all in static
variables in C static static means
everything is mutable and immutable
thing cannot be handled by a lone
natively so if you have to remove all
the static is for the internal setting
that's something I'm not sure to reveal
yes to say you have to think you have to
think about no overlap or other things
or some lots of assumptions exactly on
and and I am a torturous before SMS SNT
stuff can be written as an attrition so
if you some if you something can be
written as a real treasure is it would
be easier to implement in pure and this
is another thing I've found in a poem
own version of i-70 that adding eminence
udy has and doing the risk averse made
the quotes fifty percent faster than
using the pen go Brady this is this is a
very trivial Tribune website coding
style in order but for on SF mt this is
this was a very effective and I was very
surprised and I was very glad to see
that this that sometimes functional way
of thinking could be
useful for even this hydrogen stuff and
but the speed difference between see
darling this is this is this is also
kind of trivial thing if you really
write a good code in C it's always
faster than not remember our is movie
alone learn run running on vm that's
especially for a this time computing
computing it then it isn't competing it
doesn't hold and on pure and cold it's
300 times smaller than C on non linear
code it's still 10 times lower than see
so it's certain to speed up the service
anytime speed up so it's a lot of speed
up but there's some dilemma you have to
face speed up to my decisions always
always almost always and always
important but another as long as you're
using your own gear you have to have
some more so it won't be a real
supercomputing code it's after all
running on so let me talk about tiny
empty tiny empty is a more dedicated for
more small memory footprint small means
actually it's 7 32-bit integers so you
can bet you can have a tiny amount of
control and it's also invented by a
professor psychonauts photo interest or
11 in the period period very short to
127 the internal state is about
in some beds but still it's much longer
than forty three beds so this is
practically quite useful and and good
thing about this is that you can get as
more as 22 powers of 56 independence
generation generated per month
polynomials if you compute and this
value is not not come or is it not not
not analytically or football team but
this is entirely obtained by dr once a
four-point on during the polynomial
filing process and to Tiny empty line
although against a much straightforward
and implementation out an emt and there
are a lot of code I actually still steal
from the sfm plr cold because because on
those a lot there's a very similar and
let me show
actually this is it this is go and you
can say this is bad very bad good oh you
know you don't have to use this is
record record the structure hold instead
sorry too and there's a full 32-bit
integer status 0 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 this hat this
doesn't have to be this kind of this
kind of symbolic thing this could be on
there would be an optimization but for
other on another you cannot assume a
word is a word is adjacent to the next
address or something that unless you are
trying LSU you are going to handle a
whole full 32-bit integer into one
Kingdom and getting the shift shift left
system rises in huge big gun would be
very strong so I'd rather implemented in
direct direct implementation are welcome
it implement coating from C into this
code and on tiny empty this next state
function is updating only the internals
internal state I mean internal state
machine and the actual random number
will be coming out from the functional
temper giving the internal internal
state so the internal state is not
directly representing the random numbers
on SF empty internal state is directly
presenting than only other than by
itself again if you are interested in
this coat
on github or my paypal and this kind of
pig day or n doing an exclusive war
or a big calculation is very suitable
for hype high performance on because
from high five for myself these are
going to be all in code compile Indian
casino much so I obtains three times of
speed using height and this hike is not
not necessarily well accepted anonymity
because in emails you've used type
doesn't work well but for this specific
specific case I've work works very well
and the more speed Omega measuring
Volvo cook speed this is the speed is
same as a random module but in when you
use it at prov providing this tell the
operation takes two or six times over
the random motion and i regret to say
this but the I hey I still cannot track
down there too
the bottom end on this and let me show
you the observations on the tanya on
Monty Italian kill uncle two and one
there's a there's a pitfall about 32
veto on sorry to be tolerant sorry to be
32 in the integers are all big notes
because small integer answer to be done
can only have 20 minutes on 64-bit
dollar doing the circuit to these
calculations for each other this will be
no problem but uncertainty we talk this
week use from the cold speed will be so
yummy just be careful now using name foo
foo world nice car pressure and the
bhakti overhead the calling function and
being memory allocation might have taken
a significant portion of years of time I
majored I measured it in various
different ways but I don't I still can't
get the addition is cool about this but
that those evaluations suggested that
the function calls is has a lot of owner
and one of the interesting thing is is
that session tialan bachik institution
is still faster than tiny MTN along
that's execution so there must be a
there might be some way of improving the
average myself and about the element
about the island itself I'd like to
emphasize one thing which is not only
available for the under number or any
kind any if stuff
this is up this is applicable for
anything when you need to try to use
live the principle is that a nice
execution proxy entire landscape
schedule so if if nice taste seven
hundred and ninety seconds the host
creature stops and you know all of the m
would not give the time or display with
the challenge chunk of time into other
any other processes so push it you you
should find out how long can a cpu span
the time you need um the roof son is
that written in our own documentation is
it should be less than 10 sec for
otherwise the schedule and i said i
personally said to target target for smt
otani i'm feelin in modern CPUs 109
seconds all of us so the so if you even
if you use me first this won't be rockin
so much but um as a person as a bachelor
person i like to saying that Honoria
this has been very very serious issue
while hammering database database sniffs
ly ke level TV or other stuff and one of
my colleagues got pretty with whose
knowledge Pam actually he is his dog is
rolling and so he's in japan and he's
working with us and he has openly
publisher opening public sites an md5
calculation example of using news and
how this cetera how the stranger sitting
will affect the all the efficiency so
the thinking about this stuff some
people demand me that this should be
pure our version of every random number
edition hi I link so that the those
people one of those people don't have to
think about this nice schedule perfect
okay and um I I did a very crazy saying
you use it use about two years ago using
a kilt universal supercomputer so-called
supercomputer supercomputer means 500 or
60s you trying to know about selling to
co computers actually and those are
shared and I my advice it only are using
selective course at some sometimes time
but the good thing about this is that
this cluster is maintained by this
technical staff of university and they
are working very very hard for
continuous operation using a huge amount
of erection airtricity dedicated for
this stuff and I could run 32 days of
continuous exaggeration using whole city
to cause and I calculated 256 mega
number of polynomials and I put them
into the github but the github to get up
reverse brain takes 40 or 80 gigabytes
so you shouldn't clone it or otherwise
you're gonna kill the github don't clone
it dr. issue you can hear you maybe the
people who can handle on it but today to
tell the toaster for the northern 64-bit
photo computer or maybe two da house of
GPU clock and AMD 64 or intel 64 bit is
64 I know is Jana 64 architecture um the
copter him speed will be 18 to 19 7 18
to 19 cent percent no it's not that fast
so
don't I don't recommend it you to riddle
generate in this polynomial real time
although in many many seek in many
circumstances you can use you can use
the real-time type of generation there
as the last of the top I over top of a
secure prgs um what's but but but I aus
I like I did I didn't want to involve in
deeply in the security because security
is a very very sensitive topic recently
a government institution in the United
States says that they all cryptograph
you only all existing cryptographic
algorithm can be circumvented by their
reference but that is that it does it I
think that is kind of extreme situation
but though it's very hard to make the
one-way function one-way function means
that you can generate the output from
input very easily but you cannot guess
the input from the output without making
very huge amount of competition and the
secure our PR ends it should be a
one-way function and a PR energy is less
secure when degeneration period showed
up because it's very easily mori here
for getting predictable and and if easy
function exists against an internal
state from the output and sometimes this
will happen if y'all know on the
cryptography cryptographic algorithm if
your dreary there is a certain week keys
like this lengths of zeros lots of zeros
or bottom only only a very few little
ones or something like that that kind of
kids did exist in the tests the state
unconscious encryption standard unknown
prism which is not recommended in
current heard implementation but the
doctor thing surely exist and the normal
chain guaranteed that those of things
will not exist in their current address
upslope gotta be careful about this and
the the other issue about the week
security is empty if the output sequence
is predictable from the past output
signals that be very very bad very good
so I so the reason about this so because
of the sole reason about this son
predictability from the previous seekers
any kind of the simple PRNG it should be
called insecure so don't use them don't
use SF empty or tiny empty for passwords
or anything else you very musically and
for building more secure appearances
reducing predictability is always good
and if you re if you want to generate a
little bit more secure on seconds from
the existing PRNG a prism always try to
incorporate necessary external and Toby
external means out of the computer
system or other drainage system out of
the network or allowed to the
environment or whatever and you should
also have cryptic cryptographic
strengths you spell use work program a
prison for example es tu an encrypted
unsecured and encrypting unsecured PRS
output into secure with the AES will a
trace obtained is truly of the areas or
even less I can say is
it's an even death but it's not it's
much much better than not doing it if
the aes key is gonna be a fight say lana
marie are obtained from the external
Toby that'd be much better and and for
the other the rule of thumb is always
use crypto strong round bites this is
rather new function from think out 15
something it's a very low RS 6 eb to
guarantee sufficient air topi it's
consumed if sufficient and toby is not
consumed by this function this one to
draw will generate an error that the
entropy is not available and let me
explain the tip of parallel execution
here on this and i have been painting
this many times and using completely
different orthogonal independent seekers
like this and this this this and this
doesn't was on the whole point and and
sing about things if the ceiling space
is large you can just put the pr NZ's
output into the other dr atc and the
rest will not will become less very less
likely to conflict with shape with each
other I don't know this is not
mathematically proven but this can be
this discount this can be tried if you
just use a different one to use a
different stuff on a different process
and if you don't need the straight
orthogonality of the audio and photo
simulations or are they on testing
purpose sometimes the exact are output
of the voice the exact behavior of the
whole system is required and if you um
you do if you try to do the parallels
institutional parallel generation
everything on the palliative on you know
on the arm process they all cook a
concurrent things means almost always
Asian please so it won't be like ABC and
D that should be a dxi6800 the always be
there is a kiss you see can change when
reading to do this and I'll secure PNG's
I repeat many times don't invent yours
unless you can hire well experienced
cooked cryptographers those people have
special sense of nice math mathematics
and although several reasons which I
don't have I don't have I I should
emphasize the camera item I can go to
cryptographer when I read one of the 1d
of my my respecting cryptographer cotija
Bernstein who is also interested in
making then mentor cure I don't know how
his brains thinking don't if you if you
are not sure don't do that let the
professionals mixalis and um insurance
system has has enough entropy to
guarantee that Prez Billy this is I
mission Eduardo and external hardware is
always suggested and this external does
not necessary means really extra for
example some little recent CPU has its
own hardware on the knowledge right and
I don't know if it's crippled by NSA but
if it's not crippled by the NSA it would
be trustful and
let me repeat don't let the NSA
cryptographer if you need to these two
things should be open source and openly
evaluated and open it often is openly
implemented and it shouldn't be any
backwards so the center again this is
XKCD about these what abouts consequence
of the house security hole are built but
anyway don't try to invent you're a
person if you are not sure what you're
doing so take some right along time and
time and sense nice to listen and then
any questions
why don't we having over a beer yeah
yeah okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
