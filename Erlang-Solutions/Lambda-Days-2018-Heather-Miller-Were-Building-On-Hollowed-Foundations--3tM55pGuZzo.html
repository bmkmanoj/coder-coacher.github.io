title is because I'm I'm really
concerned about some of these things
that I'm gonna talk about briefly and I
think that you guys should be too I
don't have answers I have some
suggestions about what we could do
differently but you know I'm just one
person I could be wrong I think this is
something that we all have together to
together start thinking more seriously
about so with that I'm first going to
mention that I I am the I guess with
Martin order see the co-founder of the
Scala Center at EPFL
I'm also you know doing hotsy-totsy
professor stuff at Northeastern
University but the Scala Center thing is
kind of where I ended up obtaining some
of these insights from and if you don't
know about the Scala Center it is a
non-for-profit Center that we
established at EPFL which is the
university that Scala kind of came out
of and this this Scala center thing it's
all about somehow better sustaining
Scala's so if there's some sort of
interesting or important library or a
tool that needs to be developed or
maintained if there's some sort of
teaching that needs to be done the Scala
Center sort of aims to sort of fill fill
those gaps and to do those things for
the community and I mean just to give
you a quick rundown of the sorts of
things that we do we are fully
independent from any entity we get
funding from companies but no company
you know dictates to us that we have to
do this or else so you know a major goal
of the scale Center is to independently
guide and support the entire community
the entire Scala community that is and
of course like I said to coordinate
develop libraries and tools that should
be generally useful for the whole
community and of course to do any sort
of different sorts of educational
activities for Scala ideally stuff that
is is of course freely available oh no I
just got hot alright so with that I just
wanted to sort of say like this is where
I come from with this whole argument and
I I've I've got some data points here
some of you have seen some of them
there's
some new ones in here but I like to
start this with with a riddle and the
first is well what does what does a
sidewalk have to do with Scala or open
source or uh or like a you know and
these zebra-striped thingies like these
these walking these crosswalks this is
maybe more more obvious what is a bridge
have to do with open source and the
answer is that these things are all
examples of shared common physical
infrastructure and anybody can pick
these things up well maybe you can't
pick up a ridge but you can use them
there's no reason why you know you
shouldn't be crossing a bridge right and
and the same is true for digital
infrastructure right there are all of
these things that we take for granted
that we use every day that we've come to
just expect as digital infrastructure
that will always be there for us I'm
gonna throw out the talk
I know I've upset like people bye-bye
freely using different different groups
of terminology I'm gonna say floss and
when I say floss I might mean you know I
always mean this this you know
indiscriminate group of things that
refer to either free or Libre and open
source software so the whole category
and so when I say floss that's what I
mean if I sometimes I say open source I
still also mean this so I'd like to
point out that you know floss or open
source you can think of that as our
shared digital infrastructure anybody
can use these things we generally do and
like I said a lot of us don't really
even realize that they're there because
we've just come to expect them and you
know there's it's you know I I come from
the scholar world but there's there's
lots of uh you know lots more examples
right these are just a few and so if we
go back to that whole physical
infrastructure analogy and you have you
know a big hole that opens up in the in
the sidewalk or the the road in front of
your house well this is your digit is
your this is your physical
infrastructure and you know now you
can't get to work because you know the
you'll fall into a bottomless pit in
front of your house so there's got to be
a way to fix this right well in the real
world you what you do is you you know
okay this is like the cool digital way
to do it nowadays some cities have these
like report problem
with something in your city app but you
know you observe hey there's something
wrong here can somebody come and fix it
the local government you know it was
like all right there's a big hole in
front of that guy's house let's fix it
and you know eventually it gets fixed
and then you know we continue on with
life you know you also pay taxes to make
sure that this all gets done and you
know we've kind of come to accept that
this should work but if the same thing
happens to you know whatever important
thing that you've been using for the
last ten years you've got a figurative
giant hole that opens up in your digital
infrastructure there's nothing you can
exactly do about it aside for hope that
somebody's going to issue a patch and
then you can apply it right I mean I
guess you know if you really want to get
into the internals of some very
complicated cryptography cryptographic
thing maybe you can try to fix it
yourself but you know I don't know maybe
that's not your bag maybe you can't
right so there's nothing you can really
do maybe you can open ticket hope
somebody will answer it it's different
right you're not paying taxes to some
government that has the obligation to
fix the hole in front of your house and
like allow you to get out of your house
right so we don't have this this sort of
centralized entity that we can go to to
ask for help when something breaks or
something goes wrong and so on that note
before I get into a bunch of data points
I'm going to give you I'm gonna let you
know that I got a bunch of them out of
this really great report if you haven't
read it you should it's called rodents
roads and bridges it's by nadya eggball
who now works at github she did this as
a four she spent a year doing I think it
was a ford fellowship trying to
understand you know the ways in which
you know as a society we depend on this
sort of digital infrastructure sort of
the problems with it the good things
about it and there's a lot of
information and interviews that she's
kind of you know built up and put into
this report so there's a bunch of I take
you know I will cite it as I go when I
take information from there and if the
information doesn't come from that
report I have links at the bottom of the
slides
I've also uploaded the slide so if you
want any of these references you'll
you'll be able to have them if you done
with the slide deck okay
but on that note okay so so I don't know
if you remember this whole this whole
these days when people were going around
like like salesman selling hey you
should use open-source software instead
of
instead of something proprietary you
know use you know don't use microsoft
word use one of the you know the
libreoffice choices right don't do don't
use proprietary things when you build
new new software stacks that was
actually so III argue that that was
before because now actually everybody is
jumping on to this whole flossed
bandwagon and and I hope that you know
by the time I get through this talk
you're going to be convinced that we
actually don't need to concur egde
people to use open source software in
fact people actually just use it a lot
and instead we have a different problem
and that is how do we make open source
more sustainable or how do we set in
some way encourage people to give back
to that open source software that
they're using so there's this company
called black duck that runs has for the
last I think 11 years synced up to it
year 11 now they've run these surveys
about the sort of health and sort of you
know spread an impact of open source and
and it's it's you know they they they
have quite a far far reach so in 2016
they interviewed 1300 different
companies and in 2015 that what that
number was 1200 and in these in these I
mean they asked different sets of
questions each each year it's not the
same questions but what they found was
that in 2015 they they they found that
of those 1200 companies that they had
went out and said hey you know tell us
about the open source software that you
use 78% of those companies say that they
run on open source software and this is
actually up more than Claire well it's
up two times since 2010 and 2010 that
number was only 35% when they asked the
same question so here you have in five
years now basically 80% of people are
using open source software five years
earlier only but 30% 35% were so you
know the the trend is that more and more
companies are depending on on open
source software and you know it's
perhaps something that if you're just
you're not contributing to open source
software you can't see this happening
necessarily also in this survey they had
reasons they asked these they asked the
the respondents of the survey hey why
are you actually using why did you
decide to go with open source software
rather than some sort of proprietary
solution and the reasons that that sort
of the top ranked reasons were actually
quality the quality of solutions I
thought that it would actually be the
number three reason here which is the
ability to customize and fix a piece of
software if there's something that's not
correct you can fix a bug or you can add
a feature and maybe they'll accept it up
main upstream or at least you can
maintain a fork whatever I thought
number three would be the most important
thing but it turns out that essentially
all of these companies that were
surveyed it's like 80% of them said that
the the open source solution was of
higher quality than either the
proprietary or a solution that they come
up with in-house which was a big
surprise to me and then sort of in step
with that is sort of the fact that
features were competitive and then you
know maybe you know things were faster
things were able to be benchmarked so
it's kind of in line with the quality of
solutions point and also something
that's uh that's super surprising to me
in 2015 they also asked well alright if
you're gonna have to decide you know on
a piece of software to use in your stack
what would you go for would you go for
something that's proprietary or would
you go for something that's open-source
and 66% of these companies in 2015
answered hey we're not even looking at
opens we're not even looking at
proprietary software we just reach for
something in the open-source realm first
so at this point a majority of people
aren't even considering proprietary
solutions which is you know a massive
shift it's a massive change I think at
this point you can say that open sources
has basically won in the 2017 survey
this is the last data point from these
surveys I'm going to show you 60% of the
companies that they had surveyed said
that they used more open source software
this year than last year they've added
more things to their stack so that's
also kind of horrifying it's not even
that more companies are doing it the
companies that we're doing it are doing
it more right
and you know this this year the main
reason that they said that the you know
that open source was better was because
it was low-cost it was free right at
least they don't have to pay for it
somebody else does somehow alright and
there's no vendor lock-in so that's also
good so you know these were some of the
the insights that you can you can kind
of call out of this survey other data
points so there's a an entrepreneur
named Mark Suster
who was a part of you know you know a
software companies in the 90s and back
then when he built his first company he
said it cost him two point five million
dollars just in sort of proprietary
infrastructure to get started to build
his product on top of and then another
two point five million dollars in team
costs you know that the people cost to
build the thing on top of the
proprietary infrastructure and then to
manage market sell everything and
suddenly you know you have this open
source option and infrastructure was now
free essentially free instead of paying
for the actual software you pay ten
percent of the price for maybe a support
contractor for some contracting help
something like this so suddenly you know
his argument is that you here you have a
90 percent disruption in the cost Sutton
you know and surely you know you're
gonna have business going in that
direction if you've got such a big price
motivator to go away from these
proprietary things right another another
Co another founder of a well known
startup mark Creager he is the
co-founder of of Instagram and he wrote
a blog article about you know sort of
you know giving advice to other other
founders of a tech of tech startups and
the advice is you know very very
strongly borrow instead of building new
things just if you can find something
that will do what you need it to do use
that before you build something in-house
he says there are hundreds of fantastic
open-source projects that have been
built through the hard experience of
creating and scaling companies
especially around infrastructure and
monitoring that can save you time and
let you focus on actually building out
your product I guess that's true right I
don't think anybody's been to disagree
with that
so Nadia wrote a blog article after
sometime after after the acquisition of
Instagram and I'm not going to like
defend the calculations in this article
all I'm going to say is this going to
restate her her conclusion and you know
Nadia argues that based on the the open
source software that they include in the
Instagram app itself that you could
attest 1.41 I'm sorry 143 million
dollars of instagrams 1 billion dollar
acquisition on on software that they
didn't write I mean if that's the
percentage of the software that's inside
of this this app that then you know gets
acquired right so this is her argument
whether it's true I don't know but
that's that's a lot of value that you
just get you know on github for free so
you have all of these people you know
famous famous VC's famous cofounders of
startups etc giving general advice to
the whole universe saying hey don't
build anything if you don't have to
reuse things that already exist they're
already out there for free for you to
use just jump on it and then build your
company on top of that right and then
you know I've got all these aggregate
statistics about how industry is
actually doing that doesn't have to be
startups it's I could show you some of
the like sort of the breakdowns of the
different industries that these
companies are coming from where they're
using open-source it's literally
everything education government 100% of
industries that we interact with as
humans they're building on open-source
software right but at the same time it's
not like you know so we have this like
asymptoting of users but we're not
seeing the same trend with the people
who are building this right and so in
them I mean we all know this this famous
example in 2014 there was heartbleed
that happened so at the time two-thirds
of all web servers were using open SSL
and you know while that's the case well
literally you know every web server has
open SSL it turned out that the people
that were actually maintaining open SSL
was I think was like one quarter of a
developer at any at any moment so there
was one one guy named Steve Marcus
who who was not sort of like the main
guy that was contributing he was just
sort of every now and then casually
helping out I guess he noticed that
another contributor named Steve Henson
or Steven Henson was actually working
often full times a whole time on open
SSL for you know bursts at a time and
see Marcus was kind of you know curious
how that financially could work out how
could you how could you do that and he
found out that actually he was extremely
shocked to find that see that Henson
actually only only made a little bit of
money here and there for contracting
gigs and he basically made uh you know
one fifth of Marky's to salary and was
kind of in poverty and at the time when
Marcus had discovered this he you know
he looked at this other developer
Stephen Henson who he thought was a much
stronger developer than him and here he
was basically not not getting paid for
all the work that he does and this is a
quote he said of this whole ordeal was
that he had always assumed as had the
rest of the world that the OpenSSL team
was large active and well resourced but
in reality like I said OpenSSL wasn't
bringing in enough money to even support
a single person's job or you know
efforts and yet here we are everything
that we're doing industry government etc
they don't have any idea that these
kinds of things are happening though
we're just building stuff on top of that
which is a little a little scary I think
so yeah I I have I've got to read you a
couple of quotes because it's it's way
better to hear it from the people than
to try and paraphrase but you know of
this again Steve Marcus said you know
I'm looking at you fortune 1000
companies the ones who include open SSL
on your firewall appliance cloud
financial security products that you
sell for profit and and or who use it to
secure your internal infrastructure and
communications the ones who don't have
to fund an in-house team of programmers
to wrangle crypto code and then who nag
us for free consulting services when you
can't figure out how to use it the ones
who have never left it a finger to
contribute to the open-source community
gave you this gift you know who you are
as you can see he's not pleased about
the situation but it is a pretty
harrowing you know arrangement right I'm
a bit scared by this whole thing and so
I found some more data points so this
this comes from a University a research
group in Brazil that as a software
engineering research group in Brazil
they came up with a way to calculate the
truck factor based on a code base and
what they did was they took that that
way of calculating truck factor so if
you if you've not heard a truck factor
the truck factor is the minimal number
of developers I have to be hit by a
truck or quit you can choose the how
nice you want to make it before a
project is totally incapacitated and
kind of dies right and so they they took
this way that they've developed of
calculating the truck factor and then
they looked at the most popular or sorry
the most active projects on github and
then they basically applied their
calculation to those those repositories
and they found that 64% of those 133
most active projects had only one or two
developers that they needed to exist I'm
not you don't have to read this it's the
it's just the effect is is what I'd like
you to sort of internalize here so this
is these are the results the higher the
truck factor the better so of course we
want our repositories to be in the very
bottom of this of this table here and
the the rows correspond to truck factors
so the thing that's in orange here this
orange box that's that's that's labeled
TF this is the truck factor for
different repositories so as you can see
most of them are concentrated into truck
factor one and two like those two rows
and I know you can't read any of this
first I'm going to I'm gonna I'm going
to show you sort of some some things
that you would be shocked to find our
truck factor one and two so it turns out
that grunts if you use grunts and SAS
these are truck factor one reactive
extensions truck factor one apparently
WordPress is command-line tools also
truck factor one
I guess this one is not so surprising if
you guys use d3 truck factor one if
you've ever looked at the codebase it's
it's I you know I guess I understand but
truck factor one and everybody uses it
for visualizations like every
visualization library is built on it
truck factor two is Apache Cassandra
closure and anybody a closure programmer
in here I guess you guys know that if
your closure developer python pandas
that's a big one a lot of people use
that one
nettie truck factor two and I'm gonna
read you just a couple more in in sort
of the truck factor three in four boxes
so jQuery apparently is truck factor for
that's not a super good number WordPress
is truck factor five Ruby truck factor
five ipython truck factor four mm what
else Gradle truck factor for Jekyll
check factor for so these are all some
pretty you know recognizable names and
the main argument here is that there are
just a few people keeping those code
bases alive and I really hope that
they're not like Steven Henson's right
that would be really bad but it's not
all bad there are also frame bar tools
and and and frameworks and libraries and
things and that have high truck factors
to the highest is Linux I guess that's
good homebrew but that's kind of
cheating because you make a pull request
with your whatever but homebrew and yeah
there's just a few others I mean I don't
have to read them all v8 this truck
factor 14 guess so it makes sense google
is paying for it right
FreeBSD okay there's a bunch of things
that have higher truck back so that's
good it's not it's not all that it's
just surprising what has a low truck
factor and how much we need it that's
that's what's bad
um and if you're curious I wants it so I
had some issues plugging in my laptop I
wanted to like interactively look at the
truck factors of some popular libraries
with you but because I I cannot use my
laptop I I can't pull this up so I'm
just gonna let you guys do this offline
there's a website called get trends that
I oh and this is from the research group
that developed this sort of calculation
of the truck factor and they went and
applied this calculation to not every
github repository but a lot so you can
search around in this repository and see
you know choose choose a software
project that you like it's probably in -
you can see what the truck factor is
okay so truck factors are low lots of
people are using this more and more
people are using these open-source
projects and then we have this you know
situation with you know maintainer x'
like steven henson the guy that did most
of the work for open ssl right um you're
gonna bear with your have to bear peak
because this is when i'm gonna read you
a bunch of quotes from stressed-out
maintainer x' again i can't i can't
paraphrase it better than reading you
their own words so noah Kantrowitz
who is a member of the Python Software
Foundation
you know characterized this this shift
in the number of users sort of
increasing and the number of maintainer
Zoar contributors not exactly increasing
with it he said in the early days of the
open source movement there are
relatively few projects and in general
most people using a project we're also
contributing back to it in some way both
of these things have changed by likely
uncountable orders of magnitude the
other problem is the growing imbalance
between producers and consumers in the
past these were roughly in balance
people put time and effort into the
Commons and everyone reaped the benefits
these days very few people putting that
effort and a vast majority simply
benefit from those that do this
imbalance has become so ingrained that
for a company to repay in either time or
money even a small fraction of the value
that they derive from the Commons is
almost in think unthinkable so we've
developed a culture of reaping the
benefits but not sort of putting in any
effort to try to keep the
as it is so there are a lot of famous
examples of you know important
contributors ragequitting I'm not going
to read that some of the colorful
examples but there was a contributor
named Ryan big who wrote documentation
for Ruby on Rails and announced that he
was quitting all open source work I do
not have the time or energy to invest an
open source anymore I'm not being paid
at all to do any open source work and so
the work that I do there is the time
that I could be spending doing life
stuff or writing it's not fair to expect
me to do even more work outside of my
regular work and then not get fairly
compensated time or money for it
it's a great recipe as well for burnout
and making me just generally grumpy
an engineering manager at a web agency
he had a similar experience he says well
that's the big thing for me knowing you
did something for free out of love and
there's an endless stream of people
going more and more and more and getting
angry when you won't accommodate their
edge case I had my phone number on one
of my personal sites so friends could
get in touch with me I had to take it
down after a week because people would
call me in the middle of the day for
plug in support even though there's a
forum for support there's nothing
inherently wrong with that it just wears
you down makes you afraid to check your
email or answer the phone that's bad and
people get burned out it's not a secret
I'm sure you've met somebody in one of
your various communities that has
experienced some kind of burnout before
and you know with this this dynamics
these dynamic shifting the way that they
are you know that's a really bad thing
because we have more and more users and
not exactly more people coming to the
table to help maintain these things
so on that note I'd like to note point
out that the US Department of Defense is
a major user of floss since the late 90s
early 2000s and in 2003 there is even a
report that was commissioned basically
to determine you know what like is is
this floss stuff good should be you know
is it introducing problems somehow I
don't know what's what what is what is
this stuff and in that report they found
they didn't expect to find this but they
found that apparently they depend very
heavily on floss and actually the report
was basically just an argument for not
banning it at the Department of Defense
you know don't get scared we need this
instead they want you know the results
of this report was that they should
actually promote more more use of floss
at the Department of Defense they write
floss applications tend to be much lower
in cost than their proprietary
equivalents and yet they often provide
high levels of functionality with good
user acceptance so why why pay for
something right so I mean that's this is
what scares me is the thought that that
guy who like rage quits rage quits and
is responsible for a piece of software
that like the Department of Defense is
using to like fire missiles with that's
also something I don't want to happen so
I mean these are things that we just
don't these are these are dynamics that
could could occur and we're just not
aware of them even being possible so I I
think that's that's enough with all the
scary data points I I don't want this to
be about like Oh things are also bad
because it's not it's not so bad it's
just that we should pay attention to
this and we should think more critically
about how you know we are using
open-source and whether or not there's
some way that we can give back to it
such that we're not just extracting
value and you know killing the people
who are developing these things for us
and then we all kind of lose out on the
open source software that we had been
using for so long right
so with that before I get into some of
the things that I think you know we
could try as solutions I'd like to just
summarize so what we really saw was okay
this whole thing where you've got people
going around doing like use open source
it's the best thing ever that's like
they don't realize that that's they
already won like stop telling us yes yes
you won everybody is using open source
they're not using proprietary software
very much anymore so startups enterprise
and even governments are depending on
this digital infrastructure and they're
making policies to use it more and more
yet at the same time I mean that means
that we have orders of magnitude more
users and it's not like we're getting
new contributors at that same rate and
you know what's what's stressing these
contributors out is the fact that people
are coming from proprietary software who
are used to you know support forums that
they can yell at the poor support agent
and you know it's just some really
stress that guy he was working on his
weekends to make this piece of software
exist for us to use so whole like
yelling at random people on the internet
thing it just gets worse with the
open-source maintainer x' because you
know they're already like hanging by a
thread here it's okay what can we do to
make this better again I'm just one
person I could have you know not the
greatest ideas about this I'm gonna tell
you some of the things that I at least
think are you know better or that might
work just to give you a sense though
about how so when I say funding I I mean
both kind of time and money his time and
money are basically the same thing and
it turns out so I'm gonna go through a
couple of ways that people are already
fund open-source but I just would like
to note that it's not easy you know if
you have money and you want to somehow
give it to a project it's not even it's
not even that simple thing to just be
like here project that I love here's
$200 do something with it that that's
good you know maybe that money should be
devoted to making some feature happen or
fixing a bug or something and there
might not
any maintainer that could work more
hours because they might have a job
already even if you paid them right so
it's like it's not just that money is
going to help and further sometimes the
amount of money that that people manage
to get via crowd-sourced means like
maybe everybody gives a dollar you know
at irregular intervals might not be
enough or regular enough to make a big
impact right so it's not like you know
just any source of money given any way
is going to solve the problem that said
the by far the most the most successful
way of funding open sources via
subsidies so we can break these into two
categories the category that everybody
is probably familiar with is what we
call the personal labour subsidy where
you have a developer that has a day job
so you know they're not they're not
completely living in a under a bridge
with their laptop opening working on an
open-source project they have a job they
are paid to do that job and then they
work on their their open source projects
exclusively in their spare time so this
this individual is is sort of paying in
time right in his off time or her off
time on the other side there are
corporate labor subsidies you could say
so
floss work that that an employer might
fund either as a side-effect of a
project perhaps there's a blocker you're
working on some project and you need
this open source library but it has a
bug in it and so you know you have to
fix that bug because you know it you
can't move forward with your work
project if that doesn't get fixed so you
could be funded by an employer as a
side-effect of some other project or
there could even be an explicit
allocation of time to some fluffs
project and that is actually less
frequent I mean it's not completely rare
it's just that's not the most common
form of subsidizing work for you know
open source work the by far the most
common kind is this personal labor
subsidy where people are doing this and
their off time right
other models that you know have varying
levels of success it can be broadly
lumped into the category a patronage so
even big one-off contributions to a
project let's say you know ten thousand
dollars or something or small ones like
small donations monthly via patreon or
even personal sponsorship for a specific
project corporate patronage like you
know Google's like hey we really need
open SSL which true story they did and
then they gave them like a hundred
thousand dollars or something several
other companies got together and threw
money and open SSL after it was realized
that nobody was able to really work on
it so that's an example of this
corporate patronage and then there are
lots of companies who will build
products or services around an open
source project so a project so you know
some commercial distribution of an open
source projects or you know assurances
or contracting hosting services things
like that and these are all valid ways
to support open source and often you
know there's a mixing and matching of
things happening which one is the best
though honestly you know so the jury is
still out on this and if I had to bet
any money on it it to me it seems like
corporate corporate patronage or I'm
sorry not corporate patronage why did I
write that I meant to writes a subsidies
excuse me corporate labor subsidies so
that's a typo on the slide corporate
labor subsidies so the idea that you
know look at look at look at Google for
them I mean so v8 is okay the reasons
that v8 is open-source or not relevant
at the moment let's just look at the
fact that people can Co v8 being
developed people can contribute to it I
don't think that they've got any
contributors outside of Google being
like the truck factor people but
hypothetically they could be right and
the fact that there are several people
who are working on on on this project
and they're paid to do it and they're
paid to you know common nine-to-five
work on this thing that a lot of people
care about and depend on in need it's
it's more sustainable than you know you
working your butt off at a company at a
start-up eighty hours a week and then
coming home and hacking on your tool
that's you know never going to be
finished because you never get the time
or the
energy to do it so in my in my opinion
finding ways to subsidize this work you
know as part of you know a companies
offering is really the most sustainable
thing if there's something that you're
making money off of that is depending on
a certain project the best thing that
you could do to ensure that that project
still exists is contributing time or
money back to that project so it does
not disappear and your your product does
not disappear so getting people who are
working at your company able to be
committers able to be you know one not
up on the truck factor for that project
that ensures that the thing that you're
depending on doesn't go away because now
one of the the truck factor people is
one of your developers and you know
there's the the warm fuzzy feeling that
this thing is not going to disappear now
you can just trust that it stays there
right so in my opinion I think that the
the sort of the best thing for for
open-source is trying to find a way to
incorporate that into the time that we
spend at work but this is you know this
is my like like fuzzy feeling that this
is what I think should happen and of
course there are umpteen thousand
problems and it that you know it I don't
even have to it's not even about big
companies versus small companies
essentially all companies don't have a
story or process for managing
open-source or saying hey I'm gonna let
my engineers work one day per month on
one of the open source projects that we
depend on that we need to exist like
that's a that's a protocol or a process
for for dealing with open source in your
organization but there's you know almost
none almost no companies have a process
like this so this is also this is from
the 2017 black duck survey and
essentially what it says is that around
sixty sixty percent of of these
companies that answer to this survey
either have no process or the people in
the company are unaware of there being a
process or a story for dealing with open
source contributions or open source
and in 37% there are there is some
indication I mean it can be something
you know that this actually can be
broken down into more fine-grained
numbers but you know the point is
they've got something they've thought
about it there is at least like a local
process and one department or something
for dealing with this right so this is a
problem and I mean I'm standing up here
saying oh yeah yeah we should give money
or time or whatever to open-source
projects and of course they know I let
you work at a bank and like the the
amount of people that you would have to
walk through the amount of legal hoops
you have to jump through to to be able
to open-source anything that you do
inside of the building you know it's a
hilarious proposition for me to make
that right so every organization is
different maybe you're a part of a big
one like one of the banks with many
rules and processes and legal
departments or maybe you're a you know
you're a part of a small contracting
shop and maybe it's easier if you
organizationally to say hey you know we
we make most of our money by consulting
on this one group of libraries perhaps
one of us should become a committer on
that library and that way you know it's
also good for a business and you know we
can use that as a way to get more jobs
and whatever else so I mean you know
there are different sorts of
organizations and different sort of you
know it's it's it's varying varying
levels of feasibility depending on the
organization right and I can't just end
up here and say hey everybody you should
just do this because it should make
sense financially obviously I can't and
obviously it doesn't fit for for any
organization but personally I believe
that you know the floss that we use and
depend on every day deserves that the
you know deserves to have this
conversation happen I mean it should be
something that should come up and in
meetings or it should be something
mentioned with clients I think it's it's
something that we're gonna have to start
worrying about if we don't start
thinking about how we solve this problem
and start how we start giving back
somehow soon you know we're gonna have
big problems down the line if we don't
do anything but okay you know this is
sort of unrealistic this suggestion hey
like let's go talk to our legal
department or let's talk to our bosses
or clients and say how can we how can we
spend a very small number of hours per
week sort of contributing back to a
project that's important to our business
that's not easy it's not gonna happen
overnight so what could we do faster
than needing to deal with synchronizing
within a company
another thing that I think would be very
helpful or very useful to start is
actually working together and doing a
better job of teaching people how to
participate in open-source projects so I
don't know how many I mean I guess this
this audience is probably a lot of you
participate in open-source projects in
some capacity but if you think back to
how hard it was to get started I I you
know I imagine that you kind of had the
experience that I had where I didn't
know who to ask I was afraid to ask
people I didn't go to the right places
that I asked to detailed or not detailed
enough questions it was very difficult
to get started and I didn't know the
people I was talking to so we started
doing this thing in the in the scala
community we called them open source
breeze and the idea is to come up with a
general recipe for sort of teaching
people how to you know contribute to
open source projects and this is an
in-person thing it's open to you know
anybody who works on any sort of project
it doesn't really you don't have to be
of one persuasion or another so far
we've been doing it obviously in the
context of Scala but the idea is that
you take half a day before during or
after a conference and you get a bunch
of attendees at the conference that are
potentially interested in learning how
to purchase a you know participate in an
open-source project and then usually at
a conference there are people who are
committees on a project I'm sure there
are a lot of you here who have some some
library or tool that other people care
about use if you're interested in having
somebody you know meet them face-to-face
and perhaps somebody joins up and helps
you add features or fix bugs that would
be pretty cool right so we've been doing
this in the scallop community at various
conferences for the last year and you
know we've had varying levels of success
with it but it's also something that
we're trying to encourage people in
different meetup groups to pursue so you
know
I don't know how many people are meetup
group organizers but there always tends
to be an issue where you can't find
speakers maybe right you have you go
three months because you can't find
somebody to give a talk on a cool
project well why not have a in one of
these open source breeze get together a
group of people in your city and maybe
there's one or two maintainer zuv a
project and you know everybody can learn
how to contribute back to that project
or your brainstorm about new things that
and the way that it works is that you
know it's it's it's a whole structure
for bringing people together to sort of
make a little bit of progress on one of
these projects so we always get a
library author in the room or two author
or somebody on one of the compiler teams
and that library author will curate a
handful of two days it could be they
could be small things that that are good
for newcomers and maybe three hours of
time and the goal the goal of the whole
thing is you know one of these newcomers
will come forward and choose one of
these issues that they're interested in
working on and one of the libraries that
are in the list to work on and they
ideally would like to get one PR that's
associated one of these issues merged by
the end of the Spree and if they do they
get we give them a small price but it's
a little bit of motivation to you know
to get to the end and we we do this like
I said rather regularly every couple of
months last one we ran was in November
in Lyon and we I mean the way that we do
it is pretty low-maintenance we just
maintain a github repository with
information people project maintainer x'
who are going to be present at the
conference we'll just make pull requests
to this github repository containing a
list of the different projects and who
is the person to contact about those
projects so here I mean you know this is
the last one we had I don't know at
least 15 or so libraries in in or not
even just libraries but tools right we
have the the dotty compiler so that's
the research study or the research
compiler the Scala Zed which is the
functional programming library CBT which
is Chris folks build tool and then there
are various libraries that people people
use all the time in here and so all
these people had they came to the
to the Spree with a few ideas of things
that somebody could do to help them out
and at the end of the spree you know
there were I don't know the number but
several pull requests merged for many of
these projects um we also provide so I'm
just like this is like scrolling down
and they'll read me because I don't have
the internet connection right now that I
need but I mean you know we give all
kinds of instructions about how it works
how to propose projects if you're
interested in sharing with people about
you know like issues or things that you
would like to have done in your project
how to go about it and I mean I guess
the the t-shirts are a good indicator of
how many people succeeded in somehow
doing something I wanted to open-source
projects and and for us that actually I
mean you know this is anecdotal but it
actually seems to have helped us at
least the projects that I have a view on
we've had a big increase the number of
casual contributors it's not just
one-off Peter Peters but some of these
folks are coming back and saying hey I
wanted to do this other thing and I mean
something that they're maybe doing on
the weekends or in their spare time and
then I think they're actually where at
least three of them ended up getting
jobs by doing this so they contributed
to a number of projects that made them
visible and then they went and got hired
somewhere that they wanted to work and
sort of improve their job situation so
it's sort of you know it was good for us
and was good for them and now there's
also people just coming back and sort of
helping others with issues that are
arising in the trackers etc that just a
lot more activity and it's really nice
and I argue that anybody can do it we
all we did was come up with a social
structure and we just facilitated it and
other people are sort of replicating it
and it's it's quite nice it's also
really nice to see the face behind the
library that you're using or interested
in that's something that the internet
hides from us right so meeting the
person and then talking to them about
what issues could be or features or
whatever it could be could be added that
that's really neat okay and this is the
last thing that I mentioned and then I
will I will I will wind down but I
basically mentioned two things I said
hey so they're all they're all these
like ways of funding open-source and I
really think that the best thing to do
is to try and find a way to have company
subsidize that it's the most humane
thing it's also just makes sense if
companies are
our profiting off of it they should find
some way to sort of integrate that into
how they're you know how they're had you
know a cost of building the tools that
they're that they're profiting off over
the the software the profiting off of
that's my opinion and I don't know if
this is gonna go anywhere but it seems
to me like the most realistic solution
um and then I said okay well if we can't
really force change to happen right away
well the best we can do then you know us
as just individuals is we can try to
help other people learn how to
participate in open-source and that's I
suggest hey these free things are pretty
a pretty cool way to do that and they
actually work a little bit at least not
one you know 100% of the people that we
we worked with in these fries are not
coming back all the time but probably 15
20 percent are and that's that's still
an improvement for us right but there's
a third thing that's happening and I
don't have a lot of details about it but
I'm excited about it there's this
company called tide lifts which I I i
only know about because it was the
former like the CEO of typesafe for like
a few months before like right at the
beginning when they were being founded
he was like the interim guy and he moved
somewhere else and did things for
several years he came from Red Hat so he
wasn't really you know a part of our I
just knew he was who he was and you know
in the last few months he started this
thing with some some folks that I knew
from the open-source community in
scarlet called tide lifts and they're
kind of operating all secretly right now
but their mission I'm just gonna I mean
it's extremely vague because that's what
that's what startups in stealth mode are
like but you know their goal is
basically to try and add a new model to
to sort of sustaining open source and
they told me some of their ideas and I
you know they're going to make some kind
of announcement very soon but really
what they as far as I can understand and
I suggest you keep an eye on this base
because it's pretty cool they're trying
to facilitate an exchange of funds
relative to the usage of open-source
projects so that you know in its
innocence you can think about it kind of
like how YouTube works for people who
create con
and if you've got somebody who you know
everybody is consuming videos from
YouTube is rewarding them I this is all
you know we have issues with this but
still they get paid by by YouTube
because people are are consuming this
right we don't have anything like that
in open source and they they're
proposing something like that which is
kind of neat because as far as I know
nobody's proposed anything like that so
far and this would ultimately be a new
model for finding open source and it
would mean that perhaps a developer
could you know develop something on the
weekends maybe it takes off become super
popular the whole closure community
depends on it and you know through this
weird organization they might be able to
eventually quit their day job and work
on this projects that they kind of like
hacking on on the weekends full-time
they might get paid enough to do that
from this from this from this weird new
model and that's literally all the
information I have about it but you know
if if it does but it promises it's going
to do this thing could be really cool
and uh you know I just suggest hey keep
an eye on it because it looks neat and
that said I will I will conclude and I
just I really like this quote from Nadia
so I'm just going to read it to you guys
like an endnotes in the last five years
open source infrastructure has become an
essential layer of our social fabric but
much like startups or technology itself
what worked for the first 30 years of
open source is history won't work moving
forward in order to maintain our pace
progress we need to invest back into the
tools that help us build bigger and
better things and with that I'm happy to
answer questions and I put up a
shameless plug if you guys like
conferences this is a cool one that I'm
organizing and those are our keynotes
you're the first people I showed the
keynotes to so Alan Kay is going to be
there Simon Payne Jones Bennett it sir
Andreas Ross Berger the guys are leading
the or some of the leads on the web
assembly project and Steve Frank Frankie
I don't know how to say his last name
correctly but he works on go so those
are our keynotes this time I leave that
up if anybody has any questions I'm
happy to answer them
you
please don't roast me I thank you for
the great talk I would like to know your
opinion on the relationship between open
source I didn't hear the first part you
are what on the relationship the
relationship between open source and
Industry or companies if the
relationship isn't in a state that it is
now because it somehow works so for
example there is this potential track
factor but it never really happened so
there was no major outage or problem and
that the companies don't take it
seriously and basically the industry
models true so it works somehow so no
one wasn't open ourselves so wasn't that
an example of it not working
yeah bit was a most quickly fixed yeah
that's a dramatic example III so you're
right that it you know it might be
something catastrophic rarely but I mean
I don't think it's fair to say that it
doesn't happen that it's not a thing
that exists I think it does exist in the
OpenSSL example is one more people were
working on it there probably wouldn't
have been heartbleed
and we give the mic to the gentleman
just there in the middle
there may be a related program that
open-source software is being the
production is being infiltrated by
secret services to enable spying on us
there are now strong rumors that secure
Apaches secured rope has been
compromised so that's not really safe
for whistleblowers to use it and I just
googled on heart bleeds and open SSL in
combination with the CIA
and whatever I read and as a new of
heart beat already two years probably
and they probably liked it too yes and
Steve guy Steve Marcus yes so I was I
found these Steve Marcus must have
former CIA consultants yeah you were he
was a government so I know he was a
government contractor whether or not
there was something dubious behind his
involvement and openness I saw I can't
say we could speculate but I know he was
a government contractor that's all I
know
so if he was like you know a secret CIA
agent like ensuring that wasn't broken
that wasn't fixed I don't know I go but
can we do anything to make sure that the
all these backdoors that have been
planted get out of it
so I mean I have a much more modest
proposal which is maybe we should have
more eyes looking at this stuff yes yes
we're looking at this as like sorry it's
like you guys in this room you should
look at the stuff here using I don't
know maybe you know you'll find
something scary that Andre you know was
worried about I don't know there's just
not enough people looking at these
things and I don't know considering can
this be improved should this be fixed we
just kind of treat it like it's somebody
else's problem and then we complain when
it doesn't work I'm suggesting that we
should be a little more proactive as a
group of people who depend on this stuff
but shouldn't air also be a kind of laws
for that say that state students
interfere with this and outlaw this
could make laws but you know you know
who's like you know when do governments
agree on following laws like they don't
exactly they ignore each other they
break laws all the time I'm not sure it
said especially the US government would
they make a rule and break it secretly
so I mean sure we could do that I'm not
sure how useful a pity
I wouldn't know either but thank you
very much yeah okay so I think we have
time for two more questions I've got one
down here okay first you described the
open source industry as being powered by
a few enthusiastic burndown individuals
and exploited by lots of greedy
companies it was kind of well to
simplify things a bit it was kind of
depressing but then you said that 37% of
companies in one way or another have a
process of contributing back so this
actually is wonderful it's mean nearly
too good to be true it's unbelievable
good news unbelievably good news and the
other thing is
sorry I forgot my question well I mean
you're right it's not all bad sorry yes
you mentioned a way to support open
source by business as you label the
products and services so there are
companies that actually take money on
the writing as a portable yeah I happen
to be working for one of them
and my question is do you have any
indication how important it is like
industry-wide how important a part does
this business model play in supporting
open source industry so I'm I'm an
imperfect person with a limited view of
a few examples I've seen very successful
ones where it seems to be working really
well and everybody downstream is super
happy and I've seen examples where
people are not happy with the company so
I mean you know whether I could name
several no sequel databases for example
but there are examples where it's worked
and where it hasn't and I'm not I'm not
confident to say like this is a model
that works well because clearly there is
something that you know we're doing
wrong in some and right and others and I
don't know maybe the businesses are not
making money and then they're like
decimating the open source I don't know
it's very complicated system that I
cannot make any worthwhile observations
about I just know work sometimes and
that doesn't work other times yeah so
there's nothing I can say about that but
on the other point I just want to I
grieve you that like I started with this
I even started the whole presentation
I'm like yeah this sounds really bad and
then Oh a 37% that's good right it's
definitely very good and you know there
are some surveys that show that 50% of
companies usually who are following in
open source whatever interest things
they'll have 50% of their depending on
the the set of users you you asked to
answer the survey 50% of people are
contributing back to open source you ask
a different set of people it's like 2
percent right but I mean it's not
horrible people are contributing back
it's not like you know I guess what I
really want you to walk away with it or
that things that you care about or that
you use or depend on are better and
better supported by some companies or
some organizations and less well
supported by others and then you have
like the problem where there's one
it could be all stressed out and quit
right and you don't want that to happen
so there's it's not it's not homogenous
like across all of these different
projects they're not all well supported
some are really not well supported and
we should just be aware that that's a
reality for some projects that we
actually used a today
you
Oh
that's very nice talk you're drawing
attention I think to something that's
important and that wasn't on my radar so
I'm very grateful
just a couple of anecdotal stories that
things aren't all negative you'll know
that Jane Street makes heavy use of oh
camel and then puts a lot back into the
Oh camel community that's one of the
things they see is their need I first
met Charles Hoskins the CEO of IO HK
which uses Haskell for the
cryptocurrency stuff he wanted to meet
me to say okay how do we put back into
the Haskell community yep so they're
definitely people yeah there are tons of
good things to note I mean we have a lot
of also good stories in the scala
community so it's not just like hey this
calendar is funded by X companies but
choose a library or a group of libraries
and you'll have companies directly
funding the development of those or
supporting their user groups and whatnot
so you've got a lot of that in the Scala
community too which is really cool and I
you know again I I'm sorry if I scared
you with like the overwhelmingly
negative with the title but yeah I mean
if you care about pandas for example we
should be worried about Python pandas
because there's what to to developers
keeping it alive
I mean Scala is good Haskell's pretty
good we saw that Linux is amazing
apparently but there are other things
that don't have such great stories
behind them and I don't know we should
be concerned about those it's worth
keeping track of one thing I want to ask
you about in the early days of open
source people said this will be
sustained by an ecosystem of companies
that are maintaining this stuff and
getting consulting fees for it and
you've sort of touched on that here or
there but that used to be the main story
so how healthy is that part of that
that's exactly the kind of you know you
work at one of these companies I don't
know which one but there are a lot of
those and you know they they do support
I mean it really it's again I don't feel
confident saying that it works or
doesn't work because I have a box of
examples where it doesn't work in a box
of examples where it does in in one case
you've got these companies completely
destroying the project that they are
making money off of in the other case
they are profiting and the project is
growing that's great and why that's
happening for Deming it could be you
know the project itself it's you know
poorly targeted the business model is
bad there's lots of reasons for these
things but this is indeed true for a
number of open
projects but it's also not true for
others why I don't know we should hire a
business guy to figure that out but but
yes I think it works but not always
anyhow thank you for putting it on my
radar and I'm sure there'll be an
interesting conversation about this
going forward yep Thanks so Thank You
Heather I think this is something that
