talks here have been about language and
but I'm going to talk more about tooling
understand library and that's where most
of the focus are going today most of the
tooling that I'm talking about here is
coming bundled with the language yeah so
what's happening today and we have 1.0
coming out in this summer it will bring
a lot more stability to language and it
will we will start using semantic
versioning which means that we will only
have breaking changes between major
versions and we also have Alexa Kampf
which is the first conference it's
happening in Austin Texas in July and we
will have some great speakers who save a
limb of course we have de Thomas Bruce
Tate and Robert Verdi we've also just
released a package manager called hex
which I think will be a big step for the
community and also for the entire
ecosystem so these are tops on the
topics I'm going to talk about today I'm
not going to go into much detail about
every topic I'm selecting a few features
from every topic that I think are
interesting and I will talk more in
detail about first up we have mix which
is our build and project management tool
it helps your dependencies you can
integrate it into your projects with
help of mix tasks and then we have hacks
of course that also integrates into mix
which is the package manager next on we
have interactive elixir or ix for short
and which is the shell and we also have
X unit which is the testing framework
from the designer library I will talk
about streams and
how we're beginning to extend OTP so
first up we are mix which is the buildin
project management tool you use mix to
generate new projects it of course
compounds your code you can use it to
run tests it will handle Oracle it will
handle it will handle your dependencies
and also whatever else you can think of
because you can extend mix so
immediately after you have installed
language you will have mix available to
you you can call just name a pointer you
can call mix new immediately with the
project name and it will generate the
the product structure you will have your
mix file which configures your project
will have some config files some code
files and some tests then you can
immediately just go into the product
directory call mix tests it will compile
a code and run the sample test mix dot
exs is the mix file it is generated with
a helper mix new it is used to configure
a project and here's a sample project
configuration the application name OTP
application name the version and an
optional requirement on which version
you want yeah like I said which compile
your code takes your dot exe files in
rate themes and the app file it can also
compile our line code so you can have
your Erlang source directory will find
those files and will compile them it
will also compile our line lexer and
parser files and the mix compiled task
is fully pluggable so you can have
dependencies
which can add their own compilers and
you can define and you can add those
compilers in your project configuration
and those will be called when you call
the mix compiled task this is how you
define dependencies you can see here
what we have defined a dependency that
we will fetch from github we can handle
GT penances and path dependencies
dependencies I think are
self-explanatory path dependencies or a
dependency there is located on your
local filesystem
so you just define the path to the
dependency and it will be treated as a
part of a project and this is useful
when you're the when you're developing a
new feature or fixing a bug and you want
to try out that in another project
without committing it in Jade I'm
pushing it to G type and so on so here
we define how to fetch pool boy if you
look at ecto we didn't define how to
fetch it that means it will be treated
as a hex package and which I will go
into more detail later so we have the
all the mix tasks for handling our
dependencies you can fetch dependencies
update dependencies and so on we also
have the dependency converter which is
internal to mix is what converts your
dependency tree into a flat list of
dependencies which are ensured to be
unique because you can have a dependency
so you can have a dependency for example
poolboy which two other dependencies
depend on and we need to converge that
into a single dependency and you can
have conflicting definitions so poolboy
so one so one project made of may fetch
pool boy from G table another may fetch
it from bit bucket or something like
that so in that case we have a conflict
and you need to explicitly override that
conflict in your project
if not we'll race if the definitions for
the pool by dependency are not
conflicting we will convert them into
single dependency most high reputable
builds which means that which means
basically that all the uses of a project
will get the same versions of every
dependency and so we achieve that by
when the first time we fetch the
dependency we write the version that we
fetched into a log file this log file is
included in your version control so
every user of a project will get this
log file when you deploy and when you
deploy code you will get this log file
and that will make sure that you get the
exact same version of the dependencies
that you used when you tested the
project we can also handle rebar
dependencies we can compile rebar
projects and we will fetch and handle
children of rebar dependencies so if the
rebar project have defined and their own
dependencies we will treat them as
normal dependencies in mix you can also
extend mix this is what it looks like
you just define a module which is
prefixed with mixed tasks and then the
name of the task and you also need a run
function of RT one of these modules
compiled and it's a part of your load
path you can just call the toast like
this and put printout to the world so
that's real nice feature
these are two projects that are
extending mix through mixed tasks and
the first one is echo it's a library for
interacting with databases and like any
good database library we can handle
migrations which is a way to ensure that
your database is on the same version as
your code so you can roll back and roll
forward migrations which will if you're
using a sequel database it will it will
create table create indexes or drop
tables and so on so we can select the
mix new task we can collect again
migration to generate a new migration
file and with the necessary boilerplate
and then we can use take to migrate
tasks to migrate to the latest version
or rollback to a later to an older
version and so on another cool project
is called exo-m xrm which is a project
for generating OTP releases I believe it
uses relics under the hood but with the
help of mix when you call the mix
release task it can gather the metadata
from the project configuration the OTP
configuration and so on and it can use
that to generate the final release and
we can also extend out the parts of mix
apart from adding tasks like I said you
can extend the mix compile task you can
add SCMS SEMS are like our like how we
fetch the dependencies like I told you
we support JIT and path but you can add
more ways to fetch dependencies if you
want most support umbrella umbrella
projects an umbrella project is a
project which has many child projects
that are located in the apps directory
the child products are isolated which
means that you should be able to go into
the child project and it should work
like any other project you should
able to pull out the child from the
umbrella and it should just work so that
means that we have no configure
inheritance between the parent and the
child projects and the rental projects
are useful when you have like these big
projects but you want to separately but
you want to separate it into different
OTP applications but you don't want to
split it out into different repositories
the umbrella tasks are recursive and
like I said earlier the umbrella party
is not an OTP application so for example
when you call mix compile it doesn't
compile the umbrella project it is that
recursively goes through your
dependencies and compiles them and also
have the mix run task which loads your
project and starts it and it will load
and start all the children so it works
like a single monolithic OTP
applications but you can treat it
separately and when you want to so the
package manager Hicks right now it only
works with elixir packages but you can
publish airline packages and elixir
packages of course but you cannot fetch
so it only integrates into mix right now
so you cannot fetch packages from the
Erlang world but that's something we're
working on we want tooling in the Erlang
world for example by integrating to
rebar or having any script or something
like that that can fit your dependencies
this would hex website looks like here
we browse documentation you can find
documentation and browse packages we
also have download statistics which you
can use to gauge how use the project is
which i think is really useful
a hex package is basically a a tarball
with source code and some extra metadata
to describe the package when the package
is published it's pushed to Hicks API
which in terms pushes it to Amazon s3 by
having all the packages as tarballs and
the register file which is an index of
all the packages on Amazon s3 we can get
very high availability which means that
if the Hicks website were to go down on
the Hicks API were to go down you can
still deploy your code all users can
still use hex the only thing that would
stop working is publishing packages so
these are the tasks that takes ads to
mix you can list them mix local is used
to lick to list the local install tasks
and hexes install as a card or care for
those who don't know an airline code or
curve is like a zip file with compiled
modules which is if it's added to the
code path it will just our languages
treat its sa sa directory with with the
modules as files and when Mick starts it
will it will find this it will find
these tasks in the in the load path and
below them and we can yeah and we can
listen like this and all administrative
tasks are done through this command-line
interface you publish packages your is
your user and so on because they because
the website is only used to to browse
packages essentially also the dependence
resolution which is I would say the core
of hex before the dependency resolution
runs it fetches the registry file the
register file is an index that contains
all packages and the packages release
and the the releases dependencies and
the version requirements on the
dependencies all version requirements
use semantic versioning which means that
we can set same version requirements
without getting breaking changes at
least hopefully so the dependency
resolution is an algorithm that finds
the latest version of every dependency
that satisfies all the version
requirements only specific dependency
and when dependence resolution runs we
need to use the lock file again to make
sure that we are repeatable builds and
we need to honor over writes of
dependencies for example is it's a
dependent or is a resolver we can fail
the resolution which means that there
are that we for for dependency for
multiple dependencies we cannot find a
real error a version of the package that
that satisfies the requirements the
version requirements that you have on
that package so you need to be able to
override that in your top-level project
so feature future work that we want to
do on hex or length support of course
and we also want to be able to install
executables probably through a scripts
that are globally installed yeah so next
time we have interactive elixir or IX
for short
it's the elixir it's the elixir shell
it's built on top of the Erlang shell so
we get all the cool features on the
Erlang shell like remote shells and the
Diagnostics and stuff like that from the
Ehrlich show I will not talk much about
IX I will just show some features that I
think are are pretty cool first time we
have IX - s mix which you can call on
the command line so it starts IX with
the mixed application or with mix loaded
so what this does is when Cole mix like
this it will diff it will use the
default task
the default task here be mix run which
like I said earlier loads your puts all
your dependencies and your projects in
load path so it loads them it starts all
the applications and the whole OTP
application tree also loads OTP
configurations so this is really useful
so it should be easy to get the show
started with all our applications loaded
that should not be hard you should not
use some arcane command line flags and
stuff like that you just start a shell
with your with your application loaded
next time we are pride which is a way to
hook into a running process with a shell
it is inspired by the Ruby tool tool
also called pi and this is the easiest
way to show how pi works is to show an
example so here we have a shell a shell
session we we start by spawning a
process in this process we assign a
variable just as an example and then we
call the IX pipe function and when these
code executes we will get the user of
the shell we get this requests so it's
asked if you want to PI the specified
process and we of course say yes and at
this point a new shell we started with
the context of this that is at this
price call so we get the so this shell
exists in this process and this process
is blocking while this shell is running
so we can get access to the process
registry and we can get access to local
variables like this we can call binding
which lists all variables as a keyword
list and the Railly
and so on so that's really useful to
debug stuff and you can also use these
from tests so if you have some failing
tests you can add the prior or to a code
where you have the bug and you can get
the Chaisson a session where you can
inspect why things are going wrong
elixirs first class Doc's with that we
mean that Doc's are in line with the
code so we have in the source code we
have for every function you can define
documentation for it and when the elixir
file is compiled to a be module and the
documentation is included in the with
the byte code so this means that we can
get the documentation at runtime and we
can do cool cool things like the H
helper here here which you call with a
function name and then you get the
documentation for the function once F
tab completion in the shell meaning that
if we for example write write in mmm you
can tap and it will autocomplete to map
or show possible suggestions so you can
basically browse the documentation in
the shell which is really cool we have
other helper functions like H here we
have the our helper function for example
our for reload so give it a module name
and it will recompile the modules source
code and reload the module so it's
really useful when you're debugging
something so you have a an open shell
session you change some code in your
source file you do R with the module
name and you have the new module up and
running so next down with X unit which
is our testing framework like with IX I
will not talk much about our excellent
work so I'll just show some features
from it which I
very interesting first up we have the
asset macro which if you have been to an
elixir talk you've probably seen it as
it is really powerful just like normal a
certain functions in testing frameworks
it basically checks for true or false or
in this case where we're doing a
matching it checks if the match is
successful since it's a macro it can
look at the structure of this code and
we can do stuff like extract parts of it
so this is the a cetacean and we quote
the a cetacean to get the structure of
the code so this is the elixir AST and
this looks kind of complicated but it
really isn't and you don't have to
understand it to get the example
basically what you need to see is that
we have the matching operator here the
first argument is the left operand the
okay topple the second argument is the
call to the full function so with this
we can extract the full call and do it
separately so we can get the value of
evaluating the full application and we
can get the value and do this match with
a with a case with the case construct
instead of just using the match
operation which will just fail with a
bad match error so since we can extract
the full call we can get these beautiful
failures so we can pay to print a code
like this and as I said we can extract
the full call so we can get the right
hand side of the expression here so
unlike if we were not using an acid
macro this expression would just fail
with bad match
you would not see why it failed it would
just be this opaque fail
and you would have to investigate what
the foo function is returning and so on
but here we can print the exactly why
the why the match failed so that's
really cool I think I believe the
thermos worked in these beautiful colors
and stuff like that
right we can also tag tests it looks
like this this is a test function you
tagged it with an atom and here it's
integration so we did you can tag
certain tests or test cases which you
can then on filter on so if you have
some expensive integration tests which
are by default excluded you can then
include them with include flag you can
exclude some tests and you can only run
some species some specific tags you can
also call mix tests with the with a file
name and a line number line number here
being the location of the test so this
is a useful way to to run just a single
test and if we go back to the to the
failure here you see that we include the
this that exact same expression so you
can just copy paste this to the mix test
call and it will just run that that test
we also have doc tests which are from
Python so here we have the documentation
for the map function which maps a
function of our collection so we this
just a description of what it does and
here we have some example code you see
that the example code takes the form of
an of a expression you would write in
the shell so here it's prefixed with IX
the expression and the expected value of
the expression so in the test suite runs
we are execute we will execute all the
example code
that takes this form in your
documentation and match it so it we
shake that doesn't race of course and
we'll match it against the expected
value and this is really good because it
ensures that your examples are up to
date and also your your documentation
becomes part of your test suite
so next time we understand the library I
will talk about streams and how they
integrate into certain parts of OTP and
I will also show how we are beginning to
extend out TP and in some places so
streams are composable lacy collections
there are they implement the innumerable
protocol which all collections in elixir
implements but more things than just
collection implement the innumerable
protocol for example io divisors can
treat their streams so they will also
implement the innumerable the
innumerable protocol and to show this I
will first show in an example of how you
would read a file line-by-line and
execute a function for its side-effects
for every line so first we open the file
returning an IO device Posse to read
device the reader vice is recursively
calling itself reading from the device
line by line until we reach and a file
and forever and forever if every line we
are executing the operation function for
its side effect so this is a lot of code
to just read a file line by line I would
say it's a lot of unnecessary code it's
it's hard to really unless you are
really really explicitly or you're
you're reading this carefully it's hard
to see what really what really happens
and but streams can remove a lot of this
boilerplate so we have this is the
corresponding code with streams so we
have the file stream function which
creates a stream from the filename and
we pipe that to the UNAM each functions
which
execute a function here this day the
function operation function that you saw
in the previous example it executes that
function for every element in the in the
enumerable any and we're executing its
for its side effect so this really nice
we are removing a lot of the boilerplate
what's also nice is that when we call
this function the file is not opened
since it's a stream which are lazy the
file is only opened when when the stream
is forced so when you call an eager
function on the stream enum each here is
an eager function so it will be forced
immediately and open immediately but we
can use the streaming functions here to
compose a set of operations over the
stream and then later force it and then
why we're composing this stream the the
file will not be opened we can also use
streams with Jen event so you see it's
quite easy to imagine a journal vent as
a stream of events so we call the gene
event stream function on the on each
element handler with the stream as a
result as in streams like I said
implement the enumerable protocol all
functions that work on that protocol can
be used with the stream so we can take
the next time ten events which will
block until ten events have arrived and
we can also use it with the
comprehension Smith because
comprehension
now use the enumerable protocol yeah so
that's it about streams I will also show
how we are stopped beginning to extend
OTP I first want to say that OTP is
really great it's is very powerful you
can do almost anything with it
but it doesn't have many high-level
abstractions so we have Jen server to
create service we have Jen event to
create event tailors and so on
so we're starting to look at other
languages for example closure and ACTA
how they are creating some high-level up
some abstractions that are higher higher
higher level than what exists in OTP one
of those abstractions is agent which is
an abstraction around State inspired by
closure an agent builds on Jen server so
we get all the nice things by it being
an OTP process and we get a reporting we
get code upgrades and so on but it has
reduced functionality from a Jen server
so yeah so we only care about this state
we do not care about message parsing we
don't need to implement handle info
handle handle cost handle call and so on
we only care about state so this is an
example for how agents works so this is
a cash module this is the cash in the
start link function here we call the
agent start link functions which starts
in agent process we pass a function that
initializes our state then we can put
values into our cash by updating the
agent state and we can also get key get
values from the cash by beginning the
key and we extract the a part of the
state with the agent gate function so as
you can see here we are always passing
functions to the to the agent module so
that's how we so that's how we're so
that's how we reduce the handle info and
handle call callbacks and stuff like
that so this is the entire API
for for a for a for a shared cash and I
don't think I have to show you how much
code this would be if you were using yen
service where you would have to
implement all the callbacks like handle
info and so on so this is really nice I
think like most of the elixir standard
library you can use agents from airline
so first off we have this a bit strange
defines we do this to we do this to
remove the elixir dot air because one
liqueur compiles it translates its
module names into elixir dot the module
name because we don't this because we
don't want conflicts with with the
normal modules that existing that exist
in Erlang so this is what looks like the
apart from the defines is a pretty
straight state for straight forward
translation from from the elixir code
yeah
I also talked a bit about tasks it task
is a small single asynchronous action
it's just a process that you can spawn
and then a way to result from it either
by it crashing or you get a successful
return value from it and it's not a
complicated concept it's it's something
that is pretty easy to accomplish in in
in with usual with normal processes and
but what's nice with patterns like this
and Jen server and gentlement is that
they are easily recognized it's it's not
just that we don't have to re-implement
the code so when I see Jen event I know
that it's about event handlers I want to
see Jen server I know it's about some
state there's a no-buy server and
message processing to that server and
when I see tasks and when I see tasks I
know it's about a small single a
synchronous action yeah and this is how
you use tasks you call the toss async
functions which spawns a new process
with executing the work what is
happening in the do some work function
here then we can continue with our
normal process until we are awaiting the
result from the task so it Tosca return
a value or crash so here we wait for the
monitor message or a successful run of
the task
yeah I'm just starting to finish up
anyway and so I've gone over many things
today but a water but what I wanted to
show with this with this talk was that
elixir adds many things around the
language we have a lot of tooling to
make it easier for the developer to make
the quality of life for developers
easier we try to make it easier for new
developers to get started it's very easy
to generate any project for example it's
easy to just start a shell with your
application loaded and so on and yeah
that's it if you have any questions I'm
open forum yep
yep
okay yep yep so the question was if it's
possible to set up a local registry for
the Hicks package manager and that's not
possible today because it's still so
early in the in its life but it's
definitely wanting something that we
want to support in the future in the
view in the future yeah here excellent
I'm not sure which example are the agent
yeah
yes so the question is what this
ampersand function means and the easiest
way to show it is to show the airline
code that were also had so if you look
at this we it's a call to the depart
function on the dick module the first
argument here is the dick is a dict
itself the key and the value and what
this does is the it creates an anonymous
function with one argument so this is
the that argument so if we look at the
elixir code here it essentially creates
a function that looks like this
right you see it yep and what questions
yep
if you can add beam files to an existing
release no I don't know of any tooling
that does that I think you would have to
generate a new release or I mean the
Erlang tooling that works with releases
most often works pretty straightforward
forwardly with with elixir
okay okay so the question is how ii-if
you can add a lick search to an existing
Ireland project correct and if this is
easy yeah you can add you can add elixir
as the rebar dependency and you can add
your elixir dependencies and so on with
that and then and it will be compiled
and it will just work with with the
syntax yep any more questions okay thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
