terms of functional programming i
started with Scala and who here has
experienced with SCADA but a few how
many of you have used for closure I'm
probably more about the same really I
don't know so am i think in Scala and as
a language when I was just using it as
self was was okay but the trouble really
started when using it in teams and with
with other people because there were so
many different ways of approaching
things that it wasn't all that much that
much fun but then at the same time and
all let me first talk about how I got to
closure and so initially and pretty much
at the beginning when I started using
Scylla I wanted to have some kind of
application like what the side project
for streaming data from some kind of
girl screaming data source the web
client and I wrote this thing that I
just called Burke watch tweets and birds
and whatever and yeah I had that program
initially it was like not very
sophisticated at all but it was there it
was kind of like like the puppy it was
there and it was looking at you when we
wanted to be fed and then I just kept
maintaining that thing and at times it
felt more like this one yeah what kind
of cute I guess and then the initial
implementation and was in in Scala with
play framework on the server side and
the not so easy to understand it erotic
library and necessarily but with
angularjs on the on the client side and
to that work well but
I never really felt like extending it in
any kind of a way because I always had
this problem I don't want to go back and
forth between client and server and to
work in different languages and then
Scala jayus came along which was kind of
promising in a way but then this whole
typed thing in the browser where you
have platform where you don't really
have types it's kind of like a lot of
overhead but that still was working i
even had this college a has version at
some point and at the same time i was
working in a project we were using scala
and Hakka heavily so that was all right
and we don't really have to look at this
right now oh well why not so this is a
stream where the data that the Jason
from the Twitter streaming API goes
through the system and the stent match
against against some persisted searches
and then and delivered to clients over
in the initial implementation service
and events and now in the closure
implementation in webs with WebSockets I
will Sonia with that with us streaming
API not not a lot of people so the idea
is you can subscribe to certain keywords
I think up to 4000 or something and then
through kind of like the service end
event connection but it's not a servant
event connection because a format is
somewhat different but it's a chunker HP
connection and with that you get
delivered matches to your number of
either keywords that are contained in
the tweet or the varieties of certain
Twitter users and you get delivered
everything that matches up to a cap of
about 1% of what those fruit with a
system which means that where you reach
that cap at about 45 million tweets a
day so it's pretty good it's a pretty
good data source to play around with and
you get like 50 60 70 a second something
like that or which gives you something
to play with so that's what that's kind
of cute but then at the same time I was
working in this in the scholar project
and so many things seem so tedious and
who's a fan of types type systems people
who is explicitly not a fan of type
systems also a few people and no the
problem was was all that I always found
that first I always thought a type
system is a good thing because it keeps
you from from doing stupid things that
the compiler will then just catch and
tell you you stupid and then like to go
back to it again but then after working
in those in those projects for a while
especially with with actor systems in
that case acha the problem was that
there were so many problems that
occurred that in so many bugs that the
type system did not catch and but those
problems always occurred and not only
despite the type system but also because
of the immense amount of complexity that
was added by the building blocks of the
application that you would not have in
something like closure where things are
much more streamlined and simpler in my
mind it's probably just a better match
for my brain but you may feel the same
way so yeah that's so my 30 again I
don't know and this is the latest
version where I did some some rewrite
with enclosure script and with not
bootstrap anymore but pure CSS which I
find looks looks better and yeah another
step my journey to closure was that
he has seen a talk by a rich hickey yeah
a few people and how many times did you
have to watch it to understand
everything or to get everything I found
that whenever I watched one of his talks
there was always like something in that
that really got me think it's like oh
this is a really good idea and then I
thought about that for a minute and then
I was like way see now so every single
time that happened and he completely
lost me and so and i thought i would
much much rather rather read this stuff
and so I did a little experiment hmm and
I had freelancers on odesk to create a
transcript the idea was that I'm going
to invest the amount of money that I
would otherwise investment traveler for
an international conference and then
hire people on uh no desk to do the
transcript and then I would prove read
that and that was a really great
learning experience because I really
forced me to read all that stuff and
corrected we did a couple of times watch
it again and that was much better in
terms of what I learned than any
conference I've ever intended so yeah
that was definitely worth it it's all on
github you can fight all that there by
now it's 11 talks by with chicky and a
couple of others um all right oh yeah
this is the latest version so and then
and after discovering how um how much or
how good of a fit the closures where you
was oh I realized that I haven't
properly I hadn't probably said goodbye
to scala a very much wettest my dad's a
couple people yeah it was kind of funny
so i think it was kind of like at five
appeared scala and then somebody put it
on heck and use him in the next minute
there were like hundreds of people
reading that at the same time which was
kind of funny but yeah and to one of the
things in that letter was that i was a
little sad that there were no
opportunities really to do closure
anywhere northern trombley cuz that's
quite a bit of scholar and also in java
obviously but yeah that also helped goes
now on
working adequately a visa in Ireland
where it's all closure or at least
everything is going towards a closure
and that's that's definitely much more
fun for me than this column okay but
yeah and so then I started I can this
talk is a little bit comparable to one
live in London a closure exchange but
the one thing that changed since then is
that I started writing a book about my
experience about writing systems
enclosure and initially I didn't really
know why I even called it that why is it
the system as a mobile application what
is the system and then I remember that
that I read a book a couple years ago
about systems thinking and it's not
about programming at all that book but
there are so many things in there that
really make sense when you think about
software let me just read this quickly
and the system isn't just any old
collection of things the system is an
interconnected set of elements that is
clearly organized in a way that achieves
something yeah hopefully that that's
also to follow software that rebuild and
if you look at that definition closely
for a minute you can see that a system
of speeches of wreaths am three kinds of
things elements interconnections and a
function or purpose yeah but works put
in for software as well and then the
other thing and that was that was that
really got me thinking a little bit and
software that we write is worth
absolutely nothing when it's not one
that it doesn't really matter if we
write it but it becomes an observable
system and observable thing the moment
that we actually fired up so and that's
what what a system is its some something
that expresses behavior over time and
that's very important because that
behavior you can then observe okay now
for some
some architecture of what I built there
in my mouth gone we're more or whatever
so it's in the upper left corner we have
this Twitter streaming API and then
first we have one application that runs
in a separate JVM which is the dream
client or the twitter client which we
will have a look at and in a little bit
and then we have elasticsearch who knows
what population varies are okay so a
population very inelastic search is an
interesting thing because what you
persist there is not the data but the
verb so you start a trend for example I
don't know jobs Hamburg not Scala
something like oh and then every single
every single element that comes into the
system for the streaming API is then
matched against the existing the
existing ferries that have an ID and
then you have connections to the system
with a WebSocket connection and then you
know where to deliver those credits one
problem the end that I first had There
was that I wanted to well the most the
most the ferry that happens most often
is just an asterisk asterisk and you
don't want to stall that every single
time but that's an easy fix for that
when you use the hash in this case I
think it's a sha256 hash and you just
use that as
ID of that document that you put in the
population index then you only saw it
once so that's how I got around there
and then also the tweets are stored in
elastic search just regularly and then
there's a Redis pops up I'm using red is
there as as a queue which works really
really well with a little library called
carmine the closure library and it
really only takes like three four lines
of code on each side of that of that
connection and yeah it works it works
really well and then there's a separate
application on the server side which
handles the web socket socket
connections to the grinder you can have
one of that or ten of that or I know
that doesn't really matter and yeah just
said red askew knows actually not too
i'm not using a few there i'm using it
pops up you could use it as a queue but
it's just much easier to find out using
a pops up there mm-hmm will occur at
that another more detail and then and
when i first started with closure and it
didn't really long take long to convince
me that closure itself is a beautiful
language or that lisp from my brain
makes makes a lot of sense but the
problem was that i didn't really know
how to structure an application in a way
that it doesn't become an interconnected
mess of dependencies between namespaces
and stuff like that so i started using
something called the component library
ireland by stuart sierra and the
component library and consists of of a
couple of nice life cycle methods and
see
so this is how a component books like
this switch port that we just saw in the
middle of that of that diagram is
modeled as a deaf record which makes a
lot more sense when you actually no
closure and here and the building block
that i'm using there is core async who's
familiar with caressing couple people or
CSP couple or maybe even cool so
communicating in a sequential processes
and is the underlying technology that is
implemented with with caressing and the
idea is that information and flows
through your system using channels and
Ricky always compares those channels to
conveyor belts and convey a better
really ever the really nice property
that you put something on there and then
it goes somewhere but you don't really
have to care not really your problem at
the end of that the whole production and
could be right over there or somewhere
else but I don't have to care and just
doing one job I take something off here
I process it do one step with it or two
or whatever and then I put it on the
next conveyor belt and that's all the
single component needs to know and
unlike in other models of of concurrency
where you have actors actors need
addresses so that's that's a huge source
I find it that's a huge source of
coupling between different parts of the
system that you actually you think okay
you know where to send this particular
kind of message and then you want to
remodel the system so that it's actually
it doesn't go there but to some kind of
router that then fans it out or whatever
and then all of a sudden it doesn't have
the same address anymore so you have to
go back and you have this dependency
between different components of the
system with the channel you don't really
have that this single unit of work only
knows the conveyor belt where data comes
from and that's where to put it how you
wire it somewhere else doesn't really
matter it's completely a transparent to
that to that component and okay just a
different different view for what I
mentioned with fanning out to two
different different machines you do to
do oh yeah idea that's a that's the book
i started writing it's on lean pub and
so far apparently the page said says
it's forty two percent done complete I
don't know that that's true but I just
like that number so yeah but it's coming
along nicely so far and there are 124
pages and it's actually a lot of fun
writing a book this way where you get
immediate immediate feedback and don't
have to deal with what the publisher
than that once before has a co-author of
of another book and that was much more
tedious and also you can completely work
on github with mark down so i highly
recommend this process as opposed to
working with a tradition papa sure that
has you work with word document it's
it's big pain tell you that but you
don't have to to buy the book to read it
and there's also all the markdown that
it's written in on github it it's not
formatted as nicely and you won't you
won't get the benefit of having like a
popular formats and stuff like that but
other than that I think you can really
just find on my github okay so here
these are the new advanced that I did
after i started writing with a book and
i still don't know why i don't have a
mouse but yeah you can why can you see
that
so what you see do we have pointed me
maybe laser pointer something yeah oh
thank you all right so this is the
Twitter assuming I API let's go through
this a little bit and have a look at the
different channels yes the building
blocks of this application okay so data
comes in here from that dream year
streaming API and then it goes through a
transducer and a transducer is kind of
like map or something like that but
without the collection so it's it's
Richard you can explain that too much
better than I can but it's kind of like
a recipe that you can apply to different
kinds of data structures to do some kind
of stepwise computation and in this case
yeah yes and in this function yes lot of
azusa itself no you can just pass it to
a channel anyway yes and it can have
internal state if you want which can be
useful particularly here because some
time ago in the state of somewhere in
there some time ago earlier last year
before that the Twitter streaming API
was always giving you one tweet / chakra
everything was symbols all you had to do
was pass the Jason do something with it
initially I did I passed that in Scala
in a case class and then later just as
Jason in Scala and then
enclosure just as an as a closure data
structure and then all of a sudden let's
stop working and now all of a sudden the
chance sometimes one time would equal
one tweet but sometimes we spread spread
out over multiple chunks and it didn't
really seem to make a lot of sense
perfectly somehow optimization on that
part that really wasn't helping the
developers or whatever and then what
what I did there was to store local
state in an add-on and have that
accessible to each step so I can just
put different chunks together and then
every single time see if that is
complete Jason be so positive if not
don't do anything don't put anything on
the next channel just keep waiting and
then if that ultimately fails is throw
the weigh-in take the next one but
usually you can rely on a valid JSON
data structure coming in multiple chunks
but eventually you will get a complete
suite there okay so then I'm question
yep shop service while you're using
transistors and channels of a pipeline
here oh yeah and pipe I'm sorry little
channel yes oh yeah it's a transducer
that I passed to the channel when I
created in a pipeline no i'm using the
pipeline and when varying elasticsearch
later where i can have found out to
multiple internal go blocks that do the
crowing and just use multiple of the
same but he has only one at the same
time yeah then he said oh yeah okay oh
my maybe we can just talk afterwards
and yeah then what I do here pointing
devices came to pay my hands and then
react then we have the analyst bag this
switchport component where I have
different components that only contain
your channel and I'm still in the
process of exploring if that fits what I
want well enough because I'm not
completely sure on the client side in
the eyebrows on the closures good
application I find that things are
simpler than this with those components
but yeah I'm still trying out different
ways of doing that so here i have this
switchboard the beauty of of this
structure is that there's absolutely no
dependency between any of those of those
building blocks of application this one
does not know anything about anything
else here and same goes for for all
other components only the switchboard
knows these channels components that's
it so you can just swap a plane it
becomes absolutely trivial in your
application to build something like this
where you use Redis pops up or q or
Kafka whatever it doesn't really matter
you just put it on there and someone
else will handle it but just like in
that model with a conveyor belt you put
it on there and it's gone don't have to
care about so this is the the other side
of the application the one that knows
the client connections I think I will be
able to get rid of a couple of
additional channels here but it's
impossible to really model the whole
information application with just a
couple of one-way channels and it's
probably easier if you look at the
separate parts with the explanation on
the github page or something too
get the whole thing but yeah I must say
I really like this this process of
modeling data flow in the application
actors but let's have a look at the
client side once I actually know that
sir so tweet comes in here here's
another switchboard and here is the
connection to client-side applications
and with the web socket connections and
those client-side applications can also
vary for four previous four previous
tweets like the last 5,000 format or
whatever and in here look very comes in
and is then handled with the core match
blog where it in terms okay what is this
thing what am I going to do with this
because i don't have different channels
on the web service connection and then
here i passed those fairies to the
persistence component which then has
this pipeline thing here with multiple
instances of saying the same thing that
varies my massive search index and then
delivers that back to the client through
different channels and then to the
WebSocket connection and all that is
fast then here is the population
component that does the matching between
incoming tweets and the client
connections and also it allows to store
new searches that come in from a client
side and this is the client-side
application and this one I modeled
differently and initially I used I used
on who's familiar with on cool I think
um
for me almost like and David Norman's
article about almond the future of web
frameworks and we see farmers or
something like that that was the point
of no return for me in terms of sorry I
cannot deal with angular anymore it
doesn't make sense and also if I'm
dealing with running with mutable data
structures on the server side why would
I handle or model the world differently
on the client side it there's really no
point for that or no reason no good
reason for that and who's familiar with
react is that's good yeah quite a few
people as you should know it's a react
this is amazing because you have a cat
we of of components that resemble the
DOM and those components can pass data
to their children and the promise is
that react does not need to modify your
data in any way that makes it suit
immutable data structures really well
unlike your other frameworks that have
to take your data and then keep it and
do stuff like that and take things on
and that doesn't work when you want
immutable data structures where the
promises that you can change them and
every single time you pass behind
something out it's going to be a new
thing and you cannot you cannot hold
hold on to that will change in your pad
and what reactors with that data
structure it will render the entire and
visual representation of of your data
every single time and and then do a
dipping and a very efficient dipping
between the previous version of that the
previous version of that virtual Dom and
the new version of the virtual Dom and
then only the result result of that
different
process is going to be put into effect
and usually that's not a lot it's just a
minor change and at first that might
sound like you're that's inefficient or
slow but it's not at all it's much
easier to achieve 60 frames per second
with reactor j/s than it is with angular
and there were even articles where for
performance reasons somebody used vnj s
inside an angular directive it's kind of
guy but yeah whatever so apparently that
was faster and so here i am i'm using
closure script and i'm using the ancient
after experimenting with home at first
because and i think that a couple of
properties about reagent despite on
being like what what really got me to
using javascript on the browser as well
but we agent has a couple of properties
for example you model the dawn with
hiccup knows hiccup as okay so like a
templating we can ever look at that in a
second and i really like that and the
other property is not it's not as hard
and fast but after not using that for a
couple of weeks i come back to the code
and I still understand it and that's
that's really benefit from me and I did
not have that with all came back to that
it's like what is he doing again what is
that interface doing that I have no idea
so I don't have that at all with the
free agent anyway so I have data like I
have state application state that I need
to keep somewhere and there's one thing
that almost is much better than reagent
per se i think and that is with reagent
you typically and the UI has access to
your state I don't think that's a good
idea though because if you work with
team or something
and that's UI developer and you are
responsible for and the business logic
of your application you don't
necessarily want or even if that if both
is you and one day you will one hat and
the other day where the other had you
don't want to easily be able to like
destroy everything when some when you
just click a button but that's easily
possible from if you work with atoms and
swap something and then do something
wrong and so I came up with different
different architecture here so here i
have the application stage here's a
communicator and component that receives
data from the server side over WebSocket
connection and then forwards that data
to this to this state component here
this state component all the logic for
changing the state inside purification
is handled in here but there's no reason
you will need to have one of those who
can have 10 of those on a larger to
patient doesn't really matter it's only
a matter of of routing that but for
every aspect of the application i would
suggest only having one specialized
component for having interstate and then
i broadcast the state and i don't hand
out an atom that can be changed at all
to the different components but accept
them instead whenever anything changes
in that baby model and I published that
as as a message that contains the state
at that time and considering that it's
an immutable data structure I can just
share freely without a problem and then
in these different components that just
subscribe to this like 2gb channel basis
that something has changed they can
update their own internal state but
whatever they do with that doesn't
matter because it's not the state of the
world anymore it was just a snapshot of
the state at the time when this
broadcast
and then whenever you want to send
anything back like the commands of the
server like some kind of like a search
or something and there's a channel for
that again I'm a about there where I put
on my message that is his face and then
I send it back here and some of these
may affect a change here others are
forwarded to the server but I really
have to care about all of that when I'm
dealing with the UI component I know
that hey there's someone somewhere is
going to respond to this to this kind of
message so I just send it and that's it
so this is the whole thing that's
probably be very difficult to look at
especially at that resolution you can
see a little bit on a 4k screen but not
not really here mm-hmm so another thing
that I developed and let me show that in
action and the cause of all these these
explorations and I thought that it was
particularly when you don't have types
and you don't know how a particular
datum looks like and it's going to be
interesting to see how it looks like and
to have a way of looking at that and
logging it to the console is kind of
painful because like every single time
you want a different thing then you go
back to the code you change it you
compile it and that it's a huge waste of
time and so I thought why not have a way
to print that to a browser and so I'm in
this case I have different kinds of
messages that are put on two channels em
in this application it's just a sample
application works equally well with the
other applications just a library when
you don't lock but you say inspect
that's the only difference and that
thing fires up a web server that will
then allow you to subscribe to those
messages but
it's not unbounded like I can say okay
give me the next ten or a hundred of
whatever is active here but no more than
that and here you can see that this
every millisecond message that is
produced by many go blocks at the same
time I have 20,000 messages going
through that system per second of the
every millisecond kind of message or two
hundred thousand ten seconds here and it
doesn't really matter that thing is
running by myself and it probably takes
like twenty percent of a single call or
something so it's kind of powerful that
this whole um caressing thing is really
powerful and then what I'm doing here to
inspect the data flowing through the
system is I printed out the name of that
library that does color coded printing
it it allows you to to pass to pass a
data structure and then either print it
in a color-coded way to the console or
you can also create HTML HTML then it's
just another data kind of data or
another data structure that you can pass
into hiccup and then over a WebSocket
connection I i pass i pass the hiccup to
the client and here i can inspect the
the different message types so that
makes the whole the whole debugging
workflow a little simpler and uh huh
I've got a couple of minutes and yeah
let's see what kind of code do you all
want to look at we want to look at any
code right now on the only 40 minutes in
yeah let's have a look at some some
client side code how that looked like
with the hiccup that
that I mentioned so this is a tweet
tweet consists of a couple of of things
actually let's look at the application
quickly running mmm my first wife as
those phone yeah whatever that's
something let's look at that in a second
okay um so here I have a couple of
hiccup elements and let's see for
example here i have a list of of those
tweets that you saw on that screen shot
earlier and what I do here is that for
tea in those in those tweets I'm gonna
render those sweet view components these
are reagent components and then inside
these components you can interchangeably
use actual Dom elements like divorce and
or whatever and or you can use your own
components and that way you can take the
whole problem apart and say okay I have
this building block here i have another
building block somewhere else and I put
those together create a list of those or
I have an image view that contains well
an image and it's clickable to provide a
link or something like that so for every
little thing like that and you create a
component and with hiccup inside and
that you can always come pie
with your own component so that that
makes it quite quite beautiful and for
the for subscribing to those state
changes who knows what a goal loopers go
look okay not if you know and so and the
gold is kind of like the main building
block for processing data inside the
channel so in caressing and what you
have and is this unit of this processing
unit and that we have here which is
called a goal loop and this go loop and
allows you to subscribe to a channel and
whenever data comes in from that channel
and it takes that data of that message
off of that channel in this case I
deconstruct that this vector that I know
is on there into one element that I'd
know which is this one here I don't care
about that only the type but in this
case I know what the type of that
channel is and then I take the state
snapshot then I can do a couple of
things with that with that immutable
data structure that I receive here and
then I receive my local application here
reset my local application state for
this food component and then in this
case I wait a little bit to be a control
back to the browser's event loop and
then I just weaker and wait for the next
one wait for the next one and every
single time there's something new comes
in this one we processed here and then
also there's another concept that's used
to and that's the so called sliding
buffer and mmm the sliding buffer makes
this whole thing run fast because you
can have a lot of you can have a lot of
and state changes and
when you pass the last ten twenty
thousand tweets or something because
every single time quite a few steps are
involved every single one of them would
trigger the wood to the trigger this
state change broadcast but I don't have
to process any all of those because
whenever i have something older than the
last one I can just block those and
that's what the sliding buffer does
sliding buffer of size one year and just
allows me to always keep the latest
version and everything else is just
going to be thrown away and then cleaned
up by the garbage collector in the
JavaScript engine well there's really
having it would probably take like two
hours to go through the entire code and
it's not going to be possible to do this
year but I think there's they're quite
because I'm running into the same
problems and again and again when
building some kind of a screening system
and let me just show you something
quickly that I've been working on
recently and it's kind of like the same
problem but from school I have a
WebSocket connection to a server side
and in this case I want to load I want
to load up an alien patient to kind of
like passed the mark of the Dom that
that thing has generated with the goal
to eventually migrate back to approach
the script and what I'm doing here i'm
going to send a message over WebSocket
connection to a server and that thing is
going to fire of selenium you didn't
really see it was really fast and and
pass the dawn of of that page and then
show you okay so this was the whole HTML
that I've just seen most of that I
probably won't need but what was
happening in the main diff ok hello Jane
Doe is not going to be very interesting
but if you have a more complicated
application and that's what I'm working
on right now is it may be useful when
you want to migrate away from something
like angular and me do one more time
it's going to fire fire fox there
somewhere general if a really short and
and then i can just inspect that your
eyes it's where i've shown you earlier
it's the same application just use in a
different way but those building blocks
and i find that i wanted to use all the
time but there are no good building
blocks for that yet but that is
certainly something i'm going to explore
over the next couple of weeks also for
the current project and that's going to
be available on github pretty soon so if
you have some kind of problem but like
that it may be worth looking at that ok
so yeah this is it for today and if you
have any questions please let me know
and also at the party can definitely
have to appear to get them suddenly
looking forward to that yes
I'm not completely convinced about that
because with storm you have this do
topologies six months what you will
start up and I would it to be more
flexible in terms of creating new
connections from the client side and
have like hundreds of them that are
completely different at the same time so
yeah a look at strong but it wasn't
quite flexible enough for me here the
only time
i'm using a component still and I'm not
completely convinced about the benefit
versus boilerplate thing because it does
add a certain amount of I when I look at
all those different server components I
see like the same thing over and over
over again and I was thinking about
probably either hiding that no macro or
function that does all that for me that
we only have like the the channels as as
an argument and maybe some format cloth
or something like that but all I might
get rid of that all together annoyed I'm
5050 I'd say yeah and let's face again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
