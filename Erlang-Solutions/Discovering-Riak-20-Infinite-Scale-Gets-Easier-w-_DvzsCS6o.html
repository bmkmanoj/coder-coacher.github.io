monthly webinar my name is Logan
militias I'm the VP for the Emir region
here at airline solutions today's
webinar represents a continuation of a
series of webinars we are organizing
across topics of interest in the world
of Erlang and dealing with solutions
based on the line language now our topic
today will be dealing with react
specifically the no sequel distributed
key value database and as many of you
will know react has emerged from the
ideas laid out in the dynamo paper which
itself inspired a number of no sequel on
database solutions now react has proven
very capable indeed across industries
and its target use cases and has most
recently experienced the wide adoption
across financial services online retail
healthcare betting and gaming and many
other sectors large users of react today
include the NHS companies such as bet365
rovio and many others but as with any
live event please excuse any technical
issues that we may face today now to
start by telling you a bit about Erlang
solutions I'll briefly say debris are a
products in services orientated company
completely devoted to the ER line
programming language we started in 1999
and we've since worked with
organisations and individuals using
Erlang helping them evolve the language
and supporting people in businesses
using it nowadays we have just over 100
people across our offices in London
Stock own crack OH Budapest Seattle and
Buenos Aires and working on projects
across the globe we are equally very
keen on creating value and competitive
advantage for our customers across
industries and really in all areas where
lying as a language makes sense we are
equally ambitious in development of
airline based products and we work to
create lasting partnerships with our
customers as you may imagine I'm really
pleased to say that we have two speakers
joining us today in whom we have
carefully selected as best invited to
tell you about react and in particular
its newly launched two points over
firstly men and marshall the managing
director of Basha linea will start us
off with an introduction to the show
secondly we are really privileged to
have Tyler Hammond the technical
marketing director at Vassar as our main
speaker both mono and Tyler have spent
years in the North sequel space and can
relate the fine-grained detail of the
intricacies of react the many benefits
of the 2.0 version and what that means
towards react target use cases now
please allow me to finish by saying you
are most welcome to post questions
throughout the duration of the webinar
by using the chat facility our speakers
Manu and Tyler will answer as many
questions as time allows at the end of
the webinar if any questions do go
unanswered you're welcome to raise them
by email using the following address
webinar at airline hyphen solutions com
if you're interested in learning more
about reactive window or wish to
establish whether it may be a solution
for the challenges your own business may
be facing then please feel free to
contact us and we will be glad to
discuss I would now like to hand over to
man who will be glad to start us off
thank you very much madam and a good
afternoon everybody so my name is many
Michelle and the managing director for
bio technologies in Europe Middle
Eastern Africa I'm really pleased to be
here on this webinar today as Madonna
introduced we're going to cover the
latest release of reacted to the two
with Tyler presenting this before that a
quick word about besho as a company the
company was created in 2008 and
currently has a little bit of a hundred
employees around the world our
headquarters are in seattle in the
united states or co engineering office
or distributed around the world but we
seems to have a cluster of people around
cambridge on the east coast of the state
our European headquarters are in London
where we get a team of close to 15
people now and we also have offices in
Tokyo we are perfectly suited to provide
critical services to our customer
the world with 24 by 7 30 minute
response time for all that it the show
was created to address the needs of
customers needing very reliable
available on scalable data platforms
today react which is an open source
product addresses these needs and blood
and mentioned a couple of our customers
in the emea region one is the NHS the
National Health Services in the UK to me
the NHS demonstrate very well why people
care about react and why they would
consider react over traditional
relational database when you talk about
the NHS you're talking about storing
patients records and the NHS them self
described it as life or death data data
that cannot get from data that cannot be
lost where each and every single right
must be accepted and traditionally that
has been the real of relational database
but react as one of this new new
generation of distributed database as
mature enough that we can now address
critical use cases such as the one of
the NHS today customers turn to react
when they have a critical data needs
such as the NHS but equally in the
financial world in the gaming and
gambling world in the telco world all
these organizations are now turning to
react to achieve very high scalability
and availability at a fraction of the
cost that they could with traditional
database that's a very quick
introduction and I'd like now to hand
over to Tyler we tell you all about
react and most importantly or US release
react to data which was released in
September excellent Thank You MA I
appreciate that introduction so if
entitled the first webinar in this
series of webinars about react 20
infinite scale gets easier and at first
glance that might be the kind of message
that makes you turn your head a little
bit sideways and perhaps
it should because the reality is that in
database marketing we hear terms like
one hundred percent uptime and infinite
scale and online arguments about sequel
versus no sequel versus new sequel and
people talking about living in a
nanosecond world but the reality is
we're all deploying databases to meet a
specific business need and that business
need lies somewhere in between the
requirements of scalability up time
availability speed and style of
deployment so abasa when we talk about
rioc or when we talk about rioc CS
instead of talking about no sequel or
uptime or scale we talk about
distributed systems but why distributed
systems the reality is that everything
works at small scale that's the beauty
of of computing is that at smaller
scales things work great but the
challenge lies in scaling out whether
that's up or down both predictably and
linearly if I get a known number of
operations per second at five servers in
a note or five nodes in a cluster I want
to get that same linear progression if I
add 10 nodes instead we know that things
work at small scale but what happens
when something goes wrong as our data
set and as our requirements begin to
grow we need to understand the realities
around server network or data center
failures and ultimately I think the one
thing that all of us can agree on is
that the customer experience matters and
data locality enables data operations to
be close to the end user so the way that
I like to think about that is that when
you have a tool or a solution that is
solving the needs of developers of
operations meeting customers
expectations and you know ultimately
people are able to sell it because at
some point we are all indeed in sales
that is something that's compelling it's
something that will make
your customers happy that's a
distributed system so that in mind why
rioc so this is of course an update
about react to point 0 so maybe many of
you on the call are familiar with what
react is but i'm going to give you just
a brief overview of of why we consider
react one of the best distributed
databases there is and really we tend to
group those into these five categories
the things that matter about react is
its low latency its availability
characteristics especially during times
of failure which leads to its fault
tolerance and all of those are great but
unless it's also operationally simple to
utilize it's somewhat meaningless to
have a database that's very fast if you
can't run it and then react is also
eminently scalable so what do we feel
makes rioc unique it's built with a
highly available architecture that
enables any node to service redirect
quests requests rioc is masterless the
great part about that is that there is
no single point of failure in that
scenario you're able to round robin
requests to any node in the cluster and
get the answer back whether that's a get
or put a read or write you don't have to
worry about a single coordinating node
or a master node it easily scales and
expands we've talked briefly and I
mentioned the scalability characteristic
of react being something that's quite
important you're able to to scale react
simply by adding additional commodity
hardware whether that be a instance in a
cloud service provider or whether that
be physical hardware and react because
of its ability to scale is able to
handle really very impressive amounts of
data and then ultimately we also provide
react CS react and react csr both built
on the same platform which allows for
multi-model support rioc CS is an object
storm that's s3 compatible and so i'm
able to have a key value store and an
object store from the same platform so
that in mind why react 20
what were we setting out to achieve when
we built a new version of react so react
20 is designed to provide application
developers enhanced usability and
scalability for faster development of
these highly available globally scalable
applications while ensuring operational
simplicity this was a big release for
basho this is a release that we put a
substantial amount of time and effort
into and what we came up with was really
five key areas where we've made updates
to what react is and what react does the
first is in react search the second is
three off data types we've changed our
security subsystem we've added some
operational enhancements and we've built
in some tiered storage capability i'm
going to talk through each of these in
some measure of detail so as i said one
of the first and perhaps one of the
coolest i think things that we've done
is is we've changed the way that we've
done react search entirely so in react
20 react search combines the
characteristics that we expect from
react with the powerful search
functionality of apache solr so if
you're not familiar with solar solar is
an outgrowth of the the lucene project
it's an open-source capability what
we've done is we've actually integrated
that tightly with react and that allows
for distributed scalable transparent
indexing and querying of react data
values so you can build solar queries
just like you're used to building solar
queries you can use tools that talk to
the solar API when it's appropriate and
you can get that same rich full text
search capability that's offered from
solar with the availability fault
tolerance and operational simplicity
characteristics of rioc we support
multiple languages geospatial search
analyzers tokenizer filters pretty much
the various types that you would expect
for automatic data extraction you can
actually write your own custom extractor
as well if you have a binary type that
you're storing in react that's unique to
you but why would I want to use react
search over just solar by itself one of
challenges in distributed search
particularly distributed full-text
search is keeping the indices up to date
in reacts search we've actually
integrated react and solar tightly
enough that react search listens for
changes in the kv data and then makes
the changes to the solar indices if
you're familiar with the react active
anti entropy mechanism we use that same
mechanism that we use to heal data
that's at rest to update indexes that
have been built in search so there is no
more manual index maintenance which if
you've done solar deployments in the
past may be quite onerous and so it
keeping with that theme of operational
simplicity we've built that in to react
search I talked earlier about how react
is masterless if my key value stores
master list but my search mechanism
isn't masterless I'm going to have to
make some very very tough trade-offs
around availability like do I want
search to not be highly available in my
in my application we've actually taken
react search and because it runs on each
node in the cluster we convert a query
that appears on any node into a solar
distributed search which means that my
search is distributed which means that
if I lose a node that's probably okay
because I've got the data that's stored
in react in the other nodes and as my
indices update I'll be able to speak to
those other nodes and pull back that day
of a solar distributed search similarly
we also take index creation commands and
disseminate that information throughout
the entirety of the cluster and react
search actually communicates and
monitors the solar OS process so it
really is a tight integration rather
than saying hey take a search utility
and stand it alongside of react we've
coupled the two very tightly to provide
for those characteristics that are
expected from rioc from react search so
with that in mind we thought
a little bit about what's perhaps my
next favorite thing which are rioc data
types so I think it's always good to
understand new offerings from the
perspective of a customer as we looked
at data types with Tapjoy they said and
this is a quote the new advanced data
types in react to point o are a game
changer for us because it makes it
simple for us to manage our data model
at scale that supports over a billion
devices all around the world but what r
react data types if you watched any of
the footage that was from recon this
year and if you haven't I encourage you
to go to recon dot iori co n io it's
bashers distributed systems conference
for developers there's a wealth of
amazing content both technical and
academic combining academia and industry
and one of the topic spaces that came up
frequently was this idea of what are
called crd tease sometimes you'll hear
these referred to as commutative
replicated data types or convergent
replicated data types or conflict free
replicated data types I tend to think of
them as conflict free but the thing
that's most important is replicated data
types so a rioc data type is a
distributed data type that lets you
track an update or helps you pardon me
track an update and eventually
consistent environment for those of you
who are on the phone who are familiar
with eventual consistency i think you'll
see the value of this really quickly for
those of you who may not be as familiar
one of the things that's necessary in a
world of distributed systems and scale
out environments is that I have to make
trade-offs between consistency models
you're very interested in this you can
read up on what's known as the cap
theorem from from Eric Brewer from
google dr. eric brewer but the cap
theorem basically says that in the
presence of a network partition i need
to make a trade-off decision between
strong consistency what you may think of
as acid transactions and eventual
consistency where there's a possibility
that if I went to read my right I may be
reading an old piece of data until
that data propagates around the system
now that's in the case of the network
partition you can think of this or sort
of Reason about this as being a simple
counter if I a counter on one side of a
network partition and I'm incrementing
my counter and I have a counter on the
other side of a network partition
remember these two sides of the clusters
can't speak to each other and I begin to
decrement that counter when the
partition is healed what do I do with
those two values in the past bachelet
always said your data is opaque to us
your data is opaque on disk and you will
have to build your own client-side
resolution logic and in some cases
that's still a very valid and a very
useful answer but first introduced in
rioc 14 as counters react 20 adds sets
flags registers and maps which enable
you to use these pre-built data types
without building client-side resolution
logic we've done that for you that's
exposed directly through the reup data
types API let's look at these data types
in a little bit greater detail counters
are very simple as a simple use case of
a counter you could reason the idea of
tracking the number of page luxe as you
click like the the number increases and
maybe they unlike and that would
decrease the counter or a number of
followers the next data type is called a
flag flags are either enabled or
disabled you can think of that as
something very simple like has this
tweet been retweeted by clicking the
retweet button I start a series of logic
one of which could very well be enabling
the flag that says this has been
retweeted another example would be is
this usable user pardon me eligible for
preferred pricing do I want to flag this
user record as being eligible for
preferred pricing then there are sets
select sets are just a collection of
binary values that could be a list of
items in the shopping cart the unique
identifier the users friend in the
social networking app registers are our
named binary where the value is also
binary so I could use this to store user
profile names
I could store a primary search location
for search engine user and then perhaps
the most powerful of the data types is
maps and maps allow me to nest multiple
data types together so I could store an
entire user profile in a map where the
register is the username the flag is has
this user received email recently in a
counter is a site visit so you can take
ok I get some of the use cases for data
types but the importance of data types
as I explained at the beginning is that
data types have built-in conflict
resolution so I'm going to walk you
actually through what the conflict
resolution for each of these is so
counters in one for each actor keeps an
independent count for both increments
and decrements and upon merge the
pairwise maximum of any of those two
actors will win so if one counter holds
172 and the other holdings 173 1 73 wins
that's the default resolution behavior
for a flag it's enable wins over
disabled some people call this flag wins
four sets if an element is added and
removed the ad will win for a register
the most chronologically recent value
based on timestamps wins and four maps
right it depends a bit on how they're
all tied together but ultimately if a
field is concurrently added or updated
and removed the add or update will win
we'll be talking about react data types
in greater detail in a future webinar
just wanted to give you a brief overview
of what they are and how they work
they're very powerful because no longer
is your data opaque to rioc we've
provided pre-built data types that allow
you to model your application domain in
more richer ways without having to logic
around conflict resolution in react 20
we've also enhanced security so often
the story around security with react if
you're familiar or you've read our
documentation or you've talked to us in
the past was put your database behind a
firewall and that's still very true put
your
database behind a firewall but Basha
works with one-third of the fortune 50
those are our customers we work with the
the smallest of startups to the largest
of enterprises and in all of those
scenarios we had questions around
security and while it is still important
put your database behind a firewall in
react 20 we've introduced authentication
and authorization authentication very
simple it's the verification of a user
identity this ties into param systems it
can be Keys you could look at it with
certificates you could use user pass
combos authorization then is the
verification that a user or a group of
users has the right to access data or to
perform certain functions so react
administrators can actually grant
permissions to aux access modified
delete objects to change bucket
properties to run MapReduce jobs that
could be a very heavy load that I may
want to limit who has the capability to
do that we'll continue to explore and
expand our security story over time but
it was important that we add
authentication authorization some Pam
capability so that you can integrate it
into the system of record that's true
for you as an enterprise and we've done
that in react to point 0 as the direct
technical marketing I'm definitely a
biased voice when they speak about react
but one of the things that I find most
compelling about react is its ease of
operations there's nothing greater from
either when I'm working on a case study
and one of our customers said oh yeah we
used to have um alerts set up so that
when a system died in our sharded
traditional relational database
environment someone would get up that
get a pager that figure out which
replica said had failed they'd make sure
the master was back up and then they'd
go to bed but with react we just changed
our alerts to send us an email and we
handle it in the morning because react
keeps running if there is nothing that
we do better one of the things that's
incredibly powerful about react is that
Mabel's your operational team to sleep
and it enables them to do that at
impressive scale so keeping with that
theme in react 20 we've actually changed
the way that we do configuration
management no one wants to read nested
Erlang tuples syntax at the command line
in a config file so we've actually
changed our configuration file in its
entirety to an easy to parse transparent
format it enables simpler integration
with the automation framework of your
choice if you're a chef fan or a puppet
user or you're rolling your own scripts
if you are doing DevOps style automation
and infrastructure management then you
probably want config files that you can
easily logic about that's what the new
config files look like all the
configuration settings except for
replication which is part of the react
enterprise offering are stored in the
real calm it gives you the ability to
run simple commands like react check
config effective and it will tell you
what your current effective
configuration is you can get information
about any of the configuration settings
directly from the command line it's
substantially easier to use and easier
to reason about react to point o tiered
storage this is actually very
interesting if you're not familiar react
has the option for pluggable backends so
we can have level DV which is a
log structure storage or big task which
is great if your entire key set fits in
memory and you're interested in
expiration or the memory back end which
actually doesn't do any disk persistence
react 20 with the level DP back back end
we've actually provided for tiered
storage capability so leveldb
automatically identifies frequently
accessed information it places it in a
higher level you're familiar with the
structure of a level dbstyle system
you'll know what i mean when I'm talking
about level 0 and level 1 with tiered
storage though we actually provide the
ability in mashes version of level b day
for you to split data files across to
mount points with differing i/o
performance so I may for example have
frequently updated and modified read
sets of data that are in higher levels
and I want to store those on something
that's slightly more performant and I'm
willing to store a less frequently
accessed data on traditional spinning
rust versus flash say the result of this
though is what really matters which is
consistent more consistent ninety-nine
point nine percent tile latency when
you're reading recently written data or
when you're modifying an existing data
so the user can actually configure when
to cut over the data from the faster to
the slower mount based on the level that
that data lives up and then leveldb just
handles the rest for you so that mind I
think it's important to understand a few
things about react often when I speak to
the presser to analyst they asked me so
what verticals do you work with react is
actually a horizontal solution so we see
customers in the media like the weather
company and say a massive data explosion
is at the center of our growth strategy
rioc is a critical component of our new
IT platform they're ingesting terabytes
of data daily that's more of a media
company we see similar stories from the
NHS and others in health care from to
metra in utilities which can also be
considered an Internet of Things style
deployment with their Wireless meter
readers from social deployments from web
companies from gaming companies anywhere
where availability scalability fault
tolerance and operational simplicity
matter react could be a very good fit in
react 20 we've continued to simplify
this by adding a snoo search capability
which is solar alongside react and
without actually managing the solar
process and simplifying index creation
and index distribution which is the
hardest part of any distributed search
offering we've done this with react data
types which allow react to handle the
complex conflict resolution that occurs
for a broader variety of data types but
also provides engineers and developers
the ability to reason about their data
domain in a more rich way than they
could have in the past we've done it by
changing our configuration subsystem by
adding security capabilities by adding
additional capabilities like tiered
storage by bucket types etc react to
point o was was many months nearly a
year in the making and we're quite proud
of the capability excellent point now
where either mono or myself would be
happy to take and answer any questions
you may have ok kyla thank you for that
I do have to apologize to the audience
we've had our fair share of technical
issues like I said Tyler speaking to us
directly from the states the session is
live so these kind of things happen I am
glad to say however that react is far
more consistent than the internet
connection that we've enjoyed in this
occasion so but with with that in mind
we have had and thank you for that a
number of questions coming from the
audience during Tyler's and man who's
deliberation on react two point oh and
given the time that has run out and the
few minutes we have available i'd just
like to try and get through as many of
those questions as we can
so the first question that we have here
comes from Richard and Richard is asking
a question it's quite quite common I
think to a number of businesses is
basically saying you know we have many
many different databases in our company
already and giving examples of war a
Cold ms sequel teradata Hadoop so the
question is you know why bring in
another database why sort of further
dilute that picture and bring in another
data store option so try going mano if
you'd like to comment on that please do
yes I'm happy to take that one levin n
so Richard this is a you're right this
is a very common question we get with
all of our customers and if you think
for example with the NHS who were I mean
they're like any organization they're
using a very large number of data
repositories or data platforms of
databases in that case Oracle was one of
the main one the reason why they decided
to switch is because of the cost cost of
licenses was the primary driver and they
were trying to reduce costs and the
second one is they were trying to reduce
operational costs so in decades they had
dozens of oracle database of separate
servers running various parts of the NHS
services whether i ate doctors reports
or prescriptions or patients record and
because all of these database were
existing as individual entities that men
also they had a lot of ETL processes
expert correspondent load processes
between this database to try to
synchronize some of the data which added
to the complexity and added to the
overall cost so by migrating to react
where they deployed one very large
cluster of more than 100 node they
basically managed to reduce all the
operational costs by reducing the number
of people that would be involved in
operating the cluster if you clear 100
cluster requires only one person whereas
if you had dozens of Oracle databases
you pray end up with dozens of database
administrators that's one cut the other
one is all the ETL that was being
managed by separate products and
separate systems and separate server is
gone because now all these e TL happens
inside react at another massive win but
more importantly I can relate the story
of some of the investment banks that
took two recently and a lot of people
have that same concern of wire
introducing new technology and
especially a database where typically
relational database the de facto
standard and that investment bank at one
of the Tier one investment bank did a
study of trying to understand how many
of their applications actually require a
relational database with acid
transactions and they discover that only
ten percent of all their use cases
require relational as the transactional
use cases and that all the rest could be
served by the new generation of
databases that are far more
cost-effective that scale much better
they require much less operationally
thought to run and again that relates to
cost cost reduction but also click
community okay thank you for that man
who Tyler did you want to comment on
that at all no we we may have lost Tyler
so we'll just move on to the second
question whilst we re-establish that
connection so we have an interesting
question in regards to the CAC fearing
and the difference between react 2.0 and
react 1.4 so the question is basically
does react to point o try to please too
many people by offering configurability
on eventual consistency in order to sort
of silence the critics of eventual
consistency now how could you
comment on that yes absolutely that's a
very interesting comment you're right
with the cap theorem what it's a
defective Lee is you can't have
consistency availability as well tour
around sue partition you can only have
two of the three react by default with
it's difficult on isn't available and
publishing foreign system and its
eventually consistent so you trading of
consistency but in react to were
increasing new mechanisms to allow you
to write in a strong consistent manner
to react so whereby you're quite happy
to trade up a little bit of availability
or maybe a little bit of partition
veterans which constancy we offer that
availability know the facility now but
it becomes particularly useful is if you
want for example to deal with user
profiles or user account or shopping
baskets or for example bedding said are
you you want to make sure that example
if your data user password you want to
make sure that our squad is being
updated and there's no there's no to
version of it the consistency is
critical there another all use cases as
I mentioned just before that's all use
cases not all data interaction requires
consistency so you get you know in all
occasions you're going to cases where
most of the days I can be treated with
eventual consistency but there's a few
ademas where you require consistency and
react is kind of becoming or is able to
cover more and more of the use cases
that were reserved for relational as its
compliance databases we're really happy
and really excited with react too
because it means one more users and more
and more people can use it for use cases
that they couldn't before therefore
benefit from all the availability and
roper low operational cost of react
classic Thank You vana for that comment
now here's another interesting question
and one that we I guess in the world of
databases here a lot in terms of various
database options so what specifically
being asked is how would you compare
react and mongodb and the fact that many
companies find Mongo very easy to start
with a good point we often you know will
often being asked these kind of
questions I think some people came up of
someone came up with the new SQL term
which in a way it is a great term to
describe the new generation of databases
the one that were based on the principle
that you don't necessarily need
relational and acid and transactional
for everything Mongo is I would describe
it as the one that tried to address the
simple low scale type of you skate which
in all fairness represent ninety percent
of the use cases and it is true that
MongoDB is an incredibly user-friendly
developer-friendly database but Mongo
was never built for scale and if you
look at the on the spectrum react e on
the opposite of that react was built for
variability and scale first and foremost
and or a lot of businesses with critical
needs availability they wouldn't try to
availability and scalability for
anything else even for developer
friendliness so I think we see a lot of
people are realizing that the
variability and scalability is very
important to them and therefore we
select free our de facto or they may
start with Mongo because of the appeal
of for for developers and then may one
day and for having a need for scale and
realize that maybe it's a bit harder
than they thought with Uncle and maybe
look at react in which case we would be
more
happy to help me Thank You Man oh I
think that that sort of settles the
question to be honest another question
it's really interesting and I do
apologize we are receiving a flurry of
questions now that the webinar has sort
of ended and we won't be able to answer
all of them but we will try and honor as
many of them as we can so moving on
quickly to the next one alexandra is
asking can you say something about the
latencies so specifically they have a
situation where they have 10 nodes and
one of the nodes updates some entities
that then need to be replicated to all
the other nodes so he's asking can you
comment in terms of Layton sees in you
got react ok it sprays to to type of
latency we need to talk about one is the
latency for the end user so how could he
can they access and rich with data all
right data and the other one is latency
for replicating data in the back end so
on the first one react was designed to
be a very low low latency system there's
a number of mechanisms that were put in
place to achieve that both within an
internal disturb also between data
center so Tyler I mentioned mushy data
center replication rare can be deployed
across multiple data center and ensure
that data would be replicated between
each data center so you can have local
availability of your data this is
extremely important for companies like
gaming companies review the makers of
the angry birds games the most popular
game on mobile phones Rovio is deployed
in mutable data centers to ensure that
they can offer the flu latency access to
the data and this is quite a common
scenarios for reaching data center
deployments you and the other type of
latency is how quickly data gets
replicated in the back end once you
write it and here even though reacted
and eventually consistent system with
the king of latency of mini second
before the data gets replicated if you
know if the network works and if things
are fine which I came just many seconds
before all the data is replicated
correctly now in cases weather doesn't
work because there's a network partition
react as a number of mechanisms in place
to ensure that data will eventually we
get eventually replicated or get a
number of self healing mechanisms to
ensure that as well which means again
that it makes react very operational
friendly debate Thank You Man to sort of
quickly move on to the next question now
we have the salt asking is react using
connected airline notes or hidden nodes
with l dash connected underscore all
false option so just repeat that is
react using connected airline nodes or
hidden nodes with all connected all
false option that's a good question but
not one I would be able to enter on the
spot so I don't know if title if you're
on the line if not a proposed that we
can get back to this we will need more
salt result with the answer or send you
answer to him in some way so just to try
and sort of answer a couple of other
questions so Ruiz asking a question that
I think many of our audience will want
to know who specifically asking is there
a book or good technical material to
help us in learning correctly react
capabilities and you know generally to
sort of start with react and you know
live with it with it day to day
obviously there's the little react book
but manage would you have any other
suggestions no I think the retail react
work is I personally consider eight the
Bible it it's a great great book to get
started and understand all the concepts
of fundamental concepts that are behind
that I'm making react buddy it also to
get from 0 to 6
or your route 100 if you too can kill
metafile I would strongly suggest that
they really read that book it doesn't
take too much you can go over it in one
day all we can you get plenty of
hands-on experience exercise so my
advice is don't go too far go to www
that the retail react boob gun now you
can download your PDF version from there
okay well the the question sort of keep
pouring in but i must say that we have
time foot at the most two questions and
i'll quickly ask the first one so we
have a question what tools are there to
help in detecting bottlenecks and or
wrong configuration issues in react very
good question so 32 or while a number of
ways of dealing with that one reacting
to two number of monitoring tools or
troubleshooting tools a lot of customers
used the standard oops tools like nagios
or graphite too many they'll react so
react exposes Rick especially react
enterprise exposes all the metrics that
you would care about but also would
definitely recommend for people to get
one bar which is a product that's being
developed by alaing solution and maybe
not then if you want to give Eddie could
be of another view on one bath and what
it by yeah I'll tell you very briefly so
mano i think is completely right to sort
of the you know direct is toward one
batter we here at airline solutions have
recently developed a operations and
maintenance they have what you call
wombats Oh a.m. and it is effectively a
tool born out of our customers telling
us for years now you know they lack
visibility into their o-line nodes in
clusters and we've obviously reacted to
that by saying well you know we'll
develop a technology that nowadays
collects just over 100 pieces of
individual metrics across the nodes and
the cluster raises alarms post
notifications helps you or
straight helps you deploy code one that
is currently in its 1.2 guys and you can
find further information on our line
hyphen solutions.com website so it's
definitely worth seeing and in terms of
further information on one bar please
contact us send me an email as you can
see on the slide on the bottom of the
slide that you're currently seeing and
i'll be happy to provide further
information alternatively we have had a
webinar on one box so on our website you
can just go to the recording of that
webinar and get some extensive detail on
one but no thank you for that one final
question I would ask and that's all that
the time will allow one of our audience
is asking why did you choose so large
specifically for react to point out a
good question and one that we will open
get that when we started looking at
improving search in Ryoga two years ago
at the time and still to this day in
fact so I was by far the most widely
used edited search engine on the planet
still is the one that has the wireless
community and the widest number of
deployments in large enterprise so from
our point of view it was perfectly the
right move to go and supports at all
because it had the strongest level of
adoption I secure that in the last
couple years another search engine
called elastic search has gathered a lot
of media attention and press attention
and a lot of adoption it's a great tool
gets a lot of very interesting benefit
or features that the robbers in this
area have and frankly it's not a very
impossible that we may look at the
sporting a elastic search as well but
today we sort of integrated into react
to the zoo we offer very strong not only
search engine but a search engine also
thing of a search engine is to count the
number of occurrences of world it's also
a very powerful analytical tool for
analyzing streams of data so we're quite
excited about introducing surrounding
reacted at all Thank You Manuel and
unfortunately that's the last question
we could have formally given the time
remaining I would just say that we here
at Erlang solutions are equally
enthusiastic about react for each
specific use case because it simply
proven through industry applications
it's it's significant capabilities now
I'm sure you will all join me in
thanking manner and Tyler for a very
inspiring talk on react to point o our
apologies for the technical difficulties
we've encountered with the live
broadcast but hopefully the Q&amp;amp;A session
made up for some of that many thanks to
all of you in the audience who have
joined us for the webinar please join us
again for our next month's webinar which
will be advertised shortly following
today we will send you a short survey to
make sure we capture your feedback on
today's webinar and please also know
that we will try and make the recording
of the webinar available on our website
and obviously try and sort of rectify
the issues that we've had by possibly re
recording the webinar itself and then
posting in or on our website which is
www.hyken.com thank you all once again
and we look forward to seeing you on our
next webinar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
