solutions webinar my name is madame
Alexis and I'm the VP for the AMIA
region here at Lang solutions today's
webinar represents a continuation of a
series of webinars we have been running
across topics of interest in the world
of Erlang and elixir and dealing with
solutions based on these programming
languages on this particular occasion we
will be hearing about video video
communication platform as a service
which is aimed at providing high quality
video chat api's now with the help of
video developers can easily embed
multi-party video into their own mobile
web or desktop applications quickly and
seamlessly and most importantly with no
prior video knowledge required as with
any live event if anything goes wrong
then please excuse us we'll try to
rectify any issues as the webinar
progresses but to start telling you a
bit about erlang solutions we are a
products and services orientated company
fully devoted to the Erlang and elixir
programming languages we work with
organizations and individuals using your
Erlang and elixir helping them evolve
these languages and supporting people
and businesses using these technologies
we are headquartered in London we have
offices in Stockholm Krakow Budapest San
Francisco and Buenos Aires our projects
span industries and the globe itself and
we develop Erlang and elixir based
products some of those include magnesium
our open source messaging platform that
will mention today wombat OEM which is
our monitoring and management technology
for Erlang and elixir systems and
megaload our load testing technology now
I'm really pleased to say that our
speakers today are Nicholas ray the
senior vice president of product
management at video and me he'll Starsky
the managing director of ESL Krakow
office who will tell us a bit more about
the challenges video faces and the
benefits it strives to provide please
allow me to finish by saying you are
most welcome to post questions
throughout the duration of the webinar
by using the chapter
available on the webinars interface our
speakers Nicholas + Michael will answer
as many questions as time allows at the
end of the webinar if any questions do
go unanswered then you're welcome to
raise them via email by using the
following address webinar at Erlang -
solutions comm now if you're interested
in learning a bit more about Erlang or
elixir or technologies based on these
languages then you're welcome to contact
myself directly my email address will be
available on these slides and following
today's presentation you can acquire
that as well now I would like to hand
over to Nikolas now who will be glad to
start the webinar off
thank you very much lady and thanks
thanks again for the opportunity to come
and speak with you or with your audience
about the video I a service and I hope
over the course of the next half an hour
we can you know tell you a little bit
about what we're doing from a from a
video a multiparty video collaboration
standpoint and why a mongoose I am and
more broadly erlang solutions were such
an important part of that that service
and getting that service to market so
really we we sort I mean we our history
as a company video Inc is is really
multi-party video collaboration we've
been around for just over ten years now
and we've been working on trying to
bring multi-party video collaboration to
desktops to Mobile's to all kinds of
form factors with the highest possible
quality over whatever networks you might
find yourself connected to they can be
very poor quality networks it can be
very um you know you know very high
bandwidth networks and we'll take
advantage of of both you know all forms
so some of the that I suppose the
important things just give a little more
background about video and in particular
our technology which is a nice way of
getting into the conversation around you
know why we need it why we needed to
work with something like Mongoose I am
we are we're specialists in video media
and and real-time video
kind of transport across networks so
being able to have multi-party video
across unreliable networks with low cost
and still be able to tolerate delay we
wanted to be able to scale massively we
need very very highly reliable
infrastructure and we and we now have a
global footprint the intent was to
create a global footprint many points of
presence multiple locations
you know we've got 10 or 15 different
points of presence at the moment and
that's going to expand over the coming
months so we knew that that was one of
the components that we needed to think
when we're building our next-generation
infrastructure we do a lot of work
around dynamic dynamic network
optimization so we we are very aware of
network resilience and doing things in
our protocol stack to be able to affect
network was earlier error resilience and
cover up errors where possible we do a
lot of improve it we kind of make
improvements to to the bandwidth
consumption of of streaming video using
some unique characteristics of our video
routers so we can if you like bundle up
multi-party streams and send them
between routers in efficient ways so if
you've got you know hundreds of hundreds
of perhaps even thousands of users in a
you know a given conference we're not
sending a full mesh of the media
everywhere so that's some capabilities
in our via router we optimize the
streams in real time the video router
does optimizes those streams in real
time based on the endpoints that people
are using so for instance there's no
point sending full 4k 60 frames of
resolution to a to a mobile device
because it's never going to have the
pixels to consume that so then we're
going to have the bandwidth to be able
to take that amount of bandwidth that
that kind of resolution but you know if
you're in a fancy boardroom in the
middle of Manhattan they've got you know
very high high resolution screens 4k
screens and a gorgeous camera and lots
of lots of bandwidth and maybe you know
in in that situation it makes sense to
send 4k and and very high frame rate in
terms of resolution so it's all about
trying to adapt the
multiparty video to the right the right
footprint and you know we spent a lot of
time thinking about optimizing for
exceptional quality over low bandwidth
and in terms of the endpoints that we
support as I mentioned all of the any
mobile kind of platform you can imagine
including you know Android on things
like x86 and unusual combination but
we're seeing you know seeing that occur
in various form factors so just about
any kind of platform we have very very
broad support for all sorts of different
endpoints and we support a range of
different multi codecs everything from
vp8 vp9 h.264 h.265 and all the kinds of
high quality video codecs that people
are using out there and you know it's a
it's a really really a very broad brush
service now why would you want to do
multi-party video conferencing while
video collaboration why is this you know
a useful thing to have and obviously
there is some obvious ones the obvious
one is this sort of the everyday office
collaboration you got just heard that
erlang solutions has offices dotted
across europe you know it would be you
know very useful for them to be able to
collaborate across those offices you
know in a sort of an easy-to-use desktop
mobile kind of form factor and that's
certainly some some use cases that we
see out there you know there are and we
have people who deploy our technology
for that purpose but it's it's really in
the last couple of years it's really
gotten much broader than that it's not
the general sort of offers collaboration
which is driving a lot of the demand a
lot of it's got to do with things like
customer engagement so things like being
able to have a live-video technical
support call so you you know your your
fridge or your washing machine is broken
you want to be able to get someone on a
video call to help you kind of step
through the that's sort of the
resolution of that problem or maybe it's
you know field services so you've got
someone working in the field on a jet
engine on or in an airport and they want
to be able to bring in three experts
from different locations and be able to
help them to troubleshoot a particular
technical challenge they're working
through we're seeing a lot of lot of
work in the financial services space
actually and there are some very large
banks across the globe that are
deploying our solution embedded in their
stock mobile applications so our client
libraries are embedded in their stock
application so that when you get into a
situation in your mobile banking that
you want to speak to a a an agent you
want to speak to someone who can can
help you through a may be a tricky
mortgage transaction or some sort of you
know high-value transaction you can
click the button you know in natively
inside that application and speak
reliably speak to an agent who is
empowered to help you through that
transaction and we're seeing a lot of
what Adam and you know rise in that
customer engagement space so that's
that's an exciting area of growth as I
mentioned fill services there's a lot of
work going on in an emergency response
field technician support remote
troubleshooting type type use cases lots
of work happening there there is
telehealth is another massive area so
obviously globally medicine with you
know in a lot of Western countries there
are aging populations health care in the
in the United States particularly is is
a constant topic of discussion
spiralling you know inspiring costs and
telehealth is the one of the I suppose
shining technology disruptors that we're
hoping we'll be able to drive
significant efficiencies in healthcare
and that's everything from comes in lots
of different forms as everything as
simple as you know logging into a
webpage swiping a credit card and
speaking to a GP is one form of
telehealth another one might be you know
in a hospital environment being able to
take advantage of distributed experts if
you've got someone who is an expert in a
particular kind of heart good cardio
issue then being able to bring them in
over a high quality connection can
really short circuit the the care and
and really improve the care that would
that hospitals and and other health care
providers are able to give their
patients so it's a that's a really
exciting area as well and then of course
is that the last one is the
collaboration which is sort of the it's
the the obvious one that we all think
about when we when we think about video
conferencing it's you know walking into
a conference room and and and bringing
in bringing in people having that
efficient conversation and driving the
business forward so given the ten-year
context that we're working in we've been
you know release a number of products
and SDKs and and and you know various
evolutions of our technology but the
most recent one is what we're calling
video i/o this was launched as a general
generally available option in January
and we're seeing some some wonderful
take up in the from the developer
community taking our video i/o service
and embedding it into their workflows
and video is it's a it's you know in
industry terms it's a C pairs it's a
communications platform as a service so
it's basically a set of client libraries
that you can very quickly download embed
into Android or iOS or Windows or a Mac
or a web app and then add high-quality
multi-party conversations very very
quickly into the workflow that you
already working working within so it's
not it's not like there's a completely
separate video app it's it's actually
embedded into the experience that that
you're actually you're working on today
so that could be healthcare records
applications it could be banking
applications like we I mentioned
previously there's a whole range of form
factors people are embedding this this
into so the design goals who really we
wanted to make it as easy as possible
okay very simple API cover all the
platforms really open documentation very
simple pay-as-you-go pricing model that
everyone can get their heads around the
aim was to be able to get developer up
and going in about 10 minutes
download the client library hit the
compile button if relevant and then
you're up and going so that's what we
were looking for from easiness terms of
reliability that was paramount
reliability and also I'd kind of keep in
there security very very important
because of the use cases that we're
trying to target
financial services healthcare these
things reliability is I'm not
exaggerating life and death so let's you
know really build our infrastructure in
a way that is as reliable and as secure
as we can possibly make it so G
redundancy high service availability you
know very little downtime all that kind
of stuff baked into the the architecture
and you can't kind of clip that in
afterwards you've got to build that into
the design as you as you're creating the
platform and then finally we knew that
we wanted to create a global cloud we
wanted to be I the highest quality
solution that would work anywhere you
know so we've got points of presence
globally and we're just adding adding to
those all the time
beefing up links between them dedicated
you know sort of backhaul links between
our points of presence and really we
needed solutions components in that
solution that would give us that sort of
reach so yeah so lots of locations as I
said we're up to 12 points of presence
today and that will be increasing
rolling out over the next next few
months as we get demand in particular
regions we're kind of beefing up those a
point of presence for us is basically a
it's a number of video routers you know
in a data center somewhere and then it's
we set a backhaul back into the network
but the vision really here is to be a
content delivery network so a CDN you
know I'm sure you're familiar with the
Akamai's and those sorts of CD ends but
for real-time video that's that's what
we're shooting for with the video IO
platform okay so the video stack just to
review very quickly
there's the API plane which is the
interface that the developer works to
and it's a very nice simple API with
just some of the basics that you'd
expect create a create a call be able to
set up callbacks to listen for people
joining mutant on mute cameras select
which camera you want to use share your
desktop share an application those sorts
of things are built into the API then
there is the first level is there's a
signaling plane and this is where we
kind of negotiate the call setup and
teardown we put telemetry through that
that singling plane about the quality of
the call we do
chat over that line we do authentication
we do state synchronization all sorts of
things over that that signaling plane so
when participants quite you know join
and leave that all gets kind of set over
that signaling plane and then finally
from our perspective a very important
layer is the media plane and that media
plane is where all of the audio/video
content gets sent and you know we've
spent a lot of time kind of optimizing
that media plane to work across very
very unremarkable networks so we
evaluated a bunch of different options
we thought when we were creating the the
the architecture behind video i/o you
know we thought about custom protocols
we thought about lots of different kinds
of signaling approaches we thought about
extending sip which is a which is a
particular you know it's a common
standard it's a very complicated
standard though it's not one that we we
felt that we had a lot of experience
with we didn't think it was going to be
a perfect fit for what we're looking for
so what we ended up with is actually
building the seedling based on me on the
very widely adopted XMPP framework okay
so we knew that all right we have this
we've got the media stuff pretty pretty
sorted out that's great we've got a good
handle on that but we need a signaling
layer that can really scale to millions
if not tens of millions maybe even
hundreds of millions of online users
that's what we were kind of shooting for
and really when you when you set the bar
that high there's only one one you know
global stack that will get you there and
that's XMPP so we end up with something
that this is a simplified view but you
know something that looks like this so
all the signaling for video happens over
XMPP and the there you know when you
when you connect to a call there's an
exit the first thing happens in XMPP
session is it ago she ate it back to the
backend and then all subsequent kind of
media you know deciding which all the
geolocation all all that stuff all the
signaling happens over that XMPP channel
and then we bring up the media channel
and do all the other things now of
course just to make this very clear but
you know to an application developer all
of this is transparent you don't even
know that that's what's happening under
the covers and that's the case so in
other words by selecting
MPP we've been able to make it you know
really simple for for the end developers
okay so in a little bit more depth you
know we have we have a acosta of XMPP
servers that we maintain for our XMPP
signaling and that's generally speaking
over HTTP and you know it's a four for
three connection you know pops through
the pops through most firewalls pretty
pretty seamlessly and you know so it's
you know we knew that we needed to
maintain that cluster in order to be
able to create this this end-to-end
service and then we have a separate set
of what we call they're actually video
routers but we they we gave them a new
name for the new architecture and
they're called video reflectors and so
these are also a clustered based based
approach but they're for the for the
media layer and they are they're you
know generally co-located with the XMPP
signaling but they're kind of logically
separate and they signaling separated
from the media it just makes it makes it
a nice architecture to work with so of
course when we we decide on XMPP we knew
that that was what we needed to use you
know in order to be able to get to that
you know potentially hundreds of
millions of online users level and then
we had a choice we had to go out to the
market and and and kind of evaluate and
look deeply at what XMPP servers were
available you know and there are there
are a number of different XMPP
implementations but we needed a battle
hardware we considered a battle-hardened
XMPP stack we wanted to see you know
some good use some good case studies of
where this particular stack had been
deployed in you know in in real anger
and so that was a the first test we
wanted something that had been proven to
work globally we need a Bosch support
and that's all Bosch is obviously the
protocol that's used for layering the
XMPP protocol over you know over HTTP
and so we needed that we knew that we we
wanted to support web endpoints and
therefore we needed some some solution
to that we wanted cross-platform support
because we've got this broad brush of
platforms at
working with we needed you know
rock-solid firewall traversal and and
the last point which i think is also
really reemployment to emphasize is that
we knew that whatever stack we picked
there were things that were tweaks that
we wanted to make so we we really needed
to have a responsive team from the
vendor who was able to kind of work with
us and add at you know maybe make some
adaptations to their to their stack and
and make it fit our specific use cases
now I use cases maybe not you know
completely typical in terms of the way
that XMPP is used but you know we needed
we knew that we're going to need to have
some adaptations made so that was
important as well okay so so I guess
obviously that's that's highlighted the
what video i/o is it's a it's it's very
easy to get started very easy to kind of
sign up and you can go to vo i/o anytime
you like wait until after the webinar
please but by all means go and sign up
you get a bulk of minutes for free you
can you can get started very very
quickly whether you wanting to build add
video into a you know a web application
or mobile application or a desktop
application and there sample code
there's API documentation all that stuff
is is there and and and yeah so that's
that's the shameless video I had plug so
so before I wrap up and hand over to to
McCall and to back to Lydon I wanted to
say a little bit more about the
experience that we had in working with
with the erlang solutions team and in
particular you know implementing
Mongoose I am so so we you know we we we
started off just using the open-source
version of the of the platform and then
soon after in our evaluation process we
we reached out because we knew that a
responsive team was going to be
important to us we reached out to the to
the erlang solutions team and and then
we actually were able to negotiate kind
of an extended support contract the guys
were extremely responsive they're very
knowledgeable about you know real
experts deep experts in in a
MPP and they're able to help us through
trades kind of thinking through the best
way of solving the technical challenges
that we that we ran into during the
development process and not all of those
were understood you know when we first
started it was a it was an evolutionary
process we'd kind of do some work on our
side get so far and then we needed to
kind of have a kind of a tight coupling
with with Erlang Ian and we found that
that the responsiveness was was terrific
was really a really nothing but positive
things to say about the the the team on
the aleutian side in terms of getting
back to worse and answering questions
and even like splitting new versions of
their software to meet our requirements
that kind of combination of of a
consulting help combined with
architectural support combined with you
know new software versions was yeah I
think that it really meant that we knew
that the video is service when it popped
out when we could make it GA was going
to be a reliable and scalable platform
and that was that was critical for us so
I'm so weary pleased to be to be working
with Lang
so that's that's kind of everything that
I had to to lay out and I think that
maybe we could hand over to Michael and
who has what technical depth about that
I think the changes that they made on
the erlang side in order to be able to
accommodate our requirements okay thank
you I hope you can see my slides now and
my name is Mohammed Lansky I work as a
technical lead at erlang solutions crack
office where the majority of magazine
team is located and I'll try to dive in
into more detail of what was just
described as a magazine platform and
also try to give you some examples of
our collaboration with video team so
this is going to be repeated now but I
want to highlight this this is an open
source messaging platform so all of what
I'm just trying to say here listen it's
all in public you can go to our github
site and see the source code we are
quite transparent about our development
process and we publish a lot of new for
example integration tests if you go to
our github account where the source code
of magazine platform is hosted you will
find very many end-to-end integration
tests which we run every time there is a
new feature added to the stack and this
covers majority of the source code so
this is good because shell you want to
extend the certain features or customize
some behaviors you always have this
reference integration tests that will
tell you whether you have broken some
behavior or some some workflow we
recently also build on top of that
concept of so-called continuous
integration where those integration
tests are being executed every time you
submit commit a new increment of code to
what we call continuous load testing so
now not only we run them to end testing
where we say okay tests have passed all
or not and this is what has failed all
over successful but now we also every
time we commit some increment to github
spawn a cluster of Mongoose I am
messaging servers we spawn some load
generation tools in our private cloud
and we try for a period of time to log
test such setup so we also get feedback
in a continuous manner about how
performant is this new version of the
platform so this is good very good
because it like timewise in no cost
almost get a feedback that whether that
this new feature that we just submitted
was for example improving performance or
actually it introduces some issues that
can manifest as higher latency or things
like this so this is a new concept that
has been serving us for almost half a
year now it's also done in public you
can visit the continuous load testing
website among which I am and see that
for each pull request each feature there
is a number of capture two metrics
and you can compare and contrast
historical releases and most recent ones
and we also try to very actively
participate in the ecosystem XMPP is a
quite mature protocol it has been
invented in the late 90s so it's I think
18 year old now and there is a lot of
teams communities companies and the
libraries out there which leverage the
open standard so the way we try to
participate in this big relatively big
ecosystem is by contributing to the
upstream repositories so for example if
we have improved XMPP library for
Android systems which is called smack we
would submit pull requests and changes
to the upstream wrapper so that they can
be merged with the main repository and
the whole community can benefit from
those improvements same applies to iOS
library which is called XMPP framework
there are some applications like moving
which is about messaging for social
network where we also continue to
evaluate and contribute and Jamie
another example of a library for iOS
which helps with some api's that are
used by Mongoose again so this is just
example of number of projects that the
team mangú same team is not necessarily
maintaining on day to day basis but we
do contribute to those libraries we also
quite actively participate in the
so-called XMPP standards Foundation
which is a body which works on a new
version of the standard they expand the
existing standard or iterate on exists
on some extensions our team members are
members of this foundation and we
through active participation volunteer
volunteering and other forms of activity
try to build the XMPP community even
stronger now
to give you some high level of what this
is really what you're talking about this
whole language I am think I have a
high-level view of some components that
the platform consists of I will try to
just give you a high-level description
of each of those components but I
encourage you to dive in my reading our
online documentation or through the
github exploration if you you would be
interested in certain aspect of this
platform certain component so I
mentioned already that we have
continuous load testing and continuous
integration testing for this we can see
some two libraries in the top left
corner are mechanical those those are
used for implementing those test suits
and we have libraries for client side of
things so we want to implement and
message messenger application for
Android or iOS you would need a library
which connects you to the magazine
platform which typically is deployed in
the cloud and for this we have as you
can see smog and XMPP framework comes on
the open source libraries to which we
contribute then this is just a library
library will help you integrate but it's
not the actual behavior the messenger
application itself so what we also
contributed our open source demo
applications we call them mangosta and
we have one for Android and one for iOS
so mangos does they leverage smack or
XMPP framework libraries underneath so
that they can connect to the cloud
component of magazine platform but we
also implement some messenger behavior
on top of it so things like one-to-one
chart or group chart or other features
and this is to illustrate how the whole
magazine platform could be used in
practice so this can be also forked well
used and abused as you see fit
this is not being distributed through
any app stores
it's just published as open source
repository on github account if we look
we have the blue square where mine was
iron platform this and in this
illustration we try to indicate that
actually there are two distinct el AP is
that you can use to access the platform
features one is xmpp this has been
already quite well described by both
myself and Nikola but there's also REST
API which for some cases some project
might be a better fit and what we do
here is be exposed for the REST API the
XMPP features and this is quite useful
for a number of projects so this you
will need different set of libraries
client libraries which is why you can
see this Randi Rose squares there with
retrofit and Jaime two libraries that
will help you integrate the REST API
among as I am into your apps underneath
our mangu same rectangle we can see one
by the way M this is a product of
modeling solutions which helps you
monitor and maintain a live system so
typically when you deploy mangoes I am
on some cloud you would also want to
keep an eye on how is it doing are there
any metrics which we need to keep an eye
on for example number of online users
number of registered users number of
traffic that is being routed through
this platform so things like this
business level metrics application level
metrics that you may want to observe and
other things also include alarms log
messages notifications so anything that
you would exact expect to have in place
when a team of DevOps operations need to
maintain a live system this is the use
case for one bottom product of our Lang
solution here and there are some also
two gray rectangles on the right hand
side which indicate what is it that we
are working on right now and that will
soon be available on our open source
soon
starke one of these components is called
Mongoose I am ice
this stands for ice server which helps
with peer-to-peer
connectivity and also quite important
mine use push which is an implementation
not a push notification server which can
nicely integrate yourself with Apple
Google and notification systems and this
way you can reach out to your mobile
users which are offline meaning going to
necessarily have your application up and
running and like in front of you in the
screen but they have their handsets in
their pockets and you want to send them
some notification is that the message
arrived and it might be worth opening
your app and then you see this message
so this this is very important for any
mobile app to be tightly integrated with
push notification systems so that you
can notify your users even if their
devices are not sort of owned as in like
opened that certain messages are
awaiting now few words about the global
scalability here because this was
mentioned on Nicolas slide I wanted to
give you an example of how we
collaborated with video so basically
they came to us was already said and
they sponsored development of a number
of features here you can see some
example of docks features but probably
not tell you much and until you really
dive into the specifics of the platform
I just wanted to highlight how this
works in practice so company like video
is interested in extending the platform
of some features which may need and we
work together on making sure that the
features will also be beneficial for the
general audience open source community
around monkeys I am and then the team
has over the last months or years was
adding those features as requested by
video for example dynamic code reload
this is a feature which helps you add
and remove tenants to your hosted
environment without taking down the
whole system because we reload the
configuration of the system
I and other features are listed here and
the feature which they recently
sponsored is so-called geo scaling but
this is something that allows us to
deployment which I am in multi data
centers around the world and now
clusters of Mongoose item could be
sitting on two three four different
continents but yet we will be able to
route messages cross continents so cross
continent outing in a global deployment
and the reason why one would want to
have more than one data center is
because you can cut on latencies if your
data center is closed toward the
physical location of the user race so
imagine you have users connecting from
three different continents each one of
them needs to have short latency towards
a signaling server so that the whole
negotiation and signaling is efficient
as possible and for this it's good to
have more than one data center across in
the world to facilitate such short
latencies now this way of collaborating
with the open source team at Mongoose I
am help video in long term lower total
cost of ownership because you can see
quite a few features listed here in a
slide that the team has worked on and
this is just one part of the cost
development but the second part which is
not always visible upfront is the cost
of maintenance of those features so in
long term now that the mangu same team
is iterating on the platform adding more
and more features that I also will share
some highlights off on my next slide we
take responsibility for the features
that we already added in the past so for
video it was sort of one of spending to
add to those specific features that we
had interest in and loud the team at
erlang solutions continues to maintain
and support those features because
they're open source they are part of our
stack
in long-term this is definitely lowering
the total cost of ownership for video
and here few highlights of where we are
today so if you look on what is next for
Mongoose I am in q2 of 2017 we will be
adding full-text search for the archives
this allows users to perform full-text
search queries on the history of their
conversations as already mentioned we
will be publishing language I improve
service which should allow you to add
such feature to your Android and iOS
devices there are some contributions
from our open source community one of
them is JSON web token authentication so
this is extremely interesting from our
point of view to see that the adoption
of mangu sign is already good and
external developers are contributing
some new features that we can then
review and adopt so this is this is
great from our point of view but also a
nice example of how open-source can beef
up PP fiber powerful some more features
are listed here on for example how we
continue to optimize efficiency of this
platform when it comes to reconnecting
you know device show your mobile network
we drop at some point we are also going
to describe in more detail our open
source bandwidth IM client applications
the mangosta which are already mentioned
so this is some short term roadmap just
so that you get an idea of where we are
if you want to understand in more detail
what is already supported off-the-shelf
I encourage you to visit our web sites
and I'll show links to those website
shortly right to recover mangos om is
not just an XMPP server we consider this
to be a powerful platform which can
power quite interesting use cases
messaging or signaling is one of them as
just described here in this webinar
but there are also other interesting
areas where such platform can play
significant role and can be a core
component which helps with overall
messaging behavior if you would like to
reach out to us you can do so either on
Twitter at mangas iam it could also
visit our github which I encourage you
to do and click a like give us a star on
github but you can also reach out to
gladden and my colleague that erlang
solutions at this email address thank
you I will now hung over black to learn
and he will moderate our Q&amp;amp;A session
thank you for that
Nikolas and me hall and I'm sure
everyone will join me in saying thanks
for a really inspiring chat on both
topics you covered now as you were
speaking questions were coming in from
the audience so whereas we have little
available time remaining we should still
try and answer as many questions as we
can so to start with the first one can I
ask you mickeleh specifically this is a
question you've answered partially
during the session but I'd still perhaps
ask you to reinforce the point one of
our users is asking does video serve to
embed video chat into a mobile
application such as Android for example
absolutely yes so both Android and iOS
fully supported and the process of
embedding is is really really simple if
you've got some a little bit of Android
experience then it's basically download
a zip file which contains our client
libraries you put in you basically need
to just sign up for a video i/o account
and you get an application ID that comes
out of that account so you copy that
that application ID into your source
code you let you open that source code
up in the if it's Android you're working
in the Android studio and if it's iOS
you obviously work in Xcode you open up
in the you know development platform of
that's that's appropriate for the
platform you get to come
I'll button and there's a sample app
that's built into that sample code and
honestly within ten minutes if you've
got a little bit of experience I'm sure
you get it get an actual running video
multi-party video conference going now
of course if you then want to just copy
and paste some one of those components
and put it into some application that
you already have and you know it may be
a little bit of copying and pasting but
it's it should be a very straightforward
process we've designed all of the
language bindings are very very
idiomatic they're designed to fit nicely
with the usual programming style on the
platform that we're targeting and so we
should we should really expect that you
know you'll be able to get going in
small numbers of minutes for a basic
kind of a basic life use case thank you
for the Nicolas and straight on to the
next question to try and honor as many
as we can one of our audience and I
think he's not trying to be devil's
advocate but I think it's a fair
question you know we're all seeing a lot
of video slash collaboration tools on
the markets and you know a lot of them
are in existence many more and are being
developed so what would you say
from your perspective is the key
competitive advantage of video when
compared to all these mainstream and
emerging video communication /
collaboration tools no I think that's a
very fair question so some of the
strengths that we have as a platform is
that unlike you know some of the smaller
movers this is not this is not new to us
you know we've been doing this kind of
multi-party collaboration for 10 plus
years 11 11 years basically and so we
have a lot of experience we've we you
know we mentioned battle-tested we have
very battle-tested in terms of the the
SDK that underpins everything that we do
you know and and some of our fairly
public case studies sort of point to
that sort of scalability the Department
of Defense there are a number of you
know top tier you know global five banks
to use that technology so it's really
it's a very
it's the underlying STK that that is you
know it's more focused on the on that on
that media layer that I mentioned
previously but that stuff has been in
development for for many years has been
honed refined and it's um you know it's
it's the the proof is in the in the
deployment and it just works much much
better than some of the newer entrance
into this space we understand how to
make it work
and in terms of the technology there are
patented innovations built into the way
that we do the particularly around the
routing of the of the the media which
which is like just do a 30-second
introduction to the concept but it's
it's a big topic and and lots to get
into but when you're dealing with
multi-party video then the old way of
doing that was was basically bringing
all the video streams back at the
highest quality you could manage and
then doing some kind of central
transcode and a and a composite
centrally and then sending it out to -
to all of the consumers so you kind of
create a thing that looks like a Brady
Bunch screen centrally and then you send
it out to all of the endpoints that's
not the way that video works video is
multi stream natively and moreover it's
what's called scalable video
a scalable video codec now this is a
special usage of the word scalable this
just doesn't mean lots and lots of users
this means within each video stream
there are multiple frame rates and
multiple resolutions are all smashed
together and encoded in that same in
that same stream so what that gives us
the ability to do at the router level
please make sub-second decisions about
you know multiple times a second we're
deciding how much bandwidth is this
endpoint have what is the size of the
window how many how many pixels should I
send them how many streams should I send
or send that particular endpoint and you
know that that kind of that real-time
optimization is something that we have
you know we've perfected over you know a
long number of years and is something
that that that doesn't really exist
anywhere else in the market and taking
their step further when we look at their
global distribution the routers talk to
each other across you know across large
deployments and a nice visualization of
this if some of our attendees google
cern see ein as in the european physics
research institute video our spelling VI
dyo dashboard then you'll find there's a
there's actually a publicly accessible
dashboard which shows the video
deployment in CERN and where all the
routers are and where the conferences
are traversing and you'll often see that
there are there are conferences that are
spanning the multiple countries multiple
continents you know we're getting great
aggregation of media traffic you know
you're not having to backhaul if you've
got 25 or 50 people on a call you know
it's sending 50 streams 50 way 15 50 by
50 you know that kind of mesh is
unsupportable and so having that routed
infrastructure where it's intelligently
making decisions about what to send
where is critical for creating a really
reliable scalable experience in the
video space and so that's why it I point
to video and video I just is easy
apotheosis of of all the development
that we've done over the last 10 years
it's the simplest API is but it has the
most advanced SDK underpinning those
those api's Thank You Nicholas I would
say a comprehensive and certainly a
component
like I said honors
questions as we can let's move on to the
next one one of our audience members
almaas is asking what is the limitation
on the number of participants in a
session there actually isn't a hard
limit so we'd expect that it should work
up to thousands potentially you know
there's no reason why it doesn't and
that's in this single conference okay
across multiple conferences it's you
know it's millions in a single
conference thousands we think is is
practical in terms of actually showing
the number of tiles on a screen it that
kind of depends on the amount of network
bandwidth and the amount of compute that
you have locally we can quite often see
16 or even more 20 20 20 maybe even more
more tiles on that on a single screen or
spread across multiple screens you know
we can where we have one one extreme
example of deployment that we that we
built in India where the use case was a
CEO of a very large organization there
wanted to have a Monday morning staff
meeting with all of his branch officers
and there are 960 branch officers and he
wanted an entire wall painted with
real-time video so every one of those
960 officers as he appears as a square
on this massive video wall every Monday
morning so he can he can kind of survey
the enormity of his of his empire I
guess but it works it works nicely and
that's that's enabled by our technology
that's really interesting and thank you
for that Nicholas the problem we have
and that happens regularly in our
webinars is that we're receiving
questions that are faster paced and then
we're answering them so just to say that
we'll answer as many questions as we can
right now and then all the unanswered
questions we will answer in writing so
if you've asked the question rest
assured you will get an answer but just
to move straight on to the next question
if that's okay with our speakers so this
is a bit of a longer one so I'll try and
read gary is basically saying we used to
use
and see for collaboration which was
effective as you could share control of
mouse or keyboard as well as just screen
video now conferencing systems that Gary
has used since do not really support
this and that makes true collaboration
clumsy so he's asking what would it take
to support this in your or other similar
systems yeah that's a fair question so
just to be clear our solution today
allows you to share computer content
into a conference it's not just video
content it's not just you know looking
at me it's not just a camera but it's
also you can choose programmatically can
choose a window or a whole desktop to
share into the conference and that works
really nicely we've got some some clever
codec engineers who have optimized our
video experience in order to support
that computer-generated content very
efficiently so that's supported today so
that's half the story the second half of
the story is kind of the control
information sent back in the opposite
direction so I can see your desktop but
now I want to interact with your desktop
and that's something that we'll be
adding to the video platform in the
coming months so it's it's something
that will be there as part of the part
of the solution the ability to to kind
of send those control messages back and
and kind of control or interact with an
application running on a on that far
side so that that's where we are today
yeah thank you for that that makes a lot
of sense now on to the next question one
of our audience members again is asking
do you rely on some type of a open
source platform for media handling
generally speaking no the only caveat to
that so like the bulk of the video
experience is created with the video SDK
which is close to two million lines of
tightly optimized C code you know it's
it's something that we built from the
ground up and have honed over many years
the only kind of exception to that is in
some modern browsers there is a
technology stack that people might be
aware of called WebRTC and that's built
into chrome and
Fox today edge from Microsoft is is it's
close to having where but DC compliance
it's not all the way there yet
and we know that Apple is working on in
Safari so in in the browsers that
support whereby DC we can use whereby DC
we will use whereby DC for the media
handling it's it's it's nice it has an
upside in that it doesn't require any
download it can just be you can just use
it you know native Remy in the in the
browser the downside is it's nowhere
near as optimized as the video SDK so
the quality is not quite as good as as
what you would get using the native SDK
and and of course in a lot of mobile
environments where that's really really
important people tend to use our client
libraries embed them in a native app and
kind of download that as the the means
by and delivering that video SDK onto
the onto the client use so generally
speaking know the one exception is there
is the WebRTC
client-side Thank You Nicholas now I'll
have to apologize to our audience
members but we given the available time
we can take two more questions so I'll
move on to the next one and then all the
other questions will be answered in
writing so the next question comes from
Tori and Tori's asking is there any
support available for client-side
angularjs integration which can be used
on desktops as well as handheld browsers
ok great question
what I'd say is that the the JavaScript
bindings for video IO are actually of a
form that that a kind of framework
agnostic they don't really care if
you're using angular or react or view or
riot or any of these kind of funky you
know frameworks effectively in the in
the JavaScript world what you're doing
is you create however you want to create
a div element in your DOM and then when
you initialize the video client library
you point it at one or more gives and
we'll fill those with with video okay
now you can either choose to say
video you manage the composition of that
of what goes into the div or in you know
if you want more control you can say I'm
going to kind of lay out the divs as
they want them to be and then as new
streams come online I'm going to set up
a little callback and I'm going to feed
feed those those streams into the divs
that
the simple composition or you can kind
of add full control it or gets
composited now Tory also mentioned
and he'll brown it's a qualified yes for
for handheld browsers on Android today
chrome supports Chrome mobile supports
some amount of web ADC functionality but
it's certainly not optimal when you
compare it against the the work that
we've done on in our client libraries so
if you bet that you want really high
quality video I would nudge you towards
using our client libraries and that's
because we've done lots and lots of work
you know down to you know hand hand
optimizing assembler SMI D instructions
really understanding deeply how the the
ARM architecture and and x86
architectures work to get the best and
the highest efficiency in terms of
encoding decoded video it's a really
specialized piece of of optimization to
make that work and that matters a lot in
the mobile environment because you care
about battery life and you care about
quality you know without chewing up a
lot of CPU so so yeah I'd if you're
doing serious work I'd suggest that the
Native Client approach is probably the
the best approach still in the mobile
space thank you for that Nicolas and
we'll have to take a final question and
I would just like to say again will
answer all the questions that have not
been answered in writing and also to say
that we are answering these questions in
the order in which they were received
so obviously I'm asking a question early
helps but just to ask the final question
and I think you've already addressed
this during your presentation Raul is
asking can video dot IO be used for live
audio yes the answers absolutely yes so
we send both audio and video
we have callbacks for selecting the
audio device that you want to capture
and kind of input an output of audio we
use the the OD opus codec our own
implementation of the opus codec which
is a very very highly efficient audio
codec high-quality for sending audio
through the through the conference so
yes it's absolutely supported nicolas
thank you for this and me Hal thank you
as well no I'm sure that everyone who
was taken part in the webinar will join
me in thanking yourselves for a really
inspiring talk on videos work and on
Mongoose I am many thanks to all of you
who have joined us for the webinar and
please join us again for our next
monthly webinar now following today we
will send you a short survey just to
make sure we capture your feedback of
today's webinar please also know that
