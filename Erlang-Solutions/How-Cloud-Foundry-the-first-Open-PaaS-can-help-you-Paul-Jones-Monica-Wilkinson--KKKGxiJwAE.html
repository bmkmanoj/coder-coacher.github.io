developing software for 12 years the
last five years I focused on social
networking I worked on myspace Facebook
and then social caste which got acquired
by VMware and I'm now working at Cal
foundry which is owned by VMware if you
have any questions after a talk there's
my contact information and Paul you want
to introduce yourself yeah so I'm full
jerks so I'm both the founder 23 why my
own company and a senior developer at el
shifting some people may know where the
original developers rabbitmq through
those sorts of things I've worked for
big and small companies I personally try
the generalist across as many languages
opportunity allows which thankfully has
been quite a few and I also aimed to
select the right tool for the right job
and my contact details again well vmware
thanks for alright so today we're going
to cover a couple things first of all
why do we need a platform as a service
what is cloud foundry how to plan scale
apps on call foundry how to bind
application services and then finally a
demo of adding our line to cloud foundry
and Paul is going to lead this part
since he was the open-source contributor
so let's back up for a minute and talk
about the state of software development
today and the need for increased agility
so 10 years ago over 10 years ago when I
lived in a high on our side computer
science I wanted to have a computer in
my head I just really love computers I
don't want to carry the things I didn't
even have a laptop actually so I just
really hope to have this mobility and
applications that could help me leverage
all of the the intelligence from
mysociety right I wanted to use it for
different papers and so on so well we
have seen hardware involved very rapidly
and there's Moore's law that says that
every two years a processor speed are
going to double that is not true for
software development
so software developments still very hard
and painful and it's very much a craft
so agility is really a survival skills
there there's lots of demand for
software products and there's demands
for software products all the way from
phone applications to social apps and
not only do you have to deliver very
fast but you also have to iterate and
adjust to your audience so we think that
a great solution for this kind of demand
is a cloud platform so a cloud platform
enables you to be more agile because you
have to you don't have to worry about
configuring a plethora of systems and
your own software stack and you can just
worry about writing the code and pushing
your apps you don't have to worry about
updating the operating system trying out
different services all that is packaged
for you so called platforms in general
rice the unit of currency to be the
applications on services instead of the
infrastructure and there are other cloud
platforms out there so there's Google
App Engine there's joy and Heroku
there's amazonas elastic and some of
them offer a single language and some of
them have started expanding but we
really are seeing people infiltrate more
and more languages such as Paul I think
Paul you told me how many languages like
you code in Java Ruby Pete yeah it's
incredible so more people want to try
use the right tool for the right job and
try different languages so that's
definitely I need and also you know the
enterprise which is the focus of VMware
really wants some parts of their data to
be private so offering this private
hybrid cloud is what VMware is looking
at doing so-called foundry once again
you know it's operated by VMware's bill
by VMware here is the list of languages
that are currently supported and
you won't see airline there yet and I'll
talk a little bit more about that but
this is on call foundry com and then
there's a variety of web frameworks rail
Sinatra I know jazz spring Grails and a
variety of services so how many of you
have used MongoDB anybody okay great so
why did you use Mongo if you don't mind
me asking aha okay okay so what we're
seeing from our users on call foundry is
that Mongo actually has huge traction
because people are when they're
experimenting with applications they
like the fact that it's schema-less and
they just like the ability to very
quickly on each iteration add new
properties to the documents and I'll
cover that in a little bit more detail
very soon and then so basically Cloud
Foundry gives you a choice of data
services so we have not only Mongo but
we have reddish rabbinic you my sequel
post gray sure your guys are familiar
with that and it's really infrastructure
independent most importantly it's open
source and the source is on github com
cloud foundry and the project is called
vcap touching very quickly on the coffin
telecom service this is what you can get
today and if you want to actually
leverage the community contributions
here are the instructions for you to set
up your own cloud foundry service so
basically what you're going to end up
doing is bringing up on a bun to image
and then just run a script is going to
configure everything for you and then
you're just going to target that
environment instead of the cloud so it's
the same API use the same tools but you
are now targeting your own fourth
version of the code base and in this
version we
actually have support for airline and
with that i'm going to let fall tell you
about how key contributor erling okay so
in my part of this i'm going to cover
the technical details of power lines
actually part of anger so i'm going to
take a few steps to get there so first
thing is about understanding what cloud
foundry actually provides to attendant
language the services that you get
pretty simple by integrating with it the
next bit then is going to be what a
language actually has to do in order to
fit in the cloud foundry what the
constraints are the contracts and so on
and then finally i'm going to get to how
Erlang is actually fitting in so the
various trade-offs that had you made
along the way there gets packed into
constraints to get put on your
application so cloud foundry provides a
bunch of application services to every
application
that the regardless of the type of
application we're deploying on top of it
you're going to get these from cloud
country so I'm going to work through
each of these ones explain why you want
them and how they happen to be there so
the first one is HTTP routing so when
you've got a couple of applications to
foil into your private cloud then you're
going to need something in front of them
to work out based on an incoming request
which application in these that leads to
handle it to serve it also when you've
got multiple instances of your
application you mean something sitting
in front of it is going to route that
request to one one of your instances
agree on some kind of algorithm that
balances it nicely across them you're
also going to want something that
ensures that if you bring up a new
instance or you deploy a new application
that things get rather to it on demand
you need flexible routing kind of your
application changes immediately next up
you get application distribution so when
you deploy your application normally you
just got one server deployment
deployment doesn't tend to be a big
problem just copy the code on their use
some kind of deployment I'm like is
going to be problem when you start games
before avoiding the deploy your
application the multiple hosts or your
current the operations team wants to
expand it out to another host that's
when things start getting a tricky with
cloud foundry as long as your
application has next people entry point
you can bundle up into a directory of
files that can shuffle around you
essentially get this for free if your
application needs more instances trial
family do they automatically you and we
give it the right man if you host needs
to be taken down and cloud foundry will
find another place of your application
or if your application happens to crash
or bring up another instance somewhere
else so all of that is just automatic
you don't any employee about it next is
service binding so as you point out just
before services or things like lettuce
or rabbit or postgres or minus 2 out
normally in most systems you find that
when you design the deployment either
someone says you just have to write a
concrete file someone operations has
told you where those where those
resources have
to be all they say you have to have your
computer file in a certain place and
I'll have some kind of automation and
overwrite sit in the case of cloud
foundry all you need to be able to do is
in your application read out an
environment variable and you'll have the
details of other services operations can
then configure me be shared between
multiple places they can rebind them
making out new ones all that control is
pushed out of the application complete
files into somewhere centralized that
works across all the different services
there's one year for way to manage that
finally we've got management this is
kind of more of an add-on nice to have
feature but it's certainly one that ends
up missing from those deployment
instructions you can configure in cloud
foundry which users are actually able to
push the applications so instead of just
having it there's other people can
divide your structure or they can and
usually in most cases they can then here
you can actually instead choose to
privilege use abdomen which every time
you like and you can actually allow your
applications to be deployed by any user
you can have my isolated clouds etc okay
so moving on from here it's the question
of what do you have to do in order to
fit into the platform one of the
constraints put on so the first one is
is that your application has to run this
process realistically for Erlang this
isn't a big ass we started no binary
point of the right place
this one tends to be more of a problem
if you've got some PHP or asp or even a
Java Web APIs reporters award these
things tanta need application containers
which makes them a bit more difficult
important than architects like this
you've got to wrap them up with your
container you have to respond to HTTP
requests so this is kind of following it
on again from the container thing that
your application needs to boot you need
to be able to spawn to an HTTP request
and the user I do all the servicing
usually the best way to test that is
your application which we started
directly from the command line respond
HTTP requests ignoring and you put back
in then it's going to work like this
crowd boundary will tell you what ports
listen on and then next up your
application is died when it's dead so
this is obviously a topic fairly close
to la carte like don't find I'm going to
get much pushback here but if the
application fails internally if it
doesn't crash out and die at the OS
level and the cloud foundry management
system doesn't know that needs to bring
up another one elsewhere or it needs to
recover your current one so if your
application starts failed in any way
we've lost the back-end service and run
out of memory then if you just go down
then the platform is there to fix it a
lot for you the next one is candle being
turned over broccoli and when I say
abruptly I mean Phil minus 9 and
broccoli so the platform will a little
very brutally kill up applications
whenever it's finished with so if if
someone says they want to downscale a
number of instances or if platform
decides to move your application to
another host you don't do any kind of
gentle shut down its all go away right
now usually this is because if you're
running a large operation if you had to
wait for every application shaking
gracefully that could take quite in
another time the other thing is also my
host crashes out it's not
some kind of gentle shut down so if it
always happens the exact same way we
always be prepared for the worst next up
is keeping the binary small so because
your application can be distributed any
number of nodes and the system may
choose to rebalance you at any point
whether it's a maintenance operator
trying to do something or someone almost
upscale or if I purchases being shut
down then you need the code is being
copied around so the smaller it is the
faster it could be copy so to help with
this cloud foundry has all the runtimes
pre-installed on each of the execution
words and then the application will own
them leadership with its own code and
then a third party non standard library
uses ok so that's kind of the basics
language and cloud family that now will
gets a bit people hopefully care about
which is how our link fits into it so we
need to make a number of assumptions
about our life because as we know Erlang
doesn't necessarily have as many
conventions or something like the
groovio no doubt in terms of when you
build a web app and choose any number of
different web frameworks confuse any
number of different build tools and all
of these are start and stop except for
in completely different ways so the way
the cloud foundry integration works is
it makes a number of basic assumptions
about it so the first point is is that
we assume your application is no teeth
the app and it's been built with rebar
or something that looks like when the
outputs done likely bar because of this
we get to make a number of assumptions
the first one being that's going to be
an app directory generated it's got a
bunch of files with very standard layout
the first thing we'll expect is that
within that there's a bin directory
that's got star script but can we start
up your application the star script
isn't particularly standard but we
expect the rule if you've got a dot rail
file whatever that's named then we'll
find the starts with the same thing it's
obviously a bit of restriction on the
application but I don't really think
it's a big one because it's a fairly
good
anyway next up would we expect to find a
vm start configuration file you can see
again this is something that rebar does
by default which generated templates and
the reason that we rely on this this is
the number of modifications you need to
make to a running Erlang vm in order to
make it work nicer than someone else is
launching it so obviously they had put
in minus no input on to it means that
instead of attempting to load a shell
which obviously doesn't do anything no
one's controlling it helps being able to
give a a plus B which tells it you don't
actually need to do multiple control
things to shut things down is also quite
helpful and also being able to give it a
dynamic mode means the dash name means
if we happen to put multiple instances
of La onto the same machines or your
application is growth in multiple places
we don't end up naming flash finally we
can expect to find all your application
code in live so this is actually one
part where the cloud foundry deployment
starts to deviate a little bit from
standard practice because as I mentioned
before we're trying to keep the binary
school and also cloud fans and premium
stalls the bottom to those machines so
being pre-compiled this the relative as
part of rebar tends to include both the
Erlang runtime standard libraries and
your code or together so what we
actually do to work around this in the
cloud foundry code base is instead of
requiring you to change breaking build
your application when you actually
upload it and change all the common
license assimilates based on where it
actually easily point known which has
the advantage of then being the
application binary is a lot smaller and
also it means if you happen to do you
build on an OSX machine for instance
which has a completely different
architectures or linux flowing the
clothes then you'll find that the
application will continue to work the
only time that unfortunately falls apart
is if you've got custom seat
okay and the final bit about is as I
mentioned before we pass an environment
variables describe to application how
they should do the bits the touch points
they need to be better platform so when
you start up and buy a new HTTP servers
we obviously can't control that because
you could use any number of different
frameworks also your supervision
hierarchy could be any number of
different thicknesses just unexpectedly
what we do is we'll give you an
environment variable prevents the
airport which will tell you which port
your application is to bind on and once
you've done that it's at that point that
the cloud found a long time though is
your applications alive and if you start
routing requests to it the other part as
I mentioned about the services being
provided to your application these comes
through in the big path services
environment variable which is actually a
Jason hash this thing like over the
conservancy you going down so pretty
much as long as you compile Jason then
your applications can be accessing those
services it can in there but we do
addressing these names passwords types
all available for you at which point you
can use them just like they will
configure a static config file four
hydrogen's your application so from here
we're going to move into something a
little bit more interesting which is
Claire family in action so we actually
tools all right so to wake you up a
little bit this is this part is hands-on
so if you have machines available we
actually have the slides on Cloud
Foundry so you can access them at this
URL studios calendar calm / airline
and how many of you have a cloud foundry
account anybody so if you don't have an
account I'm going to give you a promo
code to get signed up right away so you
can follow along so here's the URL you
can just go to call foundry com there'll
be a big sign up button and then if it
asks you for a promo code just type the
word hack okay
so part of the beauty of working with
Cal foundry is that it makes it very
simple for developers to interact and
scale the apps and the way we interact
with Cal foundry is using a command-line
interface called vmc and vmc is
distributed as a ruby gem and so if you
want to interact with Cloud Foundry one
of the most common ways is using BMC of
course it's a REST API so we do have
other libraries so I would like you guys
to install the VNC jump and then if you
use the promo code hag you should have
gotten a password and you can actually
log in and what I'm going to show you
now is since we're using calendar calm
I'm first going to show you just
deploying a very simple signature
application Sinatra is a very
lightweight movie work framework so
meanwhile you guys get registered okay
so this is every we've got URLs so it's
studios.com foundry com / airline and
then I just want to make sure that
everybody can use BMC so
so if you can use it you should be able
to also look up the reference we have
vmc help and i have the very latest vmc
i installed it with the dash dash pre
flag and so it's given me not only the
ability to push ups and scale them one
of the new things that we added is
tunneling for services and also access
to micro cloud foundry and micro called
foundry I'll cover in a minute it's a
miniature version of calc Andre calm
that we basically you can download and
run it a vmware image okay
so this is the exercise that we're going
to try so we're gonna I'm just going to
clone a very simple set a trap and if
you for that it would be your name do
you guys use github okay
okay so the next step is packaging the
jumps
so this will take a little bit the
equivalent of make I guess in our line
not exactly what so we'll let that have
fun with a Wi-Fi
Wow sadly a lot slow
yes
there we go yeah ok so now i can do vmc
push so I'm going to push this up so one
thing that I need to change is I forgot
to do this
we have a mannish us
it remembers my
I've done this before huh all right so
we're going to push it now and on the
first time push it pushes the entire
contents of the current directory but on
subsequent updates it only pushes deltas
so I've pushed my application I can now
see it if i type BMC apps so I have a
few more but here's the one i just type
and i can look at the logs
okay great it looks like it's up so to
access it
so there's my app so it's just very
simple sign a trap and then if I want to
I want to make changes
I have a yellow file which uses portable
contacts
two
so i changed it and i'm going to see
update
all directory 17
in some weird caching
so
now if I want to look at environment
variables I can do vmc and be I'm
actually going to
yeah so sorry about that i was in the
wrong directory when i copied every
clone it one more time
okay yes so basically I'm a change the
file and they didn't reflect and I was
like what's happening but I was still in
another app alright so now I'm in the
right place i'm going to do again the
fund balance with the old app
hey
ok
and then we'll let that run in the
meantime though for you guys able to get
vmc setup you didn't get the mail to use
the promo code hack okay hopefully I'll
be coming soon they told me it never
expires it's my own personal promo so
yeah so basically the push is
interactive this is what a typical push
looks like you get to pick your
application name you're bound with using
Coventry calm on the California comm
service but if you're running your own
version of the source code you can
register your else that are outside a
given domain so you can pick any domain
name and then as we saw you know you get
to say how many instances and based on
if I would set it up with like New Relic
monitoring and based on certain
thresholds and alerts you would scale up
or scale down so if you want to see if
you're pointing a different call foundry
instances and you want to see what
runtimes are offered you can always do
vmc runtimes so now I'm going to so we
see that in calendar calm we have 18 19
no no doubt 6 and Java but then once I
target the open source version we can
see that we have airline Python and PHP
as well okay so let me get back to
pushing this one more time thanks for
your patience
you guys saw me just now to specify the
runtime so if we add provide additional
support for airline we could specify
different runtimes when pushing apps
once you've pushed a nap you can't
switch run times you have to lead a
downward push it and then these are all
the framework so what frameworks how
many of you do development in other
languages other than airline anybody
okay great what are some of the
languages and what framework say you
guys you
oh how are you
ok
great so we have active state which runs
a call hungry instance and they support
Python and Perl so now edit this again
just to prove that it works
yeah okay so there it is sorry about
that typing in the wrong directory ok so
moving on ok so we covered pushing a nap
and updating an app you can also you
guys saw me quickly will it delete the
app as I scrambled and you can also
start restart and stop and you guys saw
me get the logs in addition to that you
can also give it more memory and up the
instances so let's try that we're going
to save emc instances and I'm going to
say I don't know fire yeah okay I gave
it too much where it was like 23 this
account is really full
fun that's okay I can switch to a
different account so if you guys want to
see when you're pretty much at your
limit so i guess i'm at one point nine
out of my two gigs so i'm just going to
get help you'll eat some other stuff
ok
okay that work so once you up the
instances you can save EMC stats and you
see the health of both your instances
and once again this is just a wrapper
around the rest interface if you want to
see the rest calls or write your own you
can do a dash T and that's going to
output the JSON response okay
so tips for using vmc you do want to get
the very latest vmc it has access to
manifest and tunneling and once again to
use Dashti now if you want to try Cloud
Foundry running on your own machine if
you want to poke around one quick
alternative to installing the open
source code is to just download microcut
foundry so you guys can download
micrograph foundry from California calm
/ micro and what it's going to do is
once you you know your login with the
account for calif Andre you received and
it's going to allow you to set up the
dns to point to your IP so for example I
have taken over those two and I can
regenerate a token start off foundry and
it's going to route all traffic to my
instance okay so micro co-founder is
something if you want to check it out
very quickly and I once again it uses
the same rest api and you can use vmc
with it the cool thing about micro Cal
foundry is and it's open registration so
you can write just register with a
command line you don't have to wait for
the email okay and we covered this
serves on the beginning slide and then
um Paul covered it briefly but we do
have some pre amazing services so MySQL
I'm sure many of you have used is the
world's most used our dbms and we
support version five dot one if you want
to learn more postgres Seco with support
version 90 another very popular are
giving us and then for those of you that
are working with no sequel we support
MongoDB version one point
and mongodb I i love malaria has a it
has a great community it's evolving very
rapidly and we're currently working with
a partner to offer a mongo to support
mongodb to read us how many of you have
tried rellis great so raise this awesome
for caching an awesome for pub sub so
reddit is another thing that we support
vmware actually sponsors the raddest
project and it's also an open source
project and then finally your favorite I
think rabbitmq written in Ireland and
the rabbit team also works in VMware and
rabid uses amqp and it's
enterprise-grade queuing system okay so
with that let's jump to what you came
here for the demo of the point an
airline app and so for this what we did
is
so here I've targeted if i type me MC
target i'm targeting my vm that is
running the open source version of cloud
foundry so here's the vm and we just did
the vmc runtimes so Paul do you want to
drive this or you want me to drive it
okay you can you can talk through it so
I want to see what apps do I have on
here and do you want to talk a little
bit about what year I'm sure everyone is
familiar with mochi web it's probably
one of the older HTTP support libraries
that you get in there so this
application is obviously a need to be
really simple you just go to a working
show what it actually does
yeah so what we have here is the
application this simply tells you what
Portland's being provided and also the
recaps service was talking about before
which is the list of all service will be
bound so as you can see there it's
there's been a MongoDB service has been
attached to this it's got kind of all
the details you've me if your
application actually want to start
talking to it so I guess one thing you
could do is you could just add another
six yeah so let's do BMC creates service
manga manga airline
then see buying service mumble to be 22
sorry I put their own service name Mongo
airline
so when you bind a service it does
restart
oh I see
so that was obviously a demonstration in
fact that you can you can reuse a
service across the multiple different
applications so get a message key the
ones we shared the breakdown between the
service and the binding needs you can
actually have one serves creative and
bind it to multiple application here you
can see now that the application is
actually being dynamically updated and
purely on the basis of the hash looks
longer you can actually see is now a
second service with the details in there
so it's at this point you can imagine
the operations team we want to change
the location of the server or they want
to add another one if your applications
might have to look in there you might
have them dynamically add services we
can do something with but more likely
it's going to be that the service gets
added it may get relocated to a
different location that at this point is
not your applications concern you just
look into that hash and you're a good
for you so let me show what we're
working with a yes um okay so I guess
anyone that's seen what gets dumped out
when you use the standard rebar
templates for hopefully see this has
been well to be convincing standard they
fly you've got the rebar generate script
the interesting stuff I guess is going
to be the source directory
and again it's all pretty standard
pretty standard stuff so we've got an
application with the main entry point
we've got supervisor and then we've got
the standard Maki web named web files
so you can see here all very standard
mocking web noise and then eventually
get to the point here where we're doing
when you do a request we're dumping out
this will make a change to it
oh is it
okay an agency wrapping around you've
got the two environment variables be a
good week a passport in there test
oops
this one
yeah and here we go you can see that as
supervisor Bruce at that web child we
just have the one line of code here that
just mix up the environment variable
there a nice pattern to do is given that
you may want to run this locally on your
own machine instead of having to set
before all the time okay
oops
alright so this would make a row
okay it's the standard build process as
with the Ruby code the idea here is that
you will actually build the coach with
locally on your machine first cloud
family doesn't actually do anything
built for you on the other side it's
just a forceful for the packaging easy
the rail directory that contains more
the process here is the exact same as
groovy application you can see that the
way that cloud foundry actually does all
the detection this is all done client
side so the the command line utility
actually has code in there it's capable
of detecting all the language runtime in
this case the way we detect Erlang is
actually looking in the in the releases
directly and find an app file and that
is actually the signal that we've got
some it looks like an airline
application since but it's just a whole
bunch of heuristics that one looks for
various possible Studio 51 within
certain platform it then tells Cloud
Foundry there's God knowing application
uploads / code it's at that point it
takes over great so that have deployed
very well and that concludes our airline
demo did you guys have any questions for
us
palo alto mmhmm yeah there is a well
it's actually this tribute is driven
there are some people in Seattle and
some people in New Hampshire but yeah
mainly out of felt yes we are we are not
ready to announce it yet but BDS and
talks with Bushido is the Bushido
fashion yeah
oh yes I even got their sticker
yesterday did they are a stroller party
yeah so that would be done in
conjunction with a monitoring service so
it's not done by default but if you use
New Relic or another monitoring service
you can do it in conjunction with a
programmatic API so that was the VNC is
this command so kind of I guess what I
was losing through the order from your
applications perspective you'll get
scaled up and down kind of at at the
operation thing whim or some other
automated tools will it's not something
the application specific has to code in
and if you want that auto scale and kind
of thing to happen then you need
something else that kinda understand
what your application straining looks
like
it seemed yeah it's pretty much
immediate you guys saw me do it right
let's see if it has enough memory to six
and yes the album you can actually is to
show this if you now go back to the
browser and just keep refreshing that
page each of those in a cocktail Fork so
you actually should see what the three
results be unstable let's see can we
give it enough load yeah see as we keep
refreshing you can see the ports
changing oh and also yeah so you can
actually see there any other questions
there are some portions that use rabbit
but it's mainly written in Ruby and Java
yep any other questions nope it's not I
want to thank you guys for your time
appreciate it call countries or comments
in beta right now and we would love to
hear feedback from you and thanks fall
for your contribution and for helping
