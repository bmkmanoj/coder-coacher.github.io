would you be so kind as to introduce
yourself to the audience so my name is
Kirsten singer I'm the founding owner of
the company with the same name we what
we do is mainly use Arirang in the
embedded space one of our focus points
could you summarize what you talked
about I talked about the grist port and
the crisp software which is a way to run
a land very close to the hardware
basically almost on the bare metal so
you have direct access to the hardware
from air and that actually but what is
driving this little guy over there is
actually the board on top of it this
board we built to get everybody started
very quickly by how I found you
yeah you know it would work you have to
move your body open twice because it
will find you very soon I think it's in
search mode now yeah
so it's driving this little robot we
basically showed off as demo can you can
you talk about the structure of air line
on an embedded system is it roaming
inside of a real-time operating system
is it flash directly to chip how does
how does that work for people that
aren't familiar with that it's running
not under real time it's running with a
real-time operating system it's
basically I mean the world now is unocal
which but the operating system with
quotes is from the 80s and they didn't
invent the world Unicode back then but
determine its a Unicode now so it's
linked to the NBN and then this complete
image gets booted on the order in this
case it's booted from sd card and put
the RAM yeah but you could have also
flash it in
yeah and it's just a single board that
anyone can purchase - yes robotics
projects been setting the sports with
basically as a way to get started
quickly with the software stack yeah and
a congressman
risk Christmas yes there was a part mr.
P yeah so you have a demo for this
little robot down here
would you like to to walk us through
that demo so yeah I mean I just wrote
like recordings of your rotor is a movie
so I'm a changed it sauce sauce but now
I'm building it it's occurring it's
still doing the level thing yeah and now
I'm using now I'm using a shell function
called net load which basically notes
the module and all the all they have
unknowns if it actually notes so this
would actually work with a whole fleet
of robots it would just one line and you
just reprogram the whole fleet of robots
yeah and you don't have to write
anything for this comes with Ellen so
now it's escape mode I think it escaped
didn't see the ball coming you use it
for serious prototype yeah also a little
bit basically internally use it for
prototyping control systems because it's
very convenient to to have something you
can don't quickly and put on the table
the customer right who are often more
their software writers write more
mechanically oriented and need to have
some physical object object if they put
on there whatever and say you can have
this in a real product then they the
probability they for them to like it
increases so that's our internal use for
this and basically show off that what
you can do with element Hardware right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
