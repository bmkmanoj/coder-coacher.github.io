to talk about Erlang term
this is a mechanism by which we can
store large amounts of data in an
efficient way so it's effectively
breaking the Erlang model of saying it's
single assignment it gives us large
amounts of storage for it's very arrays
or other kinds of object so what is the
presentation will consist of is a
discussion of how to create these ETS
tables how to handle elements how to
search and Traverse and so on
they it's called Erlang term storage and
I think the reason for that is because
you can store objects of any particular
Erlang type in the in these tables so
they provide a mechanism to store large
data quantities data restored as tuples
tuples don't in fact have to be all of
the same size data in the tables is
accessed through a key and most ets
tables are stored as hash tables so
there's very efficient lookup and update
by that means some are stored as binary
trees and we'll talk about those when we
come to it they're very very efficiently
implemented there's a nice mechanism for
search and traversal low-level efficient
unfortunately what there isn't is any
transaction handling so if you're
wanting to deal concurrently with with
to access ets tables with a number of
concurrent processes any transaction
handling has to be programmed explicitly
or you have to use an alternative
solutions such as them in easier
database so they're low-level they're
efficient you get what you pay for
so typically an ETS table is stored as a
hash function so as a hash value of the
the key of the of the table determines
the position in which the the data is
stored and we say that tables can be
what I call what are set bags or ordered
sets sets and bags are implemented as as
using hash tables so the hash function
Maps the key to the elements memory
position an ordered set on the other
hand is stored as a binary tree and that
means that the the element the elements
are stored in key order as you can see
from the in the graphic here that's in
the other tables the position in memory
of the data has no relation no direct
relation to the value of the key apart
from its it's the hash value so the
order of data storage is quite different
from the order of the keys whereas in an
ordered set the data are stored
according to key order and so you can
the particular differences that you can
then traverse the data in key order
that's not possible for the other sorts
of table sets and bags but it's possible
to access data in those rather more
quickly so what this presentation is
going to consist of is a number of
examples of ets tables in practice let's
get started here so what we've done here
is we've called all the all the
functions we're going to look at are in
the ETS module we called new here that
named my table and an empty list of
options and the default here you can see
that we've created a table whose ID is
10 that's the thing was returned it's by
default it's a set and it has an access
it's default access its protected we'll
talk about that in a second and the key
position by default is the first element
in the tuple so we've created that as a
set let's see another example here we're
creating it with private access we're
creating it as a bag and again we'll
talk about the specific details of that
difference there and we're also passing
in the option you can see the second
argument to new is a list of options the
second option is is for it to be a named
table and you can see that the result
returned there is my other table so we
can access that table not using its
table ID but using its name now it seems
bizarre you pass in a name to the first
command but that doesn't mean you can
use that name to access it you have to
say I want this table to be named as an
explicit option
so now tab the second table is one which
we can use access through its name the
first we have to use tab ID okay so
though we've seen some tables been
created and we can delete that table by
you calling the delete function either
with an ideas argument or a table name
so when we create a table we pass in
options including the table type the
access rights and other parameters and
new and and delete will create and
destroy the table and the raziel return
result of new is a table ID so what are
the options well we can create then the
default option is to create the table as
a set so that means every key occurs
once so if you add a tuple with the same
key as an existing tuple the existing
tuple is overwritten an ordered set has
the same behavior but is stored in a way
that can be traversed in key order
that's not the case for a set
a bag it's possible to have the same key
occurring in duplicate tuples but each
of those elements has to be different
and in fact there's a variant of that a
duplicate bag where it's possible to
have the same tuple literally the same
tuple occurring more than once in the
table that's more like what you would
call a bag theoretically so a set every
key occurs precisely once a bag a key
may occur multiple times but the tuples
in which it occurs must be different and
in a duplicate bag it can occur multiple
times with duplicate tuples there are
three different access rights it can be
public so every process can read and
write to the table it can be private
where only the owner that is the process
that created it can read or write to it
and it can be protected where every
process can read but only the owner can
write and the default is that it will be
created as a protected table we saw that
you if we pass in the option name table
that statically registers a name and we
can also say where we want the key
position to be by default that's in
position one the first item of the tuple
but we can ask that to be any any
position than tuple okay now let's have
a look way dad said what we do by to add
elements to tuples to tables we've got a
new table called countries it's a set
and it's it's named country so we can
access it using that that name and here
what we do is we insert a tuple and the
key position because we've not stated
what it's going to be a key position is
position one so we've inserted the tuple
Luigi in Italy
if we look up on the key data we return
the result saying an empty list if we
look up on Luigi we get back the tuple
containing Luigi and Italy now if we
insert into the table the tuple Luigi
Austria its return the result true but
if we do the lookup now we see that
there's only one tuple in there with
Luigi and that is now Luigi Austria
because we created this as a set you
might like to do to perform the same
operation with this as a bag or an old a
duplicate bag to see different behavior
there you can see here that we can
delete a tuple by calling delete with
the name of the table and the key of the
tuple now if we look at Luigi we get an
empty result so there we've got lookup
to find all the LM all the tuples
containing that key insert to insert a
tuple perhaps to overwrite in this case
and look up to look up all the tuples
that contain that key so it's the key we
use to access because of course we're
storing the table hashed on that key
value so I think this this slide just
summarizes what we've seen insertion
insertion must insert an element in the
table this the second point says of
course the tuple must be of size greater
than or equal to the key position so
tuples can be a different size but if
the key position is 2 then the tuples
must go into all tuples in the table
must contain at least two elements if
it's a set or an ordered set insertion
results in overwriting and delete
removes an element from the table
we've seen also look up so that looks up
searches the table for elements with a
particular key value if it's a set will
either get back an empty list or a list
with one element for a bag we'll get
back a list containing 0 or more tuples
it's a set or a bag look at time is
constant if it's an ordered set then
lookup times proportional to the log of
the size because remember it's stored as
a a balanced binary tree so that that
will give us logarithmic access which
for typical typical ordered sets is
pretty much constant as we've said in a
bag you can't have the same object occur
in more than once but you can have the
same key occurring more than once so if
we have a situation where we have two
elements with a key they will be
returned in the order in which they were
inserted into the table so time order is
preserved we get back we insert the
tuple Luigi France I mean set that twice
in fact that will overwrite the second
time and then we insert Luigi Italy we
get back those tuples in the order in
which they were inserted now what we're
doing here is creating a new table
it's a named table and now we're
creating it as an ordered set and let's
insert insert Francesco with XD 301 and
lele with an X so we've now got to two
elements in the table and this is an
ordered set because we didn't override
this the key position is 1
let's insert two more we've inserted a
tuple with key and US and a tuple with
key olá and as you see in the indeed the
window that's coming up though
we'll be stored with key order and as
Francesco Leila and Ola and we can call
we can traverse the table using the
functions first next and last so ETS
first we'll return the key and us and
using that key of course we can look up
the things in that tuple we can and
we've assigned that to and ER so now we
can say what is the next key after
Anders and we get the result Francesco
and we can also put in a literal value
so we could say what's the next key
after Lele and what we get back is Ola
and then if we ask for the next key
after Ola we get back the atom and
dollar end of table saying we were at
the last the last position and if we ask
for the last the last key in there we
get the result Ola so you can see here
that when we're doing these traversals
over an ordered set we indeed Traverse
in the order on the keys so you can see
that that's that's precisely what we do
if we do this on all that sets we do
keys we traverse the keys in
lexicographic ordering if we do it on a
bag or a set we can still do this us for
the first the next the last but what we
will do is Traverse in hash order so
this is in order of the hash value on
the key and not on the key itself now
let's have a look at how we can access
we've seen how we can look things up on
a key how can we access things in terms
of the values in the tuples let's create
a bag table of company called countries
and let's insert we've got Eve in France
she was a cook Shawn in Ireland as a
bartender Marco in Italy as a cook and
Chris in Ireland is a tester no racial
stereotyping here
so we've inserted those four let's see
how we can we can look up data
what we have here is we call the match
function and what we do is we pass in a
tuple the same size as the elements in
the table and in there we can have
variables which are dollar zero dollar
one and so on
atoms literal values like Ireland and we
can have wild cards and a wild card will
match anything now what's the result of
doing this this this tuple will match
dollar one is a variable remember so
that will match or match anything so
this should match anything that has
island in the middle place so it will
match Shaun Island bartender and Chris
Island tester what we get in the result
and not the whole tuple but just the
variables that are named so what we get
back here are Shaun they we get a list
of the fields that are matched so we get
the list with just Shaun in and the list
with just Chris if we look at another
example here we've got two variables and
what we're looking for here are variable
variable cook so looking for all the
tuples that have a cook in the third
position so that's going to be either
ants and Marco Italy we returned and
what we do is we return the list of
variables matched in the order of the
variable so we'll return for each tuple
matched will return what matches dollar
zero followed by what matches dollar one
so in the case of Eve France cook we
return the list France and Eve in the
case of the Marco Italy cook tuple
returned Italy followed by Marco so you
can see that what we're able to do with
this is match values in tuples and
extract just some of the variables so we
don't have to pull back the whole tuple
according to the match we can just pull
the the very the variables that were
interested in so match gives us that
sort of that sort of functionality
so we've seen we match the elements with
the pattern
no matter the pattern has it's a tuple
the same shape as the tuples in the
table underscore matches anything the
atom underscore match is anything the
atoms dollar zero dollar one actors
variables and then you can have bound
any bound data value there and what we
do is return these lists of results now
it's possible with these patterns to get
back a list of all elements matching in
particular pattern and with match delete
it's possible to delete elements
according to match matching a particular
pattern and that gets used for example
when you want to delete an element from
a bag now we do have to be careful all
match operations are implemented as
built-in functions and the built-in
functions have the property that they
change the real-time properties of the
system the reason for this is that a
built-in function will once it's called
run to completion without being
preempted so if you do a an intensive
computationally intensive operation in a
built-in function it will mean that all
your other processes will be starved
during the time that computation is
going on so you have to be very careful
using match operations on big tables
because they stop other processes from
executing so do use these with care and
the advice is to use a sequential
traversal using first and next to
traverse a big table rather than these
high level match operations now there is
another syntax which we can use which
we've seen that we can match patterns
and pull particular limits out we can
actually do something rather more
complex with with table elements let's
have a look at this now
let's create a bag of countries and
we're inserting Eve France and cook Sean
island bar to end up Marco Italy cooks
we've got three elements there in our
table now what we have here using the
Select function is that we are we put in
effectively a little program that's
written in a rather horrible syntax what
this is doing is it's got three parts
the first is a tuple of variables so we
name the variables dollar one dollar two
dollar three in the second part we can
put conditions these we can put a
sequence of guards what we've got here
is the guard that we're asking for
dollar three to be equal to cook and in
the final part of the specification what
we're doing is saying how we want the
results to be presented here we're
saying we want the miniature in a in a
list in the order I'm sorry do want the
minute you know yes in a list where the
order is done the one for dollar to
first dollar one second so that's we're
go and we're dollar one dollar two and
dollar three other would the variables
that will match the three particular
fields so that's what we're getting with
that without much specification and here
you see it written a bit more clearly
it's it is like a program and what
what's nice is that it compiles to
something much more efficient than a
function so using a match specification
will be less computationally intensive
now these things are powerful but
they're complex to write and they're
dead easy to get wrong so what in fact
people tend to do is use a preprocessor
to generate match specifications from
literal functions let's have a look at
that now the operation fun 2ms takes a
literal function that is not not a
variable with a function in it but an
actual function fun etc taking single
parameter which might be a variable or a
list of variables and fun 2ms creates a
much
from a fun and we can see an example in
here in fact what we'll do is we'll
create the match specification we've
seen before but from a fun this time
whoops so here you see that the fun that
takes the variables the tuple name
country and job so we can call these
names that correspond to the fields the
second part of the specification becomes
a guard so when job equals cook and then
the third part of the specification
becomes the return value so the list
with country and name in it you can see
that calling fun 2ms on that fun that
literal function gives us precisely the
match specification we saw before so you
can get the effect of the select we did
using that much specification by writing
it as a function and using fun 2ms so
these things give us a lot of power you
can put in any guide you wish for on the
values of the fields and you can build
whatever result type you want from the
from the results ok so that completes
discussion of match specifications so
we've seen that select is a more general
version of of match that uses a match
specification rather than simply a
pattern that's matched to a tuple it's
possible to take a limit on how many
answers to return in the result if you
do a select the two arguments select
what that does is create a list of all
the results now that's if you're working
with a large table that could have
hundreds or thousands of elements if
you'd like to effectively to co-routine
between the selection and the processing
what you can do is the three argument
version of select which will give you
back a list of a certain number of
results
together with a continuation that you
can call again to get the next the next
batch of results
so that effectively allows you to have
the the the selection and the the
processing running as co-routines select
some process them select more process
them and so on rather than creating a
large list which you then use em process
now of course this this is an issue in
Erlang because evaluation is strict and
so you are if you crease there is a
large list you will create that whole
list before you start processing this
allows you a bit of lazy evaluation
effectively other things really this a
miscellany of issues about ets tables
now it's possible to dump a table into a
file it's possible to read a table back
from a file it's possible to turn the
table into a list of elements these will
be large if they're large they're large
tables it's possible to ask about the
information about a particular table
using ETS info and the table reference
or name that will give you tell you who
its owner is what its fields are its
size whether it's named what it's type
is and so on as an airline tuple if you
call the I function in ETS that gives
you a summary of all the ETS tables in
the system who owns them and you can see
for example in this call to I you get
the code server as its own has two
internal ETS tables which it use uses to
store one source code and the other
stores code names
so it's storing information about about
the modules that are currently running
it's possible we haven't talked about
records but this slide if you're if you
are going to use records gives you
information about what to do with how
you can use records inside ATS tables
what is the lifetime of an ETS table
well a process is linked a table is
linked to the process that created it so
if the process terminates the table will
be automatically deleted so if you
create an ETS table from the shell you
can get peculiar
because if you kill the shell process
the ETS table will itself be killed so
perhaps what you need to do if you're
doing this is have a a second process
which creates and handles the table
other thing to be aware of is oK we've
seen that tables will be destroyed when
they're owning process dies but they are
not garbage collected so if the table is
not going to be used again but it's
owning process is still in existence it
will not be garbage collected you'll
need to delete it by hand and typically
once you get larger than say 20 elements
ets tables will be more efficient than a
list of course you have the overhead of
dealing with us and imperative object
the operations are implementing Biff's
so that that can have an effect they
stored in RAM but there are it's
possible to build disk only ets tables
and that's information about that is in
the dets module there there
handle it in a similar way but we just
concentrated on the UTS tables here
so I think just just pulling the
presentation together we've seen that
that each es tables provide bulk storage
for Erlang objects of any Erlang type
they are keyed on they contain tuples
and they're keyed on one of the
positions in the tuple for tables other
than ordered sets they're going to
distort as hash tables so efficient
access ordered sets are themselves as
efficiently as possible in their
implementation they're stored as
balanced binary trees elements can be
inserted deleted and so on it's possible
to access them through keys but also
through more general processes that use
matches or actually against a pattern or
indeed at a more general match
specification and we concluded by
talking about a number of miscellaneous
other issues about the lifetime of ets
tables they're linked to the life of the
process that created them but they're
not garbage collected so they need that
process needs to manage the storage that
they occupy but also if you want
to be long-lived then creating them
attached to a shell process might might
have drawbacks that you don't expect
okay so I think that's it for ATS tables
