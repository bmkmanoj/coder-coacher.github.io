something so the first problem a trove
of the next year was a little program
that converters output from our time
registration system into things that are
sped into Excel to calculate the monthly
total of spending on research projects
exactly so I thought maybe not talk
about the first program at brunel is it
and go different route and then just for
the faint of heart I will be saying
things if this doesn't follow us try to
stand still I will use the word Java
another youtuber iphone plus a blip
through the talk at some points and I
will may not be as kind to them as
proponents of those religious are so
guys everyone your front might be things
common good so first thing this is how
job and Python programs react to you
when you say that this might be
something else you could use and and
since I go around and I end up talking
in the numerous Java conferences I get
used to this the thing is you should
have an open mind the thing that
surprised me was some fine we had a
discussion on the early Christians main
list a very friendly place and I had the
audacity to suggest using the links here
to teach the wonders of the the Berlin
BM the beam to get sober Reagan's turn
into these raving orcs and still going
to meet some of them around the
iran-contra it's like I told you about
this Alicia thank you so I think just as
it was a warning you now fresh you're
coming into the elixir kinetic we're
building it let's not go down that route
let's stay open if some width fellow
comes along say I think I can prove
improve upon the leaks yet we embrace it
said moment and all that so that people
and then comes to tons nothing back Joe
and I slightly different semantics that
I think syntax is irrelevant that
there's obviously hideously bad syntax
like Roman numerals not good for things
you can also take Egyptian fractions
they insisted on only using your
fractions so if you have to write write
something like say five sixths you'd use
the symbol for to first and then one
sift and you have 56 which means you
have horrendously long fractious but
that notation that out apart from bad
syntax syntax is returning every time we
meet a person that starts arguing over
this is particular relevant when you're
talking about earlier which you have to
do it up anyway when you're doing Alex
yet they start talking about syntax
that's a person not willing to change
have fun with them and then move on then
are worth waitin but it is important
thinking thinking is everything it's how
you think that's all that matters so if
you think like an old version and you
come to the beam you need to change your
thinking that's the most important thing
that is because language shapes thinking
and now we're not talking about a
programming language but the concepts
and things you have in those programming
languages that is how that you're
thinking and that means at the end of
the day language is everything and now
we can just take these free slice and
confuse the hell out of anybody that
hasn't had the time to think about this
but
language is everything but it's a
language of concepts and how we put
things together that's really important
not semicolons over to win or whatever
not relevant just here so now we get
back to my journey with Lego Mindstorms
how many of you do have a legal my scope
set seven on 89 good curious 12 good so
my first encounter with Leo my scones
wasn't 2008 and as you can see I was not
a happy trooper I went to to to billund
occur remember it because my wife was
pregnant with her second child and my
son we just we'll just go in and try
this link minds come thing they had this
room in here we just try it which is
pride will not buy anything so we go in
and wonderful environment and everything
and we program a robot my son is like
he's six and a half at that point and
we're having fun so I ran out into the
shop and a fire set of Lego Mindstorms
and I had to speak about past the wife
and all that so you know obviously this
then we come home and it turns out that
the environment you had in that lab was
a special one that made it easy to work
with this and then you're thrown into
this laughs you thing which was created
to generate automated process control of
atomic reactors or something and you're
just sitting there with your six and a
half year old and you just both least
staring at the screen what's going on I
can't use this so had to sell that set
up the rhinestones I'm sorry I didn't
have time to work unfortunately i sold
it with the profit so I mean I'm an
engineer so I do smart things so time
passes my son grows older and then he
starts expressing out of his own will I
promise you out of his own will a desire
to have a legal minds from said yeah so
it was the cross my heart hope to die or
that own go so we get one for Christmas
2013 and then this experience happens we
get into the visual environment and it's
the same chat sorry said this work it
just is you all these things and you
putting you take something apart as a
visual random read the documentation
from an elite drag it into her
environment and then I'll now do
something extra belated and it turns out
that there was another living thing to
further down that would work together
the figure you fought about because the
other one had some internal but boo boom
that it did and you just sitting there
so we shared the rather expensive report
mindstorms and was just sitting there
for a year Christmas 2014 I get annoyed
with having bought my son something so I
just told my wife my private time this
Christmas is hacking you next year on
the commencement so it works like this
that's me in my lap trying to do things
and it it actually carried over from
Christmas enter into this year there and
I started packing fix up and putting a
viper together and that meant we were
actually getting closer to something
because my son said after realism code I
can understand this code we lovely so
and then you started trying and talking
try riding a few function he wrote
something everything broke my conclusion
of this was lisa face when you can
program at this so i still have my
league of mice chrome Shelled there in
terms of helping my son but we'll get
back to that there will not be a time
lapse a and come back a future or
whatever but will then return to the
teaching of medics in a bit so the lazy
on the Yui 3 fortunately Alicia is here
and we have these guys crazy guys that
are putting linux on
car you can't get into your mind storms
and it's building in demons boom life is
good then you open up yes SH into the
vein you do an instrument on which is
just out get installed Berlin country
where is the capsule you not you get a
warning on the command line don't worry
there and then you answer them to
preoccupy the next year and voila you
have elixir on my scope which is good
this is something that's doable even for
a there are sale after all these years
of working in management not so
technical guy anymore so this is this is
doable so anybody should be able to do
it basically it's the message here now
of course you need to do is an alchemy
and this is mine storms because you get
a file based interface to everything you
hoping so the might the break their put
a wire in and put a bolt in and then it
shows up as a device in Sue's class taco
motor and then it will be motor 0 if you
take it out and put it in it becomes
motor one ah nice and it generates a lot
of files this is what you get after you
put in a motor all these files are
things you can do something with and
you're just sitting at the first time
point what am I supposed to do with this
most of it is documented because these
are Confucius doing things they actually
document what they do so this is good so
you can go in and understand things so
if you want a motor to run you go in and
you take the duty cycle spfile and you
write a number between minus 100 plus
100 depending on if you want to move to
go forward or backward they're easy and
then you write a 1 to the run fire and
starts running which is kind of kind of
nice however you're just doing this in
the command line so it is sitting there
and you're cutting stuff and you are
reading stuff and you're yeah not
optimal for things so we do all these
phase innovation you start writing a
base library
things in there and then you can see if
we go back one slide there's a lot of
things you need to cover in your library
and lots of these fits our single reads
from file and civil rights to a file
this sounds like teachers work and it is
so ends of a good reason for actually
using macros yeah this is the only same
reason for using macros so far i've seen
so careful because then there are other
bits in the code and you can see the
link well desperately opportune an actor
so be careful use them yeah so yeah i
can define a motor pump proceed run it
is writable and it has a male in the max
value gene good we have a motor for a
duty cycle its arrival nope you can read
what it's doing and you have a stop mode
and then these radical and you can set
it to a number of different things so
and then the list goes on for all these
things you have there so that's
basically us I'm not done that I break
myself whether they I've just worked
with the guy that did most of it and
reading the documentation and riding off
these diff motor property with
whatever's in the documentation so that
it fits and then you have access to
these things then you also have some
things like reading the values it's
actually quite nice because then you
have a get function name which is in the
name of whatever thing you want to
reverse it is the duty cycle then you do
some checking here make sure you get a
full file filename out into a beach with
a utility function and then turn the
value you read into a string on integer
or Adam student into an ancient Rome
Ethel and then you're done and then this
macro expansion valve works and then you
have all these things available to to
program so that means we can actually do
something so here I'm telling the motors
to go forward with different speeds and
you can see just add some sea air to
signify which port there on we don't
know put the motors on the input ports
it just gives weird things and then the
chauvinist
registered there and then you can to
color sets here get the color and then
some parameters to any have color this
is wonderful this is what you want I'm
in a language I like love and I can just
write simple things to connect my legal
mind some stuff so that makes me like
this very very happy true book it's just
smiling when you get to this stage okay
then you're probably gone show me some
legal and you'll be looking at me when
whitey hyperlink oh thanks I'm a chicken
I do not do live stuff my presentation
simply not but what i will do is i will
show you video let's see if we can get
this puppy to show the coming does he if
we play this magic as you well know I'm
anyone can see it when I've seen it
before so rangement we just took your
displays
oh and so they can see it and this is my
Swedish colleague Timmy cerco not much
designs not hit right at that's a
creation he did with Lego Mindstorm and
as you can see I don't think he's an
engineer and I think he's a computer
scientist it's way more creative that me
I'm just in the air I wouldn't do the
waiting's and all that but he he did it
all nice and you see everything is good
night so he he brought up some nice
squiggly lines for the robot to follow
and enter dancing and any anybody that
knows Swedish really well don't don't
listen while they're talking so
let's give me talking by the way so it's
actually working quite well who will see
the challenge that gets closed down at
the bottom look at this is following the
the left side of the line and then who
oh we found it again in those platforms
then we will not do what I did when I
was testing this video and everything XD
did it fast echoes with the audion and
it sounds like they're speaking Spanish
for something so there's probably a
hidden message in the suite is this a
good good so sorry I'm a chicken you can
come and flock me afterwards it's okay
the doors open they're good so then I
need approach to these things and I'm
having it's actually running a fixie and
everything so the native approach to
doing this would be your one process
that's a controller it does everything
it has a timer the tix and tells it
every time they need to read the census
and then it changes the motor settings
by using the library we have there
that's however the naive approach
because there's no leverage of processes
you should be using processes because if
you're not using process you're having a
bad fit you might as well code this in
Python yeah the thought of that right oh
see oh see purpose or even worse you to
code this in Java there will be no
conceptual gain here so we need to do
something about this so we need to think
about this the golden Trinity of early
and of course I Manowar the interval and
priests learn how to go around
and showing this one wolf there this is
actually something that you as Alexia
are alchemists have to keep in mind as
well this is the divine intervention
that hit Joe and the team at the
computer science lab this is like it
comes from the bottom this is the
oneness of the beam hallelujah this is
what you need to think about and it
happened somebody asked me what would
they have to chain away from going for
you to stop using it another you take a
walk when you do these things never
think in front of your computer people
that are thinking in front of their
computer are not thinking period so take
a walk yeah those are took a good long
walk and I don't think if you take these
free things out just I love them I'm i'm
done with early and transitivity I get
done with Alex this one you two have
share nothing any system where you don't
have it with lightweight processes and
message passing is going to cause you to
lose sanity or you become into one of
those Java Enterprise programmers that
are just like zombies going to work
every day you don't want to go there do
you combine this with fail fast you need
to be really really aggressive in your
code if you're trying to catch
exceptions please go back to Java enjoy
pages of exception handling that went
wrong and then make a career out of that
don't do it in Iraq or Alexia fail fast
whenever something happens you have to
be Japanese about it you bring out your
knife and you do a seppuku die
infinitely you do not deserve to live
there is very fast this is of course
sometimes an issue there and when you
put curry advice if you're trying to
move things that uses these things of
fail fast or we let it crash don't do
what I did a motorola we did police
radio system sir we did a little gateway
in in our line and we said ran around in
the hallways with these conscious people
knew that these Raiders had to work all
times because otherwise police officers
would be shocked without having their
radio don't say that in trash it is not
good for your career opportunities pick
your words so can we come to vega
anything that is the golden thing you
need to add to recover from fail fast
without proper failure handling this
approach of a past will not work and
it's a combination of these things that
makes rowing and thereby alexia golden
really important so if you're managing
this in your programs when you get
beyond the let's go have fun and learn
the thing you have to think about if
python is not your thing that means you
go back and you start applying this
because you don't want to go to Titan
good so what her in this thing is you do
some proxies for the sensors so have a
process for each sensor so when you want
to talk to a sensor you go for a process
and then in the reading time of reading
that where a particular sensor is inside
that process it's not in your main loop
for meeting the system and then whenever
you have a change in value you send a
message back so the controller process
that's one way of doing it this is a
good fit good fit because you're using
processes in you're using this is
passing will stay away from the fail
faster and pay her anything this stasis
just focus on these things their first
step so you have a color sensor the
first thing you do is you caught down
the wrong I briefing there you read the
color you do some problem to figure out
if the value has changed of it if it's
just not just the jetta thing then you
tell the controller so the message to it
and then you repeat by sending yourself
a check message which is the one you
actually laxing to there in the first
place now this is nice this is just one
process to one simple job and whatever
it takes
it sends a message to those that are
interested in known that the color it's
really has changed event earn wonderful
what's not to like so then the bumper is
the same thing you read the sensor check
it expressed you tell the controller and
you repeat nice and easy code and I can
have these two things called cystic that
has two separate processes and as such
it was so eloquently explaining early on
they do not share anything meaning I can
just separate the two things I don't
have to or have all of this in one big
humongous thing that's trying to read
all sensors and detective which one was
red and then do something even more
parental separation of concerns this is
what you have to do with processes use
lots of them you can always never use
too many processes and if you want to
see how to go the circle processes go to
my github account look for my game of
life and presentation in their life I'm
using a process for each cell in the
game of life thing and it rocks period
just go have fun with it yeah so I'm the
architecture and this is what is it
becoming slightly more interesting
because you need to be able to talk to
all the tea with what you're doing and
just tell them people it's in the sauce
II it works a bit of the time but
sometimes you need to talk to people
that are not really able to go to answer
and also you need to be able to reason
with yourself at some points we have the
color sensor it's a process of the
controller aDNA send messages that for
me there show me somebody that doesn't
understand this and you showed me a
manager so they're simple test yeah then
the controller talks to the motors
they're presenting in commands to do
stuff very very simple and
yeah the notation here he is a process
here's a message passing same concepts
as we have in the language learning oily
teal this is the basic things the basic
building process is in my architecture
small semantic gap happiness this is
what makes people not so much in the
Lisa word yet because we don't have that
many people that are over time per- are
very happy people because this magic gap
between the problems they're solving and
what they happen on the tension level
and domains the solving promising is
very small it allows you to move really
really fast so you get feedback fast you
get things done and actually most people
like to do things when they will go to
work if they don't like to do things
they'll end up being into our enterprise
program she's end up about doing
anything and then conceptually yes I
check the corner corner I'm allowed to
do this good and then you just add the
bumper look how you see this especially
because it's just a drawing of any sense
combi hate messages to the controller
again if you can't understand this yeah
you know what's what's going so this is
actually nice so so we have architecture
here and of course then if I let me tell
you the code is really really ugly it
sort of loses the important so let's
look at just slight bits of the code so
the night following as a total it
follows the left edge of the line which
means you can have an ultra thin line
because the color sensors like this so
the line has to be thicker than that of
course implemented shn fsm you see that
then you have married very small small
functions that does some specific
operations on the on the motor to make
it easier to do so let's see here we
have the same gene and first year is the
initial function going into the on the
left side so when you're on the left
side of the line you need to turn
slightly right so of course we have
really function
court forward slightly right this is
what functional programming will to foil
and also say programming other things
and then you say the next state is on
the left state and now you know you took
the motor to go slightly right so at
some point you will meet the line you
cross being on the left side Nash be on
the line they are there and then when
you are in the under the left side and
you get a colouring if it's the target
color you're looking for this alignment
color of the line then you know that
you're on the right side of the left
edge of the line it's okay I look the
same when Jimmy presented this to me
what you're following the left side of
the line yeah think about it oh I'll
endure and then you also have a timeout
with if a timeout have if you keep so
disliked right and you don't meet a line
you're lost so stop when lost and then
you do a stock and then except stop
normal and you give up which is the same
thing to do it's actually the same
things they're doing in the trains if
they don't know what to do they stop
which is a good safety precaution it's
not like I don't know what to do hit the
speed up as sisters there's some safety
critical stuff in here nigga when storms
oh that's good okay and then we have
allstate events and this is if you get
in the bumper hit so you're bumping into
something somebody put something on your
path top motors and event data races
you're taking down everything and then
into a stop and also if you're getting a
stock message in which is somebody from
the outside stop this fate I don't want
to see you running anymore so this is
how you can mix mix in the your state
events and then do with these face nice
and easy and you have this like bumper
hit it will sit with top of all events
coming in all whatever state you're in
if you get a bumper hit to stop that's
nice separate separation of concerns
makes the code easy to understand you
good so niceties of this is you actually
get protection of the hardware in by
having that process there but it's not
in the library right now and one of the
things you have to think about that if
you take a motor and you tend to go
forward backward forward pick up at some
point mechanical things will break
computer programs not going back and
forth they made for that if they can't
handle that they're written in Python so
there you can ask your face and that's
important thing when you deal with
anything the real world you need to be
able to protect the weird word from in
sentences of the program and trust me
your programmers you will do insane
things I've done it I've had added test
system that Motorola where choke one
radio moved it from one place in the
world which in the real world moving
over 500 kilometers in one millisecond
and immunity after moving it I took it
back another 500 kilometers and for some
reason the system didn't like that so I
had to put protection for my own
stupidity and my testing system so it's
the same thing yet we will all do stupid
things put some protection into
especially heavy expensive gear like the
Lego Mindstorms you don't want to be
frying and because you're just doin real
weird stuff on their rations will prob
easy and then you can have this new
thing of the sensor readings because as
we as programmers own and program is
black and white the value as a day but
the minute you Texans sensor there and
you put it on something there's light
coming in from sites and everything it
will not read this the color the same
way all the time so you need to soon now
this varies but that's actually done
inside these processes now that's ok so
you obtain this I put elixir on on the
Mindstorms and I'm sshe into it you can
actually also do another thing you can
have the normal software on the ev3 and
then you
read commands from your computer to it
and control it so you don't need to do
all this moving files over from where is
it on your own machine copied over to
the SD card and put it in and all that
you can just do it over blue tub
bluetooth and Wi-Fi with Easter egg hunt
so you have things like here output
stock has an opcode now we get it down
to hardware this is where girl I'm also
joins this is fun and you have different
things here specified and then the
direct months they have a command
encoding and when I saw this in the
documentation time talking to some guys
that we're doing these things in Java
and I look at this one and I just us
sizing this is awesome because this is
something we can do really really nice
in Elysium and the job of people like to
know this is scary stuff we have like
ten classes trying to implement this
okay so after that then i went to see
some of them had 33 hours on the train
and i got most of this done in the next
year then be some of it so here when i
do the encoding of the fig we had to
affirm before we have command type the
command itself which is a binary created
somewhere some in cody phones merge them
in with the default options for the
option coming in and then you take the
message counter which is something you
need to send it a number because if you
get a want a reply back see that it's a
rough ride so the message with the
number you said it then and some
allocation stuff their local global
don't worry about that and here's the
beauty this is like that's not the full
thing but that's like four or five java
classes here
so just say the bite size of this leads
to know the size up front when you're
sending these direct commands it's just
the size of the command + 5 because as a
head of it for the message counter has
to go into a little engine encoder to
tune by fate then you have the command
type size 8 global easy and you can
actually understand it so you can look
at the specification for this you look
at this code ago I'm doing the right
thing so you don't need to write take
10,000 java j unit test cases to prove
that you've done it right this just
works happiness same thing goes for the
parent / amazon coding so here we have
one thing that says then if the batter
is ready this more i'll use the LC 0
function and that puts in a short format
thing i sized one look look at this we
down at the pig liver and we don't care
just this one big will have to sit and
relax into it in a sensible way go home
and do that in whatever the language see
didn't see till just for the fun of it
brush off your Kernaghan and rich people
and try to do these manipulations in c
and after that you check your head to
see if you haven't pulled all your hair
so yeah and then you have another one
here now it's not our short format
that's when it's in there up to 128 put
a long formal in say it's a constant
constant O'Banion everything here for
the crn for good measure come to me the
wine in the documentation and then
suffolk there and then the value itself
done here voila and it goes on nice and
easy again short semantic small semantic
gap so between your documentation and
your code the gap is very small so you
can avoid writing too much documentation
so you can focus on the real busy
solving the problem and not writing a
class hierarchy
think of ten classes with multiple
inheritance and what happened so
beautiful thing one of the things to use
when you want to convince somebody say a
manager about using Galaxy or something
this is dead easy bluetooth issues so we
had fun doing this and we asked the
program we were at the same program
running out on our own machine and then
communicate with bluetooth to the mind
stone thing and what you say now we'll
just follow the line unfortunately
there's a bit of Bluetooth latency on
the lego mindstorm not just a little bit
but it proves when you send it too much
and actually if the funny thing is sit
in the message you win for wait for the
reply send another message wait for
reply and the latency just goes up what
I don't know what they did the coating
there there and the fingers and I don't
have a video of this because you just
like the same thing if one of your
friends is really really drunk you
shouldn't take a video and put posted
somewhere it's not fair because the
robot was like it was all over the place
and it was just trying to follow the
line it just didn't work due to this
latency so so that was really terrible
over there it might work over Wi-Fi I am
not yet to test this one then because I
managed to buy the only Wi-Fi dongle
that works with the ev3 but it needs a
windows machine to be configured the
world is not perfect so anyway so that's
something that unless if people want to
play with this just ping me mainland
which we talked about how to fix this
problem and the library yeah that's the
man that's Jimmy he's the guy that I had
the idea for this did some initial stuff
and then he took my initial utterly
stupid stupid ramblings and he just ran
with it
generated these two libraries so you
have the full diaper here that you yank
on to the linux ping you run it and then
you have the direct commands here where
you can do some brutal things and put
that in and try to mitigate them with
that that one will be changed to do
something with Wi-Fi because I think
that has lower latency than the
Bluetooth hopefully because it's just
it's like the idea of code stuff on my
machine have the program running there
and then the mind stone robot just does
things without having to copy files over
and all that that of course we also
credit for the idea or problems give me
so just just spam Amy if it's not
working so now now we'll come back to
teaching program because I had an issue
here I have an i bring I'm a programmer
I can use the library awkward a son
start typing simulation at knew he had
experience with you one I think before
and who's just three typos and
everything and then he kept these
wonderful error messages which are
better in the next year but it's not
like for the thirteen-year-old kid to go
oh I understand and I dig this error
message now I can just keep off my stuff
no we're still not there so so I need to
teach him some programming because the
visual environment very difficult
anybody who's tried it has anybody tried
doing that or just went straight to
hacking anybody use the labview on the
label nobody you just bought the
Mindstorms and have it sitting there
okay fair enough trust me it's very very
difficult to do that with this one beds
are paramagnetic CFS so how do we solve
this problem well you Joan dog food so
I'm teaching now I'm teaching for free
at my son school I'm teaching the medics
here but the class is called junior
gamestop and it's everything I do is
available for free on being slaughtered
walk / JP futuna be stopped I'm trying
to and there's a google proof so you can
come and even follow along and i'll try
to post
but so far you would be surprised here
because you have forgotten what it means
not to be a native ipad person or tab
per person these young people they are
native with that not computer people so
what I have from the initial learning is
using the command line what's come
online and you just adding that
that goes to my first lecture just just
need to bring them in and then I haven't
been using a Windows machine for like
ages so how do you how do you start a
command line in windows so hit luckily
they were out of out of the comfort zone
and I was like group I'm out of my
comfort zone I don't know how Windows
works anymore so we found these windows
out by the way you can write CMT
indicated command line but that's alien
and going between the tribes what is
that changing into a directory so these
are things that they don't have anymore
they don't have the luxury of somebody
like me I started I've programming days
in a week 20 with a massive 3483 bytes
of memory amazing stuff you can do with
that and you're straight into the
command line and you just hacking stuff
you can use to that but they they're
born on a tablet so that's very pretty
you have to keep that in mind if you
start doing this with kids then it so
it's a different experience for them
when you say anything to them they think
oh you mean word no I thought we'd work
because the first time some of them were
just opening upward to start editing
elings your programs yeah it's not super
often so that's something there so you
need to bring that across as well
functions however are you see they get
that and especially if you present it to
them in saying here's something you know
from mathematics let's translate this to
licks it and then the home
that actually works so functions are
good ty doing the same thing with
objects and then bring some Kleenex
because they don't be crying and then
recursion it comes along slowly not this
week but last week I went hey let's do
some recursive functions that was a bit
Steve I had some they look like i was
presenting object oriented stuff to them
so i just reverted for that i did my
apologies is that we will take that in
small bits but they can actually start
to appreciate some of the thinking that
goes into recursive functions so it
comes along slowly functions a good
starting point there so i'll continue to
write something on the group i have on
this one you do welcome to read in there
ask questions how to use material and if
the fix mission just tell me and I can
help you run this class in your own
neighborhood and by the way it's not
complete yet I'm doing it every week I
said to it so I haven't got like 20
weeks of curriculum yet so people
butting in would be nice so a new visual
language so now good you're not turning
into aux thank you look at that so for
experiment so if you release all your
attention of your daily work and then we
go on a different dream voyage with me
you will start in a nice visual
environment mm-hmm makes the bracken
problem things like that you open up the
boxes as you become more familiar with
the things and you can see what's inside
the box get the same concepts for this
early environment until the day you do
something really cool the coding
european test so has this nice
environment where i can just do things
this sounds like a good environment to
be it but i think so because I print up
the environment so this my dream you can
wake me up
so scratch thank you to something
similar so they have these very
intuitive these things in that nice
environment these intuitive box waiting
just cracked Iranian if you do things
and all this one of the thing is
intuitive for sequential imperative
programming so that's like swearing in
the Church of her life sequentially
sequential at least imperative
programming this is like four innocent
what have you so but the environment is
nice and it's easy to understand so what
if what if we take the next year thing
here good concert for robots so I'm
thinking about the mind stone finger get
the processes and message passing the
fifth the domain we get a good
architecture maybe we can do something
so see the initial tournaments this one
should be each sensor actuator just a
process why asked you have from whatever
you have into the break the controller
it was some sort of communication line
so you can see this is what it should
look like of course somebody with proper
design skills who write actually draw
the color sensor here and do some things
and have them look like a real wire
because this can obviously not work in
any marketing department but you get the
idea it's the concepts that has to be
there and then you can just have basic
implementations for these fins the
control over have a basic implementation
that does something of course utterly
stupid but it is it does something when
you connect things to it so they come
with a default behavior and then you
open up the box there and you can see
what's inside of it so here we have a
woman what D is for but have an initial
state you received from the input port
into a variable called distance so in
each and many visualize that this is
done like nice like scratch of my
handwriting then you send one
distance to the output port and your
next date is just going back to the
initial stage I started it so you get an
environment you've just opened up the
box just as you become more familiar and
you can change the code in there when
you know a bit more about the coding hmm
so this is the environment i would like
to create it will happen when they
instigate the 48 hour a day so that
there are the more time to actually do
these things it takes time to these do
these things but I think this would be
really cool to work with somebody of
this then for the learning curve the
very simple equation environment you can
have something that's more simple than
what you have today in mine stones you
get a ceiling very fast if you go in and
try any sort of issue of environmental
things you know who this is fun I can't
do that on stage so you just kept off
there and you left where do I go next
there so you can take the complex one
that this lips with the lego mindstorms
and you'll have an insane learning curve
I would like to see how the brain of
those people that actually use that
environment I hadley fun with it I would
like to see how those people look how
their brain works because my brain
doesn't work like that it's just I don't
get it and then you have the same
concepts from start to end you start off
in the visual environment we have
processes message passing these building
blocks and then hopefully you get a
smooth learning experience so if anybody
knows somebody that wants to master
thesis project or something here's a
cool idea and it will only some street
cred credit for photos of
it always does it's it works wonders if
you're in a bar I do legal Muslims you
get all the talk all night plus-minus
cool so thinking the basic concepts just
to recap here processes and message
passing if you're not using processes
and this is passing go back to python or
whatever don't try to use earlier licks
your what have you without embracing
these things you should be done using
something that fits the your brain and
the todo en un please remember this and
also be very helpful to the people that
are not getting this point because once
you break through this and you can see
the Sun you can start making wonderful
architectures and things that actually
works in the world like setia showed
before me it's important to do good
stuff to do this way and the modeling of
things is straightforward mostly I still
have a few examples we can toggle will
be aware I don't know exactly what the
natural process and message fashion
solution is but with a bit of thinking
it comes along and that means that at
all times this is if you need to have it
a to Monday this is your tattoo and this
is what you should be thinking about and
if i call it free n in the morning what
are the killers of airline the divine
intervention that came to Jovah the tea
yeah nothing fail fast and figure
anything forget one of them and you know
you know what you just worked it out so
thank you
that's good okay that is actually what
the heck oh man comes the program
environment us so when you put all
together all those blocks they actually
compile it into little commands for
programs there and they sent the whole
thing over and then it's executed I
would not like to write in that style
because that means that I'm not having
access to processes don't have access to
message party to the separation of
concern i'm having here between the
color sensor the bumper would be some
sort of normal imperative to the general
attendant and everything so I just yeah
but I could have cost and over the
entire theme files to it but that's what
you do anyway when you copy over the
source files and compile it on the
things that that's not much of a
difference there but i think the cool
thing is is if you get into the mode of
having the running on your computer then
you can mix in other things beside the
Mindstorms and then everything would be
on the same paradigm you're just sending
messages out for things that over
mindstorms it's a direct command do
something and then some motors of things
are doing something you read sensors you
put in a Raspberry Pi together with this
thing and you have the same concept just
write a library the same way so your
control program becomes the same you're
just plugging in different library to
connect different environments in to
your to your system so that's why I
would go
more questions what else so we'll be
back in here one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
