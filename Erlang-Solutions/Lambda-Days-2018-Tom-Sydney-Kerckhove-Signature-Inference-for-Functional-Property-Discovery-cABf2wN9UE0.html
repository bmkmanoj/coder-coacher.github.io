show you some stuff it turns out I have
only 20 minutes to do this so I will
have to maybe either talk really quickly
or leave some stuff out so I will be
talking about my master's thesis what
we've done and hopefully what how we can
proceed after this so this is about
signature inference for functional
properties discovery that probably means
nothing to you at this point the
subtitle is probably much more relevant
to you how to never write tests manually
anymore right just to jump over the
initial motivation section of the talk I
hope we can all agree that writing
correct software is hard if we can all
agree then we can move past this section
of the talk and I can just go on so the
way we approach making correct software
anyway even though it's hard usually
involves trading off what language we
use then we think about maybe we can use
formal methods but that turns out to be
expensive
there are a whole bunch of trade offs to
make but if we assume that we can use
testing to make it easier to write
correct software then that's where this
is going to come in the reason why we
choose testing has the main point to
approve is because that's currently
still the most used approach to making
correct software in the end so one of
the kinds of testing that we start with
is unit testing which is where we
specify one example of an input and an
output and we have to know in advance
what it means for our software to be
wrong and then we can check if that's
actually not the case and proceed to
have something that is known to not have
the mistakes that we think it won't have
so the problem here is that you have to
write them you have to come up with the
examples you have to come up with enough
examples so that you exhaust all your
code paths this is annoying it's not fun
most programmers don't like it now the
alternative to unit testing is property
based testing which we probably already
do in Haskell which is where you specify
an entire generalized property of your
function but this now we need to know
what it means for your code to be
correct you need to describe a
mathematical property of your code in
order to be able to test it which is
even more annoying so the first problem
that you have to spend the extra time
and money to write the test is even
worse than the
of unit tests even though now you don't
have to write a lot of examples to reach
most of your code so this is already a
bit battery but now the cost problem is
worse so if we can ignore the problem of
getting the right generators which is
actually not a problem you should ignore
but for the purpose of this task at this
talk we will have to then the main
problem is that we have to come up with
these properties and that's where my
thesis comes in we're going to try to
discover the properties of your code
based on your code so that you don't
have to think about what you want to
test anymore you can just press the
button and get suggestions for is this
something you may want to test now this
already exists and there will be a talk
about quick spec which is the thing that
already exists tomorrow in the afternoon
you should really have seen the talk
before this talk but that's actually
fine so let's look at the quick example
there is some code you can ignore most
of it you only have to look at the type
signatures we have a sorting function
and a function function that can check
whether a list is sorted if we run quick
speck on it quick speck will say oh
there are these functions in the scope
and here are some properties of it this
is the magic of quick spec you can see
how that works tomorrow afternoon
the problem with quick spec is oh by the
way only the properties from four till
nine are probably things you want to put
in your test suite to test the functions
that we just saw the first three namely
that less than or equal to is reflexive
it's probably not something you want to
put in your test suite to test if a list
is if the sorting function works so we
have to manually pick out which
properties are relevant to test so
here's the problem you have to write a
bunch of code in order to run quick spec
in the first place so you have to run a
write about double the amount of code
I've done you're subject code in order
to be able to discover the properties of
your subject code and if you were
already too lazy to write tests such
that you want to not have to come up
with them manually by writing by using
property discovery to then make property
tests you're definitely never going to
run write this code in order to then run
something to get your properties
so this is the first problem there are
some other problems namely that quick
speck can only work for monomorphic
functions because you cannot generate
input two parametric functions the next
problem is that quick speck is really
slow it tries to find all of the
properties of all of your code which can
be really slow there is some explanation
here we can just keep it for this 20
minutes so this is where my work starts
we wrote something called ez spec that
is supposed to solve the problems with
quick spec the first part is to automate
the part of writing this entire piece of
code so that you can actually run quick
spec and the way we do that is we will
try to generate this part of the code
the rest is sort of boilerplate the
input that quick spec needs is called a
signature and it contains these
functions which are the functions that
are in scope that you want to get the
properties about and it has this
background where you can already tell
quick spec about properties you already
know about so that quick spec can then
do some optimizations and also not
rediscover those properties and then the
main quick spec function is of type
signature to i/o signature which is
where it will find the properties of all
of your functions and then put them in
the background field over the signature
for the and the reason this is the way
it works is because then you can compose
sorry not compose combine the results of
multiple quick spike runs sequentially
so the way we generate this signature we
actually have to generate code that
represents our that quick spec can use
the way we do that is we look at our the
functions in scope with the GHC API
there are some parameters in there but
you cannot have function types with
parameters so we have two mono mortifies
this there is a lot of complicated stuff
behind this but in practice we uppercase
the variables then we give it a name we
can also get that from the GHC api we
put them together in this signature then
we have an expression that represents a
signature that we can give to quick spec
now the current situation after this
automation is that we can have this
little
piece of code where there are only two
functions in scope namely the reverse
function and insert version we can press
a button or other run a command and we
get the signature sorry the properties
automatically so no need to write this
code to run quick spec anymore the
problem now and now we can actually
measure how slow this is this has an I'm
not gonna say anything specific terrible
complexity so you can see that if you
have 15 functions in your code base this
will take about five minutes to run 100
seconds it's long that's the point so
maybe we can do something better to
explain how we made something better I
have to really go back a bit and say
what our property is well the top is
what you'll see in the output but this
is actually sugar for two functions that
take a list map to something else and
those two functions are equal in the
more general case it's two functions
from A to B for some a and B where the a
can be generated by randomness and the B
can be checked for equality now why is
this thing slow it's because there can
be many functions in scope and the
maximum size of the properties that we
want to discover is you have to specify
it in advance and it plays a big role in
how slow quick spec will discover the
properties now the big idea we have is
that we're usually not interested in all
of the properties of your entire code
base you're usually interested in the
last function you wrote because that's
the one you are going to want to test or
maybe you just want to specify one of
the functions you're interested in but
it's usually not all of the properties
of all over your code but just the
properties that are relevant to this
warm function you're interested in so
the idea is to make a smaller signature
from the functions that are in scope by
choosing only the functions that are
relevant to the function were interested
in and then running quick spec on that
two trivial ways to do is to do this is
the first one is called full background
which means everything is interesting
and empty background which means nothing
except the thing we're interesting
interested in is interesting
so the empty background strategy as
we'll start to call it will only find
things like reflexivity so only
properties that relate only to the
function that you're interested in while
full background is essentially the same
as automating who expects and you can
see that empty background is already a
lot quicker there is actually something
in front of my screen there we go the
better or not okay right now there is a
bit of a box code here that tells you
how many relevant functions properties
you can find with both of these
strategies based on a whole bunch of
examples that we wrote and you can see
that empty background finds a lot less
relevant properties yes but relevant
properties and full background does
because empty background can only find
the properties that are only related to
the function you're interested in but by
the way empty background can only find
relevant equations and not the equations
that aren't relevant because every
equation must include the function that
you're interested in so we define
relevant property as a property that
includes the function you're interested
in then we made something else something
as stupid as we could think of and it's
by looking at the distance between the
function you're interested in and the
other functions by name I have only five
minutes okay
by name so you're looking to the five
most similar functions by name and then
choosing those to mean these are
interesting turns out this is fast
enough to be practical not like quick
spec it's not it's faster than quick
spec it's fast enough to be practical
you find a lot better a lot more than
with empty background but it's still
more great with the two similar things
by looking at the implementation so the
distance between the implementations and
then also sorry I have to do this rather
quickly and then also the distance
between the types and it turns out these
are all fast enough but they're all not
but not much better than the others
we've also tried some other things like
other kinds of distances instead of the
hamming distance we can choose the Edit
distance or whatever we've also tried
Union Union
the previous strategies where you say
the five most similar by name and the
five most similar by type turns out it
wasn't really better and then the
breakthrough was to see that most
properties only relate a very small
number of functions and if that's the
case then we can run quick speck more
than once and you Union the results now
I have to go through this really quickly
so if we can combine outputs of the of
multiple runs then we essentially want
to find very small signatures to give to
quick speck and then combine the results
of those now how do we how do we find
very small signatures we just take the
tuples of where one of the functions
that's interesting and the other one is
in your scope this is called chunks
turns out this is still fast enough
because it's linear in time and it finds
more stuff now I don't have a lot of
time so I have to go through all the
other things we tried the point is we
made something that is constant time and
it finds more stuff than quick spec does
already because of the way the
properties interact when you Union the
results so this is really cool the
problem is it doesn't work in practice
and the reason why I'm coming here to
tell you about it is because I these are
all practical problems they're not
theoretical problems so we could make it
work the thing is I only have six months
for my thesis so I couldn't do it so I'd
be very happy if there is anyone willing
to work to help me out and making this
work in practice because currently it
only really works on examples because of
things like the C preprocessor and some
scoping problems and then in the future
we also want to see can we do it faster
because we can now do it in seconds and
not milliseconds can we think of new
functions that we can already put in
scope that weren't there initially
initially like constants for example if
you're interested in a function about
numbers you probably want to include
zero if you're interested in this then
you probably want to include empty lists
into the scope etcetera I have to go
through this really quickly right and
then
the other question is can we apply this
to IO code we can discover properties of
pure functions and that's really cool
but you cannot really discover
properties of functions like get
something from the standard input
without abstracting over the concept of
effects such that the functions you're
talking about are pure so that would be
something to look into
we've also not looked into any way to
see whether some relevant properties are
more useful than others and it would be
nice to be able to classify some
properties based on whether they're
going to be useful to the programmer we
haven't found the way to do that yet so
that was it I had I had to go through
this really quickly I wish I could have
told you more about this I hope it was
still interesting if there are any
questions should we feel free to go
ahead now yes so the if I understand the
question correctly the question is are
there false positives yes because that's
how randomness works I'm not trying to
insult you that's just this is the
reason why you will get false positives
that's also not such a problem because
as a programmer you still have to think
do I want this property or not
and if it looks like something that is
true but maybe it isn't because of the
false positives then maybe you've made a
mistake in your code or maybe you can
already see oh this should be true so we
should test it even though it or this
shouldn't be true so I am NOT interested
so you definitely have to go through it
manually anyway yes
oh I've never actually tried that I mean
I probably tried that by accident but I
haven't seen any specific results of
that that's interesting so when I ran
these a quick check property discovery
should I add those discovered properties
to my tests or it will be done
dynamically every run of tests at the
moment you just get textual output that
represents the property so you still
have to you definitely have to manually
select the properties but at the moment
you also have to manually copy paste
them so suppose you define the type
which is a monad but you don't know it's
a minute for example and then you run
the property discovery could it discover
the this type follows the Monad laws and
say to you this is a monitor I think yes
exactly
that's not something new that I did but
a quick spec could already do that so it
can discover more nine laws for you if
you'd like I mean also if you don't like
it it will just do that how good is it
at finding kernel cases especially like
more complicated corner cases than
inventory's or zero do you mean corner
case properties like this so if we
disregard the the false positives it
will find all of the properties there is
no way around that I mean it's like a
suspect may leave some stuff out because
it may not be relevant randomness is
really good at generating corner cases
from my experience so you will more
likely not see a property because of
some corner case then see a property
that isn't true because of some time
