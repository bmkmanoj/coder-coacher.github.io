some of you as you're arriving I guess
that this is maybe a little early for
some of this content but we'll see as we
go first off it's an honor and a
pleasure to be here in front of
everybody today in the home of Erlang
and see so many great faces some new
people and talk about something that
I've sort of been obsessing over for a
while now that's thinking through some
of the problems that we have and working
with software development and so from
the beginning I would have to start with
this quote here Mark Twain once said
there's no such thing as a new idea it
is impossible we simply take a lot of
old ideas and we put them into sort of a
mental kaleidoscope we give them a turn
and they make new curious combinations
so taking this it's a little sad at
first if you think about it I mean if
there's no such thing as a new idea then
where do we find levels to be able to
innovate and in that case I'm sure all
of us have been in these situations
where you know we're like oh I have this
I have this great idea okay I love
computers I love programming I really
enjoy waffles how do I make those work
together I got it I'm gonna make waffles
that look like keyboards and shortly
thereafter a few Google searches later
you're like Tom right
somebody else beat me to it this happens
countless times I mean throughout my
career I've experienced so many
situations where friends or you know
family even myself thinking about
different ideas different concepts
trying to be able to strive for that one
time when I can just be like I'm gonna
have an original idea or others and
they're like this is gonna be great and
you're like um here's three people that
are fighting for companies that are
trying to do the same thing this guy has
a patent that's weird
so this led to this like concept that I
had when starting my career this vision
that I had of the world where we sort of
like live in the middle in this in this
middle area and there's this frontier
all around us of exploration that we
look for and just on the outside there's
this like line that we draw between
what's innovative and what's like not
and what's the normal and so it feels
like you need to just spend your whole
life working toward getting to that edge
because if you can just get there you
can have an original concept and so you
start this journey alright and this
journey is usually just covered with
this shroud of knowledge so we've got
this this this landscape that's just you
know your worldview and and if you
imagine the edges of the shroud as being
you're just you know your mental
capacity it's it's at this time when
you're starting out in any sort of
career areas it's quite small it's
manageable feeling nice and so as you
start your journey you start to venture
out words and you'll uncover that shroud
a little bit more you'll discover new
concepts and for each moment that you
discover it opens the edges up further
and then you realize not only at that
point this new thing that you've learned
but all of these other things that you
didn't know that you didn't know and by
this point here from where we started
tightly all the way on the inside where
we have this just easy world view we
could see the edges we knew that there
were just these high-level concepts that
we didn't understand was manageable but
out at this area now we've explored so
much we pushed the edge of the shroud
back it almost becomes unbearable to be
able to realize that through our careers
of learning we almost know about we
almost
more about what we don't know than what
we do and sometimes this feels tough
because you just your run down you and
when am I ever going to get to that edge
so that I can finally have this new idea
and in this moment I sort of looked back
and and thought about all of those
different experiences all of the times
where you know you get to the point you
walk up to the next station and and you
like you you you fiddle a little bit and
then you you produce an item and then
you look at that item and you're like
that is cool that it's so cool this has
to be original and you pull up to the
guy next thing you go right he's like
yeah I've been here for like a month
you're like but looking backwards into
this system we can start to understand
these routines a little bit more so if
we expand outwards in one of these
sections we can we can look at what
makes up these experiences and these
experiences are just sort of replaying
the footsteps of those people that have
come before us and what we do is we take
the knowledge and we use some tools and
we take our knowledge that we've that
we've learned we use these tools to be
able to then create the product and it's
going through these exercises I mean as
developers we've all done this routine
learning language is just like this
doing anything is just like this and
most of the time when we when we take
those outcomes those outcomes actually
feed back into our knowledge and that's
what grows our mindset so we're in luck
those areas are all around us we've
weakened now we no longer have to just
strive to be able to push the boundaries
to the edge to see where that that line
is to look out on the frontier you know
there are new ideas there I should say
actually since there are no such things
there are new concepts of things that we
can produce out on that that edge of the
frontier but we don't have to always
look there because we can look at all
the systems that we have around us
because those systems have ways of
feeding back
to each other okay so let's talk about
what you've all actually come here to
talk about today and you know it's
obviously cooking um we all do this I
mean you have to eat some are some of us
aren't as good as others when it comes
to cooking but it is a extension of
creativity and chefs have some of the
most fantastic levels of creativity that
they get at their fingertips so with
cooking I do this often I like to get
together with some friends put together
a wonderful meal and I find inspiration
from all these different places around
me I look at different things on the
internet about how I want to be able to
prepare something take the best ideas
that I think would taste well and I I
mash them together no but but first it
takes a practice to be able to get to a
level where you can start to identify
what the flavors are in these different
areas so you have to start out small
something easy let's make a pizza
Pizza is pretty basic I mean aside from
the toppings people can make a pretty
complex but a basic pizzas all we want
to make and in a basic pizza well we
have to start by making the dough so the
ingredients in this case we've got some
water a little flour some salt and a
little yeast to be able to get that
going and then the topic but first
starting by making this dough uh we take
these things for granted already and
that it would be fairly easy for me to
be able to whip this up and make a pizza
it may not taste good because you know
there's some you know extra ingredients
that others put in to be able to add
flavor but in the most basic sense we
could produce this with this ingredient
list
the difficult part here is when you
break it down well what if we had to
make all our own ingredients what would
that be like I mean I'm interested in
making pizza I'm not interested in
purifying water or milling flour or
mining salt
or culturing yeast those are all quite
difficult tasks but the nice part about
this is in this example as well as
humans were social organisms now we
gather in events like these to be able
to talk and share knowledge and some of
us are interested in solving problems
that others are not and so there's
somebody else out there that decided
that they wanted to be the best at
making flour and that's fine because now
I can use that as a dependency in my
ingredient list for making my goal
happen which is to make a delicious
pizza so another example of this I mean
pizza is one thing and using these
simple ingredients that still require
the work we can build on that and if it
worked for that structure of people
solving different kinds of problems to
produce output that I can use in my
recipes we wouldn't have even more
fantastic dishes like this bowl of ramen
so in ramen there's some basics as well
I mean this seems like a simple idea
soup so humble but the first thing we
have to do with making ramen is make the
terror and then we have the stock and
then we have the noodles and each one of
these ingredients on its own is such a
task to be able to make I mean I'm not
here to actually teach anybody how to
cook or cook ramen but as a small
example of which to break this down
further the Terai step one here I'm not
going to read all of this because we're
not actually making ramen today but you
can see the ingredients I'm sorry the
the instructions to make this go on I
mean you have to take chicken and you
have to saute it and you have to then
add some oil on so there's like this
experience that's involved in this and
and you can see it when you move onwards
that you there's some
there's there talking about ways that
they've been able to incorporate the
slavers back into it and you use and you
use pans to do it certain kinds of pans
and put it on a stove those are the
tools and so throughout the steps of
this recipe we can see several different
things we can see that the time it takes
to be able to produce this individual
ingredient that's not even the reason
why we came here to begin with requires
a lot of effort and tools and experience
and so therefore it's interesting to
consider the idea that recipes they not
only are just a list of things that go
into producing what you want to produce
but they encode wisdom and knowledge and
experience and in addition they also use
tools to be able to do that so this
mechanism of taking the instructions and
applying the ingredients and then adding
it to the tools and then producing the
outcome which may also feed back into
another system or produce the final
result has a striking resemblance to the
way that we build our software systems
today so the same way that we build
software's were like cooks and we
basically take our instructions our
wisdom our knowledge our way to be able
to produce these things we take our
ingredients which may be dependencies or
other code pieces of code from other
projects we feed them into our tools and
out comes an application and so this
system is sustainable to the point where
when we produce larger level systems
those target applications expand
outwards and this produces a structure
that that that in most cases looks like
a lot of the structures we have around
us in the case of recipes recipes
produce food well there's a recipe to
make flour and then when producing that
recipe you produce flour when you
produce flour somebody else can buy it
to use it as part of another recipe and
this tree of dependency just seems to be
more and more inevitable when we look
around us and it's no wonder we've scale
a position to our software engineering
skills around these concepts because not
only is it recipes and not only is it
software but if you replace these
sections in the middle with people you
can see that we have these dependencies
as well and it takes other people to be
able to get to places like this to walk
down a sidewalk that somebody poured to
go over a bridge that's somebody
engineered or ride on a plane and so I
say at this point now that the a part of
a taboo portion and that there's people
out there that look at dependency and
they look at it and they say dependency
is bad and there's people out there that
they look at the pendency and they say
dependency is good and and I say in this
case that they're both kind of right but
it's not about the dependency dependency
is inevitable you can't avoid it if you
were to avoid it I mean imagine you're
in a situation where where we as a
society are working together but you are
like I am NOT going to be a part of this
will to completely distance yourself if
you took the desert island approach
you'd have to build everything yourself
and you might in your lifetime get
pretty far you might have some skill
sets as you're like I can make this Hut
on the beach I can live in it for some
time I can make these tools and those
tools are pretty cool they're awesome
because you made them yourself
but when it comes time for something
happens and that system dies and you're
no longer there what matter does it have
that whole system is collapsed in the
case of humans though are encoded
knowledge that we share especially
through open-source software development
travels on for a lifetime and allows
future generations and co-workers around
us to be able to gain that kind of level
of experience so an interesting thing
about this because since dependency is
inevitable we might as well embrace it
there's this man Sir Francis Galton he
was a Victorian era statistician and uh
like most mathematicians and engineers
that I know he was obsessed about things
like his job and calculating numbers to
the point where I mean we've all been
there you walk to a fair and you're like
obsessed with how things are engineered
or how the rides work so Sir Francis
Galton he attended a fair in the early
1900's and at this fair there was a game
we've all seen this game you had to
guess the weight of an ox
typically count the beans in a jar or
something like that in this case it was
they had to guess the weight of an ox
and there were over 500 entries in
guessing the weight of this ox and so as
Sir Francis Galton was obsessive over
mathematics he wanted access to those
numbers and at the end of the day he was
he gained access to all of the different
guesses the contest was over and what he
found was that any one individual guess
that was placed in the attendance nobody
was close they were miles away and
when he took the mean of all the guesses
it was within 0.8 percent of the actual
weight of the Ox this is incredible and
this actually is the reason why Sir
Francis Galton went on to produce work
in the area of Statistics he's sort of
the father of the standard deviation
which as you can see would lead to that
kind of thought process that outcome and
through this study there was additional
papers and books that came out this book
here it's called the wisdom and crowds
kind of starts to explore the concepts
well if dependency is inevitable we
might as well embrace it and if these
statistics are accurate then the
diversity that we carrying large groups
around us can produce some pretty
striking outcomes when it comes to
steering the ship in the right direction
and it's fascinating to think this way
because there are people that you will
meet on a day to day basis that you
might look at this person you will not
get along with their point of view you
can walk away from that person and those
other people that you might meet and
you're like I get this guy let's hang
out together but you shouldn't write off
the other one because in a crowd you're
probably more powerful than actually
just pairing up with people that share
your same point of view so with this I
just have to tangent slightly because
talking about food talking about cooking
talking about Sir Francis Galton while
researching some of the backstory of
first Francis Galton I found this
article here it's from the scientific
publication nature in 1906 and it reads
cutting a round cake on scientific
principles he was so obsessed with
mathematics and statistics that he
decided that when tea cakes were cut
cutting a slice out of the tea cake as a
wedge was the most improper way of being
able to keep it from going stale and
instead you should take a section out of
the middle so you can put the pieces
back together and you're left with no
open surface area that if we go stay
away and then take another section out
of the middle so that you can put that
back together and make it so that there
is no area to be stale with and you can
make a tea cake last three days for this
port one of my favorite lines in this
actually is where he goes on
have some wit you know papers weren't so
dry in this case he had a little wit
into saying that the the problem to be
solved was that given around teacake of
some five inches across oh and two
persons of moderate appetite so if
dependency is around us and we see this
in ourselves and the wisdom of crowds is
going to give us power in numbers then
applying these principles to open source
software only means that when we step
backwards and we replace these
connections with applications then
embracing dependency gives us the
capability of steering a ship in a more
appropriate direction and it's at this
point where this might be oh we're
already sort of doing this Anna and to
that I say yes in ways for the most part
software with dependency has been the
driving force in business and that it
gives us the ability to quickly
bootstrap ideas to solve the problems
we're interested in solving if we want
to be able to put a camera on something
and do computer vision we don't need to
first solve computer vision first we can
just embrace it and we can do the things
that we want to do since most of the
reason why a lot of the web has exploded
the in growth lots of technology
available in software exploding and
growth but this problem is existing
elsewhere in that we're I'm specifically
interested in tackling is the problem
with producing software for hardware and
it's becoming more important than ever
that we have an appropriate answer for
this case because we're starting to see
that from the software perspective the
people that are writing these
applications are now given the tools and
the power to reach down with an open
connection to any device that they want
to and perform whatever actions they
want to as well but that device that
they're looking to reach out to doesn't
exist yet we've seen a lot of these new
ideas that have come out smart water
bottles
one of the most ridiculous ones that
I've spoken about before smart eggs yeah
some of them are useful some of them not
so much but the problem remains that
with hardware development we have some
some some different pieces to this and
it always seems like hardware
development and when I say hardware
development I don't specifically mean
soldering hardware I'm sort of short
cutting to say that software for
hardware because we have all of these
pieces of hardware available typically
you see the opposite in the case of open
source software development for the web
we have paring sessions we share
information with each other we produce
pieces and components of it that we then
just give away for free as open-source
software but in the case of developing
software for hardware it's usually done
in secret closed quarters because I
don't know what changes about that but
they feel like this product that they
have that's tangible is more important
or valuable than the product that they
have that's making millions of users
happy online and that even those pieces
shouldn't be shared typically as well
you'll find hardware developers will
couple a customized hardware for their
needs directly they'll spend many many
times over months and months and months
years developing this perfect little
board that has everything that they need
and nothing more and its sole purpose is
to be able to do this task and it's so
difficult then to be able to update it
when you when you look around and you go
I forgot that one thing also the
isolated development teams they're
really shut off from the world and most
of the time these problems arrived in
reproducibility because they always want
to be able to reproduce these pieces and
so when it comes to this this task this
is where a project that I've been
working on comes into life which is the
nerves project so the nerves project is
a aims at solving the problems in trying
to be able to make producing hardware
more like how we're used to producing
software these days
we see all of these influxes of open
source hardware raspberry PI's
BeagleBone black we have all of these
different targets that are out there
that you can just purchase for a like
little bits of money and you can get up
and running and and you can do the
things that you're interested in quickly
and so what is nerves well ah nerves
gives it nerves as a toolkit that that
basically takes Linux and boots it
directly to the Erlang VM and so we try
to be able to get you up and running as
fast as possible so that you can start
doing the things that you want to do
build the smart devices that you want
and so here's how it works you take your
instructions
you take your dependencies and you take
Linux and out the other end comes a
package so bringing it together nerves
is really good at building recipes and
managing dependency in a scene way uh I
decided to take this angle and approach
and describing what nerves is because
there was a time when I was in
conference in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania
the United States it was uh I was there
to give a talk about introducing parts
of nerves and during the speakers dinner
I as the first time that I had the
pleasure of meeting Joe Armstrong and I
was like I get to see Joe I'm gonna rush
up to him I can't wait to tell him what
we've been working on it's gonna be
great we've been taking raspberry PI's
we've been putting Linux on it and then
it boots to Erlang it's great I'm like
Joe check this out look we mean amazing
work airline is fantastic we love the VM
we love it so much we're trying to be
we're putting it on hardware we're
putting on a hardware and Joe looks at
me and he says hmm that's cute we did
that 30 years ago
oh he's bright ah yes it was great
answer I enjoyed that and that's why uh
the beauty of the system in this case
yes
putting airline on hardware is that was
the original intent of Erlang so what
are we doing well we're making it really
easy as a toolkit to be able to build
the recipe because airline makes a great
VM for running on hardware I mean it
makes a great VM to just want to live in
I mean half the time these days with the
state of operating systems I just want
it to be Erlang I could deal with that
the problem comes in the case though
when you start to realize that there are
some dependencies that are allowing the
VM the beam has on the outside world and
there are others in the outside world
that we might want to embrace and play
along with so that's why we took the
approach that we wanted to bring Linux
into the mix because Linux gives us so
much for free as far as drivers and
hardware support is concerned that can
very quickly get us to the point that we
can boot an airline so it's nerves
essentially what happens is you produce
this image that you put onto a device
you boot the Linux kernel boots and
process number one airline so all of
your initialization of your code all of
your initialization of your systems
including bringing up the networking
happens inside the VM so if we expand
this out we'll look at what makes up
these systems a little bit and in an
embedded system or any system you need
the ability of doing upgrades or fault
tolerance so we divide the nerves
platform that gets produced into several
slices you have a formatted space that
has a position for firmware a and B
including bootloader a and B but in this
case we're just simplifying and saying
you know four more slots a and B and
this lets us do things like always have
a last known good working state I mean
we do get these systems in a airline to
be able to allow us to do
hot code upgrades but in our case we're
embracing the world around us as well
and packaging it as a container that and
when you upgrade you may want to make
changes to the Linux kernel or you may
want to include some additional library
like DNS mask or hostapd
that's a Linux tool that you want to
exist as well and so what we do is when
you write to these positions you'll say
ok I want to do an upgrade
it'll stream the new the new the new
bits to the firmware be it'll see if it
boots and you can have a way to be able
to get yourself out of the brick state
because you always have the last known
good working state to go back to in
addition we have some readwrite areas
that's what the spots on the bottom mean
read-only and readwrite the reason we
mount the system as read-only is because
the beauty in this is that all of the
magic happens at compile time and by
mounting read-only we can make more
guarantees that the system will be
consistent so if you need to be able to
write data you can shut off some
partitions you can mount them read write
or you can also mount them read only and
only flip them on readwrite when you
want to and from that standpoint you can
run this on a number of different
platforms out of the box these are this
is a list of supported officially
supported platforms that we have
Raspberry Pi 1 2 3 0 0 W the 0 W is very
cool and C we have the link it's smart
duo that's another board that's the size
of about the 0 really small built-in
Wi-Fi and it also has a microcontroller
on the back of it that's tied directly
in so you can also do some real time
work with that and the BeagleBone black
BeagleBone green those are really
important platforms because those are
actual open hardware specification
boards that if you then go to production
with your device you can rework the
schematics for that board any way you
see fit and not have to do any
additional work for licensing and then
what's more fun than playing with LEGOs
their robotics thing is pretty neat
but when there's we're multi-target
so if you start a project and you want
to be able to run it on different pieces
of hardware you can actually target that
all of these different devices and we
have some more examples later that I'll
show you on how certain people that are
commercial companies that are out there
producing their projects for their
products
use multi target in a way to be able to
test things out on different raspberry
pi stuff like that now you don't have to
just use those pieces this is the
brilliant part about it is since we're
built on top of a package called build
group which is what gives us the
capability of compiling the embedded
Linux portion of this build drupe makes
it really easy for you to be able to go
and make the tweaks that you want
changes to the recipe or even styles to
it so that you can boot custom hardware
so if your development team requires the
capabilities of producing a board that's
got X Y &amp;amp; Z on it you can embrace this
for that reason as well and how you
customize your recipe is a in the case
of that's the the Linux side of things
you do it through these Kay config menus
so there's a interface that gives you
the capability of editing some of these
devices so well a lot of talk is great
and you know hardware is fun talking
about hardware is not as fun so let's
play with some hardware oh I just forgot
to mention as well you can make
additional customizations to this by
adding and modifying the contents of the
root filesystem and if you have any C
C++ code will cross compile it all for
you as well
so dunt dunt done this is a raspberry pi
0 w right here as I was talking about
very cool built in Wi-Fi Bluetooth and
let's play around with it a little bit
can everybody see this nice and big
looks pretty big bigger all right well
you might not do the file list that's
kind of teeny but I'll call them out as
we go so one thing I'd like to start
with here is a getting started with
nerve so I'm going to go back on
directory here and one way to get
started first there's installation
instructions in our site and I'll have a
slide up later to be able to show you
how to get installed but nerves is
essentially a shim in to mix and we
bootstrap the mix environment which is
the looks to provide a build tool and
that gives you the capability of getting
multi-target
and all of the functionalities so the
nice thing is that especially speaking
to this conference group here you don't
have to use mix I'm sorry you don't have
to use a lick sir to be able to program
your application you can actually
include that anything that mix can
compile which I believe well certainly
includes air Lang but I believe that
also includes LFE as well and any other
language that can be compiled through
mix so to get started we can just type
in easy command we could say mix nerves
new and we'll pass it an application
name like my cool app and it'll have to
install dependencies and you know why
what you know why I go for this far if
you're not going to live oh I blew up
conference Wi-Fi that doesn't matter
anyways you're presented then afterwards
with a list of instructions on how to be
able to get started and luckily I was
prepared for this I already happen to
have an application here so what you're
producing then is a this mix file if
you're familiar with elixir or you this
is your first time seeing it it's fairly
easy to follow along with the important
parts are that we decorate a lot of it
with this target and target is something
you'll declare on your environment
you'll say what board are you targeting
and when the project is generate
did the other important chunk are all of
these systems that get stubbed out as
well so if you just go and say mixed
nerves new and you don't declare a
filter for which system you're
specifically targeting will stub out all
the officially supported ones and link
to those as well in our case we're going
to be using the raspberry pi 0 mainly
because I'm pointing it at a path
dependency and not depending on the
network so all we have to do is set our
mix environment so we'll just make sure
we're set order our mix target all right
and now when we fetch our dependencies
we'll get a nice helpful message is
saying oh we have our target set for
raspberry pi zero and we're in dev mode
and everything's good to go so great
right from here we instantly have the
ability of saying mix firmware which is
the command that we put in and what
we're doing during this time is we're
taking your application we compile it we
make an OTP release out of it and then
we take those nerves platform images
with pre-compiled linux and we marry the
two together and then we shim all the we
set all the permissions we package it up
as a firmware bundle which is a
glorified zip directory and then that
firmware bundle can be used to be able
to burn it onto an SD card so I happen
to have an SD card reader here let's
just plug this in
it'll automatically identify any SD
cards that you plug in and burn it to it
all right
pop this in a unit and let's give her a
go
and there we go glued it in so on this
system we can see right now on the
Raspberry Pi zero it makes a great
development environment for nerves
mainly because it runs a serial port
over the USB gadget that gives us access
in one cable to be able to run serial
and power connectivity so now we're
booted into elixir we can do things like
let's say we'll LS on forward slash and
we can see that this is clearly a Linux
machine and we can even check out what's
in the bin directory we can see that
there's not a lot there to be able to
execute and the reason for this is
because
nervs provides you with an opt-in
approach all right ah some might say
like oh why don't I just take Debian and
and throw a lick sir on to it or throw
our Lang and just run it into it well
there's a lot of baggage that's involved
there
typically with embedded systems all of
the package management all of them meet
the ability to mutate that over time
gets in the way and becomes problematic
I've seen this a lot in production cases
where you try to be able to lock down
Linux or lock down operating systems
only to find that man people find
backdoors they find ways around things
things that you never even thought of
they'll change the desktop background
and then all of a sudden somehow some
other thing is crashing it's just a
problem and so the opt-in approach with
nerves gives you the capability of
producing really small systems that are
very easily distributable that have only
the components that you need to operate
so that sense Debian and full Linux
systems they may weigh upwards of six to
seven to eight hundred megabytes
sometimes you'll see installation disks
on those of gigabytes in size this
bootable image right here is 20 Meg's
that's Linux Airline the application
additional user land packages I mean 20
Meg's that can go over the wire that can
go over the air it makes firmware
updates really easy to be able to manage
and so now we're left with a system that
has a little bit of stuff to be able to
limp along let's make it a little better
because the nice part about this USB
gadget mode is that not only does it
give me the capability of
cereal but I'm also interested in
running I don't know let's say a DNS
server and Ethernet on it so over here
let's say I want to be able to make some
configurations and looks like my screens
running off a little let me shrink this
up here for everybody in the back and
there we go all right so through nerves
gives you access to the tools underneath
to be able to enhance your recipes like
Bill Drew with Bill Drew we can type
make menu config if you spell it right
and what this will bring up is the Kay
configure editor that gives us the
capabilities of enhancing what user land
things or what additions we want to be
able to include automatically
cross-compiled into our system so I'm
just going to use the search
functionality I'm going to say I want
DNS mask it says oh do you mean this
first one up here and I could say one
yes that's what I want it'll take me
right to the place in the editor where I
want it I can hit the spacebar and
enable it and if I go to ctrl C to break
out of it I'll say hey new config you
wanna change save the changes sure why
not
now we have it in our build environment
let's we're going to use a different
command save def configs and what this
does is it takes the new config that
you've created it packages it up in a
way that it only has a list of short
list of instructions that you need to
execute and it writes it back to your
original configuration location and so
after save def config ex-students it
finishes execution will go okay now I'm
interested in deploying my application
again so I'm just going to say I will
compile the project okay mix compile and
it goes oh I noticed that there was
changes to the system so what we do to
track this is we basically take a check
some of the check sums we hash all of
the source and we tie it to the artifact
and then that gives us the capabilities
of understanding when the contents of
the Linux area is stale and through that
we can then put together and assemble a
new system
so this as you can see may take a while
but it just picks up where we left off
last the rest of the entire Linux system
was already compiled and the changes
that we made was that all we wanted to
do was install DNS masks and in this
case it also copied linux over back as
well it finishes its work creates the
target system as an outlying directory
it puts together all of that into a
squash NFS filesystem it compresses it
and then it moves it back now you can
see here I'm using docker to do this
because on to compile Linux you need
Linux kind of a funny instance though we
provide the ability for Mac OS and I
believe in the future we're going to
support Windows with this mechanism so
that you can produce these kind of
artifacts once it's all done we're back
to our prompt and we can say we can burn
our firmware again so let me just plug
this together let's actually we have to
mix firmware
and burn it to our SD card
plug this guy second
all right and we're back to being booted
so now let's take a look at our bin
directory and we'll take a look at our
s-pen directory and we should have DNS
mask on here now Hiep return nothing is
just didn't run so there you go you can
install additional packages that way
around the user land but you can also
explore some different commands as well
to be able to enhance the Linux kernel
make modifications you can also go so
far as to apply patches and pretty much
do anything that you need to be able to
do to get yourself up and running I love
it when demos work thank you okay so I'd
like to give some credit to some of the
makers there's two avenues I want to
explore to finish this out one Avenue is
who is nerves for well there's a big
movement and I'm sure people have heard
this phrase getting tossed around a
little bit and calling people that are
like hardware hackers calling them
makers and the maker movement is pretty
big this gentleman right here is named
Tim mecklen he is responsible for doing
a lot of the the work porting the nerve
system to be able to run raspberry pi 0
W and zeros he is very interested in
using these devices specifically because
he's working on an open source glucose
monitoring system I believe and also for
interfacing with with pumps for
diabetics I believe he's going to be
posting a lot of his information online
so keep a lookout for that in addition
there was another project out recently
by a maker who took a Raspberry Pi and
nerves and did his own DIY quadcopter
from scratch he wrote all of the web
interfaces for it that did a ground
station he's able to using phoenix and
phoenix channels stream real-time data
and statistics back to a ground station
so that he could modify pit control
settings
and the thing took off from work and
works a really interesting part as well
is that he's also very deep intern so he
designed a lot of his quadcopter frames
and parts and printed them out on a 3d
printer so that's really I mean with
some basic tools and knowledge you can
get online building a quadcopter that's
really cool and dangerous I've been
there those blades cut and finally we
also have this is from Tim Oh Tim Oh is
a brewer a homebrew and what he does is
he wants to be able to control the
fermentation temperature of his beer so
with a simple Raspberry Pi I'm a
temperature control sensor he's able to
build a really quick nerve system that
allows him to be able to make better
beer which is a big goal for a lot of
people here's a thing that I like to
talk about a lot too this is the project
that I did way back where I took my
motorcycle through a nerve system in it
this is sort of what inspired me to be
able to do work on these problems and
make an embedded system into the jacket
that worked wirelessly with the on-board
computer on the motorcycle and
synchronized the blinkers the stop
indicators and uplinked as well that's
the beautiful part oh thank you I doing
this experience that it was just too
difficult to be able to make these
things connect to the internet because I
was first starting with just
microcontrollers everybody was in
Arduino at the time and it was just so
hard to be able to get that thing online
let alone make it secure and so you have
to do so much work to get there and and
that's what led us to the to the
position of being able to build these
systems that ran higher level languages
that could interact with alongside of or
supervise external micro controllers
because Airlines really good at that but
nervous is not only for makers nervous
is also being used in production so I
work for a company called the tote and
we're working with nerves and production
to be able to create devices and
interfaces for workers in our
distribution center to use RFID to
interface and with the and track the
workflow of a lot of the garments that
go through our sections so since nerves
is multi-target we we actually create we
we are embracing different flavors in
our recipe that we use to be able to
present an image that not only runs on a
Raspberry Pi with a seven inch
touchscreen display but that same image
can also target an x86 all-in-one Dell
or an HP computer and that flexibility
gives us the capabilities of like
simplifying our code base to the point
now where that target we just have to
change targets and and we can ensure
that some of the bugs with a bug that we
fix and one are affecting all of our
different targets as well and so this is
sort of a deconstructed look at instead
of using one of the standard underlying
nerves platform images the changes that
it required for us to make to be able to
let our recipe come together one of
which is that we compile WebKit in
because we want to be able to render a
web browser to use as our user interface
we compile and cute because we use cute
instead of any window management system
to display the the to display WebKit in
a chromeless fashion and as I mentioned
earlier the real reason that we were
after this is because we've experienced
the pain as having having curious hands
on a computer that you could you know go
and open up any other different
applications or customize the way the
keyboard on-screen keyboard looks this
really lets us hone in on providing
systems that are reliable and means of
performing the job function we want them
to perform and in addition to this we
also added in some serial drivers other
than us there's a lot of other companies
that are out there they use this
technology there's a company called
farmbot farmbot is a california-based
organization that is a cnc farming robot
it's pretty cool what it does is a it's
up on tracks on a raised bed it's got
multiple tool heads it'll pretty much
manage the entire thing for you and they
had different requirements as well they
wanted to have
cereal drivers so that they could take a
Raspberry Pi and interface with several
Arduino is to be able to do steppers
they also had a need for a computer
vision because they mount a camera on it
so that they can identify what point
when the plants reach different growth
stages or also when the plants actually
have like weeds around them or if they
need to identify visually any sort of
other things but they also have
including they made modifications to
their nerves platform recipe to include
hostapd because it makes it really easy
to be able to configure at that point
when it generates an access point when
you buy the thing to link it with your
phone and link it with your computer
here's a little animated gif on how the
farm bot works with its computer vision
all that they did was they like I said
they weren't interested in solving
computer vision they just wanted to use
it so they just brought in OpenCV and
started using it to identify weeds and
then the farm bot knows whether it's
weeding tool head how to suppress them
back and keep things running nicely so
how do you get started well we have some
great documentation up right now on hex
Docs you can access it through our site
or you can go to our github repository
it'll take you there as well from there
you'll get all the installation
instructions you'll get some getting
started help and then you can also then
check out our examples repository this
is a big collection of just how to be
able to use some GPIO you'll typically
get up and running with the blinky which
is the hello world of hardware nothing
is more exciting than seeing a light
blink for the first time trust me
knowing that you can write code that can
control things like physical things
around you it's like an empowering
feeling even when it's just an LED and
you'll show others you'd be like wow
look at that light it's blinking they
don't get it
in addition uh we also have a great deal
of libraries that have been contributed
from the community people who are using
it in production or people that are just
playing around with it on our website
you can go there and check out a lot of
these extra things for being able to do
stuff with integrating with MQTT or
using Fermata
which is a
flexible control mechanism for arduino
you can also use NFC libraries neopixels
are really cool those were the
multicolor LED pixels that I had in the
back of that jacket they're fun to play
with there's an example of that actually
and usage on our example code libraries
and if you have any questions or
problems with it we have a we're on the
elixir slack Channel we have the nurbs
channel quite active on there you can
check us out if you have questions you
can pop in ask them away and so I'd also
like to thank litotes because without
them they fund the capabilities of
driving nerves forward without them we
wouldn't be where we are today and it
would take us a little bit longer to get
there but I am sold on solving this
problem so we were just get there
eventually but big thanks to the tote
for helping us get things up and running
a production and also a big thanks to
everyone here and everyone in the
community because if we think back to
the beginning of this linking together
the concepts of how we all got here with
how we act as humans and how we all
connect we are a social organism and the
more knowledge that we share with each
other and the more chances that we have
to be able to take code that we work on
and open source it but not just open
source it to add the instruction to
encode the experience and the wisdom
that we have so that it makes it easier
for the rest of us to be able to use
that as a dependency it makes those
dependencies have stronger effected
outcomes on not only our applications
but other people's applications as well
and it's only going to be able to drive
us forward to help us all in the long
term and so whether you're producing
just software for the web or software
for computers or software for hardware
it doesn't matter the important thing is
that you understand that the power is in
the wisdom of crowds and that working
together in this fashion and sharing
this knowledge is only going to help all
of us in the long run
thank you very much Sheldon now I need
to buy even more raspberry pies and all
four of them we have time for questions
talked a lot about using all these
different microcontrollers and raspberry
pies in that order you know all that
stuff but you can talk very much about
using GPIO SPI I squared C doesn't there
support basically hardware interfacing
that obviously doesn't some might
because you were able to talk with your
jacket up son but can you tell me more
about that
sure yeah so there's a library out there
for airline called
airline ale that's ESL Lang solutions I
believe still maintains there's also one
called elixir ale and it's sort of the
embedded actor library and for and those
libraries are sort of more an agnostic
approach to handling hardware
interfacing for GPIO and some and it has
support for protocols as well like SPI
and I Square C to be able to connect
with those kinds of devices and sensors
and so when developing systems using
nerves you have to sort of be mindful of
the approach that you want to take
because inside of Erlang is you know we
have some soft real-time guarantees and
so if you're interfacing with a sensor
that's just a general sensor like a spy
sensor or an ice core C sensor you can
probably get away with that by just
using a lick sir or Erlang Hale but if
you need to be able to take an approach
where you have some more time sensitive
interactions then what you could do in
that case is to use a library like or
write a custom protocol that would
interface was connected Arduino over
UART which you art is also something
that we provide an exposure for to be
able to connect and connected a
microcontroller so that the
microcontroller can manage the hard real
time requirements and that the soft
real-time system that's the the NURBS
node can do what it does best and
monitor that make sure that it's always
running
cool any more questions I see a distinct
lack of hands in the air
well I guess it was crystal clear them
