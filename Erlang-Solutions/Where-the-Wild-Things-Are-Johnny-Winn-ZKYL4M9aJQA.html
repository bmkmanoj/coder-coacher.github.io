people have heard of the elixir fountain
or listen to it okay so you kind of know
what the deal is you know like I don't
usually give soft talks i usually give
code talks to everything like that so
today i was going to give this soft talk
but i decided to deep dive into the beam
and the actual everybody's kind of
glossed over no I'm really not
everybody's had a great day of talks
I've seen several of them I was a little
late today but I've seen some great
talks we had today give it up for all
the other speakers and so what I'm going
to do today is something a little bit
different and so bear with me because
what I'm going to try to do is I'm just
going to try to tell you a little bit
about the community my experiences I
have a lot of people actually send me
emails and say hey we kind of want to
hear your story I'm like really I talk
every week you really want to hear my
story you know we have great guests so
I'm going to do something a little
different today I'm going to actually
kind of tell my story how I got involved
in the lick sir I'm going to look at the
community a little bit and I'm going to
kind of forecast where we're where we're
going and where we want to go the name
of this talk of course is where the wild
things are because we're all wild for
elixir right so how many people have
read the book or even know that there's
a book called where the wild things are
okay originally I was worried that
people were thinking that I was going to
get up and read the book so I can do
that I don't mind I have slides for that
actually just in case because I was
thinking you know if there was an extra
lightning talk spot i might go ahead and
read it but that being said let's let's
go on so yes i am johnnie win i'm the
host of the elixir fountain podcast I'm
a longtime member of the elixir
community I've actually been using a
lick sir now for over three years I i
remember the first part of the story see
we're going to kind of jump around a
little bit the first part of the story
is i was actually going to speak at a
conference called magnum a comp which
was kind of a rail sort of conference
it was mainly around Ruby and so I was
going to give a ruby talk on
metaprogramming Ruby which was fun but I
had decided on the way that I had kind
of stumbled upon this language called
elixir and Dave Thomas had just come out
with a book it was really early on i
think it was only a couple of chapters i
think it was like literally the first
release that they had of it and so i
bought it and i read it on the plane bad
idea heading to a conference to give a
talk that you've already written because
all i wanted to do was talk about a lick
sir and i spent most of the conference
talking to anybody that would listen to
me about this great new language that
nobody was going to use for another
couple of years so as you can imagine
i've been around for quite a long time
this is does everybody know this is
right is anybody been there i think it's
like right of the street you can
actually take the underground you know
it's funny about this it's my family and
I for those of you that don't know we're
on like this three-month tour of Europe
and this is one of the places that I
really wanted to go now typically and
one of my talks if you've seen them
before my kids always make an appearance
right has anybody seen one of my talks
before okay well don't worry about it
because we'll make sure that the kids
appear so this is my son AJ he actually
has not relevant to this talk at all but
it just wouldn't be right to make a talk
without one of my kids in it so what are
we gonna do well the first thing that
we're gonna do is we're going to kind of
look at the past we're going to make a
little mischief we're gonna hear my
story and kind of how I got into
programming to start with and then how I
got into a lick sir eventually because I
think it's one of those stories it's
probably going to seem very familiar to
you not because you've heard me tell it
before because i'm sure you all listen
to it and i've heard me tell before but
it's probably going to seem similar to
you because our familiar to you because
it's probably similar to your story how
many of you came directly to elixir and
it's your first language see so you came
from somewhere else how many came from
Erlang how many came from Ruby yeah I'm
gonna offend probably some of you at
some point but I'm going to try not to
then the next thing we're do is we're
going to kind of talk about the terrible
roars I know everybody's heard them
right this is the present state of the
electric community and that's not
necessarily our Wars is maybe from the
outside but we're going to talk about it
and just at least acknowledge that it's
there and what we can do about it and
then finally we're going to look towards
the future we don't all have to be the
king it's okay to have other languages
living alongside of us and everything is
fine but let's start out so how did I
find a lick sir now when I first started
writing this talk I you know I with the
idea of the book if you've read the book
this is a story of Max who starts
causing problems for his parents
depending on if you've seen the movie
it's his mom but the parents and the
parents send him off to bed because he's
creating too much mischief and when I
first heard that I was thinking about
like josee in the rails community and
like kind of like you know he was like
trying to do things and people were
saying no we're not gonna do that we're
not gonna do that we're not gonna make
these changes and so what did he do he
went off to his own room and I really
wanted to get a picture of a little tiny
cottage that he was way on and then he
wrote his own language so how about how
I realized in working on this that it's
really I'm a mischief-maker and I would
assume that most of you if you're here
you're probably kind of mischief makers
to you're not happy just with the status
quo you're not happy with the answers
that you've been given so you're going
to seek other answers in other places
and you're going to test what you know
it's not all about just doing the next
thing it's about figuring out why you
did it in the first place and so I
started development way back in two
thousand I told you I'm a dinosaur right
at internet years I might as well have
been like you know Big Bang so buddy
back in two thousand and when i first
got involved in it i was doing perl PHP
vb6 how many PP 6 users yeah bring back
BB 6 DLL hell I don't oh yeah i can tell
you actually i'm going to digress again
cuz see that's what i'm going to do in
this talk I'm gonna digress a lot
actually if you walk away from this talk
with anything
good luck so funny early developer story
this is way back when so I had actually
written an application for this company
in my genius self I had it on a hard
drive because of the dll's you had to
make sure that all the dll's were set up
correctly or your vb6 app was not going
to work and so I had a brilliant idea i
would just load it up on a hard drive
with the OS and i would just hand it to
them and then they would do it well we
go to hook it up and sure shoot it
didn't work so here i go walking back
and i'm going out of their office
carrying this hard drive in my hand and
I go to get my car and drop yeah I spent
the next three days up rewriting the
application because I had lost it all
yes lessons learned young developers so
anyway so of course i did that furrow
quite a while and then I got into C
sharp now the great thing about being in
C sharp I digress no I'm just kidding
there are actually really cool things
about it as a language I actually
enjoyed working with dotnet quite a bit
it was really kind of the the sense of
the community and how I felt was like I
felt very detached from everyone it
didn't feel like I was a part of
anything you know especially this is pre
there was no open source net community
there wasn't even a thought of it
remotely and actually you could look at
the source code but you weren't allowed
to touch it or do anything with it even
if you found a problem and fixed it you
could say something to Microsoft and
they would say thank you very much now
leave our code alone but that being said
so I did dotnet for a number of years
but one of the things that I really
liked about it was a solution how many
dotnet developers were pre or post X dot
net developers yeah we have meetings
once a month they're called meetups
where we talk out our issues no so the
so the solutions were great though
because you could create multiple
projects in them well each project you
could separate your concerns you could
have certain business logic in one you
could have database logic and another
this sounds very familiar right yes this
sounds very familiar
umbrella projects actually somebody said
is it just me or does umbrella from
projects seem a lot like solutions and
it's great you had separation of concern
you now you could also mess this up
considerably trust me my first shoot
passes at it everything was all
entangled it didn't matter but you can
actually separate things out this is
great this is a great platform to build
on but the problem was I didn't feel
that connection I didn't feel that
community like there was no this is
really kind of before come from i'm sure
there were conferences but i wasn't
attending them i very much at this time
worked alone believe it or not i didn't
run my mouth all day i just sat at my
desk writing my code a friend of mine
shows me Ruby and says look at this cool
new thing called rails you can actually
put together a prototype app like that
and sits down in five minutes and shows
me how to build a prototype app and it
was great but I was still pretty
entrenched in the.net world for one if
you've changed how many people have
changed languages from job to job how
many people took a pay cut to do it a
major pay cut yeah because all my skills
were dotnet skills so the apparently
didn't transfer to Ruby so when i had to
leave i ended up getting a paycheck cut
in half to go work in ruby now my wife
who did not make in the slide she does
not like being slides i found that out
also probably not a good idea to let her
watch the videos because then she comes
back and says why did you talk about me
in the talk so I just won't huh oh by
the way this is very interactive it's
you feel like you're interviewing me
feel free to throw up a question I don't
mind answering i don't mind diverging if
you've noticed so and basically I'm just
killing time till the drinks start right
yeah so in any case so I told you you're
not making out of this talk with any
good information so in any case so I got
into Ruby and I started working with it
for a long and at first I loved it and I
loved how it like it was so different
than net like I could express myself
better in Ruby you know all the stuff
that I all the warm and fuzzies
everybody gets when they go to ruby and
then of course I went to my first
conference and I saw other developers
and they were talking about development
and we had similar ideas and this was
great I mean really I could reach out
and talk to somebody we could talk about
testing where and we could talk about
the right way to do things and we could
talk about all sorts of things like the
love the meter and yeah those
conversations get way too long but any
case that's where I started getting that
feeling again though that like it felt
fake after a few conferences and it's
the same talks over nuve again and
you're going to it and people have the
same ideas and you realize that
everybody is really starting to think
the same it's kind of a weird feeling
when you're like okay I'm not getting
anything new out of it anymore I'm just
rehashing the same things and then of
course in the rail are the Ruby
community the rails community whatever
you want to call it what did we have
emerged thought leaders right yeah
thought leader and they tell us how
you're supposed to think to make sure
that we're all still thinking the same
way right because we all want to stay on
the same path because we don't want to
diverge from the group right yeah have
you heard a group thing
we're to achieve harmony we all try to
think the same way so as not to upset
anything well that seems kind of
counterproductive doesn't it I mean when
you're going to build something new you
want to kind of question what you're
doing you want to make sure you're doing
it right just because you've been told
to do it a particular way doesn't mean
it's the right way right how many people
have rewritten code when they realize it
was wrong oh come on every hand should
go up I have I know so anyway so the
idea of group now the funny thing about
all this talk is it was a right in this
talk one of my biggest pet peeves is
thought leaders and honestly this sounds
like a thought leader in you know but
I'm not I'm seriously not I'm trying to
give a good community talk but now what
got me about a lick sir in the beginning
and really I found it in early my
problem with Erlang was is that I wasn't
i like the syntax Robert good job on the
syntax but what I realized is I live in
jacksonville florida you know how many
erling shops are in jacksonville florida
20 i was going to say where huts I'll
send him my resume and see what I you
get going you know no there is ZERO do
you know how many were I guess this was
going on for years ago yeah still zero
didn't matter so anyway so when I found
a lick sir I was like oh this is all the
greatness that I have in Erlang but with
the syntax that i can sell because keep
in mind i was a consultant for a long
time believe it or not i can sell things
but yeah so selling technology i could
take somebody a lick sir application and
they wouldn't be afraid of it they
wouldn't be worried who was gonna who's
going to work on this code you know
because if you show somebody or laying a
lot of times that's what you hear who's
going to who are we going to hire his
developers well i'll call one of them up
because i have them all on speed dial
but the other thing was is elixir was
new and it gave me something that I
didn't have in Ruby keep in mind i'm
coming to ruby pretty late this is
2012 when I got to ruby rails was want
to say three something around there I
mean it was still are one at what it was
at 189 see i knew i was gonna trip who
was talking to me about tripping on the
stage and i just did anyway it was a lot
of things were built and i would go to
work on something and I'd be like here
I've got to figure out how to write this
and they're like there's a jump for that
oh that's right I'm gonna bring in this
10,000 line in code gym because I have
one thing that I need smart idea and I
used to in one of the talks that I gave
about rails which and I've stopped
giving the rails verse Phoenix or rail
or elixir verse Ruby talks you know why
because it's counterproductive it
doesn't do us any good but one of the
talks I did give I actually showed a
rails dependency map I couldn't get it
small enough are big enough on the
screen to where you could even tell it
looked like one of those models of the
universe you know it was like so spread
out you couldn't read it you know baby
you know Luke was over here and you han
and Leia were over here somewhere and
they couldn't find it there's always
missing pieces so anyway but when I got
to a lick sir what I found is I could
discover things again there was an open
canvas tons of things not written so in
my first days how many people have tried
to user laying dates aside from Robert
yeah how many people like using Erlang
dates aside from Robert yeah huh what
was that Robert do you like dates
i understand i know this is it we're all
friends here this is an elixir
conference you can feel free to you know
say whatever you feel so anyway one of
the first libraries I wrote was a
library called Kronos which really all
it was for was taking an erlang day and
turning into something that made sense
to a human it you know basically did all
sorts of formatting and things like that
and but the other thing is is a lot of
early days of elixir a lot of it was
still just wrappers around her Lane code
so you could find out what was happening
it was really easy because I used to get
this question all the time to was do you
you know do I have to learn erling
before I learn a lick sir now no should
you probably back then you had to learn
summerling because if you didn't learn
early there was a lot of times you were
going to hit a wall because you were
going to get so far and then all of a
sudden you have to get into the Erlang
code to figure out what was going on I
mean now this is we're talking three
years ago to this isn't like anything
recent but what it did it allowed that
freedom to discover again I got to work
with dates in a way that I hadn't had to
work with dates in I can't remember how
long actually never I've never seen a
date as a tuple before in my entire life
what were you thinking so in any case so
that was like one of the first first
little forays into it and of course then
I wrote I got kind of involved I met
Chris you got to remember that this time
too there was probably I know francesco
is going to correct me on this but i
swear there was only 20 elixir
developers in the entire world i know
there was more than that but it felt
like that and so like it's kind of weird
looking back when I kind of think back
about elixir three years ago or I guess
two and a half years ago where it was
like we all knew each other and really
the first elixir comp there was a
hundred people there and we all had
spoke before and we had all been using
elixir nobody did used it in production
but there was there's very few maybe
twenty-five to thirty percent of the
people had never seen it before
I just wandered in because they thought
there was free donuts and there were for
a nice low fee of conference entry but
so you know it was it was one of those
weird things we're like it was it very
much felt like a community of friends
that we're all just kind of getting
together discovering things on their own
and I remember working with Chris back
in I think if you go back in the Phoenix
logs like the fourth commit it says hash
rocket workstation yeah that was me
sorry but I remember in the early days
we were thinking we were like you know
and there was a lot of discussion even
back then of like how phoenix should of
all what should phoenix do you know
chris had his idea and of course it was
his library so he's going to do the way
once and I had my idea obviously his
idea was right because everybody's using
Phoenix now but there was a lot of
things that you know I kind of wanted to
diverge on one of the couple of
libraries that came out about this time
that I wrote Calliope which how many
people use hamill that's it okay I don't
use him later I used to I you when i
worked at hash rocket that they were big
the Devourer designers all wanted to use
hamill and so the nice designer that was
helping me do all my stuff because my
foreign development looks like a
developer developed it which how many
people develop are designed like a
developer twitter-bootstrap know so yeah
it's horrible so I used to have a la
pala gize for my slides to they used to
be so nice and so creative because i had
to designer do them up for me it was
nice but in any case the the ability to
discover i wrote a parser for the first
time i am not a CS graduate hell I'm not
even a college graduate I mean I guess
technically I graduated from a
vocational school but I'm actually a
high school dropout I dropped out and
got my GED and I had taught myself
everything I know so I never had to
write a parser that kind of stuff was
done for me it wasn't until I found a
liquor that I was like hey I should
figure out how this stuff works and
that's a big part of what we can do in a
lecture now
how many people do web applications how
many people have written a parser how
many people loved you don't count
actually it's funny when I was watching
your talk it was great i'm talking to
louis by the way i know that the camera
doesn't know who I'm talking about but
when I was watching her talk i was like
hey I remember doing that and and I'm
not saying that was right the first time
I did it but I had never done it and it
was fun to do it was fun to explore and
the other thing is is you know I wrote a
library we were talking about doing a
mailer and of course there was no real
mailers there was the erlang stuff but I
ended up writing a library called Hermes
by the way if you look at my repos all
the names are probably Greek mythology
except for coyote which is Native
American mythology but in any case the
hermes library guess what it did sent
messages it opened up a TCP socket and
communicated across sending stepped our
binary strings back and forth to send an
email how many people have done that
yeah the hands are well you just Robert
so anyway so but that's one of those
things that like I had never done and I
took the time to do it because nobody
else had done it yet and I one of the
things that I would like to see in the
community is as we go on in this talk is
I want us to keep that feeling of
discovery just because Phoenix is there
doesn't mean you can't go right an OTP
application to serve up web pages
doesn't mean you have to use Phoenix now
I'm not saying that in your production
environment that you're selling to
consulting our company that you're
consulting for you should go and write
your own thing every time but on your
own you should learn how these things
work you should take the time to learn
how they work not just accept what they
are so that kind of brings us to the
present how many have heard the roars do
y'all know what I'm talking about the
ones coming from some other communities
where they're like we're just fine our
stuff works we don't need a lick sir
we have action cable and that's not and
that's not a knock on them I've noticed
this over the last few years that it
things changed in the Ruby community and
then the rails community to keep up with
other things so they saw like when
Phoenix channels first came out this is
I think two years ago at railsconf dhh
had already started looking at what
Phoenix was doing and realizing that
they needed it do you know how many
applications actually need web sockets
hardly any really it's it's fluff it's
chrome most applications is your writing
don't need it can you use it sure I can
also slice my sandwich with a chainsaw
but it's not necessarily going to be
right but see so what we hear from a lot
of the outside community is we hear well
you're just an upstart language and it's
not just the Ruby and rails community
there's other languages and I remember a
few years ago at Erlang conference or
laying factory then why don't we need a
lick sir we're just fine well why don't
you need a lick sir is it hurting you is
it causing you problems is it creating
issues for you know and actually josei
has done an awesome job trying to
encourage especially the core team to
commit back too early to try to help out
when we find things in the elixir
community that we think can help the
Erlang community we try to give back and
that's something we also need to foster
in the communities we need to foster
that feeling that we're not just here by
ourselves or a part of the greater sense
of the developer community and we need
to give back to those now of course with
all this there's this so I'm going to
tell you a funny story because I don't
have any funny stories this is my only
one I promise so way back when when I
was first got into elixir and of course
me and my excitement for a lick sir and
everything that I wanted to do with it
and everything like that and of course
it was like it version I don't know Oh
point 7 or I mean this was like back in
the day and of course I was working as a
consultant and I kept saying to
everybody I'm like this is going to be
the next big thing this is
gonna be and this is actually we're two
years now into a promise that I made
that in five years elixir was going to
take over the market that is now
currently run by ruby on rails it's not
a slant on Ruby and rails but you watch
most languages they have a lifespan they
have a life circle they kind of go
through changes unless you're an
enterprise and then you're still on Java
but that's the first thing that happened
is they ignored it they're like ah
that's just a passing fad it's not even
a probably hit 10 we're not even to
worry about it well then we hit 10 and
we were showing look we're moving fast
things are working well then of course
they start laughing at you it's great
but nobody's using it there's only a few
people the second elixir conference had
about 250 people then they fight you and
we're kind of hearing those fights right
now well this isn't going to work why
don't you just use what you've been
given why are you out there trying to do
something different but then you win
because at that point you don't fight
back you just do what you're doing you
write good code you take advantage of
things like OTP which needs to be
brought to the forefront in elixir
community you need to make sure that
what you're doing in the face that
you're showing to the other communities
is a positive one there's no reason to
go out and bash another community
there's no reason to say oh you're
release whatever blah blah blah enjoy
their successes as much as your own and
that's how you win in life really now
this kind of comes hard for summer
Langer's because and I love this quote
from Joe this was he did a blog post
when he started his new blog so this is
probably a couple years ago now all
right can everybody read that I don't
really want to just read it out loud but
you know he says and I think he even
said on the show that like it's hard for
the Swedes to really promote things well
we have to get out and promote things
how many people have used the my
licks her status hashtag how many people
know about the my elixir status hashtag
so how many people know the story behind
it as a couple see I know the real
listeners are so anyway the story behind
the my elixir status and it was actually
funny I was talking to one of the guys
at plataforma tech I try not to name
names too much unless I'm related to
them but I was talking to me he's like
you know the my elixir hashtag is great
it's it's like caused elixir to kind of
go viral when the reason being is keep
in mind go back a couple years when they
felt like there was only 20 developers I
started a newsletter called the elixir
fountain so every week I went on Google
and tried to find articles on elixir to
send out to the 20 of us chances are 10
of them wrote the articles so I was this
is really difficult this is hard to
track things down not to mention I don't
know who's working on elixir how do I
know what people are doing i don't i'm
in jacksonville florida there's no
believe it or not two and a half years
ago there was no meet up in jacksonville
florida for like Sir or Erlang as we've
discussed earlier so in any case i
started the hashtag as a way to get
people to kind of kind of cheat on me
having to do extra work especially if
you're in florida in your google because
i'm sure it's all proximity and sword
thing if you google ruby elixir there's
a club in Tampa Florida called Ruby's
elixir and I'm sure how many people have
found elixir strings yeah I don't play
guitar anymore but in any case so it
doesn't do me any good but so i used the
my elixir status was a way to
communicate with everybody around the
world to find out who was working on a
lick sir and what they were doing if
they were writing blog post if they were
putting out libraries because the idea
is that it's not bragging to show what
you've done and to share what you've
done it's bragging when you shove it in
their face and you say haha i'm better
so keep that in mind I mean go ahead use
the use the hashtag share with everybody
let people know what you're doing
show people your libraries have people
look at your code if you write a blog
post share it make sure it gets out
there because if nobody hears it does it
matter and that's a big part of how
we've gotten to where we are in the
elixir community do you know how many
people were elixir compusa this year
there was almost 600 people so in three
years it's gone from 100 people to 600
people do you know how many people raise
their hands when we asked or when Chris
asked i should say how many people have
elixir in production most of the room
actually we all were kind of talking
afterwards and we were kind of blown
away because that the first one most
people said they had kind of a kind of
played around with it or whatever there
was maybe four or five of us that had it
in production anywhere so to have most
of the room of 500 plus almost 600
people say that they have elixir in
production right now it's a pretty big
feat in three years so where are we now
and where do we want to go we're kind of
it like a really turning point in our
communities development cycle I guess
you could say we have the opportunity to
remain a sounding board we don't want to
become an echo chamber we can talk about
how great things are we can say how
wonderful our applications are now that
they're written in elixir even though
that's really mostly because of beam we
can say all these things but if we don't
continue to question the answers if we
don't continue to explore what we're
doing it's all for naught because in a
few years it'll be something else and
you'll get bored and you'll move on but
if you take the time to learn things
learn deep learn deeper than you've ever
learned before find out you build things
that don't even make sense right now but
spend the time to do it the nerves
project is actually a really cool thing
because I know nothing about it
and so I love the idea of playing with
it because it's teaching me ways of
coding that I've never done because
believe it or not when you go back and
you code your web applications or
whatever it is you do in your daily job
it's going to change the way you think
it's going to change just like a lick
sir changed the way you thought about
building applications it's going to
change the way you build your everyday
elixir applications you're going to
learn more about OTP than you ever
thought an OTP is awesome one of the
projects that I've been playing around
with recently is a project called coyote
you can see the code is James still here
okay yeah James is gonna yell at me but
in any case it's a playground for me
right now it's a way for me to push the
boundaries of what I know and how I know
how do you work with OTP to see if I can
if maybe I don't know it as well as I
think I do and I'm building something
that I haven't ever built at this low
level before which is basically a web
library for dealing directly with the
cowboy web server which may change in
the next few days like I said it's very
experimental and I can't wait to release
it because part of the thing that I want
to do with it is I want you to build OTP
applications and use this library and
then just send a notification to say hey
i'm online now and here's my routes
route to me i don't want to have to
build a rails app or phoenix app sorry
that was not a slip I swear that was see
I told you I'm gonna offend a rails
develop so he's good so anyway how are
we looking on time have I rambled on and
off do y'all like me rambling I can go
home to a trust me I do this every week
for like an hour to timeless and drives
me nuts so you have to decide now where
you want to go do you want to just
continue building the applications of
you as you know how now or do you want
to build things new and different and
you want to change the way you think
about how you develop that was a
question
okay so you guys are all content do you
want to build something new you want to
change the way you think about things
come on now with that I'm done oh one
more thing I forgot to mention this I'm
a rugby player Gary this is for you so
yeah those are all actually me pack and
I was in much better shape than I am now
now I know typically most I don't know
if we have time but most times we do
like questions I don't know really I've
explained it all but the listeners of
the show know about five behind the code
does everybody like five behind the code
would you guys like to do a quick five
behind the code all right who's got a
question okay hello so my questions you
johnny is have you ever been in a band
and if so what were the names of the
bands that you've been in oh so this is
yes so the longest-running band I was
then I was actually playing guitar for
him it was the most successful one we
did one show and we had a name so we
were really it was the band's name it
was it was called as a Mary's so our
singer thought he was Jim Morrison he
also thought he was a poet he was
neither and he came up with this
brilliant night because okay now I'm
gonna probably get myself in trouble but
you know hey what ever I was like 16 so
we were all sitting around smoking as 16
year olds do believe it or not a nice i
got the day man it's Mary's we're like
what now Zim Aries man like I'm just
gonna play guitar over here in the
corner you call it whatever you want but
yes that that was the name of the band
and we played one show we had great
reviews and then we went out and partied
and broke up two days later
hey hello let's imagine that you can't
write elixir you're not permitted to
write elixir and you have to build that
I don't know some system which tells
stories what language are going to use
instead a pen and paper the English
language there you go I'm pretty good at
English kinda yeah I don't know i mean
if i was i actually i still really enjoy
Ruby I can't look at it the same way
that I used to I still enjoy c sharp but
like even like doing C sharp I don't
know it's it it's one of those things
are so much of an environment i'm so
used to scaling back to where like you I
was you know as a vim user for a long
time I'm actually using Emacs through
space max now so it's kind of like an
environment that I'm having to cope with
but for the most part I like being able
to just open up a file in write code and
Ruby kind of gives that I don't have to
do a whole lot so any other ones oh well
oh I got one okay have you ever played
rugby before um no I actually do have a
question it's from from the show if you
could have one superpower why would it
be teleportation so if I could have one
superpower but why would it be telep
into the teleportation so I could move
on to the next question um I don't know
actually I mean if I was gonna have a
superpower I kind of go back and forth
on this anyways cuz so believe it or not
I like the Hulk and so the absolute
strength really is kind of like cool to
me I like the idea of even if it is like
in a mad rage and I can't control it I
kind of like it you know it's kind of
fun it makes for a good weekend you know
but um now and I mean and to I play I
played contact sports you know most of
my life and stuff like that rugby being
the most recent and so you know I that's
probably the superpower I would most
like
just because i don't think i would use
it very often except when I was like on
the pitch or something like that so all
right who's next what's what's the story
of your tattoos oh there's too many okay
so this one right here y'all can't see
it it is actually the date that I was
married to my wife and her name ha she
got into the talk so we got so funny
story i will tell a little bit if I have
a little bit of time I don't know I can
try to tell quick so my wife and I
actually I saw something on Twitter as
one does I was probably working at the
time but so it was talking about like
you know that this idea that you can
explain true love and all that kind of
stuff by the fact that all particles
came from a single particle set of
particles it was the big bang and so
when people feel attracted to each other
it's because the mutual attraction of
the particles that want to be back close
together which is kind of a cool story
but then you look at my wife and I now
my wife and I have pretty much spent
within a few miles of each other our
entire lives aside from a short period
when my family moved us up to Chicago
for a couple years and but then back
down and write back next to her we
actually think we even went to the same
day care as a kid which is funny because
it was completely on the other side of
the town where we met so we kind of
moved across town together and then
ended up dating in high school and then
we broke up because me really honestly
it was me because I was a young punk kid
and she was like I'm not dealing with
that and so anyway we both kind of went
off and got married and had kids and
then we came back together after we both
got divorced and we were like hey you
want to go on a what we call it we joke
about it being aa run date because our
real anniversary is December 31st try
hitting the table for your anniversary
on dissemble 31st is that big over here
New Year's Eve is still big over here
right so yeah it's okay this is a whole
new year and everything so in any case
so we called it our undone date where we
were just going out as friends just to
catch up and
you've been together ever since and
pretty much inseparable I brought her
even to Europe so oh not not please give
a warm round of applause for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
