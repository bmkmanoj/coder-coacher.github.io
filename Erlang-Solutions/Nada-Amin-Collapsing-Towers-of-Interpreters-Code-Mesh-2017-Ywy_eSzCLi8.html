challenge of collapsing towers of
interpreters and how we've addressed it
as a solution in a in an idealist and I
in an ideal setting but hopefully this
will have some impact on practice as
well and I'll come back to this so what
is the challenge so the task is to
collapse a tower of interpreters into a
one-pass compiler from the high level to
the low level removing all interpretive
overhead so let's look at what a tower
of interpreters is abstractly so here we
have said one such tower l0 you can
think of it as the lowest level and then
we have an interpreter written in l0
that interprets the language and one so
we go up two and one and then we have an
interpreter written in at one for a
language l2 so we go up a level and so
on until we reach the high level LN and
so the goal is then to have to derive
from this tower of interpreters a
one-pass compiler that translates
directly from Ln to l0 so you give it an
Ln program and it will compile it into
this l0 level ok so what what would the
tower of interpreter look like in the
wild and here is a contrived example
with which you can probably piece it
together with things that exist today so
you can imagine having some Python code
that is executed to some bike code that
is then executed on an x86 runtime that
is emulated in a JavaScript virtual
machine on the browser and eventually it
goes to the arm CPU so that just to kind
of give you an idea of how things were
will look like in the wild of course in
this talk I'm not going to show how to
collapse this tower in particular but
we're in an idealized setting but here
really what what it would mean is that
we would maybe want to have a one-pass
compiler that translates directly from
Python code to the arm CPU or maybe we
want to do some partial collapsing so
maybe even going from the Python code to
the JavaScript VMs Varian is it would be
nice already so you can
ship optimize go to the browser this way
alright and so what would a more
idealized example look like so here is
one so you can imagine having a lower
level than a tower of evaluators enter
you reached a high level and then as a
last step you can think of having a
regular expression matter and if you
think of regular expression as a
language then your matcher is an
interpreter for that for that language
of regular expression and so here
collapsing would mean deriving a
one-pass compiler that allows you to
compile a regular expression to the low
level and so what what this do is that
for a particular regular expression you
create low level specialized code to
match that one regular expression here
is another example where say at the at
the top of your table what you have is a
modified evaluator so for example one
where you do additional tracing for
debugging or one where you make the
control for explicit so say you write
this evaluator and continuation passing
style and so now your when you do the
collapsing what you end up doing is is
transforming from the high level to the
low level and you kind of preserve your
your modifications in the low level as
well so if you were doing tracing then
you could see that you're also doing
tracing and at the low level or if
you're doing continuation passing style
then you would actually see that you've
you've basically done made all the
control so explicit at the low level so
we will see some in sensation of this
and so these are the examples I've shown
and so in this talk I will actually show
you how to realize the Reg apps and
modify the evaluator example and in
general the idea then is to from a tower
of interpreters which has all this
overhead of of like evaluating each
level cannot be able to to get to a
one-pass compiler okay so just to make
things more interesting we will also
consider reflective and infinite towers
so I'll get back to that and to make
things a little bit more constrained for
now for the for the low-level language
will only
a variant of the lambda calculus and
maybe with some imperative features as
well so think like a scheme like
language okay so what does it mean to be
a reflective tower of interpreter so in
short that means that you can at any
level in the tower you can inspect and
modify your program at runtime so
concretely the way I've drawn it here is
that a zero is the most meta most
low-level if you want and then Ln is the
most user most object most high-level
and so if you're at one level you can
shift to an a different level so if
you're shifting to the meta level going
going in with in your implementation
what you're doing is like you're you're
you're verifying something that was a
program at this level to something that
is now data at at the meta level and on
the other hand you can also reflect back
so if you if you have some data you can
reflect it back as a program shifting
back to the object level and so just to
kind of confuse things a bit I'm going
to completely switch this picture and
I've just like completely flipped it so
that now a zero is actually the the most
user high level and Ln is the most metal
level and I'm doing this because now I
want to be able to add as many levels as
I want up here so so then the idea now
is that you can always shift up a meta
level conceptually there's no limit for
any language that you're dealing what
you can always ask well how is this
language implemented and and and and and
and go back and and I mean go well I
don't know if you want to go up and down
now but anyway go go up and down the
tower and and and look at at these steps
as verification and reflection and so so
what we mean then is in our in our in
our setting we'll consider that you can
always go back up and down dynamically
and you can also make any modification
any arbitrary modification at any level
now the catch is that we are still able
to execute such a conceptually infinite
hour and finite time because once we
reach a meta level
that is that has no special
customizations we can kind of short
circle in situ into a default semantics
all right okay so just to take it one
step at a time we go back to our finite
towers so here again I've switched I
flipped it back the other side so l0 is
the most low level and Ln is the highest
level and so we will do this one-pass
compiler and so first I will I will give
an example in purple which is inspired
by black and black comes from a long
tradition of a reflective terrors of
interpreter including Brown by Dan
Friedman and Mitch wand and then blonde
by Olivia dovey and and and one of his
students and and then and then and then
black is by Kenny CSI in Japan and then
so the the the basic idea of black is
that the language at each level is
scheme so here if you look this is a
valid scheme program it's just computing
Fibonacci and so I can at the user level
I can just evaluate this program and run
it like run Fibonacci of seven and get
13 so that's good and now one thing that
I can do in both purple and black is
some reflection and this is this is kind
of a fun way to to think about these
towers of interpreters in practice if
you were to do reflection it would be a
bit crazy to kind of just mutate the
world underneath you as things are
running but this is what we will be
doing here so en means
executed meta-level and that means that
conceptually we're going one level we're
shifting to the meta level one level up
the tower in this in this case and and
and and then this code is executed at
that level so here I'm just saying I'm
defining a counter to be zero and then
this evolved R is actually referring to
some interpreter function so how do you
evaluate variable and this evolved R is
defining that and so what I'm doing here
is that I'm said by
I'm actually mutating what is my the way
I evaluate a variable and so this
evolved are takes an expression an
environment and a continuation and this
is the case for most interpreter
function and here what I'm doing is that
if the expression is equal to the symbol
n meaning if if I'm evaluating a
variable named n then I increment this
counter and other in any case I do the
the old evaluation of variable so
basically by running this code I've now
changed my meta-level interpreter to
instrument all variables named and
increment this counter that is defined
at the meta level so if I do Fibonacci
of 7 I get the same result as before and
now if I look at the counter at the meta
level I see that it was incremented to
reach 102 ok so now what about
computation so one thing one thing we do
in purple is that instead of lambda you
can use C lambda to say that this is a
computation unit and so if I look at the
behavior it's exactly the same as before
I have this Fibonacci function and now I
I compiled it but I'm not showing not
showing the target computation yet but
you can see that it has exactly the same
behavior as as when I was when this was
just a normal lambda but what's
interesting is that I'm claiming that
I've compiled this and I have some
modifications at the meta level this
tracing this tracing of the variable and
and I can see that it's it's happening
here in the compiled version so I was
compiling with respect to the modified
semantics ok and then just to make
things clear what's going on so one
thing I can do now is reset a valve R to
have the old behavior and because my fib
my fit function was compiled with
respect to the tracing semantics it
still does the counter incrementation
here but if I recompile it doing a new C
lambda then you see that it's actually
doing the the default behavior again
which is where it's not stressing okay
so this was what
to give an example of what we want to
achieve at the end where we were able to
have a way to say while compiled is this
lambda and it will take into account the
semantics of the tower at the time
computation happens and just to give an
idea of what the generated code looks
like so I I haven't really talked about
the target language here but you can
really think it that it has like some
application some way of creating
concepts and all this it has explicit
cells for mutation so we have this
counter cell and then we're explicitly
reading the cell and so on but what's
interesting is that even in the
generated code you can see how it
collapsed the level so in in gray in a
slightly lighter font you have what the
original code would look like for
Fibonacci in this sort of continuation
passing style and then in black you have
these cell increments and we really
these cell increments really happen at
the meta level but we've really
collapsed everything here alright so how
are we going to solve the challenge well
if we look back at the literature there
is a lot of work on partial evaluation
and turning interpreters into compilers
so that's a first step and so how do
these things work well duh the first
footer more projection says that if you
have an interpreter that takes a source
program and some input to this program
and you get a result what you can do it
in two steps where first you specialize
the interpreter with respect to the
source program and then you get a target
where you can run the input and get the
result so in some sense by doing this
the specialization step what you end up
is producing a compiled version of the
program in practice partial evaluation
is strictly to do automatically
especially because you have to to do the
to do this binding time analysis to
figure out well should I should I make
this part of should I execute an
expression and while doing the
specialization or should I defer it and
generate code in the target so one way
around this is to just say well we will
do the binding time annotation manually
and sort of sort of have this
multi-level language so that's the idea
of
staging so then we kind of realized that
we realized this turning interpreter
into a compiler by basically staging the
interpreter and kind of sort of manually
doing what what this mix step does but
doing it in a principled way where what
we're doing really is is thinking about
which parts of our program should be
executed during code generation time and
which part should be executed should
create generated code all right so the
takeaway here is that a staged
interpreter yields a compiler and so
just to elaborate a bit on staging there
are multiple ways to realize this so one
is this multi-level language where you
explicitly annotate say your application
or your lambda with the level and this
level would indicate for example static
and dynamic so static would mean during
code generation time and dynamic would
mean generate code for later or you
could you could you could even have like
this B could just be some integer for
example so you would really have a a
multi-level language with arbitrary
number of steps one approach taken by
meta and methods just to use syntax to
to kind of give you a way to to quote as
code and then to splice in code so this
is there should be familiar to people
that are used to scheme quotations and
then you have a way to run code as well
and then in scala in the lightweight
modular staging framework we do this
distinction between code generation time
and generated code time by using types
so if you have a type T then it's it's
it means execute now during code
generation and if you have a type prep
of T it means generate code to execute
later all right so in this talk we will
use a little bit a multi-level language
as kind of the foundation for our level
and zero and then we will use
lightweight modular staging as well as a
framework to do the the language purple
that I showed an example of at the
beginning alright so a stage interpreter
used a compiler so how can we use this
inside
it to to collapse the tower of
interpreters so the first idea would be
to just stage each interpreter in the
tower and really what that means is that
now we have like a chain of compilers a
tower of compilers and so we can just
compose them to go from Ln two and 0
but what about the the goal of having a
one-pass compiler and this is
particularly important for reflection
because in reflection we can dynamically
jump back and forth between the levels
so if we just had a multipass compiler
it would be very hard to to be able to
realize this this jumping back and forth
and furthermore that means that you
really have to stage each one of those
interpreters and if they're different
that means you have some manual work to
do and if there are different languages
you must have like dedicated code
generation facility at each of these
level ok so is there another way so the
the other key idea is that we will
abstract over whether we're generating
code or not so in some sense we're
pulling morphic over the stage and and
the way we wire this is that we say well
the base language is this multi level
lambda calculus which supports stage
polymorphism and by doing this we can
get away by just say changing the user
most interpreter and then the other
levels can have just work in this sort
of pass-through mode where they hand
down the staging commands but don't do
staging commands of their own and by
doing this we get a one-pass compiler so
in the rest of the talk I will kind of
show you how to realize this wiring in a
few examples in a few example systems
but just to to go back so if we look at
the example towers I showed at the
beginning what it would mean here is
that we would only stage the regular
expression measure or with only stage
the modified evaluator and then we would
get to this picture bye-bye
by relying on on the fact that the low
level is a stage polymorphic okay so the
two systems I will show are pink and
purple and so purple you've seen an
example already and pink is is more of a
kind of showing the this stage
polymorphism from France first principle
using a multi level lambda calculus and
purple is using the LMS framework in
scala and pali topic programming via
type classes so one is so-so pink is a
little bit more dynamic and purple is a
little bit more static because purple is
relying on the staging driven by types
that is in Scala and pink is really
relying on on doing the the staging at
dynamically by dispatching on whether
you have code or not all right and then
the other one one design question is how
do you control the collapse so in in
purple we do this just by having this
computation unit the C lambda but we can
also do explicit lifting and it's kind
of useful as a proof of concept to do
that so this is what we do in pink and
then the tower size finit or
conceptually infinite and in in each
case you can add a reflection and
mutation and so on alright so let's
first look at this multi-level lambda
calculus so the idea then is to have a
lift operator to explicitly delay things
to generate code and then we also have
this automatic let insertion which
allows us to to to control the order of
operations make sure we we're consistent
when we're generating code and not not
moving side-effects around for example
and then the realizing this idea of
stage polymorphism so this multi-level
lambda calculus is really like online
partial evaluation in the sense that we
really dynamically decide the stages of
the code alright and so we have a few
ways of defining the semantics either
either as a small step semantics which
is more traditional or
as a definition interpreter a big step
semantics and that's nice because we can
then really just run it and and play
with these ideas so here I just want to
highlight the implementation just to
show you that it is it is something that
you know that that can be understood and
and and just highlight how these these
key ideas of like having a lift operator
stage polymorphism and and that
insertion works out all right so this is
actually pretty much the code in Scala
for the for how you do the multistage
evaluation and so one thing that is
interesting to see is where the stage
polymorphism comes in so here when we're
evaluating a plus expression we first
first evaluate the two sub expressions
and then we match on the resulting
values and if we have some some
constants some numbers we can directly
do the the we can directly do the plus
operation and return a constant so this
is as if it was executing during the
current stage but if we have two code
values then we actually reflect the plus
node for the later stage and and we kind
of do this sort of dispatch or through
the the evaluation and so for lift this
is the lift operation is kind of similar
to what you have in normalization by
evaluation where we kind of go from a
value back to an expression and so say
if you have a constant you just go back
to like like I mean basically this is a
constant value and this is a constant
expression and then for at a pole you
just go back to a cone spare for example
and then for a closure you actually go
back to a lambda so to do this it's kind
of you have to refi the body of the
lambda and so on and then for the LAT
insertion what we do in fact is just
rely on the side effects in the host
language to so that we can keep track of
of of the the operations and the program
as it goes on so when you have a I
reflect what you do is that you end up
just adding this to a
and then refi is the part where you kind
of accumulate all the reflux that you
have within a block so anyway this was
just to kind of roughly roughly give an
idea of how we we implement these things
but it's really nothing too special and
nothing nothing too fancy you can do it
in Scala and scheme you can it's it's a
it's a it's a small stuff so now the
question is how do we use this to
actually do a collapsing of towers so
the first the first step is to define a
meta-circular evaluator that is stage
polymorphic and this is now meta silkier
so it's in this language that is not
exactly scheme it's it's its own it's in
as its own thing where lambdas are also
taken extra argument for the for the
recursive self if you want and then the
actual argument and so if you look at
this what it takes here is that as usual
for an evaluator you have the
expressions that you are evaluating and
then the environment and in addition
here we'll just give the eval explicitly
to be able to tie the knot and what's
new is this may be lift which is really
just a way for us to abstract over
whether we're lifting or not so just
think of this as maybe this is actually
doing the lift operation or maybe this
is just the identity function and not
doing anything and so if we look at
where these may be lifts are this is
where you would if you were to stage
this interpreter this is where you would
put the lifts so in in a sense you do it
for any sort of place where you're
returning a value so if you have a
number then you do this this may be lift
if you have a lambda you return a
closure so you do this maybe lift if you
have a Const you return a pair so you do
this maybe left and for quote as well
but for the other cases you kind of just
rely on the on them on the stage
polymorphism to do the right thing so
here for plus we we have the two
evaluations of the two expressions and
if if we end up with two numbers this
plus will be well
we'll just execute just executed the
current stage but if we end up with two
to two to code values this Plus will
actually create a plus node so for the
elimination form you kind of you kind of
just rely on the mental circularity to
get the right propagation and
uninteresting cases for environments so
here for environments notice that we
don't do any lifting well the idea here
is that the environment itself the the
structure of the environment is
something you know when you're executing
the end the evaluator but what you might
not know if you're if you're if you're
staging the interpreter is the exact
values that the variables in the
environment are bound to so if this
value turns out to be a code that means
you don't know it and if it turns out to
be a non code value that means you know
it so here we we again just rely on the
fact that we can look up this expression
and depending on what binding we have we
use that okay so now that we have this
we can do interpretation so here I've
defined this eval to basically do this
maybe have just have the identity
function for them maybe left and so now
it's just an evaluator that is
interpreting and so here I have the the
source code of factorial and I can just
evaluate this source code and get the
right answer
so I'm doing some interpretation and I
can also do do double and triple
interpretation this this is a slowing
things down but it would it will still
give you the right answer so you can
think of this as a mini tower in some
sense okay so what about compilation so
for combination we just use --lift
as the maybe lift and now if I do ever
see of factorial source I get the code
of factorial in in a style in a normal
form and everything and so now what I
can do is I can witness the collapse by
basically doing the wiring as I
suggested in the diagram so we we just
stage the last interpreter and in the
tower and then we we always get the same
code regardless of
many levels of evaluation we have so all
the overhead of the intermediate level
disappears and so if we go back to this
picture this is the this code kind of
realizes this picture we're here we had
a Val see and here we had a Val service
a resource and so the other thing we can
do is do say a modified evaluator at the
top and so then we would we would get
some modified code as well and so here
are some examples so this is the the
code for the original the compilation of
the factorials research just this is
just factorial and this sort of with
explicit let's for for each sub
expression and then if you do the
tracing you get explicitly those extra
log calls if you do continuation passing
style you get in addition to the to the
lets you get an actual explicit explicit
lambdas for the for the continuations
okay so what about purple so then in
purple we decided to to just use the
scheme where we don't have explicit
lifting everything is just hidden inside
this computation unit of C lambda and
and it's it's really using the
lightweight modular staging framework so
compared to to pink it's more like
offline partial evaluation because
statically we will we will kind of try
to to to know whether an expression is
in one stage or a second stage but we
can also abstract abstract that over by
by by using by abstracting over the
types so what we do is that we basically
have this type class R of T while we
have this type R of T and if we instance
it R to wrap then we get staging and if
we instance it are too low rep where
Nora please just define as Norweb T
equal T then we just get interpretation
and if you recall the collapse in purple
then this is kind of the the type class
we have for the operation so this is
like whether the target language looks
like so we have
Kahn's car Cooder we have explicit cells
for for explicit mutable cells and then
application function continuation if and
so on alright so one thing to notice
though is that to in order to to kind of
have a reasonable semantics for for for
compiling these reflective towers of
interpreter we did do we do have one
difference in terms of them the
structure of the reflective Tower so if
you look at black and also the
predecessor what you have is that kind
of each each level in the tower has
conceptually its own CPU or its own
program counter or its own continuation
if you want but in purple we just have
one global CPU which kind of fits better
with this idea that you're going to
compile everything down to the same code
anyways and yeah there are some sort of
interesting meta questions about this
because this is not something you can
see in and when you observe each level
of the tower it's really kind of in the
meta semantics of the tower that you can
notice these differences okay and just
to recap so you've seen this earlier
example with the modified semantics
what's interesting is that in purple the
levels are not really that clearly
eliminated when we do this compilation
unit anyways so what's what's
interesting is that even if we define a
sort of compiler at the user level so
see if we define a very simple string
matcher and then we end up generating
code that is actually that looks like
we've compiled that that that that
regular that string matter so here for
example if we just want to match whether
a string starts with a B we will
actually generate this code where where
we're explicitly checking ok well is it
null is the first part of the string a
is the second part of the string B and
so on so that's kind of an interesting
thing that you get you can get for free
as well all right so in in summary what
I've shown is how to collapsed hours of
interpreters it was something it was
some scratch I wanted to itch
some sense like some as an intellectual
challenge and I showed that you could do
it in two ways and the key idea in both
stage polymorphism so abstracting over
whether you're generating code or
whether you're executing now and so I've
shown one way to do it and think using a
stage polymorphic multi level lambda
calculus and then using the LMS
framework and poly topic programming via
tag classes and then one design question
is how much of this computation process
to expose so I've shown one extreme
where you have explicit stage lifting in
pink another middle ground where you
have the C lambda where you kind of
abstract over the details of staging and
you could go the other extreme where you
can think of maybe using a technology
like this in a completely automatic
fashion in a JIT for example where the
the JIT would be able to to detect that
okay you have a you have a you could do
some like collapsing of towers of
interpreters and and so if you did that
you would also have to be very careful
about being able to detect that your
your collapses are out of date with
respect to the semantics and yeah and
this this brings doing just would also
bring a whole new set of questions about
efficiency of the collapsing itself
which is a not a given here so in terms
of potential applications so I guess
there are towers in the wild there are
cases where we want to collapse things I
don't claim that this work and this
idealized setting can be directly
applied there maybe it gives some idea
of how how like how things could be
structured in the wild so that they're
they're more amenable to collapse one
thing we're using reflection where it's
it could be useful is if you have these
sort of modified semantics then it could
be just a nice way to be able to to add
instrumentation do do various
modification on your on your semantics
but still kind of not pay the price of
an interpretation overhead and finally
non-standard interpretation so one one
example I'm particularly interested in
is well thinking of these sort of more
like like here I believe showing towers
that are in this sort of functional
imperative paradigm what about like more
more radical paradigms so for example we
know that we can have a racket
interpreter on top of mini camera this
relational programming language and this
allows you to basically turn basically
turn a functional program into into a
relational program and we'll bird has a
talk tomorrow about all sorts of fun
mini camera and stuff anyways so then
the question is what what sort of
collapsing could we do in that setting
and even even in that setting what's not
very clear is what would the staging
language look like for a logic
programming language while there has
been a lot of work on partial evaluation
for staging it's less clear and then
another another idea would be for
abstracting abstract machine so here
you're you're kind of defining an
interpreter that you're approximating to
do more of more static analysis sort of
work so can we also use this collapsing
approach for for this kind of setting
where it's in general I suppose one way
to put it is that we might not just
collapse for performance but also for
like helping and reasoning and being
able to do new cases that were not
possible before so thank you that's all
I had and here are some references so
code for pink and purple if you're
curious about reflective towers there's
a long history with brown blonde black
you can probably find that for staging
in LMS I have the website as a good
starting point and for stitch
polymorphism Gharib up in Bag at ETH the
work on on stage polymorphism in the
context of high-performance computing so
being able to control the the shape of
generated code and so on and so he has
he has some good work on that so thank
you very much
thank you
I like your ponies questions so this
strikes me is related to but in a
different field recursion schemes and
fusion of algebras and sort of your your
stage polymorphism actually ends up
being trying to abstract over like
whether you're you're sort of folding
down or back up the back up the tree is
there is there any relation there to be
explored or like am I just actually
misunderstanding what's going on I mean
I mean it sounds it sounds related
depending on so then what would you do
with the so you would control the
foldings versus unfoldings for example
or you would fuse different like
algebraic steps into one yeah generally
what happens is you fuse the different
algebraic steps into one so for example
in the quasar compiler which is
implemented predominantly using
recursion schemes we have a large number
of passes that are not getting fused
sort of automatically for us we don't
even have to think about it
the sort of staging aspect right I mean
you can use staging to do a lot of this
this sort of fusion as well and even in
a very controlled manner so you can
choose say if you wanted to do fusion of
these these pipelines where you have
like map filter and things and and and
so yeah that's in some sense it sounds
like you're doing it using the
computation time of the language while
we're doing it by having a whole face
like a runtime code generation approach
so you have the whole host language to
kind of you know control exactly how you
want to do the code generation does this
have
I got the feeling that there is an
implicit common representation for all
the stages that you are trying to
collapse yeah I mean in this example we
are we are on this part so we have the
the the generated code like the the code
we generate is really always in this
like most low-level language but still
when you have a tower what happens is
that it kind of goes through the other
levels that you know add whatever
semantics that is meaningful to them but
I think this is a fair point that we've
explored mostly pretty homogeneous
towers yeah because the the I was really
interested by the the practical example
is the first example you mentioned which
is basically transforming a Python code
to machine code say or whatever and this
is this means that at each stage you
have different reputation which means
that each stage should you have multi
syntax take whatever stage
interpretation I don't know what this
means but that's that's in that case
it's I mean this would be ideal if you
could just teach this Python to bytecode
and then get get sort of you know
something working but what's difficult
is that it's it's kind of doing
something strange where it's going to
this like very low level and then back
in different languages
yeah yes I think I think this would be
from a research point of view like if to
push this idea further just to consider
more heterogeneous towers where even
within the same paradigm you would
consider different languages and even
different level different like levels of
you know low level versus high level
mixed I think that that's a fair point
that I didn't I didn't really cover that
okay
