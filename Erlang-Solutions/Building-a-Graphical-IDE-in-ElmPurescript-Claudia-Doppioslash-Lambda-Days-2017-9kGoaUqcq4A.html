in alman few script
I am clouded at the flash I'm a
functional programmer and the game
developer and they write on lambda cut
about functional programming and I work
for best fitting at the MGM bah when we
do cool stuff with our embedded Erlang
mainly for in do and also controller the
automotive industry like stuff like this
much conveyor ball we actually run Erlin
and we also do an embedded board the
runs all and for any other line space
languages like alex here or LFE so why
might you be here well the first option
is you want to get some funded code done
and you hate javascript anyone yes it's
a popular one you might also be
interested in asking like languages in
general or undecided between mmm and
pure v in which case i hope i'll give
you some data points to make your
decision today what you are getting is a
working progress more than so basically
the public project is not finished yet
but we've made choices and we change our
mind so I'll tell you what went right
and what went wrong and our experience
of porting from an secure script as well
but this won't be an alum or period
guide and this is not the latest and
version it's actually an 0.16 because
there was a jump between 0.16 0.17 where
they got rid of all the things in that
column over there so if you mention any
of those and you don't out and you don't
know about them don't worry you're not
supposed to know about them anymore so
our project is a visual ideally for an
interesting language appears language
with that nice memorable name is IC blah
blah blah numbers stuff like that and
PLC means programmable logic controller
they are computers used in industrial
automation and the sort of fall of the
parallel universe version of evolution
because they standardize on function
block which is the block over there in
the top there are event the events and
on the bottom there are variables and VI
these that are usually used in the
industry right now look like that
on the left but we wanted to do
something a bit more special for our IDE
so we were inspired by best Victor's
talk inventing on principle if you
haven't seen it I suggest you do because
it's really cool and that that graph
those graphs down there are taken from
that talk and this is our project so I
think you can see some similarity on the
Left column and I'm going to explain
exactly how these works because a lot of
layers involves compilers and embedded
stuff so basically this we start with
the PLC language program which is then
compiled into bin files and then the
beam runs on their method the hardware
and also cowboy runs with it with a
cowboy is a web server for a link which
enter cents talk to the program and
sends the bug information to our ID we
had a few requirements for this project
mainly a crosstab it should be cost
platform we needed support or vsee OSS
and also the iPad pro and the
performance do need to be a least
interactive so 30 FPS would be good and
we were going to show a lot of graphs so
that required some thought but we
decided to go with web technologies
because a the easiest way to go across
platform without having to write
everything all the time so there will be
JavaScript CSS and SVG possibly but you
know JavaScript let's not do that
so we didn't and back then we had a few
choices for our language that compiles
to JavaScript so that's read usable so
we had closure script and CoffeeScript
and al and typescript and I think you
know which one we chose out of those
which was elm and but why did we show
them the children well the main reason
was functional reactive programming the
paradigm around which it used to be
based and we were into it and we
basically chose it for that reason and
also the good error messages the famous
good error messages
have that was certainly better than
undefined is not a fight and also some
concepts were somewhat similar to Erlang
like mailboxes they're not quite the
same but it was nice that there were
some similar keywords and we thought it
might be more similar than it turned out
to be so what is was a good description
well it's basically a purely functional
strongly typed eagerly evaluated
language the compile to JavaScript and
it used to be based around functional
reactive programming which is now gone
and info as asking like syntax but
without the strange squiggles like the
starship operators strange sequences of
characters that are we taught without
those and it's also a very small
language very self-contained and that
makes it better optimized for learning
curve so there is not a much language to
learn so you learn it quicker also it's
similar to a square in many ways but it
doesn't have an advanced type like
higher kinda tides right classes
none of that the approach with outliers
compared to JavaScript are quite a few
well the main one is if it compiles it
works 90% of the time that actually is
the real thing and also you can be very
confident by factoring because you can
just make a change and then you'll get
error messages and then you can fix them
one by one and at the end it just works
not almost no post involved it just
works it's also very clean language and
it's more expressive so you don't need
that many lines of code to do the same
thing you would do in JavaScript and
also the famous crater of messages where
pro about those those actually works so
well because they don't send you to look
at the line 359 of your code and figure
out what the hell you were doing they
just show you the piece of code that
they're complaining about and then it's
really about if it as one of the simple
errors that it's prepared to suggest you
a solution to you will also get the
solution to your error and how do they
do that because great error messages are
not really common even though they're
getting more common because other
languages are getting inside by a try
Rast is adopting that and also even GHC
is trying to adopt that so how do they
do it well they made it a priority at
the very beginning of the project so
they had the triple public do git
repository subtract to track strange
error messages and then they would fix
them in the next compiler version so
actually a lot of efforts went into it
and also you have less type system
complexity compared to something like
active or pure scripts so if your type
system is a bit similar it's easier to
have good error messages and also in an
0.16 there was something that was a bit
of a problem with the type errors which
is if you want to do say you have a
function you define this function it's
got a type signature you use it 50 times
but the 51 time you actually make an
error with it and you think I want a
compiler to tell me what where that
place where I call this wrong is but
actually sometimes you will tell you the
definition is wrong so you would be left
to go through all those 5:51 instances
of the code function by yourself which
is not idea they might have fix that
though and also I don't know if you've
seen the web talks about JavaScript
someone has so I'm actually make sense
as a language while JavaScript you know
at the time of that talk array 16 would
give you 16 commas in JavaScript
no idea why and there are a few cons
compared to JavaScript for example Java
the repairability
is not the white it's not very flexible
but if you need to wrap some big
JavaScript library like d3 that's going
to be fairly painful and also it's a new
language is still zero point tags so you
might be want to be aware of that but
all in all that wasn't done much so we
went ahead with it and I'm going to
explain to you a bit more about the
project structure which is fairly
complicated so we have the PLC board and
the beam is running on it and you find
the pills program and
the cowboy Webster Erlang web server and
the bullets WebSocket library for cowboy
and they talk to each other and they
send informations WebSocket to the
browser which is running the arm
application which is getting through the
bullet client is getting the WebSocket
information from bullet server and
through ports is talking to the young
rang a WebSocket library our custom
library which then talks to the PLC ID
program and now I'll show you the PLC ID
program hopefully and a bit more yes if
you can see that the function blocks
that you've seen before on the top there
are events which are firing and on the
down the bottom of each function block
degrees the variables which are changing
and this is a semaphore program so it's
got I've read the yellow and the green
you can just click on the variables and
it will show you all the values in the
last 60 seconds or so and as you can see
the green and the red never overlap
which is the points of a semaphore but
the yellow does a little bit and you can
just see that out of the plot over there
and it was the main points of doing this
patch ID what moving on so that program
there as this structure so as you know
we got the PLC device which and then we
have a WebSocket component which we call
L rank which is separate from the
decoder component so the WebSocket
component gets the JSON API and then
send it to the decoder which decodes it
and sends it to the renderer which keeps
the state of everything and renders to
the browser where you will have UI
interaction they will get sent to the
encoder which will encode JSON and then
send it back through the WebSocket
library to the device and then get an
answer back and that is not the usual
way and programs are built right now but
it was their own version so each of the
components is what used to be called
startup which is basically the animatic
culture there was the implementation of
the architecture
and 0.16 as a library which is a bit
different from what is now the young
language and the Elm architecture and
the people which are more mailboxes and
undresses here so little 0.16 but it
works like this so basically you have
you know the model is the state and you
have an update function to which you
also give the act the model and the
action and calculates the next page of
your program and then renders that with
the view functions and let's get any
browser input and make an action out of
it which is then addressed to the proper
component and received through the
mailbox so we have these actions
developed from the browser and you will
then calculate the next state of the
program on it so this up as you know was
made of four components which were four
components of made of start up connected
by different mailboxes and we wire them
into a parent start up so they're
actually nested and it is a interesting
structure invented by the github user
Fox donut which we chose because it was
very difficult we wanted to be flexible
and be able to add components when we
wanted to but it was never 42 0.17
because it's really like having a on FRP
and you could probably port it but it
wouldn't be as elegant anymore it
wouldn't be as nice to develop it so we
didn't really bother and also a
WebSocket library can be a component to
2d structure but it would be awkward
supported to the new world so that's the
main reason we are still a zero
persisting the make the actual main
reason is that it works so that's good
didn't stop working let's reuse FRP very
heavily and the bad projects ad is was a
client project so I had a limited budget
and we didn't want to spend out of
budgets porting to a new version of
valve which we might then port again to
another new version of and so we sort of
stopped there and we were frustrated
about lack of communication because the
0.16 to 0.17 change wasn't didn't really
as an interpretation warnings they just
be the short alpha phase of like a
couple of weeks
was it an evil to light throughout to
change our direction but we're waiting
for an evolution to stabilize before
looking at it again and I probably go
over a few production problem we solved
while we're making it up like how to
organize sub components in a big
application so the structure we use the
file structure we use is from that
structure that we we adopted and if any
phrase over because it's got an action
model and view and update file one for
each of those and then it's got a
feature file where you write up all of
that together and then to wire up to the
main startup you have another file which
we called up to town and then you can
get that start up the dividing to the
main end and then why is everything and
we run also another interesting question
was how to mix Allen Allen project
because if you have many Allen projects
which maybe have each one and app you
want to call you to do you keep
different repositories so you mix them
what we'll do what we ended up doing is
having another subdirectory in the Ellen
project so we could compile the unfiled
supreme and then we do just at the
resulting J's file through the HTML and
that works pretty well for us another
thing where maybe is not awesome
mentioned is if you're and if you have
an L package that you want to put on the
young package repositories wherever all
the packages are if it's not JavaScript
in it you can't put it there they won't
allow you so we couldn't put a libraries
with JavaScript over there so you have
to have your own different solutions
what we ended up doing was having it in
repertory as I said before and then you
fetch it and you have to store it in the
subdirectory of not yell projects but
your own projects one up and then you
can move all these only the end files to
a subdirectory of the un-- project but
not under and stuff because that's where
unpackage put its own libraries and I
will mess it up horrible which has
happened
and then you can include that
subdirectory created in an package.json
and that is the most straightforward way
I know to do this now we're moving on
I'll talk a bit about the rendering as
you saw we have a fair bit of plots and
graphs and stuff that were rendering
there were a few choices for that we
could have done the HTML way which would
have been awkward and another option was
making our own 2d rendering engine in
WebGL which would have been really cool
but that probably would have taken out
quite a few a lot of time and so what we
ended up doing is using SVG also because
SVG library is really good and the
choice there was do you do the Styles
and animation in CSS so do you do them
in L and we went with SVG with CSS
because doing animation you know you can
do it it works but it's a bit awkward
you have to keep a lot of state around
and that's what CSS is for so you want
to use it for that so we just keep ur v
styles in a separate CSS files we don't
mix them with you at all and then we
have physics and I switch the expert on
call which I recommend for any times
yourself is watching up you just ask her
of a lot of problems okay one thing I
want to say about HTML and SVG is that
they are I think great syntax as you can
see that it's even it's the first time
you saw them ever
you can still tell what is the tag where
are the attributes what are the next
tags so I think that was very nice
and it's also BAE both are based on
virtual Dom so they are very fast you
can see benchmarks online there are a
few and they are quite fast so summing
up our Elm experience is if you want to
make an ell program you should be aware
of what Elm is good for specifically
what the Almaty texture is good for
because Alan program has two Fijian
market structure there are no more
escape ashes now which is very good if
your apps fixed because then everything
stays forward you don't have 30
frameworks for me to choose from and get
bogged down in
Charlie indecision but then if it
doesn't fit then you can get out of it
so that's not good for a beer West where
everything will be fine and if you are
one if you want to rap JavaScript
libraries big JavaScript libraries like
d3 you probably don't want to use them
because as I said there is no path to
get your rapper on the L package and
then Noah we use it and then everything
is quite awkward also if you use parts I
don't know who here has used them okay
the interoperability is called port and
it's quite limited because you only have
this this part is basically you can send
it at one and send data back to
JavaScript but it has to be of a certain
type that you declare and so you have to
have a different sport for each of those
that you want which tends to be pretty
long if you're wrapping a big thing and
also Alma still experimental as 0.16 2 0
17 proved there will haven't been since
big changes so they open 17 and 0.18
I'm still pretty similar so maybe there
won't be any big more big changes who
knows I don't know but be prepared to
write some code and also unlock the
roadmap a soul in an altered mind which
is great but it's a bit less great if
you want to make predictions and now if
you're going to write start but still it
is zero point X language address short
Rita previews and you can keep up with
them and the changes by subscribing to
the Elm dev mailing list so what's next
we have skipped over and 0.16 0 / 17 as
you're presenting and maybe we'll come
back when and is near it with 1.0 and
more stable but meanwhile we're going to
take another language for a spin and do
something with it
and now we have more choices compared to
large so the design we started this
project there are also reason buccal
script
variable pure script they are breeding
like rabbits
so it's several more important to choose
wisely or rice everything yet again a
first choice was Elm so and we're
basically we're saying please adopt me I
swear ever mention moment everything
would be easy and it through to a degree
but after you've used them for a while
you might want to break free out of
those limits which makes your life
easier but also harder in some ways well
we chose pure script which frees you up
they said if you can do whatever if you
can make it type check it's up to you
but then many more choices and much more
freedom so so I will tell you a bit
about pure script because it is a purely
functional strongly typed even really
evaluated language the compiled to
JavaScript what have you heard that
before
ok start of the differences we've got
many advanced I'd if you've got higher
kinda types either type classes monad
functors applicatives a lot of stuff and
it's also uses the Acolytes thing back
spell but with all the squiggles
actually pretty enthusiastic about
squiggles so you got your starship
operators and all of that but there's
also a way to deal with that and makes
future and and I must say it wasn't
really much into squiggles but now that
I'm used to them they do work in the air
we were quite concise so it's probably
just invented invest the time to get
used to them and one the other
difference from out is that it has no
runtime and they build it on the
JavaScript semantics and added types on
top so it generates readable JavaScript
and you can you can almost work in your
JavaScript and then change it if you
want to and that should work without
driving you crazy and also it's got a
nice community it's not big but it's
open and there's a bit of a road map
which helps so summarize the philosophy
differences between Elmen pure scripts
without the main priority is service
mode learning curve and
be able to learn it fast and keep things
simple while in two states you they're
always adding new stuff and they do take
care that the stuff makes sense they
just don't have things for the sake of
it but you should be prepared to have a
longer learning curve and and to learn
the nice obstructions things that maybe
you put off before and another thing is
and doesn't really give you any choices
which is nice you just want to get
something done you'd only have one
possible program structure you only have
them helm HTML library so it keeps you
really focused on what you want to do
well include clip there are many
possible way of searching your apps many
libraries and many choices we could
going to go over a little bit now so in
might ask yourself why pure script after
add the trade of the done makes is quite
interesting by keeping the site simple
but still using the type concept from a
skill it keeps the learning curve smooth
but it also gives you more boiler sites
because you can't abstract some stuff
out that you clued in a scaler pure
script and also the component business
is a bit awkward weights with knives and
other things so you might want to keep
that in mind so the main thing for me
was the personnel are quite nice I like
them coming from some functional
programming enclosure it's actually
surprising how much I like them and so
what types yeah let's do that and they
also have more features so simplicity
but so far where you have to choose your
poison
at this time edge point in time I choose
power also because once you've done like
a year Val more maybe two years ago your
fancy to be a board of the boiler plate
I have so you're likely to be able and
ready to reach for higher abstractions
to get rid of the boiler plate also it's
similar enough that I don't have to
write everything single character in the
codebase like I probably would have had
to if I had chosen closure script as a
second language also an interesting
thing is it's possible on to implement l
in pure skits of the library and someone
has done it and 0.16 but you can't do it
the other way around because of the
limits that we were talking about before
and one nice thing about your scripts is
that it benefit from following a scale
from a distance so the people develop
new stuff in a scale they try your stuff
and something is cool maybe something
less cool and if you see they do stuff
with a bit of a time delay so they know
what is cool and implement that for
example the pipe rack trust hierarchy in
pure script they were able to implement
it right the first time around because
they learned from Oscar while I think
Oscar is still having a bit of time
trying to fix it without breaking all
the code before another nice thing is
the community is small but open and the
communication still works so some pros
compared well are well Pursuit is a
search engine for types so you have all
this code source code of the pew script
libraries you can search true by type
signatures or also by function name so
if you have a static operator and you're
wondering what the hell is this and how
do i import it you just put it in pure
street and it will tell you what library
to imports and all the documentation for
it
and what it is so that's really great
and element got something like that with
an package they got some search but it's
not over everything and it's not I don't
think it's bite-sized and someone
implemented who girlfriend I think but
I'm not sure if they still working on
that
also it's got a clear direction as I
mentioned and one surprising thing is
you can work a lot with the wrapper if
you want because you know you can't
really none because you're relying on
the runtime and in the wrapper you don't
have the cycle of the almighty Thatcher
to drive shaft but in the critic rifle
you can do everything yourself so if you
want you can build a program for
start-finish at least a small one
within the restful and it's also got a
really nice multi-line mode and another
great thing is the workflow I use Emacs
and the workflow for Emacs is really
great you can have type holes which are
we recently introduced but they are
really good because you know if you
don't know the type of something you
just have to compile it please tell me
and it will not not also that not only
tell you the type of something that you
want to write not only tell you but you
will tell you what function in the
libraries that you have imported will
fit that type phone so you can just
basically ask the compiler and will you
can stick the answer in your code and
also you have you know as we mentioned
the very many cool abstractions and
stuff but it also takes a lot of time to
learn the cool abstractions so that is
the main content and I might inflict on
you are free reflections on the
relationship between and pure scripts
and Oscar now flee if you don't want to
and so arm is the simplest language out
of the tree it's focused on development
user experience which there are many
languages that do that so you have one
way to do things and they are quite
merciless with all historic old
historical baggage they just get rid of
it people don't use it we introduced the
feature people that use it it's gone
next version is gone which keeps the
language small anything it makes a great
and clever language into this world of
purely functional statically typed
languages while compared to that circuit
is a bit more focused on yet they do
worry about the valium user development
develop early user experience but
they're not obsessed about it they also
like to implement powerful stuff even if
maybe it's not so obvious also use it
but you can feel figure it out and it's
I think it'll ops a very sensible way of
doing things and it's very practical
maybe more practical than stuff in a
school because a scale is our search
language so you know the point is to
research new stuff and these new stuff
my pay off or not so you act is not
really a worry usually
and they also need to keep a lot of
backwards compatibility because of
historical baggage and that makes it a
bit harder to have good developer UX in
Haskell so if you go from say hell yeah
you start from that you get used to the
syntax you reduce to the site see
diffuse to the purity and then go on to
pure scripts you get the abstractions
how you can the site but it's still
eagerly evaluated because and that's a
helpful because you don't have to worry
about laziness while it when you go to
asker then at this point you already
know a lot of the reason or about tasks
just they have been learned the two
before but your flood laziness when
you're ready for it so I think that
makes the most sense as a sequence and
another difference is that Elam only
targets web browsers now not even know
GS so you can make service with it while
ticket have got many beacons C++
Erlang's and obviously JavaScript and
you know how to compile a lot of stuff
that's it so I hope this makes you want
to try pure script and if you want to
fight period at the moment the package
manager is power though that they which
is a JavaScript ecosystem package
manager but they are working on new one
specific for pure script so when you use
Bower though when there is a new version
of your skit Bauer isn't really aware of
it so it will try to install versions of
libraries and don't go together so don't
be discouraged if you are in one of
those times because after a little while
a few weeks all the library will be
updated and then you know we'd be ready
to go even even if nothing works just so
fit tight it is going too fast
so now I'm going to do a bit of a
framework overview in pure script there
are a bunch of choices and the main
difference between them a bunch of them
is wrapping react and a bunch of them is
just pure script and I'm going to show
them to you here in a graph according to
Phi complex City well you have the easy
ones like flares and packs which is our
implementation of the L max picture
basically that the length is 1
which are the might an optic UI and
rather Fremont rank which is a legend so
why would you try would you want to use
Flair pleasantly nicely the library
that's easy to start with to make like
cool interactive graphs like interactive
tables interactive plots and its really
nice and straightforward and a great way
to start doing something in pure script
and I'm come result without learning a
lot the limits are that there is only
one use case if you want to make
interactive graphs but it also doesn't
require a lot of knowledge if you just
can cope with interrupting a big Fronter
syntax you are ready to go you don't
have to learn a lot of other stuff which
i think is useful and then back and the
third box is similar to the ARM
architecture for as an advantage would
be that the SVG support is already
included through react and also nice
thing is that you can use the
interactive reactor bucket which is a
bit like the unscented little bugger
which was weak which is really nice it's
probably the simple to sleep framework
ELISA make web apps with web apps with
but you know the reason I don't like to
use it is react dependencies and I will
take a moment whine about installing
react when you try to install react it's
like installing tools forever like what
is it doing and when I was trying this
is actually get up was having problems
so stuff the installing would fail and
then I would have to start from the
beginning which was very painful and to
show you that the perks structure is
really like the air market archer down
the below there is the Almaty pattern
above there is a flux structure and as
you can see model is called straight and
that's about it
everything else is almost the same and
also effect you have effects in an 0.16
but in pure 50 you will see effect types
here I which are F and F and others in
fact they are so similar that I will
give you a quiz I will keep this for 5
seconds and then I'll show one is facts
and one
and then you can tell me which one is
part which one is M so five four three
two one and next five four three two one
which one was done yes by skipped over
last year the second good but it works
similar wasn't so moving on we have the
lenses ones I'm afraid I don't know much
about lenses but you like lenses there
are two options here then my traps react
and it's written by Phil Freeman which
is the author of few script an optic you
eye is made just in pure script so you
have a choice tar if that's what you
like so now we're going to talk a little
bit about halogen here beef Amanat so
allergen is it doesn't have any java it
doesn't wrap anything it's just pure
script so it's very really good for me
so I don't have to install react for a
hundred years
this is used by in production by
slamdata and which is a commercial
company which makes a rather complex web
application which is rather impressive
actually
so there are a bunch of people
developing it all the time and people
pay them for the product that they
produce with it which i think is
excellent if you want to do something
like that and it's almost version 1.0
almost so that also is nice and they
kept making it better and make it the
type less complex so it's actually
getting less complex as it goes on and
you might not want to do it if you don't
want to worry about types too much for
that probably you want to use box and
halogen structure compared to the other
Mac adventure is still pretty similar
model a state action is divided in two
different types of actions one is just
action and then the other one is request
from the state of the component just
have a component ID which is nice so you
can actually reason about it instead we
just have it in your head and update is
called evil and that's where the females
are
and render is called view also you have
to why the input in main just the way
you would do it with any period program
and effects are still the pieces of fact
and there are a bunch of illusions like
but all in all these super dissimilar
and I would say that halogen HTML syntax
is really nice too and in fact it's
almost the same at the Elm HTML syntax
which is nice and I will show you a very
simple component which just as a button
that when clicked change a boolean
that's it so at the top you can see the
space which is the say type which is a
boolean then you have the query
definition which is just the Union type
and then you have the component
definition which is vaguely reminiscent
of how you wire the start up library I
mean DLM architecture so you have an
initial state rendering evil and you
pass them to the component and you have
an initial state and you have the render
function which in this case is just
render this portion will on or off
depending on the state and then in here
you have deliver function which is
update to which you where you have the
case while you interpret which one of
the two commands you can give it so I
think that I mean there's more code than
maybe the other one but still fairly
straightforward a list for such simple
example and we still for you can see the
similarity of it so I hope I got you
interested in pure script and as well
and to get started we choose Kia we
suggest a few steps do it you should get
it from NPM or you can get the SVM which
is a version manager and then install
the version you want from that and also
you should probably reduce it by example
unless you're ready in Alaska but even
if you already know Oscar it will show
you what is different markup which is
the book written by Phil Freeman which
is the author of pure script and it's
free online and if you come from Elm you
should probably learn read the library
to read compact M which is the library
used by that and implementation in pure
script because if we show you how you do
the same things as well in pure supply
tap off our difference and stuff like
that it's actually quite useful then you
could try out packs or flare and you
could visit the pure six channel on
freenode or come to the online video
meetup which i think is monthly or twice
a month and then you could try out
allergens and free allergen and three
Mona's and stuff make a web app and
profit that's how it usually works
so my conclusion for pure script is that
it's a powerful language it's also a
sensible language I tend to agree with
most of the choices they make which is
nice
it got all your section you might want
right not all of them but most of them
and it will take you some learning it
would take some time to learn but if you
already know and it would quicker but
also one thing to keep in mind is you
don't have to learn everything you don't
have to learn three monitors on the
first day just takes less give it a spin
that's how I started and it's actually
nice enough and will probably make you
want to learn more and even though it's
not obsessing about having the greatest
user experience ever it's still a good
user experience because it's a sensible
language so we are at the summer between
almond pure script and also considering
working with the lung and works well
with our line and also toolkit work well
with the lung and it even compiled for a
long and if I compile it it will work a
compiler code it will work and also to
script is the same in a boilerplate can
get a bit repetitive and in pure script
types can get complicated and complex
and then we should never expect with
advanced type like I can decide because
there was some time at some point talk
of implemented type classes but that's
not that's not going to happen most
likely and the impurity should aspect we
have a bit of a learning curve if you
get started with flare and then go on it
will take you a while but it should be
fairly present actually in any of our
code syntax without the squiggles in PDF
consider
it's in all its squiggly glory and there
is no way no roadmap for an acceptable
and it is in the author's mind while
inclusive you have a bit of a road map
and you can also ask in the channels
they're really nice and they will answer
you and so I think that is a great time
to language into you know purely
functional statically typed languages to
come from even from functional
programming but not statically typed and
you get is a great second step so that's
it yeah I want one more thing I don't
know if you came to fast talk yesterday
but we as I said before we make have the
boards that run along so if you want one
you can subscribe to the mailing list
and you can win one from a raffle until
the 12th of February and that's all
thank you for the talk well so you
didn't actually set I think which
framework you end up using or you are
allergen ok we are going up Thanks
thanks for the talk and you mentioned
that you relied heavily on functional
reactive programming from Elm on the
initial version yeah 0.16 it would make
any difference now with 0.18 like your
decision does 18 didn't really change
much say they tidied up a bit they
removed some stuff that people wearing
using neighbor's house other people were
using actually and I don't like they
dropped they dropped the functional
reactive programming bit yeah I don't
think it's never going to come back to
the earth ok so we are going up
so you convinced me to try pure script
after having some experiences with elm
and now I have two questions which are
firstly you mentioned that you used
custom solution for wiring up your
application in old 16 and my question is
wasn't the startup enough for for your
solution and the second question is that
this boilerplate and the wrappers in Elm
happens to be like safety net which
prevents runtime errors and my question
is is it really worth it I mean did you
have any problems with JavaScript
Interop on the typescript side of things
one of the fine so what what was the
first one my member so the first one was
why did you use a custom solution
instead of startup in using startup just
every component remember that for
component graphs each one of them is a
startup but then you have to wrap it up
again in another startup that contains
all of them yeah exactly but you've also
said that there was a custom solution
and that that was the Constitution
there's a fair bit of wiring up all the
bits to do that yes oh I see now so
couldn't you simply use those four
components as like nested in this one
startup instead of using four of them
yeah it's also depends it also depends
on what you wanted to do to start with
because you know we started with the
idea that this was similar to Ireland so
we said oh we should do things as we do
in Ireland like an application model I
know we so we went that comparing
different components very separate from
each other which is totally different
from one single source of truth the two
things don't really work with each other
which is why I use allergen now because
it's not what single source of truth so
it makes sense for us for the frame of
mind that we use basically but it's your
choice you can make things work either
way
yes that makes sense and the second
question was about those rappers in Elm
because in theory they should give you
some more safety however did you have
anything yeah yeah the part you will
give you a lot of safety that you
wouldn't get otherwise it just it
depends well then it depends on your use
case if you want to use d3 rapping d3
with port I think it's going to be a bit
of work
it just years and we work the right way
with pusat for example and we can
basically use the code Victor
availability is everywhere you can use
it for everywhere also in the epic 16
you can only interrupt on the main file
so you can imagine having to send the
information from the main files down to
the sub components there was a lot of
work at the time but you don't have to
do that anymore now you can use ports
everywhere so that's something that only
is 40.6 of season rule 16 and on the
typescript side of things when you do
this interrupts have you encountered any
errors like for example specifying the
the wrong type in pure script for for
the JavaScript library is it possible I
haven't really done much with it yet
that probably is because there is no
type checking of the JavaScript path so
you will likely have a runtime error but
I will use library draft by other people
okay other people's wrapper is basically
