Zealand under mat Austria I work for a
company that's based in New Zealand and
started by an Asterion we give us driven
systems for the ground
tell me how to get my box around so I'm
stop that right speed up anyone know how
to write peanut like this maybe you have
been that what girls like I can't see my
face there
it's right there so we're not rich girl
I think this is a boutique scale we
don't give 20,000 servers in the cloud
and 5000 network devices our servers hip
nails we know them they are pits without
me deal I think it's actually never
talking about the Silent Way galaxy as
opposed to the Whigs feelings because I
don't think very many people actually
Henry scale and Dave arrives our public
purposes there's two to make domain
management beauty for everybody so if
you've ever bought a domain and Spain
reach to the company in the UK or
transfer the domain one jurisdiction to
other you will find out this is very
very complicated and domain mention
something that must be new once the year
and so many non-technical people really
struggled us than our goals and health
fails to make them
easy we pride ourselves of customer
support for all sorts of people despite
the very small team and across the
countries and we come a customer support
design a tip with our 12 people we've
been using you're able to be and
actually Apache couch Jimmy from the
beginning of the company surround 2007
2008 very early days how many people
were to really act then I was just
starting out so is that what's the
perspective this is a simply i think was
relatively new there were no nerves and
other theme was had a single schedule so
we been through all that growing bang
time of hey there's now a scheduler
there multiple schedules of assistive
here at lives you can add fresh I mean
all that stuff we've been through and
can we store of it we're here to stay
please shut up please to I run my name
as we go along if you can it's good for
us to get some some some live action and
like that vodka to remind you purely a
point of it like this okay so first up
let's start the story the case of the
zombie rabbit I'm so far betting my
grateful way cloud provider to another
individual plan perhapses deploy code
start services test things get us out of
the bed check the proxies over waiting
patiently switch primary duties and go
what's this going to be errors great
quick well except every few seconds are
already inclusive the slovers thought
not every time it would retain a nap and
then pick up again however in support of
the jobs pull things out of queues or
timed up and picked up new jobs and the
system at a whole words but when you
there was a problem and giving we just
moved from swarming into a really big
one that should have been screaming
along so we're kind of worried so here
look and because we're boutiques girl
obviously this wasn't think their
customers but it was emitting our baking
services everything we've got around put
a few things here the wrong things and
to section time I'll go straight to the
chase through toboggan I try to your
engine controls and every user it took
work in
this eerie search bar there are who's
had a bit odd you're in production yeah
it's just the worst it's like random
hero cars will be a segmentation fault
and the seeker me ascending that I
really don't we just article anywhere
I'm a little bit more group leader
undefined who's no it's not the group
leader is or does i think i'm gonna
change that so the group leader is the
process designated handle the io for a
given part of the vm it may not be able
to say no too long and then may be
important for example if you're running
a beast script that talks to your vm the
group leader would be the e stripped of
its running a student mode or a
community in itself if there's no group
leader is no place of iona go now the
cool thing about their every new system
still working attending jobs but we have
no logs which means we don't really know
what failed so we start off going we do
we call the group leg reverse code is
there anything explicit really cute
reports out and in what does day and it
turns out it handles blogging so the
first key check was there are no logs we
do we handle logging and then i logged
onto the team directly with remote shell
and just thought i'd just front of us
different processes we do as I bracket
bracket dot and sure enough there was no
group leader I tried starting one
delivery well so we don't understand the
whole really cute and everything went
perfect after their it turns out this
era is not particularly common there's
one other person that has heard this on
the internet at least a Tudor is a third
person having his problems rather than
the IRC channel have a social worker get
the spiritual reply which leaves them
this is your problem person what you
need to be effective this is why heaven
it's really run out of disk space so no
migration we have been doing usual thing
prepare for one server to another
databases were building in texas and one
of the databases couldn't we think to
its replication partner so that was
lobbying earring use of few seconds I
can't talk to the other system my heart
of the other system for about a week
while we were sitting things up we had
important to our main local system so we
didn't see these there round doesn't
space the sysadmin deleted the logs fix
the problem and never thought that it
might appear another protein for it
seems reasonable they were working and
inside very few the bottom function and
includes broken the supervisor head head
is here and so often the debtor crashed
right up at the top but a heavy started
the V in itself and so this is really
the key point for this tool is what this
work for Gloria protections I can be
official until the head this incident my
tested my stuff and I when I ran out of
disk space my my software is toast yet
so it's a good point to live happily
design
applications in a way where we can sit
there they're classic completely I'm
fine the rooms burn can you do that if
you'd asked me for five years ago up
have an ID able to start and Venus is
that the key frustration with the LA
metro system as you cover the subjects i
love the alexan tips lovely lips and
macros and then this is messing the best
leap of faith how i get from here to
understand this OTP thing and this is
clearly climb up it might take you two
or three years and you come down the
side you go I don't understand why
people find a suit that's just obvious
and hopefully didn't talk I'll give you
some ideas how to take the hill
systematically as opposed to wandering
around the base for four years like
identity so here we go off we go the
first busy actually reason they're one
of the top the first thing I'd like to
point out running away production is
basic barking this vital you don't do
this get it singer it's really simple
I'm logging apartment when I by 2 bar by
till they're basically supporting seen
Eunice processing metal stuff we're
importantly with errors that should take
a couple days the city if you don't have
them get better but see if you learn
from this is why do we prepare the said
530 system going mine a brown is study
feelings with the patch in cash
and databases primarily are a way of
saying if you can listen I guarantee you
back later I guarantee it and so capital
B will grow up the space me to stop us
us to mechanic signal data to got they
were to put it forever even cuter
similes are different we would rather
keep sending messages out of someone
else and hope that the rate of incoming
messages combined with durable cues
means we can get away with that so
they're Cincinnati's you can fight off
the other key learning for me was one
experience in production yeah once used
more than fifty percent of your vision
comes New York because you can't impact
because 52 think that's a segment
prosperous for their kicking probably
any other database that has a pwr yeah
at least you're Charlie if you Charlie
to get away with this there's before
their living from it's loosely coupled
systems fail gracefully that if you do
that the world is moving towards
microservices then introduces latency
network partitioning as well but at
least the fuel services are reasonably
well defined then you can have a file
separately aggressively and not
catastrophic Lee so a designer drug
resistant this is my four chips or
guidelines that have a kind of liability
big hill
this concept is a thing called era
colonel we're going to talk a little bit
about steak cheese finite state machines
may cute as a way put something to wear
put something somewhere to do later and
liftable minds if at all which I'll
explain later on so the Iroquois was the
minimal acceptable state recover from if
you think of this in terms of people the
world has been destroyed and a playing
Unleashed and times my past we only need
two people to restart the human rights
in theory it's appalling practices
little complicated but that's our broken
or just to legal yep they're having a
pacemaker in your heart on your knees
build pacemakers to doto versus medical
advice but i'm using the time the last
pulses only thing that really measures
so the pacemaker is some trouble
pressures and restarts the only thing at
least nervous when do I syndics past
when i get them regularly and in a
trivia okay something on a little more
family when familiar with a little bit
times there are only two things i need
to go into another route cash the unity
cash that identifies that swarm and any
peer that is actually active so
everything else
system crash I could lose all the data
on the disk or there can go so long as I
have one peer to talk to and the brutish
I can recover that state that make sense
yeah so you can imagine the complexity
of a tyrant system many managing many
many different modes and many big
working conditions it turns out and
about probably like 67 bytes to store an
upstate system to recover it from
scratch not necessarily aggressively not
necessary for clean but to occur there's
our variable I'm not really internal
space probe either but I thought of a
lunar module and and I know that they
have properties the very first one in
terms of processes pressuring and CEO
overload I'm kind of missing that sold
you know how high off the gravel bar and
your egg dosa which direction to keep
and how fast you can probably recover
most the other information like how I
got before I hit the ground in time and
the point i would make here is that the
European would be very very very small
this is the part of a replication that
there's device that's the piece you
would consider saying I put it database
I replicate their to another server a
checkpoint and put on some external log
file or cloud service safe here there's
a piece of one positive and once we
decided that we can start up it started
here what is acceptable to lose what we
can sacrifice and remembers only rabbits
is make sure you infrastructure is
loosely coupled because it avoids
so that's really key point here Eric
colonel your e-mails can be sacrificed
and most importantly an underdeveloped
testing this app actually other kill off
chaos monkey style any of the parts of
my application and the system should
tolerate we can continue to run like a
baby includes up the zombie rabbit sees
everything else can go so long as I can
receive messages and send them out
blogging is not necessary I require
matrix right so all these things when in
your ear occur should be out of band
they should we sent a simple process we
little precious data doesn't need to
worry about it can keep running so
around this is erica nor the next piece
if you want to put to paint in the
picture is as a state machine the
earring is the state with the fees we
need to preserve who here is familiar to
a state machine or if it's in so that
it's a half to two-thirds so the general
idea of the state machine is I don't
know why people like these things more
often because conceptually they're very
easy to explain and practice we often
implement these things implicitly in
Jesus scissors or other other data
structures without explicitly doing this
so is play the game hopscotch or PC
release the think that as a kid
hopscotch is a grid like this tier the
bottom and the top and you jump onto the
first stage of the hopscotch and your we
need to go now you have three choices
go forward it's a transition you know
you've only got one choice here as you
go forward that's a transition to a new
state state has now second square you're
at four choices are you unlimited to the
square right to the squares there's two
traditions there three directorship
magazine or a very useful one but it
still exists that I've go forward so
four states and these are the states
this hopscotch art we can develop
something that encodes the whole game
that's pretty simple I go forward five
estate it changes to a new state now
there are two ways boiling give his ins
you can be the model of state explicitly
and the function becomes the thinking
call to make the transition which
involve the transition into the saline
and have a function that creates the
estate and there's nothing on them as
approaches for some things works there
and the signs would spare key thing is
you can see how this relates to
empirical got my year ago I have
transitions that are clearly defined
valid states but like at the database
schema and a specific set of functions
that allow me to transition to the
validated state they're pretty
straightforward legs are is they're
pretty much everyone talks a lot okay so
what about the invalid transitions we
want to protect our Veera Colonel and
the simple solution here from LA Galaxy
perspective is I have a function there
cause the banks are call into the state
machine and I'm going to pressure their
function it was a Sydney garbage and I
everything that it tries to gravity must
be eliminated God okay and that sounds
pretty painful but if you something like
2g profits are very common library for
managing a list of lookups no hookups or
process or cuts in their lab she prob
doesn't let say that if you try and
clear before something that doesn't
exist it sends you back having second
thoughts since you think there are
something else and your precious
precious you the person that the
functional the process of sending this
message to the state chief of the
european will help us like what you do
very minute rap verse failure to return
a message to the user are you going to
put this on cue or some other system to
retry later can't decided in advance and
its really into this so i think state
machines behaviors which are because i
think is going to talk about later are
widely underused in the lane Alexia and
what I found a practice is that many of
us implement gene servers that do
exactly the sort of pattern we get a
message we match our ups we make sure
the searches about their full function
in our update our state but the thing
the gene sir that is we have made these
days explicit and the genes of the
family doesn't require that all these
transitions are valid and the cool thing
about statement changes you take them
off to the side you can put them in
their propeller and their allies
and improve the station is valid for the
set of transistors you to fight for
which sounds a bit super handy thing for
the air cool isn't it okay so your coach
it if it's the 6th 8th mutation
functions see doesn't get us or at least
loads and loads of pet matching and the
spherical all establishing another
should have types and struts and should
pasteurizer every time who uses types
all the time I'm extinct you see all
your hands are confusing types all the
time tomorrow on ends up yeah you're
really sure that save your time and it
catches things with imminence thought I
was going to type a type 0 to about two
years ago Ron Swanson code I started at
the new types up effect and then I found
these areas where I did not understand
my code I thought into this my vision
world tour and some types force you the
trough not the entire there's no chop
down the entire Forester than their of
an available ideas about your code but
they do take care of a few traits that
make me sure we will cope with the way
you think it does which I which is not
the case most the time so
the assemblage in server jewels in some
way of keeping of state of progressive
primer storage and the event of the
whole being the whole thing we can be
shut down everything else delegate
separate supervisors that when they
restarted they do not bring down America
mistake that's fundamental this means
display only work I 0 for them all the
separate workers when we want to talk to
them we're going to do their through
processes to a more brutal formal
contract like a message queue your
rabbit and killers about that the
ammonia care that I have for the system
it's really easy to say everything they
don't consider everything's in processes
and even when will communicate by bike
use for some parts of your application
first becomes quite an efficient and
that's because of the way modern CPUs
work they have a small cache a slower
than cash and sometimes a third little
cash and then they have ran and just in
each one of these is they adorable too
slow so every time I'm sending a message
to a process i'm giving the cpu in the
other leg runtime an opportunity to
intervene dub their cash it up so
carefully created in the CPU memory ago
I do something else so just beware it
too many processes you end up losing
like
through that probably for most
applications that i right that's typical
immature the real problems the sting of
the program of the screening program
yeah so cash loans are important for
critical code it's really good to have
that in a single process the course
funds and needs rather use message
passing everywhere so lay to was on ear
acutal achievement by state machine and
now we get the people who want to go and
get the station to change changes
triggers good it's not to be feared it
just needs to be managed and so you put
this change and cue it does necessarily
have to be you it could be a database
file and we sort of structured storage
but we can only think of it as a cue
it's a series of transactions or
requests for this particular statue to
try to apply you're not guaranteed
success and we also need to think about
what happens with the modes of failure
so i call these predictable worth
further there at the bottom it's the
predictable mode of failure is the key
learning for me
guarantee implications as it's okay if I
help I'm just going to make to the
ritual is that where happens and what
the consequences that there are so in
the relative you example i'm assuming
that they thought were supposed to come
in since their works someone has said i
don't really care are logging they're
testing everything so someone has to i'm
going to put logging messages into a
separate process i'm going to send the
wrong messages so and calm being with
ascending research always succeeds is
near an Iroquois decnet if process no
longer exists or tell another node has
disappeared so from the heading car the
Kobe writing log this law of this just
keep going metra this interest just keep
going these messages are going to
another process making Magnusson's about
patching them maybe curing them the
system of governance over there it might
go to handle to predict were cabbages
like reviews except my asus loss system
only you can ask it to cash on disk
until the deal with nature to be
obviously they comes back 0 and stuff
all these things are the things we can
think about work week use in particular
willing to monitor for through water and
latency I think the size of the queue
has been to really important because if
you run a memory then then your host but
January through
see the things that operational in
between to notice if you're through port
drops the lady gets too high users will
start a business and that easy things to
cheer for you care or leave miss Chu
length I think Amelia filling releases
it was an O in operation that I think
not Obama my company win that challenge
of it it's a good change so they are
proving that executing the process is
not something that gets bonuses for
system is more it's great so confusing
built up weed everything why and we have
to make a choice of that window we're
going to keep adding to the queue and
risk that the vm will eventually fresh
and then through choices we can defer
down or delegate they took these terms
from managing people when someone's work
too much work you set them down to go
you got three choices to further work
just do it you've done it and never
going to do it are you dealing at you
can find an employee or
to do that work for you you can package
yes the officious part of a certain my
mind interfering is exactly their
pressure you have anything like that
other sing to you can give it there are
some really really cool libraries and
for the last two or three years to do
this post box which i think is problem
feta beer fuse and safety valve from
Jerry and I'm sure there are others now
yeah so the key point here is also
showing metrics off to other systems for
this small and cute of transactions
waiting to comply to our state machine
we also want to report on our players
and the magic number i thought was the
95th percentile outlier this is the if
you like you but it's also regret this
stuff is good with all we do a lot of it
these things are very quick down front
here and this stuff down a bit the hotel
which is getting worse and worse the
whistle is the sniper the percentile
typically is the thing when you use and
start seeing problems so I figure a
graph one thing from your systems these
views are pick the 95th percentile and
agree that on some of the chart and sure
enough when people start having problems
you will see this percentile start to
rise and that's been more official
this is a reasonable point I can have
about a guest account so we defer it up
there is the zero point but I think
about cuter it's an explicit
coordination point between other parts
of our system cover it on the big slide
but the guts of it is about prior to
point our supervisor trees be very very
straightforward echo a state machine
revving the year ago and that's my
primary function was there's a type
application a larger supervisor tree
with auxiliary functions that are
important and then we crashed and we
started more or less transparently at
some of it I'm going to have to take a
design stick and make an explicit choice
about whether a particular piece of code
it's a library module or an application
as part of my main supervisor tree or as
part of some and they're not a function
that I just want to be aware of and what
an example specific example a few sites
for the wrong um so in terms of
predictable modes of failure we're
sending these visitors doraleous in its
or to our state machine it's going to
decide whether or not to apply these and
the outcome is either applied success
continued or rejected and the way I
recommend for or you're hearing others
to see they're sort of their art I
passage some people crashed
or the caller is going to us begin to a
try catch and recover which in our case
means you made a conscious choice
predictable motor failure for this type
of urine etc Bastardo message on what to
do you have here the program and what
you want to do about us maybe stick a
man like you and retry later ain't gonna
see the message better user I don't know
Joe Armstrong has mentioned for several
times and there's part of us discuss
about the Handy path and you seized more
tests to happiness programs give you a
mistake and we implement the stick and
then there's this undefined behavior so
you could mean that I think this is the
C language this is the definition the
canonical definition of the other file
specification what you should do
according to Joe are strong which is
therefore gospel yeah is that you don't
even mean that undefined value simply
don't is in a crashing will fall over
and then the risk is there
figure out what they want this program
in this program to do their case little
crash little bubble up it sounds scary
but on papers that with surprising well
you start off things die you cut them up
and then you sit down to maybe design
team or business people and work out
what you really want to happen
ninety-nine percent of the time this is
a very good strategy you've done the
stuff you don't know about an aristocrat
vacations and balanced are continues to
work
unfortunately it sounds all very
straight forward at the stage we've got
Q's when we are through our transactions
coming in and we know what to do with
your stuff in the queue that's right we
know how to handle things that go
through the developed and we know we
have to make a conscious decision about
how to handle things that are not valid
unfortunately the layer 3 is the ugly
real world we have things like liquids
that are flaky when you start TCP
session some of the Dahlia comments have
been eventually then it got to the flood
and then the new sauce let's go at least
you think it's gone but it turns out the
other end head of a slow spot and it's
just sitting it still in the space of
time you may have closed out in a web
socket and I'm starting new one and the
new one depending on how you set up may
get the tail into the last transaction
from the server that still thinks the
socket is over that's actually quite
common if using your so we use so we
unlimited unanticipated motor failure
there are so many things going wrong we
can't possibly consume more and if me
this was the Lightning thing about
learning
it's okay and not to be a program who
doesn't understand everything who
doesn't have it doesn't handle all the
important cases because if you focus on
any path ninety percent of the business
is working ninety percent of users are
happy and you're blowing this pile of
garbage we went down later and a less
stressful time not real time you might
prefer implications crashing no more
file or stash things that don't look
right and go back and work without our
universe the business is going wrong so
no programming and how smart Lincoln
cryptographers give its one hundred
percent in time I think this is
embracing my inner demons accepting that
failure is never bore and making
explicit so this is me if you like that
our the being way it will be is what
will fail and more
so this is where we need to think
carefully about many months will be the
liver failing the failure to validate
input it be some will also be working in
particular to grow yourself with this
disks and the timing matters the revenue
example is only rivers the underlying
issue was that messages are coming
through fast enough the envelope me
suggest that the opera is trying to try
to sing bear shaft sufficiently fast the
bitch is four and tries to send has
never seen that the gracious and you
will respond Nick reticent New River
support fresh new municipal apprentice
it so fast that the supervisors exceeded
its it's a allowable retrying they give
an amount of time so the supervising in
two minutes so the river was fast enough
we kill off the workers because the
supervisors supervisor dies and then the
entire subject of record q underneath it
restarts we leaving from a no-good state
and this is to renew presumed again so
the key thing here is when you're
talking to the real world we have to
think explicitly about overload our
queue overloaded about through cooling
system and is no hard fast rules for
this but my general plumbers monitor and
measure everything related to acute
latency and throughput message queue
length if you can grab them over time
and there may
long-term decision to that what the
sensible thing to do is dropping qs q
daily sales pay for most cases you're
dropping transactions that are not
related to a year ago door and there was
somewhere be recovered something maybe
you will use with a growing but maybe
most of them never seen a more stable
making system that's probably been on
the novel so one of the things you can
hear I'll touch on this inning of we
have time there's a really common
pattern for the high throughput reeling
applications is to initialize a sheer
socket their database handle or an
evening or something like that in the
supervisor or in the first worker if you
have a risk the one supervisor and then
passing them through all sorts of
components they share the socket and any
one of them that is really merit eight
beeps message of the side so wat saket
and maybe 20 or 50 workers having it the
problem here is what happens when one of
these connections types of Socrates for
some reason and this bottle empty
restart all workers or once and it's
very easy for us to exceed our trailer
that something really is that a test you
can start of observer and go off and
kill in the supervisor in or the first
process the first word press is
repeatedly and see what happens with a
rubber ones for a director but it's kind
of nice to kill it off and kill
watch your system keep running it's a
really nice different yeah um so when we
have these workers we need to have we
have a choice of three things with you
to link to them or monitor or explicitly
supervise the difference between these
three is explicit supervision foot to
the supervision true and as a result of
that we are now at risk of cascading
failure the other choice is to Heather
mother several supervisors let's try and
find a good example here if I'm having a
bitch survive too manly side a whole lot
of concurrent requests happen and I
accidentally processing just I want to
see people so I completed arrange things
with all of the HTTP listeners under one
supervisor and then overthrows over here
another big pile of workers we are
simply hema making transactions the back
into intentions might fall over
erotically the workers might blow the
bureau glee and supervisors we start the
other way of doing this is to turn them
around so it makes more sense to have a
single HTTP list with its own
potentially supervisor process or maybe
in process its own connection to the
database or to them to the making to
decide up to that's more mission
speaker and a change the web service and
free books if I have a problem in a
particular back into work and now it's
going to crash it the way we started but
it's directly linked to the supervision
tree now to its corresponding HTTP the
snow so the two choices here is
structure around the flowing through the
system make their separate entry
explicit when listener when the end or
structure in a group where you have all
the things that are common together the
first time tomorrow my TV project I put
all the things with similar over here
we'll have a link to the different over
here so we're lessness everywhere is
over here and pop my top i switched
around and it made things much cleaner
when one of my readers died I lost the
cross bottom server process and there
was all good things of restarting
exhibition their choice difference okay
cool so we need to trust nothing and we
need to verify all the data element of
water this is the only place in our
application we should do this now there
are three and out of this from tomorrow
on your be using dialyzer strikes or
equal to next three system commuter
ottoman so it'll be through this this
code we know with all types of things
that lives okay the hanging path the
code that the phils aunty workers and
Jeanne Jeanne things pretty
straightforward helper applications or
maybe
EMP is and supporting stuff that's just
help as it doesn't need to be doesn't it
depends on the state and so it doesn't
need to be for my TV application and
then we need to go through the gates of
lintern monitors from cross our
supervision tree to provide the Mission
Control to link up things that which
made a conscious choice not to group
together so if we got wet workers here
in ATP masters here from Italy from
across we've done the other way around
kenichi as peer worker they may we need
to lead into a supervision tree to
restart the web workers or listeners
there for other so we mainly here having
explicit out with certain trees and
invite spirits compared to other
programming language other contemporary
languages we simply haven't need to
rewrite literally giratina code and what
we have done or what to think we should
be doing this we've taken the steering
logic put up to a security true it would
kind of be cool if you could see that
gravity glee programming forgive
different men in which expires it's
worth drawing that out and making sure
it will make it so forth makes sense
under these predictive almost family so
this is a company example you might
redirect pictures the communities a
little room I top tips Parkinson's so
this is a library called its girth by
deeds in as a neat design pattern you're
stopping device
masking its entirety application to
manage and eats table in a reliable way
with recovery submit so the products of
this talk we're thinking about its table
as our ear occur but it could be any
portals it could be sockets or database
connection to web servers or poor
drivers anything like that that we want
to manage as a resource and at the same
time attach some sort of Q workflow to
the general idea is that the next tape
is created and they're working on that
process is delegated to a monitor which
is this is a happy it sports a
supervisor the one through our mornings
for one is our supervisor the first
thing it does it's on the tape manager
and the tech manager of men joining your
duster heads and chooses people working
and then it goes on is it it's for the
table worker the manager he creates a
table and the manager also monitors the
work the work that says here's the table
and our over here at work out we've got
a table and unfortunately work that
suffers some form of arcane need which
is quite common Elaine the manager
received any certification because we've
set up and water up here and the
management spawns replacement taken
where the manager then wanted the worker
and seemed to be speaking to the work
they're just like it did before here's a
table
same thing again the key thing here is i
do influence your slides that if the sub
raising this manager died which is
probably likely because of all it's
doing is spoiling a workout then waiting
20 megabytes or another one it's kev
allows us to receive your message back
to the supervisor which then here which
they received back that ownership that
it's table with the socket of an illness
one keyhole of and an increase our whole
process of you to the work and the
management of every insurance did work
on is completely separate here and
really there's a sort of heaven were
looking for an hour OTP library to be
this clear separation of control all the
way through it is worse than conceivable
that this main implication here for the
interaction time or that's doing your
retirement it has an inch table it's
starting a manager supervisor process
passing it through that's pretty
straight from this pretty reliable code
and then there is the system task where
we've got Q's directly with that worker
seniors go through and separate safe
that's a did that makes it bring that
last two months into a single picture
it's a great library or however you mean
you gotta have a look at it short sweet
that's really nice atletico to read so
we're going about five minutes thing or
something oh I want to do a little bit
about being mops all using open source
tools operational being hopefully isn't
dream to deploy its know depending no
dependencies and the self-contained
releases
really depicting however it's awkward to
get things like runtime sockets and
login Imperial usual places or system so
it's great that its dependency free but
it's a tu mix and I really wish you
totally team attacks that there are
third-party modules you can use to
plugins doing it but it's nothing like
being able to send a signal handler
directly intervene early release you
ever run time and have it really is
config files or what do you want to do
there's a beginner here going on in LA
and Nick slaughter a well-known but on
the very high mode they also exhibit
some some problems there's a syslog it's
very very fast which is great you'll see
you too nervous and I open the new unit
two sites for 19 19 and we can have the
best of both of its high-speed logging
with zero enough dependencies
distributive over forward for monitoring
to leave they're both in different white
box so white box is the code you write
as a developer it's the perpetrators all
year into the safest synonymy tances
thing completed within an hour each time
it took 2 seconds to process the step
that's quite box you need to note inside
of replication and you need to mind
knowing there for you talk about
business you also need to monitor it
from there foxes look from outside OS
which we talked about earlier at the
network and we can also look at things
like the amount of memory used by the
vehicle to certain floors how much has
been used by ports how much has been
used by Evans we should chat over time
and yet by no means it's and so forth so
it should be here is used by debugging I
want to see hands up if you're here okay
tomorrow after you've studied many types
I want you to go ahead we'll get one of
two tools either recon or dbg depending
on with your hair looks the ordinary
person there is nothing like if you are
using their lame or else your production
and you here not use recon for shame for
shame yeah spirit there's nothing like
it what being only here is the
programmers and developers to be right
stuff sure that it doesn't work Adam
rocking my own print statements we ship
it it doesn't work and because we've got
something protector
the program has changed and the problem
that we were too what's gone so we leave
the pretenders in there because yeah so
we go and what we really want to do is
we want to go to seek in real time how
these things are working so pictures
right this is lack of interest with the
usual sort of stuff there's a cover to
mention things here system logan every
little bit of that really cute basically
anytime we can with that lot of
unacknowledged messages we have a
problem would you do something that at
time is a box we ludicrously disk space
and at the top here because we really a
distributed system reaching in terms do
we have connectivity from no no no theme
and two ambition and museum going to
boutique scale here because we can fit
all the boxes and a single like the
extra mile
they're both hit the picture of the
other thousand systems you simply
couldn't do that this is really
expensive to do a fused hosting cloud
providers data dog relic in fact it was
so expensive it was born three times our
entire hosting costs some stop doing it
in the stools combination of collecting
for structure measurement ribbon for
live streaming netflix for the browsers
and these things update the real time
that the cost of laptop cpu they get
really hot I'll illness and then we ship
it out to graph y great white supposedly
a boutique scale we don't have problems
with report will dissipate speaking like
that when you see the SPD store seven
years with it at a 10cm resolution very
back that's great yeah if you're the
thousand service that won't be possible
so while I was making supplies are
worker bee starts that it'll be any
tricks nerio location run accuse the run
Hugh is a rigid equal to mentoring for
me in a single run time it was how many
tasks are outstanding to do it and when
we have multiple schedules for than a
single VM I'm not very intuitive that
means love three parties okay you're a
longer message giving I've personally
burdened by a system crashing because
the rate of logging eros increase so
light so much that you're gettin
celibate
I'll create different students memory
that's really painful it's really worth
monitoring that specifically so rather
than Q is a plus book of that piece of
the graph you can see down one degree
bears for us as total messages are
acknowledged that's basically my life
that's that's the backlog we've got a
problem and if you're looking inside of
you so ports processes over here eerie
longer and run you down here that's the
main thing and again you versus memory
usage we're expecting to see that pretty
constant over time the first time you
should the eventual interruption this is
really the key thing to watch the sort
of sort of basic the UK trips give
yourself a couple of minutes every day
just to keep an eye on and see if it's
not growing up and there you can pretty
much ignore it so how much do we need to
read this very serious so regarding
white debugging read the scenario
Stelter what's wrong get used to it it's
not that hard specifically gives the
function names and a hierarchy of what
that poor us the pieces you need to know
to
use recon recon trace to see what's
happening at one time you can
specifically vocal into your code and
save for this function and this module
and these parameters showing step tres
showings return code shown even call it
so it's difficult letter print
statements and recompile your car
everything you can just abstract a
single message from this particular IP
address that's causing a problem in real
time without being a pilot it's a dream
so there's a lot of stuff that only two
let's just go through the nice picture
in cool thanks for listening I have
there is useful definitely is over all
right so why is a larger
and my name come try to fix it transfers
