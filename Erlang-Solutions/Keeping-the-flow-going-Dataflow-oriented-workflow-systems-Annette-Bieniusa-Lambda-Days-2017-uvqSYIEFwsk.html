just assume by some rich and you end up
with a big pile of money and because
your software developer or researcher or
whoever you don't actually know what to
do with all this money right so what do
you do you take it go to your bank and
you know you will find a nice guy
pitting up behind the screen after you
so any ideas of how to invest the money
I have some I will help you in this in
the system setting up and cutting up the
financial plan and so on and you usually
have a lengthy talk they will guide you
through a whole process and in the end
you hopefully know what's happening
what's the problem so today's financial
advisory systems are pretty complex so
they keep track of a state of clients we
look into actual data what's happening
in Wall Street and etc they do give you
an individual advice so they will tell
you what fits your own profile however
due to some well to the disturbance of
the financial markets in 2008 and
following and governments have imposed
quite a few obligations on people doing
financial advisory so you have to for
example track when you when you when you
do this consultant talk you have to
track what you were talking about
there's a protocol being formed and
there's certain invariants and all of
this so for example if you're no vice
novus to to the to investing money and
several products are not supposed to be
provided to you if you're an expert you
can invest in whatever you want but if
you don't have a clue about something
the banker advisor it's not allowed to
and suggest certain solutions to you so
in order to make sure that all these
regulations holds we need some
infrastructure we need some system that
enforces these regulations and and that
also preferably can be and can be
checked in order and to provide
everything and also to automate parts of
this of the system so what we want to do
is actually for this workflow of
advising a person and we want to we want
to program a system it will depend will
consist of a number of independent tags
so how does it actually look like on the
other screen on the other side of the
screen so your advisor has some kind of
user interface or it is just German but
I think you you understand what's going
on there is always the kind of open
tasks that you're working on solving
together so you have a concrete agree
that that you fill in during your talk
and then you have like here on the side
a number of tasks that still open the
skills need to be performed and some of
them may not be performed before others
are performed and you usually have
something like here I suggested next
step so a lot of things can happen but
typically you want to happen one thing
next such that the and talk with your
advisor works smoothly so how do we
program your systems one approach of
doing this it's actually thinking about
you know designing the task what others
have meant putting them into a certain
order and kind of programming the
control flow of the talk so for example
you will you will start with with an
entry task where you make the account of
the person you will track the financial
situation and then depending on the
expertise of the people present a quick
for exams will be several people
presents or this this is a task that or
a meta task that keeps recurring you ask
for the master data so who's president
what their expertise is and then the
experience they already have and humor
the accumulator data for all the people
present you make a protocol and you're
finished works pretty well if you stick
to this protocol and the problem is and
if you talk to two people so I'm the
banker you know they don't like doing
this I've got a form here please give me
your name please give me how much money
you have please gives me how much real
estate you have and so on it was not a
very nice way of talking so that you
want to be a bit more flexible they
don't want to go through the stepwise
but when there is a chance for example
of already collecting data on the
experience of people you want to do this
when the chance occurs and like not when
it's time for it in the
in a protocol so instead of looking at
the control flow of of the task being
performed you could also and look at
what kind of data is accumulated into
something more data-driven so you have
for example there's the financial
situation in order to get financial
situation you don't need to have the
master data of prison person one person
2 and so on so these are kind of
independent but you need for example
this this data in order to perform the
protocol and you see there are a few
independent passes here through the
through the system in order to generate
a protocol you need to collect all of
this by the order in which you are
collected is actually not fixed and you
don't want to fix it the problem is if
you try to program the system by taking
this approach it can very quickly become
very complex you have very fine tuning
that data that you want to track their
and programs there and turn out to be
quite verbose and also static in the
sense that and you can program this out
for two people and people but what
happens if you have entered one people
present there so there's there are
certain types of restrictions here so
what did we envision we actually want to
have something that is dynamic we want
to generate the well justice task
workflow in a dynamic way and the tools
that we're going to apply here are taken
from higher-order reactive programming
as you will see in a met in a second and
we will actually try to define a dynamic
graph that models the this process of
consultancy so how do we go about this
we still start with the task so I have
here shortened version we want to ask
for the name we want to ask for the
status if the person present is a
private person or say representing a
company we want to to know the address
of the person and this does would be
like a very small part of the of the
system I've been showing you before we
want to perform the task in a certain
order which is not too restrictive so we
want to know
we can track for example the name of the
person but in order to track the address
we first need to know the status if it's
a private person we need to have a
private address if it's a person
representing a company we need to have
the company's address and maybe the
person's position in the company so
depending on what kind of output you get
here from the status asking task we will
have here different type of address
after task and so this code snippet i'm
showing here looks actually a bit high
schoolish it is haskell but don't worry
if you don't understand haskell what you
are seeing here I actually just
descriptions of the task so this every
box here Christian corresponds to one of
these functions in the functions your
for example attack it doesn't take any
input and produces a string the address
task is a task that takes the status so
the output giving here from the previous
task and also produces a string and the
overall thing here does not take any
input and gives you a tuple of strings
one for the name and one for the address
so in order to specify how this workflow
will you works how it goes we need now
to combine all these tasks in this
workflow sort of what will the consists
of us address our status as name and we
need to combine it in order to reflect
this kind of graph that we have here so
and we need to in order to do this we
kind of need to have a representation 22
different half and it turns out that
these four variants of tasks are quite
helpful to have one is here a pure task
that actually just takes a fraction and
generate the tasks or dysfunction
operates on some values and produces a
new value we have an impure task that
that's on the test take a value of type
a and it's impure so it gives you a
computation that youth a value of type
II just get another task but the
specifically the task that involves
human interaction and this is just
depending on what kind of answer
you get from your client for example
then we have a task that is actually one
of this Combinator's it takes to task
and performs them in serial such that
like the output of the first task can be
taken as input of the of the next task
and we have a Combinator for doing
things in parallel such like when you
when you see here we have this thing of
asking the name in parallel to asking
status and address so this is the
parallel task that we need in order to
combine two different articles are so if
you are familiar to Haskell in at least
a bit of depth and you might have
thought already or actually if you don't
use and you have invented and the
concept you might have have such
relative tips very well and the idea
that the functional concept of arrows
what is an error where an error is
nothing else than just the computation
which takes an input of Tybee and
delivers something of type C so an arrow
of type ABC take something of type B and
deliver something of type C and so this
a here is actually what we call task a
computation take something and deliver
something and task are a generalization
of monads of the magnetic contact and
but it helps in our specific case
because it allows us to have a
dependence on the input so if you I
don't want to go too deep into the into
the theory here but think about cases
like this as I said if you if you don't
have a lot of knowledge about financial
product and the task of proposing
something to you for that to you really
depends on what kind of input you have
in the tour yeah what kind of input you
you give to your consultant so whatever
you say you already know will determine
what kind of proposing task will be for
there oh also as we've seen with the
everything and depending on what kind of
status you say you have it depends what
kind of address you're going to be asked
going a little bit more into errors i'm
just really i'm showing you these the
essence of it and we want to have
computations pick something of type A
and yielding something of type being so
how can you how can you deal with errors
errors help you constructing
computations by first of all providing a
construct here called R which takes the
function and turns it into an error what
happens is so this is a this is a kind
of function and which gets at input a B
and use it out put a seat and you can
take F for example in the Indian in this
half that way that we've talked before
if you have for example some numbers as
input that are going to represent the
estate that you have then a pure
function like adding everything up would
be another task in that system and you
can represent it as a task by just
wrapping the function into an arrow we
have sequential composition usually
denoted with these three errors here
where you take one arrow another arrow
and you kind of construct the the arrow
here so just thinking if you have one
task and perform something in parallel
just gives you composed tasks or justice
outer box and we have first which
applies a task to to the first entry of
a capital leaving the second part of the
temple unmodified which gives you a
compositional task we have here the
parallel rhythm order the parallel
version where you take again at apple
and or wait where you have where you
have a tab and arrow it takes a B and
transforms it into a sea and we have
something that takes to be Prime and
temperance forms into a sea Prime and
then you can really just construct an
arrow that takes a couple of B &amp;amp; B Prime
and use the Chapel of cnc friends so
this is what you see in this in this
type here and we can also combine two
arrows and they take the same kind of
input so we kind of split be here
you provide to two instances of B and on
one instance we perform our first error
on the other we perform a second error
and we get a result a triple of CN c
prime so this combination of these two
tasks gives you or of two tabs would
give you a task it takes a beat and use
both the C and C Prime and what we now
actually want to do is take our task
definitions like the spear Imperial and
parallel task and see how does maps to
two arrows so this looks maybe a bit bit
abstract but what it actually just that
says is maybe look down here and we said
if you want to lift a normal function
what you do is we take this pure task
and you know it just takes the function
and transforms it into a task when you
want to do something and parallel well
we use our parallel I'm constructor here
that takes its to task and gives you the
task working on yeah both those entries
giving 22 results here we have here this
parallel composition it's clips or
lipids doubles the input and then
performed the first task on the first
input and a second house on the second
part of the input yielding the table
with the result and first and second can
be which also implemented again with
these tests that we found you before and
just before John ask later yes we did
our math and the error log error loss
fault so yeah so you can you can show
that everything that you're allowed to
do with errors and actually work with
this task implementation of ours and
what you then have is a language where
you can compose these workflows so what
we've seen here and you can really just
implement it and I'm going to show this
to you in a second a workflow that looks
like this and it's very it's very um yes
nice a very beautiful way actually of
representing workflows like this we then
have
functional run task it takes attack and
the first input and yield some
computation or some of them I owe an
instance that constructs here the yes
such that given given input a you get
your computation that used to be and you
can run it on and this actually does
everything that you want the
implementation of Randolph make sure
that we work on this task graph on this
work flow graph in the dynamic way that
we said before so we interpret actually
in run task this kind of grabs and make
sure that we only that we allow to work
on every task that has not been
performed before and that is enabled
because all the dependent tasks that are
supposed to happen before have actually
been addressed and the way we did is we
also allow react situation of path we
have implemented a first prototype
library called HTF in haskell for this
half-baked task-based workloads and i
should say that within the company they
actually implemented something pretty
similar but in Delphie so um yeah looks
looks a bit looks a bit different and
but the ideas are exactly the same and
we integrated it also into into
happstack so i can show you in a second
how does i wouldn't really work how does
really works maybe i should do this
right now so what you kind of see here
yes so what you kind of see here is a
little web page in the background in the
background runs the server that
implements the the tax system so we can
hear for example at first name is name
and i can also add here modify here eh
this program is a little bit different
from what i've shown you and it's
actually supposed to be in a way that if
you are older than 18 you're supposed to
add your own address here if you are
younger than 18 you can you will be
asked to add the name of your or the
address of your legal guardian so it's
just very similar to this
data system I've just shown you and this
is the whole implementation so building
and the specific instance of the
workflow that the server gives you and
as you can see it's really just one task
for asking for the name which does
something with forms and so on but it's
the task that works and gives you string
the ask task is a task that does not
take doesn't have prerequisites and
gives you an integer ask the dress
depends on the age to edit here and
gives you a string and it all composed
using the arrow Combinator's up here so
this year example test was kind of the
workflow the composition of all of these
ask name and this combined task of ask
age followed by ask address this gives
the executive graph that i was showing
and you can see it's very very neat
right here you see kind of directly what
the structure is I guess it's not too
much effort even to to make a nice
graphical layout and all of these tasks
you can define independently and as
usual with strongly typed languages like
Haskell that hides already gives you a
lot of information on how to combine all
of this together one last remark and
this is this is work that is still in
progress and we are looking into server
extensions of this and if anybody is
wants to help here or have some ideas
and we want to extend it in order to
allow also collaborative workloads
workflows in my other life I'm working
on consistency in databases so having a
nightly consistent database and a
background should also be possible to
allow workflows where people
collaboratively go through the through
the work flow graph and what the company
is more interested in having actually a
nice rapper where you have where you
have micro services that are mapped then
two different task and are combined in
the overall system so this is probably
where of all of this work is going thank
you very much
and we have time for questions did I
understand correctly that the a order of
the questions to be answered as defined
by the dependencies and those
dependencies are defined by the
developer during the development of the
application and they cannot be reordered
writer without recompiling and so the
order in which the but this is currently
an depends on the on the workflow
descriptions all the work flow graph
this is this is kind of fix you can work
your way so through this so this rug for
graph in a using red forest bread no
report so exactly yeah so here it really
does not depend on which order you
process it but you must have processed
the dependency before so poor Hugh Jack
studied something really cold
commutative arrows in which if you
exchange the order of your text but it
makes a difference that I wonder and if
the effects that you're considering I
mean things like filling in the field
perform those effects are clearly
commutative is that important for the
arrow laws to hold here um if I remember
it has been a while till we studied the
error loss and I think so yeah but I can
I can show you how to have it there I
have a term paper yeah so commutativity
of some of these things also to make
sure that that we have these dispute ask
in order to combine things this is
essential in some in some ways you said
that if the H is above 18 you have to
provide an an address right so what
happens if the user or the operator of
the system changes its mind his or her
mind that's the data disappear or or is
it still there if I first I enter age
which is below and then change my
change my thinking and enter 26 and
enter the address and then change it to
12 and then again to 26 will the data
disappearo will be addressed to be there
so the stuffs not really very much
depend on how the workshops are executed
this depends a bit on how the data is
handled in the background and I must say
I don't know exactly because this is
something that this is something that
the student of us implemented so it
seems that it kind of remembers it but
this really a very much depends on how
you do the how you do the server and how
you how you save the data correctly so
if there are tasks that were specified
in the workflow that are okay to run in
parallel and those do not require any
user input you can paralyze them yes
they are so the weight of run servers
implemented that execute them it takes
the pure task first and make sure that
the frontier of opencast does not
included given the proper hardware doors
are actually paralyzed yeah right thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
