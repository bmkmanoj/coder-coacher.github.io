his talk to this audience because for
one thing this talk was actually
originally written for web developers
looking at possibly learn programming
lang bike ready go I'm supposed to be a
likely fluff for evening meter for the
first time I'm goin inta cuz i'm going
to do whole thing to go mentor I'm a
person bidding for this at all it will
never get accepted I didn't shoot all
anyway so I thought customer nothing
computing but it nearly except possibly
a conference I can swallow have a lovely
time but accepted so now i can't go
straight up to talk about lost the style
of this is almost fundamentally wrong
side of that talk justice go and must
climb at you differently in hollywood
approach making software better quality
and with basically by accident going to
pretty much turn the whole girl i live
in florida also what we're going to
slice into memory and then learn to
automatic italy to it cuz they're
falling it doesn't actually have to be
coded data enclosures all kinds of it so
I expect so learn what I go and i'm
going to try and actually show you the
result of the code running and when you
see the first of the cobra with us have
50 ladies and have what is it easy but
you should prove it so what is not the
most basic kind of loop that everybody
is aware of the conditional dupe every
imperative programming language has this
even a similar effectively has a so this
is a valid go global site it is only
nine tom so I'm glad you're keeping a
log and my person who's going to be
black and white by fought with great we
should be looking at it like this so
what we've got here is we've got a
program accessibility this way to as in
slice numbers and ask result comes out
I'm true to that poker actually does
this because I somebody five minutes
extra love talking tom you see to it as
opposed to probably break everything is
now going on so come over here that's
the actress /
ok papo nervous since at some numbers
every single coming up my show you
basically the same output a couple of
them will tell you have melted into but
basically this please turbo in 101 go to
character learning my heart now you can
learn your tight and you half now you
can expert for years ago that I have
further reading it but promoting tired
advocate half an hour protection and
task achievement so firstly we've got
going to practice to break things up
this is part of Harriet's compliation
speed basically want some packages
compiled Annapolis compiled you want to
compile another package the first
package you know I've a senior tailback
so the command line if I become a photo
with dozens of practice involved and can
still actually learn my old material
consisting essentially libelous early
programming I start I moved over
this means the first amazing cure feet
assistance language like a coding as
fast we tested this is how you import an
existing package so this case for
macbook if you understand is seen Skye
format now that soldier that's jumped me
or neither but the printf statement and
print a statement at something wrong and
that's because you can afford to package
into your local name space and then
don't have to keep saying you're using
the patch we're going to use it very
hair week a little hairy Pacific so we
does function may I like to see you
can't return a value for me so this
isn't language that if you want to
explicitly Center value back to Michelle
you have to actually do a nice cool to
do it main does have known values this
makes a surprising different approach to
writing grant myself I don't think
you're being domestic duties this is an
assignment and at the same time as hard
declaration go past time difference the
pilot will feel a lot of times the same
cell based on what your sign the first
time to do it to use this syntax or you
could use the bully noblesse declare our
type since has to get from you
I'm very very rarely do that there's the
sort particular thing to medicinal tea
sir I need about a bear coat this is a
slice that's not like I needed there is
no way but things are different time and
go two slices away some time to actually
forces the size doing so if I wasn't
under the desert away five items that
you can never spam your contract this is
a slice it consists of that way and
information about capacity and how long
we actually thought action and swap
those ways Madison needs to to make sure
you always look so lastly i have never
accessing them you're using the way in
life going project this kind of Destiny
way better that's it hey look it's just
boiling go has only one consequence if I
was a pleasant a slice of 30-point guy
is those would be 13 points compartir it
doesn't affect you too happy retire
something
I here we have a standing classic see
style food it's a t.c 99 sabra sleep is
for a very declaration going on there
but half a map with room very very
old-fashioned Toto we're setting on
counter only exists in scopus for loop
we do any tests we have a built-in
function without I got the length of
slice and then we're losing influence
operator I like to see this is not right
away this is a statement you can see
infra increments and trading post and
detriment of wasting time of average
honda too many things which is the
nightmare for maintenance single best
place offers are some code we can't take
that value have vascular members
identified so stupidly change they met
bubster assessment see her disappear the
pretenders vintage we go
available 13 general place values can go
now have printers so you something and
if you so the sympathy is too much you
scream ice melts into kc unless you do
exactly one may floor and has such a
book standard / short while why
complicated cuz i decided what are you
fighting is first there to compete with
you talking to enter one who is you
she'd ended when you can't afford an
item to insist we existed which involves
quite a lot of bounds checking and stuff
like that there's always going to be
done with my little girl the other
option is you can just keep these rating
this with go burn 20s up solely you know
loneliness class Alex so this program
does that I was a good read introducing
a whole part of stuff to do patent which
are not inception but could be used like
exceptions if you want so we're gonna
move down so I it he's doing okay we've
got the third faction that is the third
functions of an on the obviously ordered
your room instead right so it basically
is your mouth will snap busy for a
function of an XP recovered it happens
to say did you hanok are my about to
turn name is a sad that dress I will
prove that actually stops it for
eternity foot and this asymptote
evaluation
you check this is neil if it's now
continuing if not I'll what Alex has
particular ecology center this is not
start a family get utility in the other
functions is there closures so it's not
actually taking a function pistol it's
taking a pleasure this is quite
important because he means that you
c'mon team to the state of function in
which the function scope without having
to passing parameters into it gets you
some how to change return values and
small trees so here you go operator you
notice momentum is different we have put
any test in the middle so genuinely
because we knew from our perspective
range after we got them to don't race
works I'm a poor showing occur are just
learning certainly and exactly what the
last one did say half of this working
out cooking is about both you notice how
much bow any other animal so most of the
stuff potential is actually not good go
start because I don't have to do it with
our style I can do interesting past hour
or I can't ability to the language that
are popular so let's move ox you're
going to see something
no I go past on ability concept of
iterated William rate is handled so
we've got a claims there at the website
and we just might have the item measure
this high school app i went to the slice
like it if I sliced the map I get key in
fabric using long-term mystic order so
this program is actually just doing that
it's just running mr. areas where r to
better take this tool though doesn't
fall functions so our functional
interlude probably this is not a
confident to say that because this isn't
about functional program in europe in a
hardcore haskell set but to most people
who i'm only have to try and explain go
to the idea of using functions as
first-class fighting is considered
challenging i'm a question of why
because I'm they're just another carbon
black box like it so Hugo we're going to
have the same slice and this time we're
going to ask a function to printer so
functions intact encoder is pretty much
like we expect most languages you define
a function with a name and parties and
parameters we put our declarations the
opposite way around that they are in C
and that's deliver because apparently
quite a single biggest mistakes that
serve the goatee think who's made
particularly care Thompson thinks was
makin see was putting those bits of
information
he thinks its focus focus people's minds
actually the wrong end what they're doin
it like a week declaration massively
after I start to do a go go go but now I
could see code matteson to myself that's
kind of active from compared to this
Turtles more map from the same way that
the changing masked scrolling direction
in line my children commentator 2 it's
awesome possible go back you know excuse
me they're so thin slices slices this is
very boring in traditional imperative
code and we're going to deal with other
the operation to change we got there yet
for artistic oh so instead of going to
the molarity of doing that I can state
just define that I've got this nice very
gladly accept parameters I can pass on
some ideal constituent this is where
typhoon difference makes all kinds of
horrible boy object disappear which
leads onto the concept of time I've
heard some very slim said by people
another language meters about ghost type
system because we don't have asked old
lady we're never going to have
parametric types and I'm quite frankly
it's not slow on good software as I've
talked we take a very different view of
how to play we tighten it for this
entire system we're going to see
explain this curve i should say it's
best if we put time in go a sort of the
representation is hard and routes go to
our time it's two little boxes that
consists of a time tag and a valuable
commodity and in going just as visiting
player because quite a lot to do care of
things where was obviously most language
people don't we think about the
representation of their time at my title
it to the runtime tool we take the party
that's what now stuff for us move
rudeness own prints nice function here
but which is taking an empty generic
thing this is called the bank interface
basically we could the thing that go has
that allows us to do generalized program
because but in statically compiled is it
has interfaces which are basically
message set of methods images and this
here is will try to anything that has at
least no message and that's an important
thing in the language because we have
said built in primitive types are
innocent loads that don't have methods
to talk and then we can create user
defined tighten those that do have
methods so in a sense the blanket
ofertas have unified as you type systems
but you've uses at Isis unfortunately to
do anything useful with that we have to
unbox it so we have to marry to do what
a lot of Java Runtime to do with with
object in silent and so this is the type
of search and if that type of session
files is programmable had control over
we don't have to use just that kind of
type assertion I'm in fact you go around
just allows us to be a bit clever and
back off if a type of search
I have going from kind of type surgeon
so physically that this is the meat of
this fishing program you go pay a little
over here performance-wise so like a
couple nanoseconds here a couple United
seconds there but at the same time you
provide much more generalized solutions
we can see without the largest employer
meters which is pretty much as he does
getting my programming is very limited
so here we've got this oops paper and if
you type certain in this segment we get
back both a valid value if the assertion
works or we get back annual value
boolean value that says it didn't work
and so we can have profiles based on
whether or not we've got a certain type
of a certain place I toes ever the most
currently writing Google applications
it's never been more than about two or
three types to you you're trying to get
to go to the summer sort of course i
know now we know that this is a slice of
integers we go off we can rent a little
intimate discussion it's better for the
more general coming to be nice to do
whole part of if then if then if then
type assertions would be very dull code
I don't be very verbose and one of the
goals of go is to basically a systems
lab which there has I'd like to say the
elements of Ruby but really nice to have
the terseness entitle the pricing
community of Google as well aware will
be guild forums for a reason why go made
some of the design decisions he did
mostly it is brought pipe and can't
answer and bought rittemeyer or felt the
amount
scary and they thought that a group a
lot of the forms will be exalted
fighting from salt in a statically
compiled language much better and also
it go is a trivial for deployment
because it only produces statically
compiled static about buying which we
have no dependency search for those who
are old remember sneakernet you stick it
on your flock that you go to a building
in school well that's what you get so
it's a surprisingly nice trait so having
a language so here we've got this type
screech tape is going to be working at
me off into most value and this
particular syntactic sugar will just say
okay in here every case is going to tell
me about type not about anything actual
content to leave these with statements
didn't say something like this is nil or
x equals 37 missing particular context
it Cydonia out by an inside here your
lightest on using the same very way this
is Incred or you wouldn't notice
something else here by using a full- a
variable as a review program for many
years I got into the habit of using very
long description fairy pets because you
moved programs you can go very very nuts
trying to figure out what's going on
you'll be fine it's a variant but people
still do it but it is it's big heart up
to it even though it's very very rare
you have a functional messed up that's
more than about five to 10 lines of code
and nearly always the very was just a so
obvious it's hard to find names for so a
large amount of the gopro 30 out there
you to vomit
over the place for which we get
criticized but a lot of people to come
to the community and shows a better way
of doing it when everything is staring
you in the face with it there's nothing
else to write so in this case when we
get out here from inside this case
statement we know that s is not to be
sliced elitism and this exalt you mind
over it by the good morning that's
before I think
anything we get say so you chaps housing
information for everything else I've a
little black box nobody cares what time
it is but it's still able to render in
this last obviously you can talk about
isolation that it's not like what he
thought about Hoshi's it will save quite
a lot of functional in the sense of
naive Lisp programming goes on the go to
beauty because we have closures first
class values we can pass them around do
all kinds of funky stuff in our place a
bit and I obviously I for many years I
was an embedded c program for my sins
and if i had closures back there a lot
of code that i worked on many it's very
good you wouldn't add a lot more
maintainable because we've been
everything that we must clear out of you
very different patterns in the curls
writing and it's one of the things it's
also good a disappointment usually not
language you go back to see loose
clothes your son lean then you have to
go back to thinking like it's 1985
warehouse or forward which remaining
spaghetti airline magazine based program
committee life so not a good place to be
now here we're just we're going to prove
based on as i said every one of these
programs does a very boring journey to
sample a pre try to get 99 examples with
because both are not this one I think
it's myself I can't bear to be 280
anymore but young people that's nice
we've got our function here and then
there's always the inside that we're
going to reference back to the sliced is
there we're down here we're going to get
we're not going but they certainly have
to give it a particular type of function
where you're going to use the type of
surgeon said you've got a function if
you've just given me oh it's the right
kind of function I can do something
useful there which means we can have
multiple ways in printing out different
things slices maps different kinds of
writing about water protest in different
ways it's all it all gets thrown over on
the type system and how you want your
types to work rather than forcing you to
a particular way it does me so again
this is trivial stuff we've got a
function we can call it based on the
slices up there most people looking at
go on blue team ago because they're
interesting concurrency in fact when I
first laughs because I was interested in
concurrency having specialties as a good
programmer and doing more for assistance
that we're pretty much to talk about
conferences I got kind of sick of the
fact that you was pushing against as
well we stuck effectively one for the
execution a lot of things are quite
difficult to express that we might
naturally want to or feel forced to take
care for you and less wanted to use fork
there to staff community so
this a lot of waiting forward in trying
to do those so the first class token can
support me in Ruby so when I first met
goes like all comparison to the really
cheap CSP is so get easy to think about
that anybody's ever seen sort of like a
transmuter surface with all the chips on
it you can instantly reason mouth after
you've got a lattice a chip very very
easy sewing your head to quite easy to
build a lattice of things connected your
challenge it's quite a mighty do not
always the best idiom however is doing
compared to your tea but it's a nice
easy infernal floor apartment and go
with has channels and housing policy so
this are fortunate in styling a little
bit more challenging program because if
we're going to basically have two
separate threads of execution which
allowed to treat out the numbers from
smarty it's also a lot of things that
freaks a lot of people from languages
like the line and the most so first
thing you have to create challenge and
the type of channel is the type that's
passed along it we can make the
asynchronous bike in the buffer space
which is a part of their time or we can
keep the secrecy which means they'll
block from one until one item to pass
through obviously mostly all programs
really don't need to have constantly
brought in all those professor I know
we've got go routines I go between to
basically scheduled code routines so
this is scheduled on to the word every
time you spawn off and go BTW it gets
passed on to the sketchier and sketchier
says ok off you in the active so because
it's a whole set of perspective of our
time you will stay on the active to it
until such time
rotten course unpacked locking pools
didn't get charged went to the word
spread so there's never anything that
blocks the main thread of fate of
execution at all a couple of days ago go
didn't officially have pre-emptive
scheduling it had property schedule I
can say from having been things that
were running hundreds of thousands of
Cobras you at the same time I never
really noticed different but plan my
wedding like this actually built on top
of he's incredibly good look for
operative scheduling but these days
every time the function call is made
because some people found her great ways
of putting huge workload it starts with
every time crunch ball is made now a
preemption is done so it'll be
interesting to see how that works out
because that may actually turn out to be
too many wait for the pattern of motion
most of you / Reuters of go in which
case then somebody's gonna have to do
something more clever but anyway the
thing we should notice here and this is
that the thing I normally get pumped at
night and I talked about by people who
think that this is really not safe
because it sort of it is the yin yang
goatees take coaches so using a
concurrency mechanism that's actually
implicitly with thinking when we build
things well we might want to use half an
ounce within Kart 8 but at the same time
they could all be a hundred thousand
cars can't stay standing off of the same
core closure state which is sort of you
think this ago p on safe is going scary
but this general motors humming bird we
don't use lower state but we can do it
systems lions or sometimes
should be set in certain parts of Africa
but what we generally don't use local
state so if actually practice doesn't it
I've not got any friends in the
community who've had this Bible yet
we've been writing a lot and kind of
code for four years four kinds of things
down a little bit too late 100,000 lines
and go that's hard to stay off in some
part of their build infrastructure so
it's massively can come but no one's
held on didn't buy this yet it could be
of course--we're a lot of too early
adopter so therefore perhaps be more
cautious how we use it anyway might be
true Sally got flooded by four PI over
if we have a whore's life event where we
suddenly had a new program is coming
into the industry who instantly using
her a go base to phone work then perhaps
we see an offer of spectacle only time
turn that we can happen so anyway don't
get over here what we actually do is
going to do is we're gonna pump a
channel with the values in the slice so
you're just using the fall break and
this weekend I've got a channel I have
declared directionality of chunks so
technically channels bidirectional most
of them the directionality is part of
the top so most of the time you'll see
that people actually tend to go for one
direction while are doing all right out
so and then we're going to close the
time and when we finish money exeter go
to and down here or if now we're passing
a channel because we need to be able to
use that to lead from the channel we get
again out all we have to do is range
over the channel and the range is
walking blocking until the channel
closed so you just might ease and sits
at some point I'm going to just meet
things often door it's best just like
you to pipe I mean it's basically just
like very light very much the
interesting thing here is probably the
fact that I've now introduced
value because obviously nice to know
when printing a channel habitants were
printed and we we have multiple it up so
you can have more my values which flight
it's got a bracket syntax you don't have
to use that I mean I can't do anything
so there we are concurrent piece of code
runs off does it prints out the number
of elements which is five now go move
mr. tells you that i'm more more often
we talk about consistently ranked i
actually find much heart and I get told
a poem go community I get told off what
I want to go to youtube satisfied go as
a donor program I will officially a
statically compiled statically typed
programming language but in practice
every program is running on imaging the
world is absent statically typed it's
worth 450 set to start title assist on
the phone there's a static boundary it's
just some languages insist on me static
fascists about this we're making sure
that everywhere you know what the type
is other languages like Ruby I happy to
let that be something that either does
or doesn't work in though we have a
bounded set of time to no actual one
time but we can my code that is just as
dynamic to think about as a movie or
only fastest my party trick I'm not sure
how to do free genetic map get MapReduce
in 39 to go and it strictly easy to do
from absent slices using pretty much the
supper when years here now first of all
because a solution to how we might want
to do or both situation over
and iteration using the function so
we're going to do different ways between
how we helped a piece of code that
effectively batch numbers are so we yet
again we're going to be using the empty
interface because we want to decide
myself a time playing with and there's
our code for doing slices in there for
function ok this is this is nothing here
I haven't written and this is basically
very boring I care about our territory
we have tied to Fletcher we have a very
nice time for flexion laundry that's the
Ice Man 3 is using it is just so much
planted flowers to show people tricks
about what you can actually do we
tightened up and also I spent an awful
lot of time trying to like the perfect
Ruby style in US which I failed at
numerous fight so first off we need this
beautiful reflection package and I've
actually awesome I would do this
instruction code but I thought versatile
be posted to the next place I don't have
a reflector place because just remain
closed life decided swim and we are
actually mostly interested today in
functions and slices and pulling our
trig functions and doing things with
ultra slices are playing their families
so we're going to start up by passing
the function right
they're passing a function and now we've
still got a switch but we're not using a
type switch here this is a normal kind
of switch lot of times there's no type
of searching sale tool what having dead
said to innocence reflection system
could you please give me back a man time
value that describes the ugly this used
to be quite expensive but now all this
stuff flies around all the time it's
very very cheap at least an order
magnitude quicker that was for the first
two years of language and over here
we're going to find out what the kind of
the things so in movie we do we care
what missing in go we care what kind of
things are things which is kind axis but
as way to think so if it's functioning
we would like to call it and when we
call it we'd like to get an answer
obviously to call it we need to pass it
some parameters and functions like to
take a slice of parameters you might
have more than more fragile but they've
got to take their parameters as
reflection values so we've got a little
bit of extra boilerplate to set up our
our slice and reflection values and then
we're going to have a slice of return
values from the function the domain is
we can reason about all this trivial
easy on mattifies i will use like to two
weeks into being program and i can show
them how to do this make up a network
tons of code and most of it will
probably work which is between nice
compared to the tricks in some languages
do to generalize types because we want
to pass that value back to another
program at Southwick important photo and
we don't want to pass back what we get
from you because what we actually get
from here is a whole slice of these
reflection values we don't want to look
the rest of the program with you need to
use reflection really we just want you
add something it can be treated or
time so we boxing our capital as an
integrase icon back out and in with
slices well we know certain properties
about slices they have next we know that
we can look at the links because of that
we know their index so we can index that
yet again we can box up the value so
wherever you see reflection coat and go
sort of a short burst of it and
everything will be boxed up and then
check back with a man getting awful
others to say what a jar on top is doing
for efficiency and we get to play it and
think about it different only way to be
able to do it I can find out to prove
actually works and i think this six
there's only one more to do but nice
light so that one was boom it's doing it
to two different ways from before too
long to slice and it's doing me
fundamentally genetically so any kind of
functionality i despise anyone do the
same it i think that's actually
incredibly cool even though it's
actually simple it's not true at all to
most people but i just fine and credit
approval never do it it just makes me
feel happy user-defined type the other
thing about go is the object oriented
early with them we're actually type or
guilty we like to put message all types
we like to know first things based upon
the type see where the method signatures
of times that's how so this will bring
duct
and it said timely and we sort of very
seem like we care about is Earl Weaver
memory structure but my nemesis aren't
doing so so here I'm going to
demonstrate how to make it something a
generic piece of code or work with any
type that happens to have a interface
you never say that type in commencement
affects what you do is just implement
interface on time by giving it
appropriate method so firstly interpose
definitions look an awful lot like type
definitions because they are except they
can only contain interfaces or methods
for two things going so in this case
we're going to have any method and then
we're gonna happen right over history
will slice now any primitive type any
existing type can be typed again you can
have a lot of time based on it you don't
get any message from the title you doing
this for you gain nothing in common with
it except you gave no memory layout and
that can t be quite useful sir perceval
trips but we're not going to go there
today so with this little slice I know
that if I if I you men this each and I
can take a function and we'll take em
boxed up thing that I'm going to apply
with each other so i can write map out
in terms of each report and not in terms
of anything else and down here i might
do in such a way to slice do some stuff
with it for what function do some
situation what I haven't actually shown
because it's occurred to me that was
another set this morning at home
thinking this is
and of course this light misting isn't
one in which this in the bottom is
entitled to her to be to Alaska in times
of israel but be honest the only thing
that changes is i declare a variable
down package will that's it into one
lime difference in to codex s4 code so
you actually know we've got that is it
that is the go programming language we
don't have to know anything about memory
layout or anything like that you don't
even have to carry to garba to inciting
dimension garbage collection we haven't
cared about whether it be allocating the
elevator is the opportunity spending the
articulation is pretty efficient I've
got a library from Joseph E which is a
micro benchmarking library for go and
I've never had the garbage collection
fall over for him sometimes anticipated
really slow sort of generator 200,000
slices time middle of America but the
garbage collection doesn't pull over the
dough routines are very lightweight they
put a 48 k stack depends of your 32 or
64-bit architecture under older laws of
go before him 11 I co 2 1 912 thousands
of me to get of rare that was the memory
exhaustion area for the program now it's
at least 300 maybe they also given way
but to be honest it's a pathological use
case to be trying to run 900,000
concurrent things on the network i did i
till my death for two years on that at
some 270 so it goes are so fast you can
def emilio hardware and actually feels
incredibly fast to work it's still
because it's compilation model i will
certainly
not a static market the best place to
find ourselves on twitter though off
alaura's you came round after 19 hashtag
the downside will go alone hashtag is it
means happening the Philippines and now
let's go figure out what but a lot of
the photos that pop up about people
having a very good time not too lewd but
very sunny place isn't going to be smart
so it's sort of a nice nice photo
sometimes you can just be kicking to you
get totally different perception or go
to me how you want me to sleep to find
out more obviously go around at all and
that's it that's the whole of go to
avoid okay ah ee do their function they
often braces in their hands empty
parentheses there is there anything
cycle yeah you can't hospitality so
those functions could take the Mounties
well that's because we were actually
cooling as much and then Thurman
recording it from the firm range called
so we can passing parameters if those
previously our local station crunching
they might change but if they come if
they're useful because we do have your
beautiful date I disturbed warfare
because it just might really method on
cartoons point is why I'm actually doing
it on values and if you put methods on
values Devon beautiful they don't change
that line value only in the context of
the front so yes those are actually
function court we have one more place to
go charging for workplaces if they had
had a slider said user-defined types I
can actually show you how to find lists
because very quick but it's something
I'm actually I've been working on
recently I mean we do have those data
types anyway looking in the standard
library but sometimes it's nice to do
something a bit different
I ask you most of my coding in landover
to be honest I find visual tools quite
difficult to work with but if you up
here I mean this is fairly very standard
sort of oops expecting attitude like
this is a very very standard bit of sea
we just happen to have her type of
activations the other way around and
then I'm excused to define type at that
point in the center at I can see where
it comes more interesting for season but
because women go we can now put medicine
on that time and this method is not a
pointed to it so this motorcycle
around with the links in this but it's
that as I say if that was actually
unparalleled my pointer to it I could do
all kinds of stuff to it in youtube
which the outside would any other
pitchers don't worry brilliant is that's
normally the matter how exciting we much
for sitting through it obviously it's
been a very busy two days but everybody
and this is one of those conferences I
know how much my converse so thank you
