where's the earth Bonjour
buongiorno so uh I don't know how to say
good morning in the den a language my
first story comes from northern Canada
where this is a native language and
these are called barren ground cat
caribou and they migrate across the
tundra in the summertime these herds
once numbered in the hundreds of
thousands and have declined dramatically
in many cases by 90% in the boreal
forest caribou remain year-round and the
den a people have lived and hunted the
caribou for thousands of years they have
a word for this specific kind of caribou
which they describe as darker colored
larger and heavier and much more
skittish of people they have a different
word for the barren ground caribou which
describes the caribou that migrate in
this way all caribou are actually the
same species in Europe they call them
reindeer so these can all the caribou in
the world can mate with each other and
interbreed but they have specific
behaviors they look different and
they've adapted to specific habitats the
IUCN Red List notes that the subspecies
designation for caribou is based on an
outdated taxonomy scientists catalogued
these subspecies with very few samplings
more recently they would swoop down in
helicopters and put a tag on a reindeer
and later
figure out where that reindeer or
caribou went and this is turned into
situations where you can see on the
slide that you know on the left side we
have differ
let names for different kinds of caribou
and on the right side we just have the
general term for different kinds of
caribou and this is really problematic
because in conform eight conservation
they need to have what they call
conservation units or evolutionary
significant units it doesn't help us to
preserve some habitat for some caribou
that doesn't actually live there well it
turns out that the den a people have
words for the different type of caribou
that they have been hunting and relying
upon for millennia and scientists are
now collaborating with indigenous people
to learn from them about their knowledge
of the local ecosystem which is embedded
in their language and their oral
traditions there's a den a concept
called
she got let me see if I can get this
right Chicago's Annette Day which is
means learning together and they use
this word to describe how the elders are
collaborating with scientists on
conservation that will help the caribou
thrive again and part of that is also
including the youth because it's
important to have the youth learn the
knowledge from both the elders and the
scientists so they can bring it to
future generations so Jean Poulos is a
scientist to study the caribou in
collaboration with the den a people and
she actually tracked genetic differences
and proved that these words actually
described caribou that were
significantly different from their
genetic types and particularly
interesting is they had found a genetic
difference that they couldn't explain
and they didn't have they didn't really
understand where it came from and from
one of the stories from the elders
they tracked how this particular group
of caribou had migrated to a different
location and become isolated from a
genetic perspective in researching the
caribou last weekend I found this cave
painting from 30,000 years ago I studied
art in college along with computer
science and I always thought that cave
paintings were like art you know sit
around the campfire and look at
paintings um
but upon reflection perhaps these were
used as teaching techniques and and I
found an interesting contrast to pull
faces research where she documented how
the elders taught the children about the
different types of caribou and then the
children used art to really internalize
these differences which can help them
learn traditional hunting techniques I
really believe that language is the way
that the past communicates to the future
we use these words like I feel that
English you know and a couple of other
languages are kind of mine they're my
words they express my thoughts but
they're handed down from prior
generations they give me these words and
some words fall out of favor and we stop
using them and sometimes we invent new
words and those new words and a new way
of saying things is a kind of wisdom
that we we pass on to the future and I
think this is interesting when for human
spoken language but it's particularly
important when applied to programming
languages so I'll give you a little
brief tour based on my vocabulary of
programming languages when I was a
teenager I learned basic in Pascal which
are generally categorized as procedural
languages so as you all know these
procedures are sequences of actions
we're computer programmers to instruct
the computer about you know what it
should do
for most of my career I have done
object-oriented programming I first
learned it in college with C++ and my
first commercial software was written in
C but we use these patterns to associate
functions with data to organize our code
and have simpler architectures and for
years I wrote graphic software for
desktop applications and then for web
browser plugins and then the early part
at the early part of this century I
moved to JavaScript where I worked on an
arbitrated framework for doing graphical
user interfaces on the web and we had a
vocabulary of views and layouts and
words to describe animation to build up
what we call the cinematic user
experience I later learned objective-c
and Ruby which had a different heritage
of object-oriented programming from
small talk where instead objects
received messages but they retain this
core property of keeping your data
grouped with your code a few years ago
as my work moved more to the server side
we came more and more interested in
functional programming I feel like this
is some language I'm not yet fluent in
I've read about it and experimented it a
bit but I can't yet think in this
language and they continue to be
intrigued about what new powers would I
have if I was really native in it and so
in preparing for this talk I had the
opportunity to spend some time talking
to Dave Thomas who wrote one of the
first Erlang books and I asked him to
define in his words the difference
between functional programming and
object-oriented programming and he had
this nice clear description that
functional programming focuses on
transformation of state whereas
object-oriented programming focuses on
encapsulation of State and it was
interesting because I reflected to him
that well I think that that graphical
user interfaces are perfect fit for
object-oriented program
Don Norman talks about paper being an
extension of our intellect because it
like we can it sort of extends our
memory space right we can have paper in
front of us and keep other things in our
brain and I've always thought about
graphical user interfaces that way it
kind of refits the state right there
reflects back to us what we've done and
what our new opportunities are and it
expands this shared memory with our
brains like what is what like what could
be a more natural fit to object-oriented
programming and Dave said well
functional programming is a much better
fit actually the if you think about how
graphical user interfaces are
constructed there's the event based
programming and every event triggers a
transformation of State and I wanted to
argue with him because it's sort of
related to this this Caribou story
because I'd read that I showed you about
the three types of caribou but the
Denney language has a fourth word for
caribou that scientists haven't found
any evidence of in the genetic material
and this article said that the Denney
people believed that there was a fourth
type of caribou now I'd probably
characterize that as a fact if there
were tens of thousands of years or
millennia that people were hunting a
specific type of caribou like maybe that
caribou is extinct now but that's
probably not a mythical belief but I
found myself reflecting an
object-oriented programming and thinking
that's an interesting belief dave has
I've been doing object-oriented
programming for 25 years and I think I
know better so why I tell this story is
there's this reality we all share and we
interpret that reality through our
perceptions that our beliefs and it's
very easy
to think that our beliefs are facts and
it's very easy to think that somebody
else's facts our beliefs so in thinking
about this conference and this community
I've been thinking about what's this
land where Erlang is the indigenous
language and what does it mean to have
an elixir tribe descending upon this
land or maybe emerging from it
programming in a new language transforms
our default path it influences the kind
of solutions we create it's like living
in a place with a different value of G
this different gravity makes some things
much easier and other things much harder
you love it when language creators
describe their worldview independent
from the language and I really valued
reading the Erlang worldview is
described by Joe Armstrong and it
shifted my thinking about putting it in
this category of functional languages -
putting in this category of something
entirely different and that was
underscored by something I read by
Joseph Allen where he said in an
interview that he has a very personal
definition of functional programming
that it's about making the complex part
of your system explicit as an example he
talks about mutable state as data that
changes over time and that time is a
source of complexity because it adds a
bunch of moving parts to our system and
we end up having different pieces of
data changing at different rates
so therefore we don't want mutable state
to be a primitive but instead an
abstraction that we use when we need it
making ourselves conscious of it so that
we can reason about that complexity in a
different way and the most interesting
part he says is that functional
programming is associated with
concurrency but not by design it just
happens that by making the complex part
of our system explicit solving more
complex issues like concurrency actually
become much simpler so these languages
allow us to express some things very
simply and other things require a bit
more work to express and it reminded me
of Benjamin Whorf studies of the hopi
language which is a Native American
language which is inaccurately described
in popular media as or the Hopi people
are described as having no concept of
time because their language has a very
different way of describing time in
their verb tenses but that's like saying
that functional programmers have no
concept of state because you don't have
it as a primitive but what's interesting
I think about this is that the they have
three verb tenses or three that Benjamin
Whorf describes they have the same tense
that they use for past and present that
there are certain things that are
happening right now or you just
witnessed happening that our fact that
are part of our reality because they
have happened they are part of our
reality because they are happening they
are part of our reality whereas the
future tense I will run it uses the same
tense that we use the subjective I might
run I if I'm going to run if I were to
run because really the future is
completely uncertain and who knows
what's going to happen anyhow and then
they have another tense which is like I
run on the track team where that's
really a property
of the noun you know that that I'm not
really actively doing that it just
describes how I relate to the track team
and so I don't know if anybody's
actually done for their study on this
but Worf believed that people who were
Native and Hopi would have an easier
time understanding Einstein's theories
of relativity than those of us who think
about time flowing and discrete discrete
units like traveling a distance so it
thinks different words different ways we
construct language let us reason
differently about the world so in
preparation for this talk I was
searching for a word which there's
there's many many languages in fact I
think is probably every language where
there's a word in another language which
takes many many words to describe in a
different language but nonetheless these
human experiences are still reality so I
looked up on there's a fabulous book
called the book of human emotion by
Tiffany watt Smith the catalogs a lot of
different human emotions mostly in
English guys soon that's her native
tongue but also in different languages
where we don't have words in English and
one of those that I thought was suitable
for this talk is I'm probably going to
miss Brown this man mana rocks so it is
a word for a desire or a wish and so
this Hindu phrase is used in school to
motivate school children and and
directly translated it means to date
nobody's ardent wish has been fulfilled
without effort so ardent wish is it
doesn't really mean a lot in English it
could mean I have an ardent wish for a
Porsche or for chocolate ice cream but
that would not be a good use of the term
in Hindi in instead it means like the
best word that I could come up with that
reading a few descriptions of it was a
calling and I consulted with a Sanskrit
scholar who my brother introduced me to
who and it turns out was a programmer
for 33 years before she became a
Sanskrit scholar and she said it's it
speaks to why you are put here on this
earth that as humans we're all searching
for that thing why are we here and my
friend Vidya said that calling is a it's
a fair way to describe it but it doesn't
capture the yearning for that thing once
you realize youth you might have found
it and it seemed appropriate to me today
because I I think to myself why am I
here like in this room with all you
people who know so much more about this
this land than I do I'll talk a little
bit more about this later but the the
key thing that I'm trying to describe is
about how languages capture patterns of
thought and the this ability of language
to express patterns seems so much more
true of programming languages so I had
an opportunity to hang out with Jim
Larson who works on a neighboring team
at Google and learned a little bit more
about Erlang in the last couple of weeks
and he wrote an ACM paper which has this
snippet of Erlang and
one of the things that he said is that
you know this this probably would be
pages of code in another languages
language he underscored how fault
tolerance is encoded in the language of
Erlang and I've always heard from people
maybe people who didn't climb the
learning curve all the way that Erlang
was hard to learn and some people accuse
that of its syntax which is unfamiliar
to a lot of people who learn programming
in the last five or ten years but I
think that one of the reasons it's hard
to learn is because the concepts are so
different but those concepts are very
powerful and I think that's what gives
people who become native and learn early
such a love of this language
Jimbo's went on to tell me that Erlang
tries to embody a belief that a program
is died a dynamic living thing that it's
built of active processes that interact
with each other with the programmer and
with the environment and it can heal
itself when it breaks it can spread
across multiple hosts and survive
multiple crashes so last little note on
this language and I want to share a
story about why I how I stumbled across
over it and how it took me a little
while to be able to look at the
programming and understand it and it
actually speaks to why I think that it's
important to teach people to not be
afraid to teach new programmers a hard
language because I think what's hard
about it is that you've learned a
different programming language first so
this was very hard for me to read
because I come from a different world
and so I immediately think the thing on
the right side of the length of the
arrow is the
Olsson I can't help when I first started
reading these this code to just parse
this this is two functions that weirdly
have the same name and it took me a lot
of reading before suddenly and I've this
has been my experience with with human
spoken language suddenly you stop
translating in your head
suddenly you start thinking in the
language suddenly the concepts collapse
and suddenly I can read this and then it
just seems like a logical way to
construct an expression and to say
something that means something so so
this after I became just a little gained
a tiny bit of fluency in reading Erlang
suddenly this javascript code looks
baroque
so and for completeness I think the
elixir equivalent has some of the
analogous challenges it's a little it
was a little easier for me to read at
first because it has some ruby isms but
I think the what it expresses is more
Earling than Ruby David Harrison one of
my favorite linguist yes I have favorite
linguists notes that as we live in this
digital age we like to imagine we have
this kind of fantasy that any
information that is useful is available
to us somewhere in writing in some book
or library or database it can be googled
but that's not true I'm gonna shift now
talk about community because there is a
wisdom in this community that is not yet
effectively articulated for the world
and I look forward to all of you sharing
more and more with the world the things
that you know within this community that
I think the world needs to know but I'll
share something from my own experience
this is a photo from the first
railsbridge workshop which happened in
2009 we started with a simple concept
which has grown into a movement the idea
was to teach a new framework and
language to both expert programmers and
newcomers in a one day workshop we
iterated on this format and found that
there were key few ingredients that made
it work one was to have a diverse
teaching team it's important that your
students see themselves in the experts
and it's an important way to teach each
other that there are experts who all
look differently we offer child care
we didn't want there to be any barriers
to someone showing up food is a great
equalizer
and a great networking opportunity for
people to talk to each other and share
stories in an informal setting we would
always have an install fest the night
before because sometimes it takes hours
to install the things to make your
programs work and from my perspective
that is like the worst part of
programming other people like that stuff
but with all that out of the way we have
a day of coding then we have reserved
this day for people to experience to
have no limits oh and all the support in
exploring a new language and a new
framework the mission of this group
which is now called bridge foundry which
includes eight different bridges which
are languages and frameworks that are
taught by volunteers all over the world
is that we empower people with
technology through teaching and
facilitating access enlarging the
community of people who give back and
teach others and I think this is an
important description of what we do and
our call to action but over the last few
years I felt like this didn't like
there's something going on here that was
not well articulated I kept hearing
through people like random women would
come up to me and say railsbridge
changed my life I'd read blog posts and
tweets going to this workshop changed my
life it created this mysticism that
people are think that we have like a
fully-fledged program over months or
years that are like transforming
people's lives but really it's just this
one day workshop what's going on I
thought about like what's this magical
thing we do I have some ideas but I
think if I asked
a dozen different volunteers what are
the top three things that make this
magic happen I get 24 answers and that
all be probably right and I don't know
how I would rank them one of the stories
that gave me a bit of a clue is I kept
hearing these little anecdotes from
somebody who worked at a company where
she would have colleagues who had
volunteered at workshops and would be
like well I was here and this thing
happened and it was a little weird and
then this dude stepped up and he said
the thing and oh my god I could go back
to work and that was awesome and what I
saw was the workshops were having a
transformational effect on the people
who were volunteering to teach that they
were in fact learning some other skills
that they were bringing back into the
workplace so a small group of us got
together a few years ago with a
researcher Julie Reimold from whose day
job is working at s RI and studying
educational processes and how they work
and we had you know we've met like once
a month or every few weeks for four or
five months to talk about like a
research project where we could like
really surface what are the things that
really work and I just felt like it was
all talk and we weren't getting anywhere
and then finally I asked Julie I'm like
okay so we've talked a lot like what's
our hypothesis if we were going to ask
somebody for a grant what do we think
we're what do we learn here I don't feel
like this you know I don't know has
these conversations taught you like been
meaningful to you and she said yes I've
done a lot including to listening to you
I've done a lot of research looked at
your online presence and she attended a
workshop and she said I don't think you
know what it is that you're teaching
she said that what you do in your
workshops is you kind of inflate this
culture you are this community of
practice and you teach your workshops
like you make software there's this
collaborative process that you talk
about that you do in your jobs that you
love that makes it meaningful to you
that makes you productive and that's
what you're sharing you are teaching
your workshops like you do coding and
therefore you are sharing with people
who don't have that work experience what
it's really like to be a software
engineer and I thought whoa like yeah I
think that is what we do because you
know I read TechCrunch in the newspaper
and I hear about what a horrible place
it is to work in this industry and you
know there's truths there but there's
this other truths that is not being
spoken of which is that it's awesome to
work in this industry and it's fun and
there are great environments out there
where people treat each other with
respect and we need to make more of that
and we need to show newcomers that
that's what they're looking for and so
this collaborative teaching I think is
the thing and we sort of identified in
the last year that that what we're doing
really it sounds kind of bold but they
were transforming tech culture this
thing that we do in the workshops is
actually spreading beyond the workshops
themselves we're generating teachers
leaders mentors we're helping these
people who are doing this anyhow to find
each other in to build community we are
empowering the underserved but they are
helping us achieve this greater mission
even more than we're providing skills
and knowledge
I never expected that this soft and
fluffy community stuff would be so
deeply rewarding and intellectually
challenging last year I volunteered
although I mostly learned at the first
elixir bridge conference and a nice
bridge is in the audience where are you
Oh back there yeah Anna
and she's speaking today or tomorrow so
elixir bridge is the same kind of format
the same type of workshop around elixir
and the tools and processes they come
from the Erlang ecosystem and I want to
invite anybody who has an interest in
this type of community building to send
email to info at elixir rich org tell
them what what resources or skills you
think you can share and what you want to
learn and I'm super excited to build
that community and be part of that
community together this is a place what
we found that students become teachers
and teachers become mentors and we all
learn together so I want to go back to
this word why am I here I felt called I
felt a certain urgency to show up you
know like I I kind of like I have a job
and I just started at Google less than a
year ago I'm working on some deadlines
I'm working getting ready for a talk at
Google i/o I I have all sorts of things
going on I'm about to go to Warsaw and
it's like you know I got stuff going on
but Francesco reached out to me and said
you know would you be willing to keynote
this conference my immediate response
was yes wait why
so I felt this urgency to come and show
up and speak with you today
but I think that like overstates my role
even though I feel like I have something
to share with you all I think that maybe
I'm here because I need to learn
something from you perhaps I need new
words new vocabulary maybe I need a new
language to express that thing that is
the reason I've been put here on this
earth so I want to close with Chicago
it's Anette day the word from the den a
language we are here not only on this
earth but for these two days to learn
together in the spirit of Chicago it's a
knit day to learn from each other about
Erlang elixir OTP and learn new words
new primitives
maybe invent some there are people who
came to this conference because they
have a deep understanding of different
domains who are solving diverse problems
and have some insights that these
languages that this community can
provide solutions it's easy to be
humbled by the stark and terrifying
challenges that face our society today
it's easy to feel small and powerless
yet each of us reflects now and then on
why we're here in this world what is the
unique experience the knowledge and
skills that we can bring and when we
find it we can transform our one small
life into something just a little bit
bigger and help to create the future
together
you
any questions
this
the graduate students
that's a great question our educational
system was formed to support the
industrial economy I think most people
know this that what we're doing in our
school systems today doesn't actually
serve our children our young people it's
preparing them for a world that no
longer exists
we cannot be cogs in a machine and
survive in this world and that
transformation is hard there's all sorts
of things that are stuck in fact I am
three years ago I was I went to help our
federal government with the the
technology transformation that the Obama
really instigated and I worked under
Todd Park first as a presidential
innovation fellow and then as at 18f
which is a little consulting group
inside the US government and I was i I
wrote about on my blog that I think that
like if we could somehow get open-source
into the public schools that that could
be transformative that could be
unsticking our textbooks should be open
source we have the capability here in
California if we could get it together
and require that text for textbooks be
open-source that would change the nation
we are the biggest school system in the
nation what I learned after going to the
federal government I did not do my
research well enough the federal
government actually has very little to
do with education as it turns out
I was at the Smithsonian so I did learn
a lot about awesome things and I think I
had some influence there but I think
that in small ways and big ways we need
to make this transformation happen there
are policy ways I think by requiring
open what happened in Brazil with the
open source is phenomenal it
reinvigorated the economy if anybody is
inspired or know people who know how to
make policy pass laws like I think
that's some place where a small change
to make a huge difference and these
things are possible the other thing is
by getting involved I volunteered at my
kids school just I showed up you know
every morning in kindergarten for an
hour
I still got in to work before most of my
fellow engineers that and you can do
that even if you don't have kids it's
it's phenomenal how the presence of a
grown-up transforms kids lives kids need
the grown-ups in our community kids need
to be connected to the new world and the
teachers were trained the teachers can't
they can facilitate how to teach but
they need people experts coming from
industry to help them understand how to
bring this new technology to kids so
there's a great organization called the
Computer Science Teachers Association
does great resources if you're doing any
volunteering with kids teaching
programming but I think that in every
different way each of us has to do
something to move the needle just a
little bit and I think these things seem
slow moving but we have to keep moving
that way and then all of a sudden
there's a tipping point
