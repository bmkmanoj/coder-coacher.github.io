course what I'm going to talk
is about how errors are handled in
concurrent processes we've got three
plants to the to the chapter we're going
to talk about the basics of process
error handling in the first part in the
second part we're going to look at how
client-server models are outlined server
systems are modeled in Erlang look at a
particular example and then in the final
section we look at how to take that
example and using the principles of
error handling that we found out about
in the first part how to make that
system robust ok so let's start by
looking at the idea of links the BIF
link that takes a single single argument
creates what's called a link between two
processes the process that calls the
Biff and the process whose Pig is passed
in as argument so for example in the
picture you see there we call link on
with argument pit of B inside the
process pit of a and that's created a
bi-directional link between the two now
often what happens is that you perform a
link at the same time as performing a
spawn and so in a typical pattern is to
spawn and then to link there is a
potential problem there in that other
things in a system could change between
calling spawn and link for instance of a
process could be deshield so in order to
perform the spawn and Link atomically as
a single action there is AB if spawn
link and that will have the same effect
but it will make sure that either both
of them happen or neither happens so we
tend to see programs that begin with a
spawn link what's the purpose of a link
well what happens we want to build a
system where we control termination of
processes
so what we do is a link causes the
termination of one process to be
reflected in the termination of other
processes when a process terminates a an
exit signal is sent from that process to
every other process to which it's linked
and the process receiving that signal
will exit and it will itself propagate a
new exit message to all the processes to
which it is linked so transitively when
a there's been an abnormal termination
of a process in one place in a system it
will travel across all the links in the
system terminating the processes which
are linked so that's the way I could
exit signals work by default but we'll
see there are other mechanisms that can
halt that behavior but the picture here
shows you that transitive arm
propagation termination of process a
sends an exit signal to process B and
terminate that in turn terminates B
which sends an exit signal to process C
so all three processes finish up
terminating now we can reverse that
behavior we can change that behavior and
a process can execute at the Biff called
process flag changes a number of flags
on in a problem which which govern a
processes behavior but in this case we
call it with the atom trap exit as first
argument and they be the boolean true
second and that means that the process
executing that Biff will now be trapping
exits and instead of these exit signals
causing the process to terminate what
will happen is that those exit signals
are converted into messages of a format
with the exit atom at the beginning and
then followed by a PID
and the reason the PID being the
originating process the process that
sent the signal and the reason being
whatever reason determination has has
happened and these will go into the
process mailbox so in this example the
process on the right if it's trapping
exits will receive a message as a full
exit second argument a the PID of the
processes that's exited and the third
argument being the reason and most
importantly this stops the propagation
of exits through the system so if you
trap an exit signal
it doesn't propagate any further than
the process which trapped it so what
we'll see in the earlier example if we
now see a sends a an exit signal to be
be traps it and so excuse me so the
signal that would previously have
propagated from B to C doesn't and so
what we see is that a has terminated
abnormally but B and C are still
executing normally B has now got a
message with the the with the Atem exit
and a reason in the message but in the
message but apart from that it will
continue it to exit as normal so B can't
handle that as it wishes
so just to remind you of the terminology
we've established a link is a
bi-directional process propagation path
to exit signals set up between processes
so recall we said that when we typically
what happens is when we spawn a process
the spawning process links to this form
process but this is bi-directional so if
either of those dies the other one will
be killed and the the mechanism for that
that process termination is this exit
signal which is transmitted by process
on exit and that contains information
about the precise reason for the process
having terminated and finally we've seen
the option of trapping an error when a
process is going to handle exit signals
rather than simply be terminated by them
and they're put into the mailbox in
exactly the same way as other messages
just to remind you of the functions
we've talked about the link function
sets up a link between the calling
process and the PID which is its
argument it's also possible to remove a
link using the unlink function spawn
link combines the operation of spawn and
Link into a single atomic function and
it's the process flag function call
during the arguments trap exit and then
true or false will switch on or off
trapping exits it's also possible for a
user to program in a an abnormal
termination using the exit BIF with a
single argument if we call exit with a
the reason as the argument in a process
that process will terminate abnormally
and so that will cause a message all the
processes to which it's linked typical
exit message with its PID and the reason
which was the recent past into the Biff
as the reason for termination
it's also possible to cause another
process to terminate so if we call eggs
the two argument version of exit with a
PID and a reason that causes the process
with that particular PID to terminate
abnormally with the reason being the
reason we've passed in so we're able to
programmatically create those exits so
we can do that if we're wishing to close
a number of programs down we can do that
by choice now we need to be very clear
about how exit messages are propagated
in different circumstances the basic
message is that when a process
terminates it sends an exit signal to
the processes in its link set now an
exit signal can be normal and that will
be when a process simply comes to the
end of the code it's executing or it can
be non normal and those are they non
normal abnormal and those are the things
we've been talking about earlier in this
session where we've created either
through calling exit all before some
other reason a process is terminated
abnormally if a process is not trapping
exit signals then it will die if it
receives a non normal exit signal we've
seen that that's how exits get
transitively propagated through a system
a normal exit signal is simply ignored
we don't we said we see it but it
doesn't go into the mailbox
it's simply ignored if a process is
trapping exits then all incoming exit
signals get turned into messages that
are handled in a receive statement so
those include not only the non normal
terminations but the normal terminations
as well now there is one exception to
this and that is when the reason for
termination is
process is terminated unconditionally
whether or not it is trapping exits so
having a reason of kill overrides
setting the trap exit flag to true now
just to be clear about that here's a
table which summarizes those particular
those six different conditions is a
program trapping exits or not is the
message is the termination message a
normal one is it a kill or is it any
other and you can see there that the
kill message irrespective of trapping
exits or not results in the process
being terminated and that will again
that will propagate transitively through
a through a system so that's a way of
bringing a whole system down normal
termination messages are when exits not
being trapped I simply simply have no
effect but they do if a system is
trapping exits it will receive a message
in its Inbox
both the normal terminations and for
abnormal terminations and in the case
that exits are not being trapped what
will happen is that the process will
terminate with the reason that it
received from the exit message so I
think that has covered how we set up
links between processes so that errors
are propagated through process networks
and we can see in particular exit
signals can be transmitted or not
according to various settings of the
trap exit flag and the particular reason
that that the the termination has
happened and we've also revised some of
the definitions we've made in this
section so I'm just going to have a
pause here and what we're going to do
next is talk about client-server models
