sounded way cooler than this one so
thanks for being here all right
as really said I'm Kevin and I come from
way over here I'm American but I live
over here yeah and this as he said this
tiny small town called Seoul and there's
like one or two other people that live
there as well so I work for a company
called skelter lab we're hiring if you
want to come to come to Seoul and
ironically we actually just moved
offices to Gangnam which puts me one
step closer to my life goal of being
this guy so today we're going to talk
about protocols so protocols are an
elixir feature that I think is really
cool and it's kind of built into some of
the core parts of the language but it's
also something that not a lot of people
talk about and something that I didn't
really discover until later in my
journey through elixir and so we're
going to kind of go through the the
reasons why elixir protocols exists and
talk through some practical use cases of
how you can use them so to first go
through what protocols are I first want
to talk about why protocols are so why
why do these exist so to go through that
we need to understand that programs all
programs regardless of the language are
made up of two elements two fundamental
elements and those are types and
functions so types are the data of our
system the noun the like the strings and
the lists and all the all the stuff that
makes up the data and then functions are
the operations on that data they take
data in they transform it they do stuff
to data so we have strings and strings
can be split and we have lists and they
can be flattened and maps can be merged
and structs can do what they want so so
these are kind of the core fundamental
things that that all programs
everywhere are made of and so languages
all languages try to organize these
things in the most optimal way if
possible so how can we organize
functions and organize data in a way
that makes the most sense for everyone
but the when doing this there's a
problem that arises and that problem is
called the expression problem and so
we're going to walk through today a
little bit about what the expression
problem is and why languages get tripped
up on this thing and what we can do to
fix it so what the expression problem
says is how can we add new types so new
types of data to our systems and how can
we add new functions to our systems
without modifying the ones that we
already have so without modifying our
existing types without modifying our
existing functions so to explain this
I'm going to walk through kind of a
simple example we're going to use a
couple of very simple types representing
shapes and we're going to talk about
functions that can apply to these shapes
so calculating area and perimeter for
example so first let's try an imperative
style so like an object-oriented style
so these these examples are going to be
in Ruby but if you're familiar with Java
or JavaScript or PHP make make sense
okay so here we have a class can you
guys read that okay maybe so here we
have a class it's a rectangle it has a
couple of instance variables for width
and Haissam call area it's just going to
calculate the width times height so
pretty simple and then we've got a super
simple printer that will just print out
the area when you pass it a shape or a
rectangle so question one of the
expression problem is can we add a new
type to our system without modifying
either the existing types that we have
or the existing functions that operate
on those types and in an oo system
adding types is kind of like a is
optimized so in this in this case very
simple case yes we can add new types to
this to this
and we don't have to change anything
right we can now create a circle and it
calculates this area differently but our
printer still maintains compatibility
with both our existing types and our new
types so we can add a new type and
everything's cool so new types cool all
right
so second question is can we change a
function or implement a new function
without changing anything else and this
is key because sometimes your types
might not be owned by you might right
they might come from some third-party
library they might come from some other
part of the system that you don't have
easy access to sometimes you just don't
want to change more code you just want
to like do things in isolation so if we
wanted to change our printer to output
the perimeter instead of the area how
could we do that well that starts to put
some roadblocks in our way right if we
wanted to implement perimeter we would
probably have to go into rectangle class
and into circle class and add the
perimeter function how we could like
this is Ruby so we could like monkey
patch which is like sounds like a
terrible thing to do and it usually is
and so we could do that we could like
wrap our instances in some other class
like like an interface like what Java
does but there's some downsides to doing
doing that so so no matter how you slice
it in most imperative languages changing
functions require you to change your
types and that's just kind of the way
that those things are so we'll say that
adding new functions or changing
functions is difficult all right so now
let's try functional language and we're
at elixir comps so let's write some
elixir code so here we've got the same
exact thing that we've got a rectangle
it calculates the area but this time
we're going to pass an instance of this
struct to our area function to calculate
the area we've got the same thing a
printer which takes a rectangle and then
outputs using the rectangle module is
going to output the area and
so the first question is can we add a
new type without modifying any other
functions in our system and that starts
to get a little crazy right because we
add a circle and now we have to update
printer to know about what circle is
because it doesn't it currently doesn't
know how to how to call over to circle
so we would either have to add another
another print function that takes a
circle and calls the circle module or
we'd have to do some pattern matching
some other way or pass a function
reference which is not optimal so adding
new types to our functional system is
typically requires us to change our
existing functions so not not optimal
however if we want to change our printer
to print out the perimeter instead of
the area although it might not seem
obvious that's actually not that hard to
do because you know in functional
languages we've decoupled the the data
from our operations that be coupled the
types from our operation from our
functions and so we can just implement
the perimeter function inside of printer
if we wanted to so that might look
something like this we could just say
alright we know the printer knows how to
calculate the perimeter for rectangle
and circle and it'll just define that
itself we don't have to change our
existing types and everything's all good
so adding new functions cool we can do
that all right
so recap the expression problem adding
new types for an imperative language
typically doesn't require modifying
existing functions although adding new
functions or changing changing functions
typically requires us to change our
types and the direct opposite is is true
for functional so if we want to add new
types to a functional language typically
have to modify functions to handle those
new types but if we want to change just
functions we typically don't have to go
change our types all right
so this is where protocols come in so
protocols are a language feature of
elixir and they allow us to solve this
problem so they were influenced heavily
by closure I'm not going to say that
they were copied you can ask good josée
if he would say that so they came from
closure and they kind of follow the same
sort of pattern that closure does these
are an elixir only feature so this
feature does not exist in the underlying
Erlang system and what a protocol does
is it decouples the definition of a
function from its implementation for a
specific data type so walk through what
that means basically before when we had
our data which went directly to a
function a protocol puts an intermediary
and an intermediary step in between
there so we take our data type we pass
it to our protocol and then our protocol
given the implementations that it knows
about we'll call implementation for the
data type that you pass it so let's walk
through a very basic example of that
okay so here we're going to create a
protocol called blank able and blank a
bowl just has a single function blank
which will tell you if a data structure
is blank or not blink so if we want to
so we define the protocol using the Deaf
protocol it's actually a macro and and
you can see that we defined a single
function and we only define the head of
the function so no bodies of the
function go inside of the protocol
definition but now if we want to
implement our protocol for a given data
type we cannot do that and we use the
DEF in pull macro so we say def in pull
blank able for in this case a bit string
so just a string so we can say that a
string is blank if it's an empty string
and if it's not if it's anything else
it's not blank all right then we can go
on and we can define implementations
for a blanket protocol for other data
types so we can define them for maps and
we can say that a map is blank if it's
map size is equal to zero
and we can also and I think this is kind
of the key point two protocols is that
we can define implementations of our
protocols for structs so for our custom
structs so here we have a post struct
which has a title and a body attribute
and we will define we will say define an
implementation of the blank able
protocol and because we've defined it
inside of our struct module that's just
kind of a shorthand thing there and so
we can say that a that a post is blank
if its body is nil and otherwise it's
not blank okay so now that we've defined
our protocol blank Abel and we've
defined some implementations of that
protocol let's see how we can use it all
right so the first one will say so we
call a protocol by calling the the
protocol function so we blanket ball dot
blank will pass it the string foo and
that is going to call the string
implementation of our blank Abel
protocol so it's going to call that
implementation for string and we'll get
false and we can now call the blank Abel
protocol for a map and this will call
the the map implementation and we can
also call that for our for our post
struct and that will call the
implementation down here so we get we
get kind of different implementations
that get called based on the data type
that we pass it and we can also if we if
we pass something that we have not
defined an implementation for we'll get
an error so in this case we're passing
the atom foo and we'll get the air
protocol blanket ball is not implemented
for the atom food okay so to diagram
this out a little bit we have our blank
Abel protocol and we have implementation
so we have one for a bit string and for
a map and for a post
and if we pass a string to our protocol
it will dispatch to the string
implementation if we pass a map it will
dispatch to the map implementation and
if we pass a post it will call the post
implementation all right so the last
thing I want to talk through kind of in
the introduction to protocols here is
the ability for us to define a default
implementation so if we don't want to
implement for all types we can say we
want to implement this for what's called
the any type so here you'll see that
we've updated our def protocol module
and we've said we've added this fallback
to any attribute so if we set that to
true and then we set then we create an
implementation and we use this any
keyword this will say if you pass me any
type that I don't have a specific
implementation for use this
implementation so now if we Pat if we
call our blank with the atom foo it will
call the any implementation and we'll
get false the other way that we can do
this is by not doing the fallback to any
but we can use the derive syntax so
we've got our post module which is a
struct like before and instead of
defining our implementation we can say
at derive blank able and that says use
the default implementation of the blank
able protocol for this struct so it's
kind of a shortcut especially if you if
you're defining lots of structs and you
want the same behavior for for each one
you can use this so you don't have to
type it up in each one okay so there we
go so blank bulb a blank for posts is
going to call the any implementation all
right so now that we're experts in
protocols let's go back to the
expression problem so recall that before
in a functional language we were able to
add we were able to change function able
to add new functions without modifying
our types but if we added a new type we
to go change our existing functions so
this time instead of calculating the
area as just a function we're going to
use a protocol so we'll define a
protocol here called area and it has a
single calc function there and then our
rectangle is instead of just defining an
area function is going to define an
implementation for the area protocol so
this defines the area that way but nope
no code here is changed we've just
inserted our protocol layer between our
data type and our function our
implementation ok printer and the the
printer now is going to use the the area
protocol to print out the area and so
the question of the day is now that
we've converted this to using protocols
can we add a new type of shape without
modifying our existing functions and the
answer is we totally can because now we
can create a circle our circle
implements the area protocol and it it
can be passed to the printer the printer
calls the area protocol and we've kind
of done like a polymorphic thing here
and so we've totally solved the
expression problem for functional
language like that's awesome yeah
alright and furthermore we can we can
also let's say that the printer wanted
to implement the the perimeter to wanted
to now call perimeter instead of area
well it could define its own protocol
for perimeter and it could just define
two implementations I ran out of code
there or room there on my slides but it
could define its own perimeter protocol
implement it for the rectangle and the
circle type and kind of do the same
thing so we have solved the expression
problem using protocols all right
awesome okay so now that we know kind of
why protocols exist what problem they
solve let's walk through some of the
core protocols that exist in the elixir
language so this is protocols that
shipped with a lick sir that you can
implement for doing different things so
the first one is pretty simple one it's
called string dot cards and this is
responsible for converting a datatype
for converting a data structure into a
string and elixir implements this for
like atoms and for a few other things so
we can then we can just use this this
way so if you implement a string dot
cards for your data structure you can
like customize the way that it prints
out as a string and you can see we can
pass like we can use the two string
method this also gets called whenever
you do string interpolation it's going
to call the string dot cars protocol and
so two strings the second one is called
collectible and this is a protocol used
for taking values out of a collection
and to implement this protocol you would
just implement a into function for your
data type and it's used by the enum into
function if you've ever used that and it
lets you convert for lists like
structures from one to another so in
this case we're converting a keyword
list into a map and so that's using the
collectible protocol and you can have
custom behavior if you wanted to do
something special for your for your data
types all right the next one inspect so
this is similar to to string or yeah
similar to string dot cars but it takes
a data structure and converts it into
kind of like a pretty printed format it
lets you do a valve on it and yeah it's
called like an algebraic document
whatever that means all right so we can
inspect something and it'll print us out
a a string of that all right so the next
one is IX info this is the protocol that
gets used by the AI helper so
if you're in an IX session and you say I
and pass it some data type it will tell
you some information about it so in this
case we say the atom foo it'll say that
it's an atom that it references these
modules and it will tell you what
protocols it implements and you can
define your custom custom implementation
of this if you want to and the last one
is the enumerable protocol so I think
this is like one of the coolest
protocols and it's used by the enum and
stream functions so those modules that
iterate over things and to implement the
enumerable protocol for your own data
type all you have to do is implement
these three functions count member and
reduce and this will let you let you
have your custom datatype interact with
all of the enum and stream functions and
so there's actually some really cool use
cases here right you could imagine like
you could have a process that keeps
track of some list of things and so you
want to be able to call into your
process and pull out elements of this
list you could do that by using by
implementing the enumerable protocol
yeah so it does lets you do map and
reduce and all that stuff okay
so now that we've talked about some
protocols in the core language let's
talk about some protocols in in the wild
in libraries that are out there so the
first one I'm going to talk about is is
a library that you've probably all used
if you've done much elixir at all this
is called the poison library so this is
what converts elixir into elixir data
structures into JSON and takes strings
of JSON and converts it back into elixir
data structures let's use by Phoenix and
pretty much everything that does JSON
encoding so poison implements two
protocols one called
encoder and one called decoder one
encodes into JSON one decodes from JSON
and the way that it works so if we have
here we have like poison and code and we
can give it some some data and it'll
just print out a JSON representation of
that and the poison encoder protocol
looks like this so we have def protocol
poison encoder it's got the fallback to
anything and it encodes a value all
right and if we look this is a little
bit simplified from the actual source
code but pretty close so we have a
poison encoder for atoms and we can say
if you pass an atom it will so if you
pass null it's going to print out null
if you pass true true false and anything
else it's just going to to string
because in JavaScript we don't have
symbols or atoms so it just converts it
to a string but the cool part here is
that you can define your own
implementation for the encoder protocol
and do like do special encoding for your
for your types so here we have a person
with a name and an age and instead of
doing the default behavior which would
be to like create an object with the
name in the age we're just going to say
convert this to a string of name and in
parentheses age so that might be
something that you want to do you want
to say anytime I can
want to convert this type into JSON I
want to like have some custom behavior
there all right so the next one we'll
talk about is a library called Scrivener
I think that's how you pronounce it and
this this library does pagination so has
a nation's very common problem that we
that we have when building like web apps
and things so so the way that Scrivener
works is it works works by default with
EXO and it will handle paginating a
query based on some input parameters so
in this case we can say my repo paginate
the this this user EXO struct and we
want to say with page size of 10
and then this will return us a Scribner
page structure which has the entries
that we requested plus a bunch of data
about the page size like total pages
total records all that stuff and so
Scrivener implements or defines a
protocol called the Scribner paginate
err and this has a single function
called paginate and it so the the
implementation that it ships with is for
an XO query so here we have a paginate
ER implementation for XO query it takes
anything that's an XO query plus our
page size consuming values and then it
just does the limiting and offset of our
echo query and returns the structure you
saw up the top so this is all cool but
what if we wanted to implement like
let's say a cache we wanted to like
cache our records in some process well
we could totally define our own paginate
err for like our custom types so we
could say like I want to define an
implementation of the scrivener paginate
err for like my thing maybe some cache
process or something like that and this
could implement the same same function
here and now the cool part about this is
is that your whatever you're passing
this to like the front end it sees the
same thing right it sees a Scribner page
with entries and it doesn't care whether
you got them from XO or you got them
from the cache it's all like the same
thing so that's kind of a cool a cool
thing I thought for implementing a
protocol all right so let's walk through
kind of another use case that you might
commonly see and if you're writing any
application this is like integrating
with a some third-party so you want to
talk to Twitter or you want to talk to
github or you want to talk to something
you could actually solve this problem
using a protocol so let's say that we
want to let's say that we have an API
that we want to send messages to so
github or Twitter or something so we
have a message and this
we want to fetch users to fetch user
message and we're going to say with the
roles of admins and we're going to send
it to our API so API send this message
so we could implement this using a
protocol so we could say I'm going to
define a protocol called API message and
we'll define two functions on there one
to build the request so build some HTTP
request to go fetch users or whatever
and and another function to parse the
response that we get back from our from
this API and so this might be what our
API module looks like so we have our
send message which calls into the API
message build request and then does some
HTP stuff and then call back into the
protocol to parse the response and if we
look at the list implementation for our
fetch user message this is a struct with
a role and then it does building the
request body and parsing the response
now the point that I want to make here
is that that send message function there
could do a whole bunch of logic that is
universal to all messages so it could do
like some authentication it could do
parsing to and from JSON or it could do
like cookie handling like anything that
was unit universal to all messages and
then your message types have a very
specific implementation just build the
request is specific for this message and
parse the response that is specific this
message and we can add like tons of
messages and never have to change the
underlying logic that's universal there
all right so black or a few things that
I want to talk about this is a question
that I often see on forums is should I
use a protocol or should I use a
behavior and the question that I've sort
of learned to ask myself is can each
implementation of my function take the
same data type
and if the answer is yes it can I can I
can distill this problem down into a
single data type then I might choose a
behavior over a protocol because a
protocol is specific to different data
being passed to my functions so let's
look at an example where you might want
to use a behavior instead of a protocol
and a behavior by the way for those who
might not know behavior is just a way to
define a specification for a module that
says this module needs to implement
these functions in order to implement
this behavior and it doesn't say
anything about data it's strictly about
about functions okay so let's say that
we want to write a write a library to
send emails so here we've got a message
and it's got a to and a subject and a
body like standard things you could have
with an email and we want to have a
mailer that's going to deliver our
message now we might come across the use
case of where we want to change the way
that we send our messages based on like
whether we're in production or we're in
test environment so we might want to
send using SMTP in production but use
some like cash thing in testing so that
we can assert on messages so you might
think like well I could implement a
protocol for this right I want to change
the behavior based on on something but
the but the actual reality here is that
our data which is that first line that
message that thing stays the same across
each implementation right whether we're
sending through SMTP or sending through
some cache or sending through mailgun
like the message data is always the same
the - from the body of the message like
that that all stays the same so a
protocol would probably be better here
or sorry a behavior would probably be
better here than a protocol so in this
case our mailer will like get the
current adapter depending on like what
config whether it's in production or
whatever and I will deliver that message
and then we can define different
implementations of our adapters that
each take the same message data
sure so we're going to find an SMTP is
after a sing good adapter and a test
adapter so the rule of thumb there if
your functions can take the same data
type use a behavior if you need your
functions to take different data for
each implementation than lean towards a
protocol alright the last thing I'll say
here is don't get too carried away when
I first Dovan two protocols I was like
oh yeah let's use protocols for
everything and that's not usually
optimal because they do add a little bit
of layer of indirection there so just be
a little careful and you know think of
this is just another tool in your
toolbox right it's something that solves
a very specific problem I think in a
very very elegant way and so if you find
yourself coming across these issues
where you need to you need to have
different data types that can be kind of
changed dynamically there the functions
they're calling then protocols might be
pretty good so with that yeah come up
some need ah thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
