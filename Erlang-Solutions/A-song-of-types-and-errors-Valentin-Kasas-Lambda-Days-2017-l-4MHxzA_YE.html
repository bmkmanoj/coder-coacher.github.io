I'm this court as a very misleading
title first you should not expect the
singing which is not the lincoln n
threaten and secondly it features color
in the title but I feel that what I'm
about to say could apply to pretty any
new technology that is not yet
mainstream so in the next 45 minutes i
will be sharing with you some of my
personal experience from this experience
so we try to extract some tips and
tricks and to illustrate my point i will
make very poor pictorial metaphors which
are taken from a lightning famous TV
show and may constitute spoilers so
we've already begin if this picture the
means nothing to you or maybe this one
or that one that saves me if you've
never seen that that means you've not
been on the internet for those past four
years so my name is sometimes I'm a
scholarly voter in Paris but before
being a scalar developer I was a
mainstream therapist I developed in in
Java and so I think it's a good starting
point for a story to begin with what it
is to be a mainstream developers so it
is your our mainstream guy is very
handsome he has a really hands-on
experience you know all the
yeah you know only handle tricks of his
craft and this guy has a motive well
sorry not that one and it's not oh is
that a developer always pays is
technically the source code is rather
inaccurate because a developer always
pays other technical debt and maybe it's
a certain point when you've faced a new
technology you become begin to see all
your mainstream code as technical debt
and clumsy and cumbersome makers leaving
a mainstream technology doesn't only
drawback first there is a lot of job so
if your job is becoming boring you can
easily get it and insight another one of
course since there are a lot of jobs
chances are you observe which will
become very and rather on the same ID
since the technology is mainstream and
you matter it it can it can become
something comfortable and so you don't
have a big pressure to get better but on
the other side of this same coin you can
start to feel that you you've seen
everything you know everything there is
to know and it can become boring this
term that is in this little diagram
we're on the top view as the expectation
curve which starts on the left with a
technology trigger then there is the
high then people start making mistakes
and that play begins and then the
expectation drops and finally we get
better and we reach a plateau of
productivity
and being mainstream means you are
somewhere on the right of this point
which means also that a lot of
experience has been collected through
the years and there is a lot of material
online to to to learn and get better
they're all black boards and boots and
comfortable and you know it means that
it is really easy to bootstrap newcomers
win with a mainstream technology and and
you have a mental in company and so on
but of course this also means that there
is nothing more to it so almost nothing
more and that's why we we become bored
with say Java or C sharp or PHP and
because of that bottom you decide to
explore a new and share leading
technology so you pick it you pick up on
you you become to you begin to learn it
learn it and now we want to use it in
your day job and so you search for a job
in your Chinese in technology and of
course since it is not mainstream yet
there are not a lot of job so what do
you do but first you can try to create
your own job in your shiny new
technology by convincing your manager to
use it for the next project but it's not
always successful a good starting point
to try to find a new job in this little
niche of new technology is to try to to
bind with the community of that
technology and the better the best place
for that is your local user group so if
you're a new practitioner of emerging
technology and there is no user group in
your city about it you might create one
who of course good conferences or
chatter with people on Gita or IRP and
so on and finally you'll need to be
patient because it's stealing merging so
an opportunity may arrive but somewhere
in the future in fact I i discovered
scala in 2012 and from the beginning I
wanted to work with Scala that I had to
wait until of late 2013 to find my first
job in scallops but in the process of
lining with people and trying to reach
that new community you might feel that
feeling that we saw in college I
yourself which is the impostor syndrome
imported everything thats when the Paris
scalar user group and we have a monthly
meter and that's each meter there are
about all of them so of people will come
there every month but they leave at the
hand of the last port and I feel that
that they miss the most important part
of a method which is dining with people
and there is they do so because they do
not buy feel entitled to to take part of
the community because they are newcomer
or scholar is just their hobby language
and they feel they do not have the right
to proposed talks and just chat with
people while working with skala on a
daily basis and this is wrong so if you
feel that way I want to tell you that
you should not you should set up and and
bind with the community of your shiny
new technology but finally you back up
and you try to pack your things and go
to the edge of the civilized world and
try to join a little company that
is the the shiny new technology and
chances are you will be the first
developer in that new routine or new
company and you take on the project and
you make progress and it works and after
a while a new developer comes or maybe
this graduate students or even illusion
and without notice without that we
wanted it you find yourself being a
leader of a shiny new technology team
and maybe this will be comfortable
because after all you're still a
beginner you're not an expert yet and
you keep hearing that little voice in
the back of your head reminding you on
daily basis that well you're not an
expert yet and this is probably another
flavor of the impostor syndrome which is
a good one this time because it will
pushes you to to to get better and to
make progress but of course it also can
be overwhelming because now you're in a
team you are tasked to to to produce
software and you're not the next word so
there is a double pressure you need to
produce software and you need to get
better and in fact you have a big
responsibility you have responsibilities
toward your team and your boss because
you need to produce software but you
also have a responsibility towards the
community of that shiny new technology
because if you fail yes you will be
blamed that the team will be blamed but
chances are the technology itself will
be blamed because it's you because it
was risky to use it in the first row
space and so things can become a little
overwhelming and when you're under
pressure you will make a fake
also we make the face because during a
completely different landscape from the
mainstream technology you've used before
with a new and emerging technology you
are somewhere on the left of this point
which means that the biggest mistakes
with that the clergy are still being
made they are not yet very documented
and also there are lots of artists
material to to teach it and to learn and
to get better and in fact that's what
the the point where I was when I
resorted to using Java in a little
company I joined a little startup in
2013 which was whose mission was to
build and deploy a website for families
in France websites would do that with
allowed to sell drugs online which is a
very regulated activity in France and
because of that regulation we had to
deploy our website on very specialized
of the in company and these companies
were in turn freely expensive and so our
challenge was to build as much as
website as possible with as few as
possible computing power before I joined
the company a cultural one of the
co-founders are as build a little proof
of concept of the platform and my task
was to take her this proof-of-concept
and and make it better unsuitable for
production so of course I kept doing
that little voice who's back in my head
reminding me that I was not an extra set
but at the same time I felt a very
schizophrenic feeling that was that I
knew nothing but yet the fuel I knew was
so much powerful that what
you when I was preventing Java that they
was in a very mixed state of mind and
this can become very dangerous it can
lead to something I call other cabinet
which is of course not real world but
it's like hubris that apply to
programming that is abusing language
features you or libraries you've just
learned and put it to them everywhere so
for example if you know a little color
that can be using implicit parameters to
to pass dependencies and having it
flexes everywhere or maybe using actors
to to model everything even if you don't
need to to add concurrency or resilience
and this is in my sense the the biggest
enemy for a noob in a shiny new
technology and of course since us to to
produce software you are under pressure
about time moreover if you occur in a
start-up which has got much money you
have to produce software very quick
which means you will have few times to
to learn and get better and shoot I'm to
to teach to your co-workers and help
them getting better with the technology
and this kind of pressure made me make
big mistakes so this is not me to
mention to be read to them try to
decipher that that that practicode we
are using the place memory which is an
MVC web framework and this is an action
in a controller and at that time I was
very happy with that with that solution
because after all it's only a single
from Chico guide quite big but it's only
about 40 lines it's okay
but no III know that this is utterly
critical there is a mixing of language
features and there is a place again used
to to do dependency injection it is
awful and I knew it closer oh so why I
try to write things in a slightly better
way using the scholars at library so
don't know the skull of the library if
bits of Rascals are scaled ported to two
scallop it objectively better but it has
some drawbacks for example these mystic
singles there nobody knows what they do
but it was better but what was very
wrong in in that code base was that I've
mix some of this style with the previous
utter crap and it's a bit of having a
curb days with a style which was
secretly scattered and not consistent
and a few humans after trying this side
I had to part ways with that little
company and a few months later I came
across my ex coworker at a conference
and I went to in to ask him how he was
doing and if he made any progress and I
was doing it by his angry face a go away
I don't want to speak with you I don't
want to have anything to do with you
because it's been announced I've been
suffering as certain struggling with
your prattle code wow that's worth I
mean that Reb really badly because I
knew the code that has left behind was
not so good I even gave in my personal
phone number sitting in you can call me
anytime you you find something
completely mystic in the code
I will help you and in fact we had a
very strict cuz we do process in the
team which means meant that he had
reviewed every single line of my crappy
code so what was the problem I mean was
it not crappy before I'm 30 now I don't
know but array i realized that when you
use a technology that could be not
completely master and that allows to
have multiple solutions for the same
problem because with you is not enough
to ensure i could cut palicki we can
sense your fear learning and since there
are a lot of ways to do the same thing
your notion of good code will evolve
with a long time and so the good code
for today can look crappy tomorrow so as
I said that decided to to to get better
celsius was video traumatic experience
22 to meet that guy and 22 I really
salty he will be punching you so I
decided I needed to get better and a
good starting point I found 22 to get
better and focus on how to get better
with you when you do not have to thank
to it West you to get back to the basics
and to ask yourself how do I sell this
technology to my manager so certainly
you won't need to tell him here it has a
very big attractive power or i can write
elegant code or i can do category theory
but the selling points from the manager
point of view of functional programming
is productivity you will write less code
you will make less bugs the code will be
more testable not available and so you
will be you should be able to do more
with less manpower that the selling
point in my point of view for for
functional programming and starting from
that you can make it a strategy to get
better to hire the problem I was still
using the playground work so I was the
writing comforters and actions and I
wanted my actions to be very simple
because after all an actually in a
controller you know well designer MVC
architecture it was only three things it
was a request it validated then it calls
a bunch of services and finally it
builds up a response very simple and so
these are three steps any installer you
have a nice construct called for
contentions that fit that step structure
so I wanted my actions to be single for
comprehension but the problem was the
compiler wouldn't let me do it because I
have different types involved and in a
fall convention you can only put one
type so I had a problem and the first
thing to do when you have a problem is
to think about it and write it down and
scratch your head so that's why I did I
try to write down the types that were
involved in my various steps so in play
framework when you validate adjacent
field you get back jes result which is
more or less it resemble either it's
either the tax amount or a list of
heroes similarly when you very day to
form you get back a form of x
which is not either like site but it has
a full method which you can pass two
functions wanted to to manage the errors
and want you to manage the etiquette so
it's more like more legislature a hater
of course you you will call services and
often most often services involved
speaking to an external system which is
included in scala with the future type
26 for to winco decision synchrony but
of course these service methods could
return a result or nothing which which
made sutural function effects or maybe a
future of either an hour or the document
and in the end you need to return a
future of results with all being an HTTP
response so that was the the steps of my
father but I still had no solution
because I knew nothing so now I need to
search for the web on the web and that's
where the Prada begins because in
functional programming and especially at
that time six sectional programming use
mathematical concepts and those
mathematical concepts of name you cannot
make up you don't not really what to
search for for example I've tried
million times searching out of your
iPods different size in a for
comprehension and I find nothing so I
needed to learn a deeper functional
programming but I have not I had no time
for that so I came up with a little
strategy to learn just enough to know
what to learn next so first I gather
some knowledge so see
sources which are basically Twitter
accounts I follow those are prominent
practitioners of functional programming
or bloggers or conference speakers and
they will feed you with new concepts new
libraries new mathematical name and of
course you don't have the time to get
deep in all that knowledge so next I I
told you to build a mapping between
names and very vague notions of what
they these things are good for so for
example I knew only that Lynette was
where for managing effects and had
something to do with for comprehension
and scallop or for example that the
shadeless library was good for generic
programming and abstracting all the
types and so on so are you very little
but just enough to know we're too fat
we're pleased research when I will have
a new problem that's what I do when I
uncover a new problem in my day job I
rivers that nothing to define the name
of the concepts or libraries that I
should know learn and that's how I I try
to learn about manners and forms I don't
know if you familiar with that concept
it's not really important for the
thought but what I transformers that
allows the yard desert state so they
allow you to to mix and such different
manners into a single new manner so for
example in a very home problem the
solution was to use a Idol team of
future of resolved and X that will be my
new Mona that will be the thing I would
be able to to put in my for
comprehension
so now I had my solution and during a
weekend I I wrote a little vfl that
would allow me to use a single for
comprehension for my actions this is
quite involved even if it doesn't fit in
the screen I'm sorry here i have the
validation of adjacent pillows which
returns be a quote she's an object in my
domain or i will return a bad request if
it doesn't validate then I call service
that returns me a picture of action of
user which I i call the user user oh I
return Machamp and so on and so with the
people there psl I was able to transform
each of my type into this new either T
future of widows Annette and this gives
me a really cool vehicle which is the
wish you regenerate its link in there
but this is not the most important point
in the process the most important point
was that the Monday after that weekend I
refactored everywhere everything to use
it everywhere and I'd feel this is the
most important part when you use search
a solution for problem you have at work
because people the therapist they tend
to especially new comments that they
seem to take inspiration from the
existing code and by taking inspiration
I mean copying editing app and pasting
which is completely okay as long as
people try to understand what they are
doing
copying and pasting is ok but it makes
very important to have a single style in
the whole sub base because issue of
different sources of inspiration the
card will quickly decay and become
completely inconsistent so when you find
a solution and alone if you find a
partial and not completely acceptable
solution you should try to refactor
everywhere to use it it is really
important and finally when you've done
that and you happy with your solution
the next step is processed in fact in
that project that people the gears up it
made us able to write better code Penal
Code cutter and it forces us to think
about every possible error case which
was really really cool because we had in
that way we had a very self debacle API
since we are using different HTTP status
code for each heritage when an error
rides on the API we were able to quickly
and easily track where the problem arose
so that was the the biggest profit of
that little libraries and personally
inside the important impact on my life
it was though the first and for the
moment only library I ever published and
it was also there the subject of the
very first fault I ever met so after
that point I felt that I was not yet an
expert but I was in a better shape 22
chief and I was reading to to live with
that impostor syndrome without I think
it's overwhelming me but don't get me
wrong that little votes they never shut
up I mean I've been doing strata for
nearly four yrs and they are still so
many things I don't know that I still
feel like I know nothing that is get
better and I did I feel it good so to
remain humble and remain aware of
watching don't know it pushes you to to
learn new things but now I am more
confident in leading teams even if there
is no lead in a job title I mean you you
don't have to to be explicitly the
leader should be in leading position and
I try now to to to to bootstrap
newcomers and juniors the quicker I can
and do to to that others including on
cooling is very important especially in
the scholar world where our mental is
SVG which is known to be a little
cryptic and if you experienced enough to
to to master everything may be a good
thing to do is to use it extensibility
to provide some elders and little to
that will help newcomers and juniors to
to bootstrap project really quickly
that's what we we've done in the project
where I
currently we had we added some little
functions that allows you to create
modules in a single line with a whole
bunch of pre presets libraries
dependencies settings and so on so that
the generals in the team that do not
need to learn SBT before that began to
work of course they will learn at some
point but for now that they can skip it
and being productive this sets of little
tools they also include some project
skeleton that is when you use the little
apples to create a project then you have
a new current it means enmity to
initialize your project with unit pet
and for example for micro service you
will have a health check on endpoint and
so on and so you lay up a project so
that the the the general went asks you
to create a new module in five minutes
tops it can begin to write the real code
and in also he already has an example
test and so on and finally but more
importantly pair programming is really
really helpful to help Tramp jr. when a
junior in the team as a problem when I
see her trying on a specific problem I
always sit beside him and we try to find
a solution to the problem together and
using that opportunity I try to
introduce new concepts and new ways of
doing things it's important to introduce
concepts only when they are needed
because you connect this concept to a
real usage right on the on the point
and finally when your code base grows
enough you will not be able to apply the
reflector everywhere step I mentioned
before so you need a way to have a code
review process that will accommodate to
the changes in your style and this
honestly this is something I've not
experienced yet in a team but i feel
that is a good starting point when you
use a technology where there are many
ways to do the same thing the team
should read to one local best practice
and the team should write it in a wiki
or on the written in the gate project
with rules simple rules names and agreed
upon by the whole team for example in
skala it will be that team chooses to
represent enumerations with a seal trait
and quesada there are various solutions
for that very specific points in skala
but you have to choose one then a phone
code review you ensure that the whole
file that is such biochem it applies the
rules that are a greater fun and the
important part in the whole file because
you will need to be able to announce and
make and evolve the rules the style
guide of the team so maybe the file was
correct before the next evolution of the
SAG ID but now the silent evolved and
you have to make sure it will the field
the file will evolve with the style
guide and then you can repeat the
process
as long as the team gets better and
masters new new ways to do things and
you keep the subject the more
consistency consistent possible so
that's it that was my little tips and
tricks and experience about being a
leader in a shiny new technology you
want to keep in touch these are my
twitter handle and these are the account
and i guess we have plenty of time for
for questions thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
