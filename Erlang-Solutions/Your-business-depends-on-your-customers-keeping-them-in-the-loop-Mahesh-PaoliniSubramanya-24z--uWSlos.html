about the customers and this one's going
to be a really brief swing through why
well why interacting with customers is a
good thing for most of us that make
money off of customers and basically
achill ëwhat Erlang has to do with that
what kind of sorta it's not really an
erlang based thing but airline kind of
helps so the point being from a
remarkably obvious and remarkably stupid
perspective it is about the customers
they're the ones that pay our bills so
well there you go that's ludicrously
revelatory isn't it it's like wow check
it out customers good for us good for
everybody good for the economy but from
a tricky perspective when you get down
to it the key isn't just getting
customers it's once you get your
customers you want to keep them and when
I say customers I actually refer to any
anybody that at the end of the day is
paying your money I mean that's
effectively the point so kind of a
really obvious perspective when we talk
about customers what we always end up
saying is when we talk about customer
communications to be precise what we
think about is the marketing we do to
them or customer support people call us
and we talked to them and so on just
hold the thought we'll get back to that
in just a moment the thing is what we
don't quite realize what most people
don't quite realize is you are always
interacting with your customers it's not
just about customer support it's not
just about marketing or sales or any of
that stuff take your application
whatever it is think about I mean take a
step back I run a hosted pbx company
think phone services company we got our
customer support center we got our sales
guys we got our marketing folks and
frankly they're the ones that interact
with the customers the least because
literally every single time the customer
makes one of our customers makes a phone
call they're interacting with us they
picked up the phone they're using our
system that's a customer interaction
when they log into our application when
they check their mail when they get a
voicemail when anything that they do
that uses our system anything that they
do that uses our system is a customer
interaction and that's one of these
somewhat overlooked things because
frankly when you get down to it and this
is for the pure sales and marketing
perspective every single one of those
interactions is a marketing moment can
just pretend marketing people are good
you know marketing folks are nice some
of it so my best friends are folks in
marketing but anyhow every time they log
on the system it's time to make a phone
call it's a moment that you have an
ability you have a slicing time so to
speak when you have the ability to
market to them anything just the fact
that they were able to make that phone
call is a marketing moment because hey
they're happy they made that phone call
and it worth which frankly is kind of
amazing fear horizon but still I know
there we go sorry verizon people here no
good every customer interaction is a
teachable moment and by the way the
opposite side of teachable is learning
it's a learning moment for you
potentially or for them they picked up
that phone they try to make a phone call
it didn't work it's a learning moment
for them hey does vocalocity guys not to
be trusted he told me they had the most
reliable phone service decide if i don't
know it's a mountain range it's a
learning moment for me wow why did the
system go down that's not good why did
the phone not work that's not good oh
they didn't turn on the phone that's
happened to fine that's a learning
moment customers are stupid that happens
too and my favorite every single
customer interaction is a karmic moment
and let me kind of take a step back on
that see the cookie jar
this is what I call my magic cookie jar
picture this or effectively picture this
you have this big cookie jar it's empty
just by keeping the customer happy by
the customer not complaining about
something cookies magically appear in
the cookie jar you can use those cookies
to keep the to like satisfy the customer
customer complaints about something
you're like hey here have a cookie
customer eats a cookie walks away their
kind of happy for a little while if
nothing happens eventually the cookie
jar becomes full because the customer is
just happy can there's just a certain
amount of happiness that they can have
if you have a disaster something bad
happens oh my god the system goes down
customers really cheesed off you can
basically say here take all the cookies
customer kind of goes away for a little
while they're kind of placated but it
takes them a while to kind of like
refill the jar with cookies that's the
magic cookie jar every single time the
customer interacts with you you have an
ability to either add cookies to the
cookie jar or remove cookies from the
cookie jar they made a phone call it
worked what do you know another cookie
the made a phone call it didn't work all
of a sudden half the cookies are gone
that's what i call karmic moments every
single one of your customer interactions
is a key karmic moment the thing is
every single one of these interactions
counts you know they always talk about
you never get a second chance to make a
first impression that works all the way
down the pipe you never get you know a
14th chance to make a 15th impression
whatever you just don't every single one
of those things every time they pick up
a phone call every time they pick up the
phone to make a phone call games started
all over again the 42nd time they make a
phone call and it doesn't work hey there
cheesed off again and so on that by the
way lesson number one every interaction
counts the thing about communications is
it comes in two kinds when you're
talking when we're talking about
customers
there's what I what I turn reactive
communications which is the customer is
asking you for something Who am I why am
I here what about what am i doing or a
better way to think about it the
customer goes to the computer and says I
want to see my email customer logs into
the thing customer goes to the googles
and says where the pizzerias around here
all of those are reactive when the
customer asks for something the opposite
are reactive proactive that stuff that
you initiate to give you a customer
something slightly different way of
thinking about it it's me I'm sitting by
my I'm standing here all of a sudden my
phone rings that's a proactive
communication from the phone company to
me saying hey there should call for you
that is a customer communication
effectively so kind of to take this step
for their what's a point behind all of
this why do I keep why am I harping
about all of these one harping about
customer communications to quite this
extent the thing is at the end of the
day most of us if not all of us are in
the business of doing something
providing a service whether that service
is a cloud-based service or a game or
whether it's a standalone controller
that does god knows what something
annoying probably whatever that thing is
we are in the business of providing some
kind of service to end users who are
hopefully paying us money for the
service but thing about this is for the
customer should pay us money which feeds
us and helps us go on vacation and stuff
like that we want to keep our customers
happy but the flip side to that is we
also need to be able to build this thing
in the first place and odds are for most
of us or well for some of us either
we're building it from scratch using
your own money we're lynnie building it
from scratch using somebody else's money
or we're building it
part of some project at a company one or
the other there may be other options too
not quite sure what those would be
anyway in all of these situations you
got a bunch of requirements as we talk
as we heard in the keynote earlier today
get these great requirements and we kind
of sit around and say cool we're going
to build things based on these
requirements nice simple easy the
problem is invariably the very first
thing you do is you build a prototype
and you put it out there and building
prototypes as easy building prototypes
is simple the problem building
prototypes is they're almost always
invariably and fundamentally nothing to
do with the final thing that you're
putting out there it's just not going to
be the same so think about your classic
prototype whatever it is I don't care
you got a bunch of assumptions your
assumptions are wrong it doesn't matter
what they are they're wrong in fact the
one thing I can guarantee you is about
99% of all your assumptions are going to
be flawed that's okay you can like fix
those as you go along but the thing is
if you like fool yourself into thinking
that your architecture your glorious
architecture that you are building out
to you know whatever to do your thing is
going to be the bee solution for what
you want to do you're screwed that's not
going to happen for two reasons one is
remember your assumptions are flawed so
your great great grand and glorious
architecture is going to be wrong anyhow
and two and much more importantly your
prototype doesn't use that architecture
your prototype is something that you
kind of threw together over weekend or
heck over like to two weeks or three
weeks whatever or god forbid you I don't
have any committee and you put together
the prototype either way it's a
prototype you put it together it does
things differently from the way you
wanted to actually do whatever it is you
want to do think about it to bring this
back to the customers customer
communication perspective think about
all the ways your prototype will be
interacting with
the end user pretend there's no or
allowing stuff going on pretend this is
the way most people in the world are
doing things Ruby no jeaious god forbid
but something what else pearl oh yeah
pearl lots of pearl easy to do stuff in
Python and Perl in Ruby in PHP and God
knows what else you slam it out there
coffeescript or there's not a great one
that should not exist but it does you
put together services you put together
domain objects there's some database
sitting down there my sequel maybe it's
a my single cluster because you really
really know what you're doing maybe it's
postgres and you decided to do triggers
really i mean people still do triggers
or shock but it turns out they do cg is
because hey come on it's easy to do cgi
oh you're really good an HTTP rest api
any other point in all of this is you
put these things in and you kind of sort
of vaguely know that it's going to scale
it somehow somewhere but you don't care
because you just want it to work so they
can show it to mr. money bags and get
your money or show to your boss and say
hey look it's working and boss says
great now make it work for you know 100
million people and ultrasone you're
screwed but that comes later prom with
all of this is every single thing that
you build is going to evolve as patch
wear a patch where patch where basically
is for those of you they're not aware
this patch where is the system that you
built that basically evolved using duct
tape and baling wire which is what every
single one of us basically everything
that we ever build this patch where but
there's different categories of patch
where so what happens the scaffolding
think the infrastructure associated with
that which you are building your
scaffolding is fundamentally you know
this is kind of I'm getting very
religious I guess at this point but your
scat scaffolding is flawed you read this
great article on Ruby on Rails and you
said woohoo this is the way everything
should work because somebody else said
Ruby and rails scales so he built it
well it doesn't but that's a separate
story all together or maybe it does
scale but it doesn't scale the way you
want it to scale or god forbid and this
in some ways the worst part of all you
built your application you build your
system you put it up there and it worked
for the five thousand users users that
you expect it to get and that is good
and life was great and about a month
later you now at 7,000 and about three
months later he had 10,000 about a month
after that you got another thousand and
you're slowly adding users and all of a
sudden your database is just sucking so
you look around and somebody says shard
the database so you shard the database
and boom you're good for another 10,000
users and six months and now you got
performance problems because your big
honkin ejb apache tomcat whatever front
end is sucking so then somebody says put
a load balancer and replicate this out
there and do something else with JVMs
and that works any good for another
10,000 users you get the point
degradation thing systems degrade slowly
they don't degrade overnight or maybe a
lucky and all of a sudden you got like
50 million users in your system in which
case you're also unlucky because you
know just degraded like that but nine
times out of ten they degrade slowly so
invariably what you end up with us what
I call to face design or two plus phase
design which is you built the thing to
demo whatever it is that you wanted a
demo you got a bunch of customers your
customers were happy then all of a
sudden the degradation kind of kicked in
say kind of sit back look at the whole
thing it's a great and when we architect
this whole thing from scratch say we
architected completely based on all the
stuff you've learned and now you know
you know hey I got this right it's going
to work properly now and about a year
later Yuri architected again and this
time you actually get it right so that's
a two plus part and that's just the way
this is the world works and the problem
which to recap what you always always
discover is that you didn't understand
your own problem you just didn't you
thought you did but
you didn't you really didn't understand
your tool set now this one's a bit of a
tricky one java people well I assume
somewhere most of you have dealt with
java at some point to the other it's
great it's fun Joe you know what people
raglan java i got nothing in java it's
just a language fine the JVM now that is
evil I mean that is evil personified but
people don't think about the JVM you
know people only start thinking about
the JVM and all of a sudden they
realized they got to deal with all those
flags dash XM 256 meg whatever you know
what's a heap what's this what's that oh
great garbage garbage collection oh
garbage collection issues that you have
to deal with that you're just not aware
of when you're writing because as far as
you're concerned it's a language you
compile it you run it and boom it works
and then so many points out it's running
this thing think all the JVM which is
God's greatest gift to mankind and you
think wow that's great too all right I
it just runs anywhere so on sister JVM
there and then somebody points out that
you know JVMs have their own issues and
there's memory and there's this thing
called garbage collection and you say
what wait a minute garbage collection
just happens automatically and they go
well kinda sorta and things get locked
and things happen and when there's
garbage collection going on all of a
sudden your UI slows down and this
happens and you're sitting there going
they never talked me into this stuff or
when they're talking about this stuff i
was sleeping because i thought it's a
language whatever so when the point
behind this being your tool sets are
actually your own worst enemy it's if
you can to take a whole bunch of steps
back and this is more from pure coding
perspective you can if you can't just
look at the code for how the system
actually does what it's supposed to do
and most importantly understand what
it's doing just
leave it right there and walk away or
ask for another zero on your paycheck
because you know one of those two is
necessary you can it's not going to work
otherwise and the last part it's not
going to scale the way you thought it
was because it just isn't it's not going
to scale the way you thought I'll leave
it at that the tricky part about all of
this back to customer back to customers
interacting with your system and I'll
put it more as api's now your users will
find more ways of screwing you up then
you can possibly imagine that's
guaranteed I mean Pierce a quick one
this is something that happened to us
this is kind of like a passive approach
to screwing us up about a couple of
months ago due to no fault of ours
entirely our entire cloud-based to
distributed to fail infrastructure crash
well the reason it crashes because our
data center provider basically pulled
the plug on it a whole bunch of cages
and all of our servers went down fine
whatever forget the blame part so hey
we're down what do you do you start up
your system right wrong the last time we
did a cold start was not that long ago
it is Christmas morning at 2am this is a
cold started the entire system easy to
am Christmas morning everybody's asleep
or you know dreaming a presence or
looking at instructions saying some
assembly required or something like that
but at two p.m. on a wednesday afternoon
you're basically looking at everybody
every single one of our customers online
at the same time so when we went down we
started bringing our system up all of a
sudden every single one of those
customers try to like you to make a
phone call log in or do something in
real time so the first node to come up
promptly crash into the load so
all these great routines and we got all
these system startup procedures nothing
worked we had to like hack our way
through the whole process in fact
something this is totally on a tangent
something I can guarantee you Adam this
is for you your cold start routines will
not work but that serious note though at
their ago things happen that you don't
expect cold starting massive distributed
fault tolerant thingies when was the
last time you did it really and much
more importantly what is the order of
magnitude of users you're looking at
back then are all our routines were
based upon about two maybe three orders
of magnitude less interactions in the
system when anything scales by three
orders of magnitude all the rules go out
the window not just and to bring this
back to customers not just because users
are just doing things a thousand times
more frequently it's because you got
different types of users doing different
types of things that you didn't expect
remember what I said they'll find ways
to do things that you didn't expect
users are the bane of my existence i
bind you they're also good but they pay
us money but there you go so to bring
this full circle what's a point behind
all of this about 45 years ago five
years ago may four years ago whatever
not important our entire application
base was this big huge honking Java ejb
whatever thing and it basically worked
except about a hundred ten percent of
our entire developer base and system
base and management base and everything
was devoted to just keeping our systems
up and running we had Zippo zero ability
to do anything new because
you know total development budget
equaled maintenance budget on systems
and that was it so about well four or
five years ago we kind of SAT back and
said let's redo this from scratch and
this is story for a separate
presentation but we just read basically
threw everything out the window and did
a from scratch we architect the whole
thing in our Lango TP blah blah blah
blah blah and I've got a lot better part
of the context behind this is to fast
forward a couple of slides here part of
the context here is what you need to ask
yourself is where do you want to be
spending your time when you're doing
anything do you want to spend your time
working on scaffolding do you want to
spend your time working on just keeping
your system up and running which is a
noble endeavor by the way you know a
system that's up is better than a system
that's not up but if one hundred percent
of your time is spent on keeping your
system up that other company over there
that's busy spending their time trying
to figure out what customers want and
how to keep the customers happy they're
gonna eat some metaphor like eat your
shirt or eat your lunch or take your
shirt or whatever basically your host so
the thing about using and this is a lot
of preaching to the choir here but the
thing about using Erlang OTP etc etc for
whatever you need to do for your system
for your environment is if you are in a
scaling environment if you're in an
environment where you expect to grow by
a couple orders of magnitude or more if
you are in an environment where you need
you actually care about soft real-time
systems will you actually care about
fault tolerance and so on and so forth
if you build it with OTP behaviors if
you build it in Erlang it takes care of
these things for you yeah yeah we know
that we we all know that
that's not the point I need to emphasize
this it takes care of this stuff for you
which means you don't need to worry
about the stuff you just don't with the
extremely ridiculously rare scenario in
which you actually find a bug let's
pretend you do except for that it just
works so what you end up spending all of
your time on is the magic word customers
so all of a sudden your big honking
distributed system it's just kind of
taking along now what you can do is kind
of step back talk ask yourself hey what
customers want how can I help them how
can I do things for them so this is kind
of like a long long winded way of kind
of getting back to the point which is
the four lessons that I brought up here
earlier every single thing you do every
single thing your customer does every
one of these interactions reflects on
you and reflects on your ability to get
revenue from your customers every single
one of those things every interaction
counts these interactions just get
harder and harder the more the more you
scale that gorgeous CGI you wrote that
goes in and hits a database and that's a
table scan to throw a bunch of data up
on the screen works great as long as
you're the only customer absolutely does
not work when you got 5,000 people doing
it simultaneously step further as you
scale as you grow you will be spending
more and more time just keeping your
system up and running what you need to
ask yourself is what percentage of time
are you willing to devote to that much
more importantly what percentage of you
know pain and suffering annoyance in
your mind and money that you have in
your budget are you willing to devote to
this the combination of those two
basically takes you to the last part
which is
if you're smart use something that takes
here that for you and spend your time
working with your customers and that's
all I got folks oh no no the first
version was Java horrible horrid we have
our old environments sitting around it's
got about sixty percent of our clients
on it because the one foot okay this is
kind of evil but we've got a pretty
sorry it is evil we've got a whole bunch
of clients who seem to be quite happy
not getting anything new now they'll
turn out eventually because they're
going to sit there going wait a minute
this is I can get the coffee grinder
attachment if I go over there you just
give me phone calls you know I prefer
coffee with my phone calls great that
works but what we also discovered is
most of those people they churn out back
to us and on a non evil perspective we
actually kind of did a pretty heavy
survey of our own clients and the people
that we have on our old system are
people that literally just are doing
phone calls they're not doing anything
else our new system there's all these
fancy whiz-bang things with gooeys and
displays and notifications and the
coffee grinder attachment people that
want that come to us people that don't
want that are perfectly happy sitting
out there but we have zero people
dedicated to it we actually don't have
any developers remaining that worked on
that stuff the only person that knows
anything about how that works is me
which is frightening I mean like
unsurprisingly frightening so they're go
it's so this kind of goes back to the
you didn't know what you were doing and
so on our first system was patch we're
at two levels it is patch we're in a
physical the way the application evolved
perspective but it is also patch we're
in a business rule perspective here's a
beautiful example this system evolved
from the mid 90s this big hosted pbx
thingy so one of the features that we
put in was the ability where as you are
if you're not on a phone call and you
want to say record this call you could
hit the pound key on your phone and it
would play a little menu saying if you
want to transfer this call press 1 if
you want to record the call press two
blah blah blah sounds like a great idea
it is brilliant people loved it except
what happens when you call into like a
bank and you're going through their
automated menu system and it says tap in
your social security number followed by
the pound key right all of a sudden that
didn't work so patch where where's patch
we're coming to this easy solution you
now have to press pound pound for
anything to happen which you think would
work except it turns out that a lot of
banks actually have pass-throughs where
they intercept the first pound key and
pass the second pound key to somebody
further down the pipe so it's just like
bad karma whatever you do it's going to
fail along those lines so we wised up
when we discover that nobody uses a star
key everybody uses the pound key hence
the new version of the system moves from
pound pound to star start but that
cheese's off the people that are used to
the old system and we're back to what
you're describing but on a related note
to that though one okay this is I call
this a rule of three
which is the third time you ever touch a
piece of code we write that code that's
kind of like my default rule of thumb
for anything the flip side to that is
the third time you ever encounter a
screw screwed up business rule change it
so there are a couple of things actually
there's a whole bunch of things in the
old system which were patch where that
we effectively just mute and put in
something drastically different the
problem is remember all the people that
I mentioned who just used the old system
for phone calls most of them are people
that are not happy doing anything that
other than thinks the old way take this
a step back years ago years and years
ago I had an admin this was God in 1986
my admin was this woman Betty god bless
her who had this very unique filing
mechanism and the filing mechanism was
every single file on her computer was a
numerical and an auto incrementing
number basically and she is at something
like sixty seven thousand 352 or
whatever and she knew oh you mean the
letter that we sent to the Vice
Chancellor that was in the thousands let
me go look at that now the number and
she'd figure out which one was which the
problem here being that made complete
sense to her because she knew what she
roughly knew the timeframes and numbers
yeah the thousands were three years ago
the 60 we they had like about 30,000
letters last year so I know you know
stuff like that doesn't make sense to
anybody else in the world so a lot of
the really idiotic things that we have
in the old version of our system is
unfortunately stuff with trained our
users into using so they like using
things which are stupid because we told
them in a smart because we have tactical
marketing woohoo whatever
so that's the other side of what you
just described which is it's not just
that user should dumb we make our users
dumb we all do thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
