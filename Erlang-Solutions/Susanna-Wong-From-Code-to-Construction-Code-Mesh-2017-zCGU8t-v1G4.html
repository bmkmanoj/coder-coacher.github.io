like to do a small survey so how many of
you in the room are developers
programmers almost everyone how many of
you would think or consider yourself
also a designer okay I love you and how
many of you would consider yourself to
be both developers and designer okay so
and the main reason I'm asking is
because in my talk is actually exactly
the one exactly the last cover scene I'm
trying to use a developer perspective to
approach design problems but at the same
time you still kind of need the design
mindset to fully understand your problem
so I'm going to go to to go deeper into
two examples I mentioned about the V&amp;amp;A
museum project in my description but
unfortunately I decided to go deeper
into two projects rather than you know
talking more but if you're interested
you can you know come talk to me or or
maybe like you know maybe next year so
so a little bit about myself I did my
undergrad at the University of Virginia
and I did engineering so it's a very
traditional school with a very good
curriculum but also very widget
curriculum and and afterwards I went to
become a Java developer in Silicon
Valley but at one of the biggest a
software company and si P so you can
kind of imagine why I was like oh my
life is meant to be more creative and I
just there's just no role model about me
that can do kind of creative programming
so I decided to trade that off for a
creative life so I enrolled in the
school in a school in London called the
AAA school of architecture so it's a
very specific school and it's one of my
personally think it's a hidden gem and I
highly encourage anyone who wants you
know who is considering a change of
career to you know look into this
culture because well some of the best
architects they do not come
traditional background as an architect
they all come from different fields and
that's how you know you make great
things and so they one of the pioneers
in proposing parametric design and which
is heavily using computational tools in
architecture so I was very lucky I came
out with a very good time I
I had it told me how to adapt to the
design thinking as well and and
afterwards I actually went on to become
a facade consultant in in Arab in Hong
Kong and then later on I became an
architect and the one of my favorite
architects in Tokyo it's called a guy
called Kengo kuma so so and so today I'm
going to share with you two projects I
did because my background is still very
different from the traditional
architects so pretty much what I'm
trying to use a developer's viewpoint
how you know we you know we train we're
problem-solving to apply to solve design
problems everything I did here is very
freestyle there's no you know like no
school of thought or anything like that
it's pretty much like you know you have
a problem I'm just thinking you know how
can you script into solve it so you ask
why why do we need scripting in
architecture so of course there's many
many different use cases but I would
just genuinely say there's normally it's
one of these reasons so first we've
design so the human mind is very limited
in that imagination but the main thing
with parametric design is that you've
you identified certain parameters for
example this this is a beautiful project
by the way it's done by some a students
in designing a pavillion and so if you
want to identify like and I say the gap
you know is the work of the gap is in a
parameter and you this whole form let's
say it's generated by scripts then it
can generate if you vary the parameters
they can generate forms that it's beyond
how do you think and of course like you
know most of the times it's not a
pleasant surprise but you know you have
very amazing forms that's generated
through parametric design and then so
listen you have a beautiful form how do
you make about constructing it you have
to like you know put it down into small
pieces to construct
and so that's a process what we call
penalisation how we you don't just go
around okay let's see if you have a cake
how do you cut it you know that you can
optimize so that you know you have the
same area for each piece and so on so
it's actually it's always a very
interesting problem to solve and of
course you you need to extract all the
data so you're not talking about you
know a few pieces but you were talking
about thousands and thousands of panels
you might have to measure all the angles
and so on up to very exact millimeters
so you need to have scripting to extract
all the data and budget so you know
within the real world money drives
everything so if the kind say oh yeah I
love this design but I just don't have
the money to to implement it so you have
to go back and be like okay I would
change my design you know tried to meet
a budget so that that's all the boy
sounded all these four reasons
so within architects nowadays don't
design in 2d plans so we know mostly
work work with 3d software and the most
common software we use is rhinoceros so
rhinoceros is a NURBS modeling software
I was playing go a bit into you know the
basic concept of what NURBS modeling is
but and the scripting tool that I use is
a library within the rhinoceros software
called Rhino script it's basically
written in Visual Basic and everything
once within the software so there's no
dependencies when you open once you open
the editor everything's set up for you
so you know now I'm a software developer
but now when you go into you know doing
frameworks you have you know this and
this and all those dependencies that
will take your aegis so you know you
just dive deep straight into the logic
which is the best part of it everything
is synchronous so everything is very
logical to and so architects I am
nowadays because a lot of architects are
also trying to do this but of course
they don't have the programming training
and they're very visual people so they
there is something like a kind of a
visual programming where you start up
functions they have all these what they
call batteries are actually functions
and that's how you pass the data you
know you pass a through
wise it's very interesting and you get
all the data through the rise but but I
would not advocate anyone to that do
that because you can have situations
like this where you know and this is
talk about a very simple script like you
know maybe talking about like you know
less than 100 line of code because you
can't really iterate things within their
special programming and if you want to
do it you still have to write script
within the battery so I always say to
the architects that you know if you can
drive a car why you know why would you
ride a bike
so yeah I'll just encourage anyone or
even architects to learn programming
it's you know essential for how we think
nowadays in this world so knows modeling
so different software have different
theory behind not only I wouldn't go too
much engine in a math because I don't
know I just know that everything within
Rhino is formed by services services are
formed by ISO crepes which what you see
all these curves either curves are
formed by points and and all these
points so so all these points are
controlled and what we call like you
know control points so if you would
modify the control points it will modify
the service so if you the most
fundamental concept is points iso curves
services that's how everything is
constructed in rhino and a little bit
about the datatypes within this software
and this freedom modeling library so the
I would say the beauty of this is that
it's actually very fun that when you
program you actually see it's not like
you know you program all this data and
then you you have yeah so you know if
you if you input a point you know you
construct a service and you see a
service and so on so you see where I met
Lisa it's very fun and so normally how
would you data wise how would you
represent a point so it's the XYZ axis
so it will be represented so I as an
array of three double data types and the
second type is an align so a line is
represented as a string but if you have
a line input you will be able to extract
the start point and the end
and you'll be able to obtain and the
middle point which is there or they will
give you back an array of points and
then for a service service is also
represented as a string in like in the
Rhino software but then basically with a
service string you can you'll be able to
obtain all the ISO curves from that and
you're also able to up from the icicles
you were able to obtain all the points
it's on the service so it's basically
you know you input a string you get all
these like wonderful things that come
back
it's very still amazes me to this day so
a little bit about the common functions
in the library so for example like
extrude curve what would you think about
extrude curve would give you well if you
have a curve you extrude it it gives you
a service so that's how you construct
services so you need to input a string
which is which is a curve you have then
extrude curve and then it will give you
a service as that which is another
string as an output and for example the
curve service intersection so what do
you think what would this class give you
a curve and then there is a service and
it intersect it will give you the
intersection point and then oh if it's
overlapping on the service site it will
give you a the period of overlapping
which is the start point and end point
of the overlapping period so this
library will give you all this this
two-dimensional array of things that
will you know you can obtain the event
type which is point or overlap or and
then from the different you know array
output of that way it will give you you
know the intersection point and so on so
from then on it's like a you know you
can go on to take the point to construct
what you need to do further it's pretty
much like a visual puzzle and split
curve you know how you want to split
curve so we of course it's some of this
something we've never sma'da lling so if
you have a curve you know a TP of course
it's like a lot of like points along the
curve that because you're not talking
about straight line be talking about
curve and then in Rhino the curve is 0
to 1 and within if you want an exact
point on that curve what they call is a
curve parameter
so it's like a fraction so you know if
you want three out of 64 is certain
point and so on so it's unique to each
curve and you if you and if you want to
split the curve at a certain point you
need to import the curve and you need to
input the parameter and then it will
give you in a way of to split that curve
but then the first let's say if you have
a curve like this you want to split at
this point then it will return you in a
way of two strings which the first
string is the first little path and the
second half and how would you know
whether it's this part being the first
element in their way and this is a
second and that relies on the curved
direction so it's very fun right you
know you have to know have this kind of
basic understanding of geometry but
after you have this you know you can you
know pretty much all I can drive your
car all the way down to China a very
interesting architecture so now I'm
going to actually talk about how I'm
using this library to solve all the you
know there's all the potential problems
in architecture by the way disclaimer
everything here is very freestyle like
you know they like you know there was no
school of thought that I followed or no
mathematical model I just saw a problem
I'm like ok why don't I just try to use
this library to solve this so this
problem and this project was done about
five or six years ago
I shall not yeah so so it's it was one
of my first projects that I used my new
scripting to solve and and it was done
during my time as a facade consultant so
the room for that consultant is
different as in like you know it's like
you know you are an IT consultant but
you're not the person who's designing
the system so it's very much like that
no the architect has all these design
restrictions they give it to me and then
I try to kind of help them solve a
problem so the biggest problem is they
have this beautiful scheme where they
have a podium which is a shopping mall
and then they have this amazing tower
and all of them are what we call like
double curve services and they have
designed a very clever system to try to
clad the entire system with a flat panel
glass and they're all of the same size
and in between the glass they have all
these like aluminum panels to kind of
eat in the change in their geometry but
of that comes to the next problem is
budget so all these panels are all
different sizes and all the biggest cost
of architecture is labor costs the
material aluminum panel is not too
expensive but in order to have each
person catering to cut the different
sizes it's extremely expensive so that
we are trying to limit the amount of
types of aluminum panels
so our first Center and counter this
problem by identifying that in two
different zones so someone someone is
the queen area so someone is more
simpler because what we caught this is
what we call a single curve service so
if you if you extract the iso curve
along this direction each curve is has
the same curvature yeah they're they're
identical but shown to is the corners
and that's the biggest problem the
biggest problem is because so it's a
double curve service I think that if you
extract the iso curves at different
points along the service it gives you a
different line with a different
curvature so but even for this for that
pattern if you if you have eight motors
on the top you have to have eight
modules in the middle but you have to
fit that with a curve of a different
curvature different lengths but we tried
see an optimize the amount of panels so
that becomes a very interesting design
enzyme problem and then so this is the
system that the architect gave us so
don't ask me why is like about 1200 and
1.4 - so it should be 1200 but they gave
us that number but anyways we're trying
to that's the that's the glass size and
we're trying to use the same graph
across the entire service so we have
here we will so you see all the
triangular panes are aluminum panels and
those are the those are the ones that
are causing the problems that have
different sizes and so on and so we have
identified two types so there's the
yellow type is the one where we have we
were aligned according to the same
alignment as the glass and then the
the booth hub is the one where we will
kind of like you know shift it into kind
of fit the global curvature so we kind
of identified that facade system and
then this is how it will propagate in 2d
2d wise so you know how when you start
from one end to the other end you go it
will you know lets you kind of fit that
puzzle it will go slightly slanted and
then so in the bottom for the bottom oh
and by the time it goes up to the first
of all the taco would have shifted by
nine modules so it's just kind of
identifying the relationship and within
that you kind of have to fill in modules
to fit in with the corner piece so this
is some problem how we identify that the
best way to tackle this is to kind of go
back and revisit the design process to
find a way to generate the panels from
you know to make a script to generate
the panels from the ground up give me
control certain parameters to do
construct all these panels so you have a
flat service you have all the floor
slabs how will you go about like putting
that pattern into that service so I
decided to try to use of course there's
many many ways to a problem you can use
some people were suggesting to use
vectors you can you know try to get a
service to do a grid system that kind of
stuff so I was just like you know you
know I was just like think why don't we
just do it simply I would just use guide
rails because we've we have the service
you can extract the ISO craft and then
if you extract the ISO curves that
relates to the relative you break down
the component into certain key points
and it's like you know as a kid when we
were connecting the dots in a coloring
book to form shapes it's pretty much the
same idea you just extract all the
essential different guidelines they're
all straight lines and then we will they
will refer to the level of the point of
the module and then you just simply from
then on just simply divide there the
curve according to your required length
and then you just connect the dots and
then you will form the panel and the
panel will be aligned according to the
service
so this is the script for for the for
the strategy so first you produce all
the guidelines and all these guidelines
it's very simply you can extract it from
the Rhino library you input you input
the full lines which is given by there
to you by the architect and you input
the reference service and then from the
on the scripts you can go through it to
extract all the guidelines it's written
in the function within the Rhino script
library and then from then on you have
one serve all the guidelines you can
start like you know introducing
different module size you know if I want
it has like then time module talk we're
talking about glass in the panel maybe I
want to try a family mmm with for the
panel then I can of course and that may
be then long the entire link there would
be 15 modules if I want to try 14
modules or 13 modules I can vary that
and see the effect because you know
architects they like to see like how it
looks differently and then and then from
all that you can produce all these
points and simply from the points you
can construct their glass services and
all those class service will be aligned
according to the service to the curve
surface and then so we have soft to
someone but sewn to how do you solve
some to its yeah cuz I'm plan everything
is the same so you can just use this
straight guidelines and then you can
just simply divide it by the length
right but we're in the curve cornice
it's a headache because for the top
Isaac after you obtain it's a different
curvature from their lower curve and so
on a long troll and then they are not an
arc so you cannot simply use our
calculations to do it it's basically a
curve with the control points like
irregular control points basically so I
have for this one it's it's basically a
given that like each the length of the
module next to the class will be
different along each row but how do you
know like you know what is the optimal
length for this and that's here I have
kind of identified that that isn't alone
and we need to start with we will have a
variable that we're kind of govern the
first point and that you would test it
to for example if you have some a ratio
of the glasses one
and the panel ratio is 0.3 and you kind
of know you have a you'll fit eight
modules along the way but you don't know
the length of that panel we don't know
that exactly you cannot make it as all
300 it would be 320 something in order
to be optimized so that's actually a
very simple voice onto a very fun and
very straightforward design problem that
can be solved by scripts so that
something that that actually took me a
while to you think about how to do it
because we're in the Rhino library you
can divide a curve by length so you want
to divide a curve by 3 3,000 mm you can
and they will output you you know points
that on the curve that's 3,000 mm from
the last point but we are talking about
straight class so we're not talking
about distance we are talking about
displacement yeah well I call a line
distance and then how do you do it you
can just simply divide the curve so my
idea is that if you can take if you take
the center point of one point of the
curve and you construct a circle and you
get the intersection point between the
circle and the line and because the
distance is the radius well it will be
according to what the link that you want
and so so what our menus for example
like if you were this arc link is not
figured out in not 1200 but then the
aligned distance would be 1200 and
that's where you will fit the glass so
so once so with that's the first iterate
we iteration of the script passing you
construct a circle you obtain this
intersection point and that we become
the center point for the next circle to
obtain the next point for the aluminum
panel and so on so we just continue to
iterators and and of course the link of
the panel is variable that you input in
that's your initial try so you would you
know as a as a designer you'll be like
okay I think you know I wanted to be
eight modules and there will be about so
the ratio will be about 0.3 to one you
fit eight modules and what we would
likely is so you continue to feel this
music method to obtain all the points
and it comes to the million dollar
question literally million of dollars
because it's construction material you
have an edge condition so the edge
condition is like it's will be a gap
because this part from then on it will
be the panels from someone you have
there will be a gap between the panels
that you generate here to this from one
panel and we there is what we call
tolerances in like if the gap is less
than two twenty millimeters you cannot
see it so you can't just you know call
it a day and move on but you can't mind
most of the times it would come to like
you know 180 millimeters or something
and then that's what I call an edge
condition and with this one you will I'm
missing we have 180 mm as the edge
condition and then the screw like okay
so now we need to shift the pan aluminum
panel from 300 mm to 301 mm so we'll do
it by increment of mm and well what I'll
do is if you have eight modules because
it will first determine whether you can
fit eight modules you can fit eight
modules they will tell you to like or go
back and change another number but um if
it can fit eight modules with a edge
condition of 180 mm so you would take
the 180 mm divided by eight and then you
start again like you see the different
points like when I shift the points by
180 divided by 8 mm and then go on but
the thing is that's the thing you would
not you will not exactly propagate the
edge condition because this is the curve
like the align distance is different so
you will keep iterating that until it
meets the tolerance level which is let's
say 10 mm but but the world is not ideal
in there are cases where um you the edge
can amuse let's say your panel is 224 mm
so you can piece by one so 325 right so
maybe before the edge condition is let's
say like 22 mm
and then you belong you need to go back
and we optimized it but if you increase
it by one mmm then maybe it will be
negative us and you will eat into the
next someone panel so there might be
situations where it does not accept Ain
a configuration that would meet the
perfect edge condition and that's when
we were brutally that's up to 200 runs
if it doesn't mean couldn't find a
solution I hope you truly set it to you
know use there are calculation just you
know okay so you know you cannot accept
that all the same well we have the same
length just you know maybe some you
assign some panels according to a
different life and car today
yeah so this is pretty much the layout
of how the iteration of obtaining these
points is and this is our employment
class renderscript
and then after you sum up the points and
then the nick generating the next layer
of points is much more straight for you
can just what we use a function called
curve closest points so it will so just
have a curve here and you have a point
here and you have a relative curve down
here you can just use curve closest
point to obtain the relative relative
point on this other curve and then again
it's after you've obtained all the
points just join the dots and from the
panels and then for this lower level
then you do the same iteration again to
find a perfect configuration and but of
course like because the top layer you
have set it up to be eight modules so
the lower level really will do it with
according to eight modules as well yeah
so this is pretty much the summary of
how the script with one so so you have
the top you the school input is you have
the weapon service you have you have you
define the top ratio of the panel to the
class and that would govern how many
panels there are and it will keep doing
this to find the optimal panel
arrangement for the top and the four
that makes a four links and so on down
from top down so you can see why
everything is synchronous and yeah and
everything is very logical as in
architects do not like you know us as
developer you have the power to be able
to help them break down a problem
that but architects you know they were
just yeah and then afterwards of course
we need to output the data so within the
script Visual Basic I think that's one
of the reasons why the developers chose
to write this library in Visual Basic
because you can simply call the visual
basic functions which they can call an
excel directly and I'll put all the data
in Excel unfortunately because of the
time of this talk I don't have time to
go through all the exact code and how
it's run within the software but within
the next example I'm gonna show you how
it once in line oh so this is a
different exam project that I did
actually this time as an architect so
with the good thing with being an
architect is because before we were
given a lot of restrictions at design
how the module is designed is given by
the architect but ever the target of the
Pierce project is very small I think
that system is one of the best what we
call component based design system I've
ever seen and it gives you a ground to
have all these like you know some
mathematical things to play with that's
what I would think that's a good system
so with this one I am so I work directly
with the architect who designed this
game this is a museum in China
unfortunately the project was kind of on
hold but maybe one day you see it and so
initially the the Kengo kuma once yet he
got this project here like oh i wanted
to make us a museum gallery we have a
spiraling service that's the only
condition he gave and also cut off so he
wants to penalize it we have straight
panels got straight like like what we
call like flat glass panels not doubly
curved panels but this is a spiral
services that double curved service so
here I first like identify like in how
you do this double they spiral service
so you basically have a upper spiral you
have a lowest Bible you have a inner
spiral too far from the and then you see
like these are the or the slabs so the
gallery space in between but this is
more like an architectural I think but
here we were trying to optimize and
find out the relationship how you can
achieve the required service area with
powering service so and the angle of the
in inspire would have could affect what
we caught you have a the area of the of
the geometry but this is not a there's
no coding involved in this but ok so I
have this this service identified then I
start to keep going in and think about
okay so how would you penalize that
service
flat glass panels that's the only
condition and so so you know of course
um you can go in just you know cut tried
what's the best way to try to cut it
first so that's like I start doodling in
my notebook and then I have identified
two ways to cut the service don't you
divide the service one way is you can
alone the spiral you can't divide what's
the the width they're lined with after
class and then you just divide using the
same way that I mentioned in the last
exercise when you construct a circle or
sphere to obtain the intersection point
to get the aligned distance and the
second way is to you have a cutting
plane and then you just take the center
point you rotate it to rotate by same
angle to obtain the divisions but the
thing is I decided the first way is
better because the with the the center
of rotation method to obtain the
division it's actually not much you can
control because it's such a big scale
and the angle that you can rotate is
well if you want a little bit you
already like you know making divisions
that's beyond the fabrication limit so
that's why you chose the first method so
with the first method you are able to
obtain all those points and again it's
all about connecting the dots in this
exercise so now you can go into the
individual panel and see like how we
will construct the panel so we want them
to be glass service right so if you look
at this problem so if you were to just
obtain simply obtain the points it would
be a doubly curved glass service so
they're all in order to make it flat you
have to take point one and point three
take that line and copy it to point
- but if you do that then it will create
this kind of what we call like offset
from the upper spiral but that's the
beauty of why as an architect it's so as
an architect you are able to design a
system and then that kind of drives me -
okay then in that case if you have an
offset part why do I just put wooden
glass paint and concealer and then in
the end in any in fact if you were to
copy that
will become like a turbine shape or like
a fan shape thing and they kind of
became that design era tip so so when
for example when you know I mean
Chemical Mikula sound like he goes on to
be like oh this galleries you know
trying to represent the Chinese culture
if the Chinese fan but you know it's
basically just to like solve a design
problem but that's you know yeah and so
yeah so this this forms a basic system
of the facade and from then on you can I
can start to construct the script to
generate this so I go in to be of course
I cannot this is just very plain if you
just copy it and have this turbine of
course so you try to introduce small
interesting design features so I again I
also went back to the the notebook and
such you like final what are the
parameters I can vary to make it more
interesting and then so one so if you
recall like you know here I have chosen
the method of method one I can like so
in this case the variable I can an input
is actually the width top way from the
bottom here so I can decide to control
how my geometry would work so here I was
just thinking like we would be so quite
cool if you're walking along the spiral
and the distances between nickel from
like why the glass to us
tighter glass and back to why the glass
again so I like how you see like you go
from a tighter with to maximum way from
back to minimum ribbon so on a separate
parameter it'll be quite fun so okay
this time I'm going deeper into the code
it's a wealth of these simple code so
we're in the visual basic you have to
design the user inputs
well you can't generate something from
nothing so you still need to input
something and so you need to define what
variable called intensity intensity is
basically controls how drastic this
change would be and then there's the or
I call it t detector basically it
detects which so an increasing zone or
decreasing zone and so on and you have
to define what's smallest wave the
biggest wave and then you have to input
all the spirals to up generate all the
points yeah and then and then you define
the center point of the of this cutting
sphere to obtain the intersection point
and then you have also have to define
what's the width of the so let's say
it's the first pylon within the
increasing section what would the width
B and then the next panel next panel and
so on so the river is governed by the
intensity and then you also save the
data for outputting to excel and then
you would construct the first thing like
okay we use the sphere not a circle
because the curve is not a plane but
it's a it's it's spiraling up so you
need a sphere you know let's obtain the
intersection point and then you obtain
so let's say you start with the lower
spiral you obtain the first next point
and then you need to obtain the relative
point on the upper spiral and then you
can start the biggest fear to obtain the
intersection point and then you
construct class service and you make the
panels and fins and then you put the
data so okay you know talking let's see
how the script will run in action and
then so first like when you want to run
the scripts so you need to call the edit
script and a script editor and then you
start running the script so you need to
input all the variables that we have
defined so my I'll set the intensity to
be 50 and then you have to that's when
you enter like an all the minimum glass
with the maximum so you can kind of
control it in terms of fabrication wise
and then you also control how that
slanted length would be it's 15 meters
so yeah it's crazy big piece of glass
maybe that's why they took the project
on hold I don't know yeah
and then then the script we start
constructing all these like spheres to
obtain all the intersection points it's
really fun right because you know well
you program you can actually see in
action so yeah and it's such a very
soothing after you've programmed and
then you just watch the ball you know
and then yeah and they will start
constructing the glass panels and and of
course like you know here because the
viewpoint needs to be constructed Rama
tree so it's slower but you know if you
minimize this it doesn't need to be
constructing in front of you then you
know this process is talking you're
talking about like seconds know
milliseconds so you get this within one
second yeah but yeah but there's nothing
better than senior code you know come in
action so yeah and yeah so you see you
see the others like other points is like
being concealed by the by the aluminum
thin the decorative thing and as you
which the the end of the arm is
spiraling service then it will actually
output all the data you'll call excel
directly and I'll put all your data
according to like yeah basically all the
data that's one within the script so
that's this is it and this is like kind
of defining yourself that you get you
know gradual like songs that you go
through an increasing zone decreasing so
name-clearing zone and so on and in
since the intensity is a variable that
you can change within the scripts so you
can of course the the in fact is not
that that different but by you can't has
different intensity as to how it will
look in general in the foam and you can
also analyze the data to see which
configuration has the best we allow you
to produce the best cost yeah and then
of course like we're talking about 15
meter long glass like you know the
biggest biggest class that's everything
this world is 18 meters then that's
Apple Store in I think it was the Apple
store in Hong Kong and of course our
client is not Apple so they don't have
that budget
so they yeah so we all have to like in
order to think about like you know
breaking the panel down and and what
comes as a you know obstructional to the
design actually it's something that you
turns out to be something that you can
play with you know I thought go back to
my notebook and then start like thinking
about Oh what are the best placement of
what we call this break point for the
glass what we this is something we call
transom so what's the best way of how we
put the transom and then and with
because we have a script as a basis we
can just you know I can just write a new
class to construct all these different
like places where you can put the
transom and can produce all these things
can be generated you know just by
varying putting a different variable and
within the script we 115 seconds but
imagine like modeling this for an
architect because everything that every
piece of glass you have to measure it
and model according to that exactly as I
mentioned this will take an architect
talking about like weeks days if not
months to generate different effects so
this will actually really affect and
even for them a lot of them the human
mind we cannot imagine things to be a
certain way you only know when you
generate the script so this is such a
very new and interesting design tool
then that will die only as that is there
in the hands of the power of the
developer so we are very powerful not
just within the development world and
here this is a little bit more than
architectural design part but for
example like before we when we copy the
point we would cop it to the bone of the
lower spiral but if we can copy it
according to the top line and then it
will produce a different atmosphere
within there there's the building yeah
but so we can identify the different
cases again and that we're just you know
you trick a little bit in the script and
then you will be able to generate the
different effects of it this is again to
showcase the different effects of it by
the way my presentation is very visual
because before I was presenting to
architects so that's why you kind of
have to diagram everything to kind of
show officially how it works and but so
this is a very powerful library but
there is also a very lot of limitations
to it because technically this is they
design this library for hobbyists so
there's nothing they have no idea of
like States and so on within the within
the program so my state's us in like so
let's say if I were to run the script
and I have well until I generate all the
points and I have a bug in a code or
there's unclean geometry and then so but
let's say after a puts other points it
will have like 133 points at 132 points
generated and so from then unless your
script breaks from there and then you
have to go in you have to check why it
breaks and you have the one the script
from scratch again within the black box
of Rhino it lost all the data once you
terminate the script so you even but if
you this is a relatively simple project
but if you're talking about like if you
have to make like 10 28 of these
services so that means like you know you
lost all your data and you have to rerun
it from the beginning so it would be
great if they can actually have
something that you know terminated here
you can save the state and then we can
start the script from from that own and
also there's no testing framework so how
do you test it so when you test this you
just pretty much run the script it
breaks you check the data as to why it
breaks and you run it again and or if it
doesn't look right in the mall you know
it doesn't you know so no testing
framework no snapshot testing yeah so
that's what causes a lot of late nights
and okay so I'm not an architect now
okay so how I see it can be applied to a
lot of like application outside of
architecture so this is something that
I've actually always envisioned since my
master students so this way how
architecture is not it cannot affect me
just visually but I can really affect
you your daily operations in a building
so my master's thesis is to propose a
solution to solve the congested
underground stations one of this the
main problem of causing congestion
pretty much your ticket gates whatever
if we can eliminate the ticket gates we
can because we have a random reality and
if we combine it with senses then we can
kind of detect where the people has paid
or not if once they pass a pay zone and
so on so this is one of the reasons why
I'm going back to the development world
and this is one thing that we can use
this kind of mindset of doing is really
programming into software development
yeah this is just some clean scenarios
that I did before that we can propose us
an architect and so yeah this is it so
I'm not a software developer so but I
have a few other projects that I did
before if you're interested you can like
ping me on Twitter I'm not very often on
Twitter but now I'm back in the
development world I have to be on back
on Twitter so so that's it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
