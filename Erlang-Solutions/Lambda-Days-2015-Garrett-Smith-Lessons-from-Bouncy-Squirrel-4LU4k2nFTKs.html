at this point because I don't know I was
going into this with popularity so I'd
probably didn't need the squirrel here
it's kind of overreaching so welcome to
lambda days 2015 second edition like
doubled the size amazing really amazing
program so I'm really an honor to be
able to open this up so I want to
introduce to you a little bit of fun and
a little bit of craziness so you guys
ready for that is it too early you will
leave for fun and craziness you're good
good okay good so I want you to say
hello to balance II school say hi I'll
just go it's just a picture you'd think
I mean with webcam today you think he's
going to say hi back but this is just a
still image so bounty squirrel is a
creation of my son's Elliot this is
Ellie these ten say hi to Elliot it's
just a picture can't say hi back so
Elliot um Elliot's into programming I'm
happy to say and he likes Minecraft and
he likes Python and one morning he
called me down it's actually preparing
for this talk completely different topic
and he called me down here said dad
check this thing out I've been working
with his programming language called
scratch and I've got this program here
there's a scratch say hi to scratch it's
just a programming languages it's not
good so he said dad check this out got
this this squirrel and he balances
around the screen and so sure enough the
squirrel bounced around the screen and I
said that's great you know I'm going to
get back to preparing for my talk of
this conference and he said hang on a
second hang on hang on and he did a
little change and then the squirrel
started to change colors like a rainbow
it just started to oscillate back and
forth and he'd SAT back and laughed and
laughed and I said yeah that's pretty
funny and and and he said this he said I
can watch the squirrel bounce around for
hours and it was one of those like pure
kids statements that's just pure joy
pure satisfaction and I knew at that
moment that we were sharing that the
programmer moment I remember when I was
his age and I was actually programming a
similar thing with sprites on a converse
before I don't know if I said I could
watch this in a little box balance
around for hours but it was the same
thinking it was the same feeling and it
was it was it struck me as this father
and son moment that that that were being
us together and I said what the heck is
this language scratch so I took a look
at this thing what is this language that
attracts a ten-year-old without any kind
of training or no formal education and
programming and I was a little bit
concerned because when I started to look
at this thing this is this is a picture
of scratch it's a visual programming
environment and this is a program called
fish job as you can see it involves a
fish that chomps as you can imagine and
I started to get into this thing and
look at the code so this is this is a
picture of the code and it was a little
concerned you know what what is my son
learning who's teaching my son program
and how are they teaching you can kind
of appreciate my sensitivity to this so
I took a look at this thing and so this
is some code so i take you know what I
learn a new programming language I like
to read source code so let's take a look
at this thing so we see this flag when
when when flag clicked you know it says
switch to costume open mouth okay I'm
following that so and then forever if
distance to mouse pointer you know point
toward the mouse pointer move three
steps okay so I can kind of navigate
that the big something to read this and
understand it they get this other one
when i receive got me play a sound chomp
okay i'm tracking here then repeat twice
switch to costume closed mouth and then
open mouth ok so I'm poking around
looking at the images and here's a
picture of the open mouth this is hungry
fish and then this is closed mouth and
you can see if you go back and forth
like that what's he doing that's fish
chomp we can watch this fish chomp for
hours this is great look at this guy so
coming back to this thing i just spent
time trying to figure out what this
program did and as a functional program
or somebody's train kind of in you know
making programs save meaningful things i
don't like to have to go through that
exercise every time I look at the
so what's my instinct at this point I'm
going to rewrite this thing in early so
this is the real code version of that
and look at it it's basically the same
thing when i receive got me chomp now so
i put the word chop in there right so
i'm i'm attributing higher level meaning
to this program that's something that
satisfies me I'm like okay now i can
understand what's going on and you can
just stop then you could stop reading
you don't have to know what chomp is but
if you ever have a programming language
with a function named chomp you might
want to look to see what shonda so we'll
take a look here chomp says play sound
and it was oh so you play the sound and
then you would repeat something twice
snap jaws right so that's exact same
thing that we just looked i need to see
snap jaws you switch the costumes right
back and forth remember this one here
that's that's what that does but so we
look at this code and we say that does
the exact same thing but it expresses it
in a higher level meaning i don't have
to interpret this it says it right there
and that's the beauty functional
languages all right okay good or now now
key i see me okay no problem get here
alright so this is this is real code and
then it dawned on me that this is a
moment right this is a teachable so they
call it teachable moment where my I can
like introduce this idea of functional
programming to my son Elliott who just
loves this bouncy scrolls bouncing
around but I can show him this example
in a language that he can understand
right this isn't luring but that but the
terms snap jaws and chomp are tied in to
you know what he's experiencing long in
this program okay so this is a test now
my test I want you to imagine coming of
age test right this is the back in time
when you know it culturally would send
it came into the jungle to stare down a
tiger right it was you know this is
you're going to go in a child and come
out a young adult it's just like that so
I'm going to give Elliot a test that's
going to push him into this junk that
real jungle we live in the suburbs of
Chicago so it's not an actual jungle
with actual Tigers don't have actual
Tigers but we have erlang right so we're
gonna have the child sort of a
functional programming language and see
what happens this is a time for him to
you know maybe I become a man but you
know of mature so a time for him to go
from kind of hacking on scratch to now
thinking about programming as kind of a
lab eration of higher level meaning
let's see how it goes all right so the
test look like this i'm going to
introduce a mystery programs to elevate
and it's cold fish on he doesn't know
fish job i I installed this thing it's a
sample programming scratch and he didn't
see he hasn't seen this so he doesn't
know what this is I'm gonna provide him
code samples from scratch and hurling
both right so he's going to see the
scratch and is going to see the ER line
and I'm gonna ask him some questions so
different questions about the behavior
of the program and then I'm going to
observe it so we'll see you know it's
not quite a navy double-blind test you
know it's not that scientific this is
just sending him into the jungle we'll
see what happens okay so here's the
material goldfish we have scratch
material this is a piece of paper I
printed it and I gave a damn right so
it's a little packet of information so
this is the scratch version on paper
this is the other link version
okay this is more colorful and fun but
this has no human words and describes
the meaning and you can probably can't
see this here saw before it's got the
you know the behavior of this of the
program is called out as as functions in
this functional compositional pattern
that role used to seeing okay so that's
print out number two for him this is the
goldfish this is the victim in the game
fish job this is the thing that gets
chopped we haven't seen the goldfish
this is the hungry fish you've seen
hungry fish scratch version so you've
got the sprites and then you have a code
all right and then viola get the idea
okay here's some of the questions when
the green flag is clicked what does the
hungry fish do what happens when the
hungry fish eats the goldfish what
happens what secret power does the
goldfish hat so now are like we can't go
into the the imperative instructional
code here we have to do some inference
so I'm going to kind of curious to see
how he's going to handle this is he
going to dig in to the erlang is going
to stare down that tiger or is he going
how's it going to handle this so I was
interested in that and to either of the
goldfish of the hungry fish ever stop
not an obvious answer to this question
okay makes sense so this is the this is
this is the test so here are his answers
this is the answer sheet again it's all
print out there's no actual running of
the program and you can see I'm going to
zoom in he gave himself an a-plus that
is the highest grade that you can give
yourself when you take a test and is
very happy with the results here are
some answers to the question what
happens when the green flag is when the
green flag is clicked what was goldfish
do well he swims and show okay all right
the show part I think you'd kind of just
read enough scratch I'm not going to
give you full and that's here's here's
another one with secret power does the
goldfish have he swims and he responds
ah alright so the word respawn does not
appear anywhere in the scratch cooking
but it does appear in the ER line code
so he got that and I knew he used her
leg he had to write because this is
actually a very tricky question
superpowers you have to sort of get up
into the storyline of the program and
when you're looking at these imperative
instructions do this
you know greater than 10 repeat 2 it's
very hard to get a story out of that you
have to kind of play the game okay so
that's pretty good so here's the result
so Elliot but I'm Dan here which
language did you prefer I think I know
the answer I think you know what its
gonna say oh no okay scratch look so
Elliot let me uh let me rephrase this I
don't think you may be understood the
question you meant early erling is
better right okay okay erlang is
complicated that is actually the wrong
answer not the one I was looking for it
is Elliot if anyone ever tells you
there's no such things or wrong answer
they're lying to you and that was the
wrong answer so when we talk about
scratch you know we'll just shift it you
know we know the you can find early a
little complicated so tell me why is
scratch so hard to understand ok ok
Elliot I sent you into the jungle to
stare down tiger and you brought me a
bunny I need something I need something
here I'm going to bring out the big guns
so this is this is the question that
sort of lays the victim bear doesn't it
bother you that scratch is basically a
side effect
right you know what is he gonna say to
that snap yeah that just happened huh
and just and just to like just to twist
the knife a little bit more you wanted
me to know that the squirrel changed
color so so this is the result of that
test so I know you're saying if they
could Garrett you're being a little
overwrought here I mean he's tan just
kind of relax he will in time learn that
Erlang is the language of choice for
anybody who wants to write software
he'll get that we know that but here's
what gets to me right last year I did a
survey on the conducted a survey and
asked the Erlang community so these are
early programmers what what what are
some of the challenges to adopting and
using early and this is one results this
is a tag cloud and the size of the text
is reflective of the number of times a
particular term was used and you might
see the term here that kind of jumps out
it's hidden a little bit in the middle
there there's a general sentiment within
the Erlang community these are people
who use our leg as a language and lover
are passionate about everything that
it's hard to use and there's a number of
reasons why it's not because it's being
pitted against scratch right in fairness
but there is a general sentiment that
air laying is hard to use okay so that's
kind of weighing on me in this potatoes
up bringing some emotional baggage into
this conversation with failure like I
grant you that here's another view
functional neighborhood this is a plot
of pop basically popularity with the
more popular languages going up to the
upper right Erlang and some other
functional languages are sort of in a
second tier it's highlighted in yellow
can zoom in on that we can see that
they're ranked in a similar earliness
ranked in a similar similar place to
scala closure list emacs lisp is down
there these are not all functional
languages but you'll notice that in the
top tier the ones in the far right your
Java JavaScript you know C C++
python there isn't anything that can
remotely be considered functional if you
ever see somebody calling javascript of
functional language you hear this all
the time I just want you to reach out
and just just say that's from Gary don't
slap do not tell them if you do do not
tell us for me so this is weighing on me
uh so I've got this you know this the
sort of idea that you know while I
believe in this stuff I you know my
instinct is to go take the scratch
program and go whip up the Erlang
version or the functional version the
one that I can read and understand this
is good it's pat you know we all sort of
kind of the same page there the rest of
the world doesn't seem to get that and
it's not dissimilar to the conversation
that I had with my son it's not that
different so you know we can look at the
market share here and see exactly how
small share this is again that
neighborhood this isn't even the
functional part this is just the not
popular kids it's a very very very very
very small percentage of my chair out in
the marketplace so yeah that's how I
feel right so I don't want to leave it
at that though this is a this is not you
know a language debate that I'm having
with my son for trying out a lot of
course not this is a father-son moment
that's supposed to be beautiful it's but
we're supposed to share a common bond of
program I am NOT going to let this these
language wars get in the way of this
moment with my son so I want to go from
sad dog too happy dog optimistic dog but
I need a reason I need something in my
brain to help me think how are these
things the same what is important in
this exchange that I had with my son you
know do I want to get into a debate
between you know sort of impairment and
imperative and exploratory practices and
perhaps more deliberate meaning oriented
is that really is it a matter of just a
kid playing around with something that
looks like a Lego and a so-called adult
who is you know you
in using programming you know for four
decades now and just the difference in
age and maturity is something like that
how do i parse this how do i how do I
put this this moment into into a happy
place all right so this is the question
what's the thread they can't I Elliott's
experience in my experience it's kind of
a big question because it's it's not
just Elliott's experience of my
experiences how all of our experience
what's the what's the thread that can
tie these things together I have two
words I I bet some of you are thinking
I'm gonna say lambda calculus here's a
surprise human emotion so I thought a
lot about this and I really did I really
did struggle you guys think I'm a little
nuts here and I'm kind of going through
this but I want a story for myself that
I can I can I can resolve Elliott's
practices and my practices the thinking
here of different modes of programming
different modes of learning and now I
know you're hearing this looking at
human emotion thinking I've come to a
functional programming conference and
Garrett is going to introduce this topic
of human emotion I didn't want to talk
about that today I'm a functional
programmer because I don't like talking
about him and emotion give me a chance
here to explain what I mean there is
some science here and my first example
to show you what I'm talking about I
will introduce the most emotionally
charged hot topic icon in all of
computer science that Erlang function
this for me was an emotional experience
I didn't weep I didn't break down but I
did like it and I want to explain what
I'm talking about here being very
specific when I first learned erling saw
early i was a bit mystified as to where
the state was because there are no
global variables you know there's no
place to put a go put a value somewhere
there's kind of a mystery the answer is
that the state is associated with
processes but that's that's that's not
the story here the point for me is in an
erlang function
cuz there are no global variables
there's no context even read only
context that I need to worry about
outside of the scope of a function and
this was the first time I had ever
really seen that it's obviously very
common in a functional paradigm but this
is my first experience with that and for
me it was a sense of visceral relief a
pleasure to see this function and say I
don't have to worry about the context up
here there's no state or instance
variable yeah there's no class variable
that I need to worry about there's no
locking contention it's just this thing
and I can reason about this the
arguments passed in there's some sort of
manipulation that and there's a return
value and so this thing for me I looked
at it and I liked it and now what I want
to do so I've identified some sort of
human emotion there I like this thing
what's the next step what I want to do
here as an exercise is take that I like
it expression and sort of identify why
and use a pattern language identify what
it is about this like that is universal
or reusable so I'm gonna identify this
thing as variables that don't do it now
you might be used to seeing this as
immutability immutability unfortunately
is viewed by many as a missed feature in
functional languages because mutability
is this thing that we do in programs we
change variable some programs imperative
programs change variables all the time
and the ability to not do that feels
like a restriction so it's a bad thing
and you'll see languages actually try to
work around that and give you the
impression that your make your you're
mutating variables even though it's kind
of a bad idea in that language or under
the covers don't identify the pattern
here that has a bit more of a positive
spin and identify why it is that this is
a good thing so here's my example you
can disagree with this but understand
it's a process of taking an emotion that
I have I like this and trying to
describe what is really good about this
in Universal so that's the process I'm
going to go through right now so check
this out all right values established
the rule of the game okay they're
playing a game you have rules so when
you're playing game nobody likes when
rules change during the game
she's running a race you've won the race
and somebody says I'm sorry you actually
didn't win because we change the rules
during the race it's a bit frustrating
so here's sort of the universal truth
the universal the pattern variables that
don't change create a sense of security
right you're looking at the same duh you
know this is why we like functional
languages right what i'm doing here is
i'm driving a reason process about the
mutability or variables that don't vary
and putting it in a putting in terms
that any human being can understand and
appreciate i think that this is a
universal pattern in all humans we don't
like it when we think we understand
something and then the rules have
changed so in a programming language we
can look at this as a pattern to say
when you know you see a variable right
and and and your question is you know
Candace change or not is there some way
to reduce the scope impact of change on
a system in functional language happened
to be very good at that that's an
example of a pattern so what i'm doing
here is I want to do something with
these fundamental truths and systematize
them in a way that we can share an
elaborate and exchange information when
you see patterns you're probably
thinking about this and you probably
have an emotion it's probably not a
positive emotion
when i see this i have an emotion in its
anger its discussed I really am angry
about this not personal I don't know who
wrote I know I don't know anyone who
wrote this but I took this book when I
was young and I said I'm gonna implement
everything I'm gonna use every single
pattern in this book and I did I did I
literally I was you know working a
project and we use pretty much every
single pattern in this book I have never
seen such a monstrosity of an
application as a result of that so I
have a personal kind of vendetta against
this thing the term patterns here I'm in
my in my what I'm sort of presenting to
you so I'm introducing this kind of
human emotionally informed pattern
discovery process has absolutely nothing
to do with this other than the sharing
of the word pattern it so let me be
clear about that I'm not talking about
that and I'm certainly not talking about
if we want to duck dive into the some of
this stuff example builder pattern
separate the construction of a complex
object from its representation allowing
the same construction process to create
various representations if somebody ever
says that to you I want you to just
reach out slapping and you tell them
that was from Garrett do that oh don't
go now don't do anything violent
seriously for the record don't slap them
I'm not talking about this stuff I'm
talking about this stuff I'm talking
about the stuff that feels good when we
program and we sit back and we kick back
and we enjoy something I want that to
inform our thinking about the good stuff
in program I'm actually talking about
this and this is a book that in an
author that is cited as being the
inspiration the sort of a thought leader
for the the software and architectural
patterns in software again the thing
that these share that this is the
timeless way of building vectors for
Alexander the thing that is common
between Alexander's vision of a pattern
and what we see in software today is the
word pattern and that's it it's as if
they read
book and got to the word pattern
language and then said I got it and then
just closed it right it is completely
the opposite point of view and what I
want to do here and give you some
examples and try to maybe consider
reviving this these ideas I want to talk
about what this guy's talking about and
and and that for me is there the
reconciliation in this Elliot dad this
got this discussion here's a quote from
Alexander patterns made from thought
without feeling lamp black empirical
reactant lack empirical reality entirely
and he says this type of thing
throughout his book and the reason he
says this is that there's sort of an
instinct in humans and sorts of
particularly intellectuals that feeling
is somehow not a legitimate point of
view and so he will liken the work that
he's talking about to you know to being
as rigorous and difficult to steer retro
physics is it being a little defensive
here and I understand that it's the same
problem I had when I said human emotion
they're just like what is this guy
talking about how could this possibly
have anything to do the software it's an
interesting phenomenon but the his point
here is that the emotional experience
that we have is programmers it's really
basically what we have as human beings
languages and what we do as programmers
is all very very human right we're not
writing this stuff for the computer or
writing this stuff for ourselves so this
he's talking Alexander talks here about
building so it's physical architecture
but the same types of principles can
apply the software so he says that
patterns made from thought without
feeling lack empirical reality entirely
I took he keep us in mind that feelings
are central part with his of his of his
model patterns do not come only from the
work of architects and planners and so
he's saying look this is not something
that the ivory tower has exclusive
domain and that I think is what we've
been given is software programmers an
ivory tower point of view pattern very
intellectual he goes on to say they come
from the work of thousands of different
people so my wish would be that we take
back patterns so I want to give you some
examples I know this is a little bit
fuzzy right now but I want to give you
some examples and go
some concrete sort of exercises to see
how a motion can inform actual
elaboration of real effective patterns
that we can use when talking to people
about languages designing languages
designing libraries designing products
we can use this throughout our work as
programmers okay so let's look at some
more examples I know you're gonna think
this is soft I know you're gonna think
this is kind of fluffy thinking here
remember work to try to show you that
this is actually the rigorous process is
this is a difficult process when I use
scratch I like a particular thing about
it I found myself liking and that's just
emotion I'm not thinking I just found
myself going to the same point in this
this graphical display and it was the
event handlers and now it as a process
here I want to translate that raw
emotion I like this this feels good to
me is why does it feel good to me why
does this make sense why is this why do
I keep you know feeling good about this
thing so try this try this on for size
so this is the example here an example
when space bar suppresses you'll see the
soul basically all the code blocks in
scratch are triggered by external events
so it is an event handling event
oriented design first and foremost so
this is this a scratch so what is the
elaboration of this pattern how do we
describe this very simply events happen
in time and space code is called when an
event occurs it creates a sense of
connection to the world outside your
program I know you're thinking okay this
is this is kind of dumb right duh like
event-driven like why are you going
through so much effort to try to map
this into this soft sort of
non-scientific language we as a
community of functional programs have
had a hard time getting our message
across to folk right you saw the graphs
you saw the mindshare you saw the
popularity contest and where things fall
out right I think we have the math right
quite literally I think we have perhaps
the message wrong I think that we may be
thinking of
design features in our languages a
little bit a little bit too much
difference to the lambda calculus so I'm
deliberately softening this I'm
deliberately trying to get down to the
story that is compelling to people will
that influence our thinking in the way
we design things I think it absolutely
can so I do understand this is not a
scientific you know breakdown I'm not
trying to be mathematical here I'm
trying to be human I'm trying to
communicate but very specific features
come out when we do this I'm discovering
okay here's another example functional
composition why is this is this is this
is this is my this is my thing I like
punctual composition so anytime I see
something I don't understand or takes me
more than a moment to Drock i will go
mount that to function and i have seemed
to see the code that i write tends to be
you know one or two lines all over the
place and i think very very hard about
how to name things so I like this
pattern all right so what's going on
here so this is an example of an erlang
function you've seen this before this is
nothing new but this is now describing
some sort of you know pattern behavior
using functions and its composition so
that's the best example of strict
composition again I'm just running a
story across here I'm not presenting any
lambda Kappa I'm not building a you know
type theory here I'm just showing you
know kind of a story line so what's the
what's the pattern how would I elaborate
this pattern functions name behavior of
things becomes our functions name
behavior and things they do so functions
can be composed to tell stories using
human words it's created affirming
confidence in how a program works this
is what's going on with bouncy squirrel
right you know or other emotional
dynamics and programming it's why people
say this is fun you receive people using
Ruby and rails and JavaScript and they
love it I'm just going what how is it
possible that you love this this is
horrible but that's that's arrogant and
ridiculous I should stop and try to
understand what is what is true
motivating and it's an emotional thing
it's not an intellectual thing
there's aesthetic values there's all
sorts of other things but there are
practices and patterns in that in that
emotion that we can use and we can learn
from we can put them into our languages
and there are I think elixir is a good
example of I think I'm emotionally
driven you motivated and not I don't say
that in a derogatory term I think it is
humanly motivated this tried to put the
power of some of these functional models
into the hands of folk and I think in
order to do that we have to got to drive
past the mathematics we've got to find a
way to reconcile the scratch erlang test
right we think it's a we think it's a
paradigm conflict you know it's this or
that it's really something that cuts
through orthogonal II so I'm proposing
that we pick up Alexander's notion of
patterns and and use that take back this
unfortunate unfortunate Advent wear
patterns have been hijacked essentially
by the architects the exact opposite of
what Alexander talks about all right
there's no quickly some other patterns I
want to we have some time for some
discussion here Rep okay so everyone
likes to wrap up with their languages
that don't have a ripple every language
today needs to have something that
lowers the stakes of getting something
right I think we can experience that
we're picking up a language when we like
something we say this is this is great
what's going on with a rebel you're
experimenting you're playing you're
learning it's that sort of Elliott
experience with with balance a squirrel
so r apple this rep to me represents a
pattern that we should look for in our
program something that lowers the stake
of getting something right and
encourages play and experimentation a
visual model I don't really like visual
programming but the fact is the matter
is that that visual models reinforce our
understanding of a program we don't have
to use necessarily the visual tool to
write the software we certainly can but
there tends to be a lot of pushback on
or if it's pushed back but
to say well wait a second you know
you've got the visual tool and that's
all nice that's all fine and good but my
text is just as much a model as that her
this argument point of it that's that's
also true but let's just be affirmed an
affirming of the human sort of visual
inclination and let's start to think
about adding more visual tools to
functional languages I would love to
have the better ability to visualize
things I use Emacs it's a challenge to
use Emacs to really visualize things I
would love to have some breakthrough in
tooling on that front because I really
enjoy what scratch brings to the table
on that front on the converse human
readable text another pattern it lets
our code participate in a broader social
context of text based tools and services
all right so we see that scratch one of
scratches limitations is that you can't
really get to text you can't really go
put stuff and github but you can't you
know dip it you can't apply said to it
regret so this is kind of a deficiency I
think so this is another pattern it's
very specific right and why is it why is
it good why do we like text based
programming well it just opens up a
world of tools and social social
patterns that are would otherwise be
very expensive to recreate or if not
impossible so this is specifically you
know different different patterns that
elaborate value but they're informed by
emotion so my point here and this is
what i'd like to get across is emotions
are signals they point to something real
don't shy away from them so when i say
the common thread the thing that ties
Eliot's experience in my experience
together as we both love this stuff and
we're being informed by specific things
Elliot I observe was attracted to the
fact that you can iterate through change
is very very quickly and very much like
Legos you pick something up you put it
together you get immediate feedback how
many of our languages have that level of
feedback I encourage you to go grab crab
scratch get it's a small talk derivative
so it's your building sort of in the in
the runtime environment so that the
difference between bill time code time
and runtime is learn in a small talk
environment so you'd expect that but
that's a great experience for any
programmer it doesn't have to be a kid
any of us playing around with things
that emotion drives that my emotion to
to to elaborate and bring me into things
again point is something real so I want
this true useful pattern language I want
four people we experience it it's not
something that is handed to us in a book
it's not something that somebody goes
and Ponder's like this for a while and
mapping things out I think that's all
fine and good but if it doesn't make it
and if it doesn't tie into something
that we can experience viscerally like I
like this this feels right to me I think
we throw it out the window so emotion
who is this emotion driven development
on its pattern language patterns are not
prescribed or discovered there's
something there's something about this
process that comes from the human makeup
so we are product of this evolutionary
if chain and computers are very very new
and weird using languages as
intermediaries between our brains and
our society and our society and the
machines this is entirely a human
practice and we'd be foolish to ignore
our human responses to certain things so
these cues are things that will inform
our thinking and point us in two
directions what is good about this and I
want to elaborate that I'm going to put
a name on the pattern I want to describe
any way that I can share it that's
pattern language experience and
experiential enough theoretical somewhat
of a restatement of the second point
we're not sitting back and theorizing
about this we are experiencing it quite
literally and finally and this is for me
why this was important it cuts across
these language categories and tribal
affiliations I think intellectually we
know that we know you know we're all
brothers and sisters in the common
effort to write programs we know that
right but sometimes we get a little
tribal and we get a little judgmental
and you know understandable this is a
specific model that is constructive
right what comes out of this is real but
you can make good quality design
decisions out of this process so it's
not just hey let's all get along feel
good it's let's build better software
better languages
our tooling better libraries and it is
this thing that for me reconciles it so
I can look at elliot and reason about
his experience I can look at me and
reason about my experience and have
absolutely no problem with any of it all
right because it's just a human endeavor
and these these specific things come out
of that so the lesson is go forth and
feel I want you just to be ever look if
you see something you like stand up and
just say yes that's what I'm just
kidding don't do that you can if you
want I mean that's you know there's
nothing wrong with that does that is
that completely crazy all right I got
one fan that's good that's all I want
all right so I want to open this up for
we have what kind of did a little time
for discussion here so let's uh let's I
want you guys to to yell get angry get
emotional yeah I think I know your kid
scratch because it's them to think that
all the female boy and that they won't
push the boundaries and actually think
about yeah and we actually don't like
you are all you know client so it is
pushing about with an achievement by
doing things in Brazil also actually day
their parents always tell them what to
do and in fact they can now tell her to
computer also interesting and I think
that's maybe okay so we can take a
pattern on that sort of the rebel
pattern or don't tell me what to do
right I mean that's yeah who wants to be
that's a desert so I'm sort of talking
about things I feel a good but we can
also talk about things to feel bad all
right we know I really don't like would
be mean when I you know go learn
something so lowering barriers to entry
this process is actually quite hard I
don't know if I could simply when I when
I was trying to put language behind this
is actually took quite a bit of effort
and I know that the language that comes
out of this is soft I understand that
I've made this point but I find it very
difficult to you know we talk you talk
to
risk-taking and not being wanting to be
controlled how does that specifically
translate into a language feature now I
think you can do that it's difficult
though and it takes a certain discipline
and and this is what Alexander talks
about is being difficult feeling is not
difficult right we can feel things
instinctively that's not more to point
we're saying here but it's translating
that feeling into something a pattern
that you can absolutely tangibly apply
when you build software so I don't know
where that goes but that that is
certainly a something that should land
in the next patterns book here the
emotionally driven Parenthood what's
that fail fast okay and then the mascara
was that you can get functional or you
can get it if you want to stay
functional you have to really really try
to stay functional ever you have no
choice it's just elegant I think
I think it was summarized perfectly I
couldn't agree more yeah you know I mean
honestly I you know just to be you know
to tour take us to a personal level I
don't know this is brand new I you know
I'd like to understand why Scott if
there are people who like all of the
options in Scotland say this is this is
great i'd like i'd really like to get
and serve and dwell that so maybe it's a
sense of being able to migrate and not
forcing a complete shift on somebody to
say you know if you're used to this
model you can take steps and had some
conversations last night with some folks
who said you know we only use purely
functional scala I'm like I don't even
know there was such I mean that's that's
cool is there like a mode that you can
put the compiler in to say you know yes
I just want that would be really nice
and so you have where you have you know
sort of a warning flags or something to
say and then you could you could have a
migration story so this to me i will be
completely honest with you I'd say two
weeks ago I would I've had very sort of
grossly and I have things to say about
any given language i really i think i
might have just been converted here like
i might actually have an open mind to
things it's not to say i have an open
mind to bad patterns and dangerous
things but what do people like about
this i really am very interested you see
these patterns in javascript where
you've got this these chaining functions
where it's like function dot and then
Dobb you see that the patterns of people
using it's like a chain of dot
invocations and what's happening is the
object gets passed along so you're
simultaneously side affecting and then
returning the object that was modified i
look at that in my mind is blown that
people could possibly do this why why
are you doing this why they seem to like
it it's I honestly would like to
understand that i truly do them out i'm
not kidding so so there's something in
there that's fun and is likable it
scares me i look at that and i just i'd
say don't do that but the fact of the
matter is people do it and they like it
so I want to understand it so you know
what does that translate into something
that
might be useful for a functional
language I bet there's something there I
bet there is a human being a base
instinct to do something there I would
only speculate but that's a discipline
so why not what's wrong with that why
not purely functional Java if anyone
ever says why not funky early functional
Java just just don't do that I'm just
kidding maybe that's Colin maybe that's
what you know Scala offers that I think
you know if there is one it would be
Scala if you know you want to help
somebody within the java community take
steps toward a more functional it's
called value proposition right let's you
know I mean come on look look at some
functional languages there are
violations all over the place I mean
what is function I mean it's a
preponderance of the use of of the
functions right there's generally
immutability involved but sometimes
there isn't you know and you have
various ways of handling this problem of
side effects you know degrees of purity
I mean really come on it you know I
understand I understand the arguments
and believe I'm with you all I i I'm
it's hard for me to go back I try to
write in functional patterns using
imperative languages that that basically
our side effect machines and it's kind
of impossible you really don't get the
same benefit so I understand it but I'm
we've been stuck for a long pants I like
function problem is that new it's fairly
new but it's not that new and I think
we've got to figure out something to get
more traction and it isn't because we
want our the population is swell who
cares right be happy with a small
community it's to get its to improve our
civilization right we've got good ideas
here so let's help programmers be better
we work with them right you like working
as a functional program if you like
working with folks who don't care about
functional programming and don't like
you
is your functional programmer that feel
good feels bad so you know adoption i
think is becoming for me kind of a
personal passion and this is a practical
bouncy squirrel little bit then be so
cute bouncy squirrel is is gives us a I
think this it's really it's really
Alexander it's a really very very good
model proposes and it's very applicable
to to software I like this a lot I
really like the fact that it gets to the
way we are built the way we operate and
it's a it's a discipline understanding
what works well for humans and so
there's no reason to say mathematics I
win right that's usually a debate or
that's how we win the arguments to say
lambda calculus i win is you hear ya it
seems elegant I like it so it sounds
like something that could you legit but
if we got if we have to sort of Judge
around its merits let's push it for the
bother scope and the question is are you
do you think you're both you have a
woman of things to say that the had some
primitive level every program early on
in the community shares the same let's
see motional things like is it platonic
in that size they're like a you know
other Universal best versions of this so
if I'm going to go to Christopher
Alexander's point of view he's going to
build a home that that he thinks is
beautiful that many people will think of
is beautiful but if you have a you know
a fear of open spaces you know you're
not going to like a room like this this
is a nice room I like the space if you
are if you are built in a way where you
don't like open spaces your home is
going to be very feel claustrophobic and
that's just the way you're built so
there are absolutely variations and you
will never eliminate the variation
languages with this theory you might get
a lot more languages but for any given
person you know there's a point of view
and there's something driving that but
there are preponderance is with
in broader communities so this is not an
exact science at all but it is a science
it's a discipline of trying to elaborate
these principles I think you have ranges
of principles I think people you might
have trolls that say you know I like it
when the rules change from under me okay
fine maybe you do I think most people
don't so you know you don't have this is
not a calculus is not a formal calculus
applied to the human race you're going
to have variation I think that's fine
but you know goodness gracious you know
what we're going to conceive patterns to
these ridiculous I mean come on these
these these architectural patterns if
you read them they are truly bizarre and
people will use them to build truly
bizarre systems they have no grounding
and human experience whatsoever this
yeah so they might make that argument
but i'll make the argument that if you
hear something that doesn't make sense
if you has ten people how is a striking
and then all scratching her had gone
what what are you going to do say that
guy is a smart guy in the room therefore
he's right i'm not going to say that if
you can't manage to get your pattern in
a way that those 10 people can can
understand and accept rejection it's a
have you seen you've seen these systems
that are built right bridge patterns or
you these crazy adapted to these adapter
list these are systems that all right I
don't have the science to back this up
so I can't make it but if you ever see
this invading your car open space it's
sort of we have this issue that of
common sense versus science because open
spaces could be just a trend as when
people think that you want a little
spaces because you have like psychology
experiments are shown that even though
open spaces might be trendy right now
thousands of years of
evolution have shown that people have
through all these years that they've
been looking for shopping and it had a
psychological level they actually feel
more they feel better you know yeah yeah
I don't I don't know what I don't know
what the patterns so a team put together
a huge set of patterns and it's just an
instantiation of patterns you find them
useful or not you throw them away if you
don't like them but they are very
intuitive and you can read them and they
don't make you your they don't make you
extremely confused thinking that you're
you're a dumb person because you haven't
thought about how to extract the process
of creating something that you can't
even identify I've seen very complex
systems in big enterprises to and then
and you know simple direct solutions to
problems are better than than crazy
abstractions that take Team six months
ago build and don't serve any purpose I
think we can agree with that and then we
go measure it I'll go to the field and
see how these patterns actually work or
not I'm not saying I don't know you'd
have to go study but this discussion
sounds like a religion that sound that
I've heard it before definite saturday
matter for oh you know if you feel good
depending I have a I three I know where
we come from
the dress yeah but also I can see were
and maybe planners in that way I know ya
know so it's not the same we feel good
let's go crazy lalala is to say it's to
say so there's two things there's
there's two things going on in sad
dynamic this is an example right in
static you invest time up front and you
get information about the behavior of
your program and the way to program is
shaped early on in the process but you
have to invest time in that and dynamic
language you don't have to invest that
time you can get by without spending any
time at all and then you find out your
behavior of your program down the road
so there's a trade-off there what i
would do is look to see in both both are
fun but you know people who use types to
sort of get things right at least as far
as the type system is concerned will
tell you that it's an enjoyable fun
process of people who use dynamic
languages will tell you it's a fun the
process to do that as well so what is it
about these specific threads of
experience are good you know the patent
so I don't know I this is this takes a
lot of time and effort i'm not going to
i'm not going to throw that out but it
is not a matter of throwing your hands
up and saying what feels good is great
that's just an informant just informs
your thinking and points you in a
particular direction and then you
systematically break down what's going
on here why do we like this and then try
to put that into a language that we can
describe we can use to share a pattern
language that's a bit more human
and so if we have a background in that
may be drawn to we may be that certain
code is Elliot that if you jump in her
trial imparting scratch you probably
don't have that same mean he will do he
will soon he'll be exposed to that very
soon that came from the area Robin a lot
of you guys are we hate and I'm sure the
reverse is probably true as well you
think there's any of that it's just from
our background wish to know all the same
type of coleslaw ah yeah there could be
acquired taste but there are also great
dishes that translate that cross all
boundaries Chicago hot dog for example
everybody likes that you know Hyderabad
briyani I mean it's a universal so I
mean maybe you know we don't have to
start with the things that are
controversial maybe we can just start
with the things that or try to build
some things that we have consensus on
you know if your if your brain is wired
a certain way again I just go back as I
wasn't saying that open spaces are
necessarily good i'm just saying that I
mean I I happen to like this this this
room but there may be people others who
don't what's the science behind that my
point here is that you don't want to
have to force one thing on everybody so
you allow that variation but i guess i
would i would say where are we are we
are we today with this discipline of
being able to elaborate things that are
deeply human and qualitatively good and
reusable and can create great software
where we at where we at today when i
look at the patterns stuff I maybe be
overreacting a little bit I don't think
I am though I think that stuff is bad I
would say that's that is horrifying what
we've done on that front and let's just
try this and see what happens yeah I'd
start with that rather than trying to
get this into a calculus yeah you
mentioned visual model and we see in
scratch it's very cool
whole show squawks quite wisely is there
something particular you miss when using
your chronicles Tulsa I assume have
colors and emacs I have colors what do
you say that I just went through like a
retooling on emacs I went I want to go
use I was like you know the c-max stuff
there's got to be something out there
that's a little bit newer and nicer and
I spent a lot of time on looking at
alternatives and I just came back the
Emacs cuz I'm like all the alternatives
have other problems and Annie Max's is
pretty pretty darn good and then I
stripped away all these colors and I
came up with a really minimalistic color
color theme but the idea of colors in
and they are bright and gaudy just like
that I don't think it's a matter of
colors in this case I think it's a
matter i think the motivation for
Elliott is not the colors it's the
immediate feedback it's so I would say
you know if we were to sit down with him
and say what motivates you I very much
doubt it would be the colors it would be
the fact that i can get started on on an
animation with no effort at all and then
iterate almost seamlessly at every step
to see so well is there something that
you can point out Oh something like a
direction to go to oh oh yeah i'll give
it perfect example absolutely okay so so
one so i advocate and i like lots of
functions really really small functions
and you'll see the code in fact you saw
the picture the printout of the code
line line line line line and the end the
human reaction a lot of people have and
i have also when you see that you don't
like it because you don't know what you
don't know where to start looking you
don't know you know is this high level
is this and so people will want to then
start to put them into modules or group
them and sort of organize them so they
can get some sort of structure there is
in fact a very precise structure to this
code but you just can't see it so what I
would that is an editor or a visual
model that will allow me to look at a
particular level and it's not really
cold code folding because you need to
understand whose it's the call tree so
you have high level functions that
sort of high-level meaning and low
functions that are lower and I want to
be able to say I want to look at this
and see how it relates the thing above
it and below it I can't there are some
things that can do that in your line
there are some tools that but they're
there early stage they're hard to work
with but I think that's an area that we
could push on for sure from visualizing
functional program that's an example
okay so I've got time for one more
question okay so you show us some a book
at least desired muttons right the
question is isn't the functional web a
bizarre thing itself because when Norman
people amount from times right I want to
do something let's say the handsome when
you did you did you assume your second
did you just I put your pants on yeah
yeah so that I think about the next
steps and that is very intuitive right
you don't compose how are you going to
put your clothes on yes ok this is fine
so I have I have 30 seconds to sort of
hypothesize here I think both models
work you have the imperative model and I
use sort of imperative style when I
would it when I don't understand a
problem I don't have the right the
bright model does not come out of my
code initially it is very incremental
and it is very much like putting your
pants on when one pan of time sort of
stepwise do this and then okay I got
this now once I've done that I want to
tell the story that i know i just wrote
right so I'll then refactor this and
I'll put it in a sort of this pure
declarative functional but that's a
story at that point that anybody can
read it understand so I think in this
case it's both it's it's I've seen I
think most people work this way they
don't understand the problem until they
really see how the solution working and
so it's a very experimental and
iterative process and then once you see
that you have a model and I think that's
where functional language and functional
languages that that put you into a
compositional note to begin with we'll
let you tell i think a more pristine
clear story much
cleaner with less context and weird
things and less room for bugs so you
know experimentation play story
understanding meaning all the same thing
there's probably four or five patterns
in there again this is hard like to take
this stuff and really understand what's
motivating a human being and what's good
here that we can reuse and features i
think is work so i can't just go dive
into this and but i would approach it I
would approach your comment that way
okay with that thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
