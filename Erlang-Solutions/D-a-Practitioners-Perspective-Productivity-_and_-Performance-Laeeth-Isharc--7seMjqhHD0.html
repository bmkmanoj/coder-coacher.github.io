reads collide associates to talk about
my experience of using the D programming
language in the investment world who
here has knows much about D is sort of
you know written by ganzel Ballard the
compiler anyway I'm here has written
programs in D or downloaded the compiler
they would okay all right that's good
I'm so you know I'm speaking for myself
not for any of my clients and I'm well
clydie
is a boutique startup firm that consults
on economic investment strategy and also
applying technology to the investment
places what I'm interested in is less in
automating things and replacing human
beings but more in using technology to
augment to amplify human capability and
that's sort of how I came to use D um
the modern world is very complicated so
click advanced and I'm gonna tell you a
story to begin a long time ago in a
universe far far away there's young man
who joined a wall up
he lived in a castle and the world had
some type of machinery for laying siege
to the enemy and this machinery was
based upon the idea but there's any that
there many ways to do it and more than
one way to do it and it was good for the
enemy is always changing and the snares
and tricks of war must change with him
and the young man was given commanders
and troops and when his battles and the
successes forces great the world was an
excellent militia leader and his
emissions grew with his success in order
to achieve his ambitions he consulted an
Oracle and the Oracle said that this
machinery is not scalable
not maintainable and there is only one
way to do it and you must replace
pearl by C++ and this was not so good
for us machine was being dismantled and
rebuilt the enemy continued to change
his tactics and stratagems
and the young man could no longer doubt
the machinery was built and built and
built and by the time it was complete
neither the young man nor any of his
colleagues remain with warlord and there
was no longer anyone there who
remembered how to use it so if you
return to the world of today technology
is critical to the investment process
you need productivity and greatness but
you also need efficiency and plasticity
because markets are always changing and
what worked fine five years ago simply
won't work today on the other hand
technology itself is always changing
people but the tendency today to say
that you know Moore's law will always be
mail you out and you know that's been a
case of a few thousand we've had a
window whether it's been true is it true
today
maybe but bate effects are growing and
memory isn't getting quite you know it's
not getting as fast as quickly so and
you know once one came to write software
that lasts for much longer than you ever
planned for it to so you can't afford
not to spend some time considering it I
spoke to a colleague at a twenty billion
dollar hedge fund who does algorithmic
trading and I asked how big his data
sets are today compared to ten years
back and he said more left-hand times
and obviously memories any twice as fast
so you know he said that as far as
prototyping goes you can drag numpy from
his cold dead hands
but when it came to processing logs
Python just choked you know when he got
to tens of gigs and where is you know
you with with D which is what he used
things were fine and it was basically
productive than that so in 2014 I
started to build some tools applying
technology to the investment process you
know in either distinct processes not
it's really discretionary places and
I wanted to steal my own problems and I
figured that you know by solving these
likely others who who will benefit and
that's been the case I started out with
pison and incise and and for various
reasons it wasn't the thing for me I
mean it was a plea to start with it's
not a Python book so I leave it there
but I surely must be a better solution
and I could have searched around and and
that's how I found E so what is D it's a
multi-paradigm programming language is
written C and C++ it's borrowed ideas
from many different sources and in
return has been a source of ideas for
other languages originally the concept
was you know C++ done right and it's no
longer that it's just it's same thing
the guys behind it - two men one Walter
bright he was the first he's the first
chapter write a C++ compiler you know
native C++ compiler for the PC and he
all saves the only any person to have
ever written entirety was flattened pile
by himself and you know the advantages
is that history because developing
things in those days resources were very
constrained and so he was a small
company competing with many large
companies so his age was to make it very
fast the compiler is very fast and
that's still case today and the other
person involved is Andre Alexander s key
some of you may know him he's known or
somewhat a notorious for his work on
template metaprogramming and the
inventor of the term ones he first bus
even made several books on that idea he
was until very recently a research
scientist at Facebook and he sort of
deployed be there some winds say for
example V there C and C++ preprocessor
is written in D and it's significantly
faster than what they had before and one
reason for that was that they were
because E is a pasty
it allows to take very rapidly
say of course yes in theory you could
write it just as quickly in many
different languages but because it was
because because it can pass quickly and
you were able to refer it quickly and
there's a built-in profiler they were to
make it very fast you know recently
modest cost and he's open-source done so
there's a kind of creative tension
between the two men you know and raise
quite a high level thinker you know with
her back academic background in computer
science will to smooth move an
engineering type he's got a strong
aesthetic sense you know code should
look right on the page and the
consequences are this combinational bit
you know it's well it's very well
designed language the language and
standard library but at the same time
all these little things that make
programming you know either hello or
pleasure to use are you know they were
all little things are all done right and
it's sort of a notorious complaint and
the on the forums amongst people who
pregnant if it's less than a day jobs
that it's really difficult for them to
continue to do that because they know
how much more sort of elegantly and
briefly it can be done indeed I mean I
think it's interesting too I mean news
gave this talk and it's become sound by
that you know productivity people focus
far too much on ops premature
optimization and you know she favors and
the three percent really matters and in
the same talk he also talked about the
benefits of having a proliferation of
languages of different ways of thinking
and about algorithms you know a premium
language is really an expression of
thought and so there's benefit to having
language that matches the way you think
and it's suited to the problem to make
you know you only there's a kind of you
know there's an aesthetic aspect as well
if you if if language is a pleasure to
use and it fit with what you're trying
to do once this much more productive and
efficient and it's easier to read your
code and others code in the
language say what is the you know what's
it like
really it's opinionated for some
respects so you know Luke shadowing is
up loud you can't reuse a local variable
inside a block and then you know that I
just was really irritated by that in the
beginning how dare you tell me what to
do but but actually looking at it and
seeing thing compile error messages I
found that very often it called many
areas that I just would have made
without realizing it and been painful to
to find before to talk it's quite sort
through and it says you need to be not
too opinionated you can sort of pick the
style of code according to the problem
you know that you face so if you want to
write the light feed to use on an
embedded device well like the better see
to use on an embedded device you can do
that you can also program it quite a
high level and you know it's got to
those functional concepts the mutability
thought paradise of those message
passing the web the fact that it can
pulse fast is quite you know is i found
to be a reasonably advantage occurs and
you know you could start off with a
simple little prototype and and you know
see what results are you can you can
iterate quickly and sort of the code
kind of morphs in a quite a dynamic way
which makes it much easier to adapt to
the problem and you don't quite sure
what the solution should look like but
also you know you're in my area of the
business changes very quickly so even
though in some sense home base client
and the guys providing a solution I
don't exactly know what I want to be
doing you know next month because I'm
not in control of the market and you
know what I need to be doing what will
shift is market conditions shift
I get to a start bait by you know
exploring bigger than Tuesday you know
it's not for everyone and it's certainly
not as mature languages you know C++ is
you know which has benefits and quality
it's probably not great for building
very complex security interfaces they're
arguing libraries you can do quite a lot
but if you need to use any of the kind
of large super nice frame works you're
going to have to either you know if you
do that you're going to have to accept
your it'll be a bit bit of work to you
know their bindings but they're not
perfectly maintained I think also if
you've got you know team move relatively
experienced junior programmers and you
know they need to be productive quite
quickly
in other words like the situation that
gay was developed for then documentation
is you know is okay it's getting better
but it's not it's not like Python where
you know you can google for a solution
and it'll be broken down for you and
beautifully presented so that's
certainly an area that you need to be a
problem it's actually a pretty good
language for scripting which is funny
for you know see family language but the
set of libraries is more limited so if
you want to if you're doing a whole
bunch of different things and today
using 100 be two more another then
there's probably a you know you might
want to think about about about whether
it's best thing for that I think also if
you you're creating with large code base
citizen C family I mean you know people
use it for Java to talk to Java but you
then you need to do some work to create
the interface and my reasons I mean I
mean dentists the the thoughtful
commentators I'm ready for providing
threading me at this list and I think
that I mean there's these sort of
standard talking points everyone and
races that says that you know it's a
pain to learning new language so the
first thing that you hear when someone
talks about something new is
and not to spend the time and and I
think that's great
so you know listen to standard talking
points it may be never applied or once
it apply and don'ts emerged today one is
you know because they used to be to
standard libraries to tango versus
fables that sort of ancient history now
there are there are three different
compilers to say those and the reference
compiler called DMV and that's you know
that's developed by Walter bright it's
very fast you know people say go as fast
with this you know game B's really first
it to the extent that you can use it I
mean you can use it as in a script so
you could have had a shebang and you
know run it dynamically you can use it
in a Python notebook which is quite no
so you can sort of into a great spice
then there's an LLVM back end and a DCT
back end so there's slightly slower than
DMD they still you know recently first
but you know the the code DMVs code
speed is you know Walters focusing on
language not keeping his compiler
cutting-edge City MD is a bit slower
then then then the LLVM or GCC compilers
but it you know it's fine for many
things but if the performance really
matters you know you probably not going
to want to use DMD you know impact you
know you impact this B and they share
the same front-end so there's not you
know fragmentation of having different
parties it's an advantage particularly
for running on on different devices
because you know GCC and there will be n
run of many different things there the
compiler is records compiled U is not
strictly open source but you know it's
up and github and the only reason it's
not is just Walter wrote the back end
when he was working with someone else
and he's just not able to completely
open source it but in practice you know
if you want to be distributed just ask
him it'll say please don't see me and
it's fine
it is a garbage collection language and
very often people carry preconceptions
with and you know from the early days
Java whatever so people sometimes have
these religious almost religious sort of
opposition's at UC I mean it's not an
amazing garbage collector it's it's a
lot better than it was but you don't
need to use it if you don't want to it's
quite it's really it's pretty easy to
avoid using too you can use there's a an
alligator that Andre has written and he
talked about it at the sequel classic on
recently you know porting it to super
for us really
so they're containers that go on top of
that and it's pretty easy you know to
use free lists or you know local heaps
you know fruits it's it's a bit a little
bit more work but it's you know really
fairly easy my other concerns it's you
know being around since 2001 and not
gone anywhere I mean there's this weird
thing where people think that what
people say about languages is the same
thing as what's going on for whatever
reason it's not ruin as much process
some other languages but you know what
actually counts is our people using it
here are some statistics on daily
compiled it downloads since 2013 so you
can see that you know it's volatile and
tends to go down over the summer but
it's increased from 200 downloads a day
to you know 1,300 and you know the other
aspect that particularly large users
concerned about is you know every
language seems to need a corporate
sponsor to take off you know games
google java you know sun and sea even
see had you know labs community bet and
and that would have been a reasonable
concern twenty people it's changed you
can't yesterday say there's a company
called semantic that started by two
weeks ago and PhDs they be drafted from
scratch they probably do this the
advertising biddings say
you know you when you go to your browser
and you see an advert that space is
auctioned off the real in real time
right it's sort of soft real time and
they've written that completely indeed
and you know the sponsoring the XD
conference and there and ray left his
job at Facebook to work a default time
they set up a thief and a ssin and this
is sort of the first thing to come out
of it so they're you know they've got
bought for 200 million dollars by done
Humby which is a division of Tesco I
didn't know they were safe so technology
arranges but if they are they go yeah
they got water to move in and they're
going to be much more you know active
and indie and I think they're sponsoring
it I've touched on the generic business
Tuesday before I go on to you know what
I what I found to be helpful um you know
this medic-2 very similar to see in
sneakers per se you know there's one
company that uses V and they said we
give C++ programmers code to read and
like it's a test to see whether they can
make sense of it sometimes and we gave
people decode and even if they've never
seen D they can read it so you know the
basic mathematical operations object
layout it's calling conventions they are
very very similar you can take code
that's written in C or C++ and chose a
deeply straightforwardly without you
know makes many changes I think pison
Python that's not sort of heavily meta
programming is also quite easy to pause
you know on the library fund it's quite
important that you can you know it
connects directly to to C so if you want
to declare a D function with with the C
calling convention you just write X turn
C before it C so you know you can call C
so you can call D it's all very
straightforward and you can use you know
if you want to you can use pointers and
and so on the C++ integration is getting
better it sort of it works now but
because
destructors are not there say so people
are within a year I guess you can
probably be able to use you know
standard string and so on the like you
know the language very plastic and one
of the reasons for that is that it's got
some very nice piloting capabilities so
you've got you've got template and
string mix-ins
compiled time function execution I mean
C++ is having some of these things now
but you can do more indeed it's sort of
a lot easier so even if the language
doesn't quite do what you want you can
you know but he does you can feel the
cheat your goal by using making you
think functions and you know the the
reason that it's useful for me is that I
can I could have a model of what I want
to achieve you know as a as an
investment guy who does technology
rather than a pure technology guy
because like it's important to me to be
able to solve my problems
you know technology's a superpower to
solve your own problems and so it kind
of allows you to you know map your model
of things to code without you know being
forced into a box it just doesn't fit
fit your problem and what you're trying
to do you know in it's fast bits its
naive and Andreas's said at Facebook
about C++ it now even leave written C++
will be fast you know it'll be fast
reasonably fast and that's generally the
case first year as well so currently the
fastest jsonparser in the world only
some benchmark is units like between
three five seconds to pass a million
lines of XY say Jason coordinates you
know and I guess C is two seconds or
something of course you know C can be
made as fast 50 but the point is that
because it's very easy to iterate and
because you can combine you can combine
sort of quite high-level concept with in
line as an
it's easy to make it fast so you I have
maybe slightly unconventional
backgrounds or media compared to many
people who were talking here I said
we're going in 1983 and I used
programming in my work you know in
finance so I'm basically a portfolio
manager so I I try and take you know I
try and take iPhone with you about
opportunities markets and technologies
obviously a very powerful tool to help
you do that
I you know programmed it about 2003 and
then I got just got to unity to to be
able to justify the time things changed
a bit I think that you know I set up a
hedge fund and we had sixteen hundred
people applying for you know two jobs
and you know I had a guy who had done
for the postdoc had been away for
several years you know writing code for
a living pretty much and I found that
it's very difficult to to communicate
what I wanted to do without
understanding you know current
technological possibilities so you know
you need to combine an understanding of
Technology and the problem domain in my
mind if you want to get an effective you
know an effect of high quality solution
that solve the problem well I mean
you'll get there in the end otherwise so
it's totally pregnant again in 2014
having kind of thought about it you know
I found I mean like I let Python to
start with and I found D actually I mean
I'd a nice you already which maybe means
it's not a fair comparison
but I found D pretty pretty easy to
learn it's one of the nice things is you
don't need to learn the whole language
to start with I mean I think often with
when you're when you're learning new
language the problem is that you're used
to feeling extremely competent and you
start off with something new and it's
you know
there's this big energy gap until you
can actually be productive so the kids
you can just start out writing a
straight C you know that that's you
don't have that problem to the same
extent so you can start off you know
using pointers whatever using malloc and
step-by-step as you kind of you know you
read a bit about it you can try
something and you can learn the advanced
features you know pretty relatively
straightforwardly you know it's easy to
port your existing code if you want to
you can embed Python in D and you know
you don't need to worry about about sort
of reference counting and so on that's
all taken care of for you by by this
kind of compile time you know major
programming see you so I you know I do a
lot of stuff indeed but for something
like a web scraper
there's no point my grukk tried to pull
battle rewrite it so I you know I embed
a user I use like phantom jeaious i
embed that as a string in my decode so
the bit you know that that control the
browser is is in Python but then the
high-level logic and is indeed so it's
lots in very nicely with rest to my case
which is is mostly D so the D community
I think some languages are you know they
kind of had very good marketing and it's
very well presented and they can it suck
you in and you know with with an
attractive composition and when you get
down to it it it's a little bit more
complicated it's not quite as I mean
it's true but it's more complex than
that D is I think historically the
people involved have been you know
they've been hardcore programmers hacker
types and so they're moist writing code
then in the mortgage money kids and in
kind of making it shiny it's very much
not a glossy shiny language today so the
impression you get it is quite mote
workman like it's not you know I think
it's a little hidden gem it's better
then you think in first look if you yeah
well cumin beings I'm with interest by
the way somebody to present it's a
community where people have certified no
on personal you know if the good thing
in for the head high standards but it's
easy when to get you know just one of
you documentation it's you know when I
when I started using to you it was
that's it
completely correct and clear because I
had about cranny computer science it's
it was a please be play work and that's
that's much better now it's still an
area of development and there's some
distance to will make a difference you
know with Python you can just you'll see
you know twenty Stack Overflow answers
and like D you might may find it but you
may not and say they don't even you know
so no one will get much further if you
ask me happen but when you do us to help
people I mean
I bet my dip their cake for them in even
quite sort of large pieces who was he
found that D was fast but then pison
multi-processing was much faster and was
to do with memory allocation to this in
any relief which downside is in the
beginning it's you're not aware not
clear what is so I got rearranged escape
room and it was you know much faster and
you know that's been oh the because it's
a small community it's grown but you do
have benefit to being able to interact
with some of the you know Lola cats
forgiveness in the world to see a guy
that I that I hired me and you know it's
taking free calls from you know and very
own example you can't you couldn't buy
that and I you know I think generally
the community's the language and the
community are in a transition phase so
two years ago it was you know well I'm
gels programmer and this is how I used
to eat my personal projects and that's
changed quite a lot notably so now it's
sort of like well where it companies
that we're doing we using D to do these
things so that's my cigarette case in
Cadiz no it's it's sort of hard to
capture it they relatively diffuse and
nice project and that's
one of the things I'm doing is I've got
some market data and you know market age
can be different forms and like even for
the same instrument so at the very least
for multi data you have a date
and the clothes that you know you might
have open high low close you might have
a high low close maybe you have volume
an interest maybe you wait and then you
know maybe it'll be intraday data or
daily data but I'm also interested in
historical data to say you know
obviously a date from 1727 generally is
an error but it might not be for some
kinds of you know something if you're in
a very long term time series you know he
doesn't begin with the first point in a
Bloomberg chart so if you very long time
time time so if you might want a
different kind of date that that has a
different way of validating it so so
this is a my kind of price bar a price
bar meaning just like one price
representing one time period so this you
know and I can have different choices of
I can represent it using a float a
double or an int along with whatever it
is I want that's the value type there so
the sort of static if is a compile time
is compile time code so it is it kind of
it's a it's a very flexible this
basically can be templated based on
price bar type I can use Slaton quick to
a fixed point which is what the decimal
places is there and so I can create an
instance of this that's adapted to the
particular series I have then if I
actually said that this type is defined
at compile time but I can then write a
generic routine that will take we'll
take this price bar and operate on it
you know by treating it in the generic
way so
I don't if he really the sort of
technical analysis but there's a
Japanese chart in Sydney called it
Jamaica it's not very complicated but
this is you know many languages will be
a lot more clay than this say this takes
the the syntax for DS a bit different
say some price bar is is the is a
template parameter and you know I pass
it some bars and some parameters and it
doesn't need to know you know whether
it's got volume worried interest this
particular function you know another
look it's not used in the calculation so
I can pass I can I can I can pass the
deck around and sort of and treat it
kinetically so I mean let's see that's
the kind of overall picture of of D but
I'm very happy to to go into a bit more
detail depending upon what's most
industry
yes definitely yes
so if I if I speak Sicilian honestly in
the beginning I rate it like T because
that's that's the language O's familiar
with and it's well it you know the use
of many years and over time you know I
sort of like loops and so on because it
felt familiar but over time I became you
know more comfortable with Dane things
you know maybe not in a super high-level
way but you know using a mutable data
for you know message passing rather than
you know sharing data in yes completely
I mean it's you know you've got lambdas
and you know their first class project
so you can and you know it's caught and
raised written this library called you
know STD algorithm and it's really
pretty good and it's it's you don't you
can you don't need to be that clever to
use it so you can you know you it's
called
algorithm and there's also functional
stuff in in a set like they say you know
what i'm doing i you know i can use map
filter ii reduce quite a lot and it
makes much easy to see what's going on I
think over time probably I'm using that
direction to take case I've got people
who are more familiar with some of those
paradigms to need to work on the code
base
any other questions yeah so a few little
bits one is they're sensitive so I've
got a multi data server and that's you
know I saw I stole this data initiative
five and use a library written by the
guy one of the founders of 0m q nany
message to kind of you know talk to
clients so it's very easy and
straightforward and it's really not much
code and then I have various systemic
building blocks for price data and at
one level you know the highest frequency
that I really care that Macy's
one-minute buzz say performance isn't
that big a deal but sometimes you're
going to have the stuff inside you know
a couple of layers release and there'll
be some kind of fitting thing and you
really care about it then so I'm trying
to kind of write stuff with some
forethought then you know there's a kind
of charting thing that's sort of a
necessary evil because I'm more certain
you know you need to be able to child
stuff to see it to be sure it's correct
you know I had the idea to look it what
I really want to do is look at time
raisins - one minute through one month
but displaced very simply so I'm just
looking at a daily chart because the
problem is the information you get a get
overwhelmed of stuff and you can't you
know if you try and do it by hand
it gets very tiring then listen let's
say sentiment analysis type work that's
sort of at a relatively early stage and
you know again it's nice that you know
text is there's quite a lot of it and
people say you're constrained by a bit
2.1 gigabits per second with the
consumer-grade sse it cost us the tune
up and say first of half a terabyte say
to eat and that's an area that's really
working currently and I
you know we quite interesting and
there's sort of some other things and on
top of that any other questions about
about the language
you look puzzled
so the the like the first the easy thing
to do the easiest thing to do is to use
a garbage collector so you know there
are a lot of people who have a very
similar version you know you just hear
the word Leroy in front of mal and I
think those is to do though these
connotations of the early days of Java
and I can understand that
you know I felt the same way once um but
what it helps with is correctness so you
know you know you're going to be needing
to worry about leaking and you know your
code is quite clear obviously the
problem is really really latency not not
necessarily speed I mean it uses more
memory and maybe is expensive compared
to many other resources so the d GC is
is not the strongest point but it's
gotten up a lot better so you know most
most objects are not that big and you
missed you know there's some areas you
really need to be concerned about but
you know it's not going to be that much
bit um that being said if you you know
if you want first of all you can use
malloc - you don't need to or you know
you don't need to easy GC but it's
probably better to use and there's a
library by and very alexandrovsky called
STD experimental allocator so you can
use many different allocation strategies
like you can mix mix and you can use
free list you can use fruit and of
course that's still fairly low level so
you might want to have something on top
of that so there's a container library
but run design via phone called entity
that they do you can emit modeling
they're in the New York Times and so
it's quite easy to have to have
containers that go on top of that so you
need to be a bit thoughtful about it if
it's memory is really you know a key
area for you but it's not that hard to
be thoughtful I mean I have been
programming in in see if quite some time
and yet you know I picked it up quite
quickly to say
actually speaking you know I mean for
sure for some people it may be you know
a killer but I think it's many fewer
than they think so um so lobbies are so
first we can cough is he cool any she
library and C++ is you know working
prego some things you can do some things
you can't one of the guys that's working
with me his written some GPU you know
libraries and he's but I wouldn't say
that I you know honestly you can there's
they're like three different choices and
they're all robust and complete and you
could definitely do it and you can find
things to help you but you need to put
some work into doing it you can't expect
just to immediately start writing code
but there are definitely people using a
sense of computing yeah yes pretty much
I mean it's a it's a language that can
be as low level as you like say you know
you can do that and there's a pretty
cool deal and science and there's
definitely worth checking out and that's
one of the areas that you know that
they're going to be I think emphasizing
um so familiar I think and rated the
target of 2000 pull requests for the
first half of the year for the language
of the library and I think it fell short
by 150 or something say you know the
there quite a few people that there's a
guy Japan called Kenji the slightly
mysterious character and he's just you
know goblet a you know machine in in
fixing bugs so there all kinds of
different people involved to a greater
or lesser extent you know it has a
decent community and you can just go to
github and check it out for yourself and
see they don't trust me so um so yes I
mean thank you very much for coming is
you know I'd say that it's not a fully
mature language but it's definitely
something that you can realign I'm
advising someone who's managing you know
Odyssey billion dollars and I always
thought about it quite carefully before
entrusting you know I've got my
reputation on the line because if
they're real forms of the language it's
it's terrible for me
and I thought about it quite hot long
and hard and talk to a few different
people and it's lonely you can you know
if it seems people trying to do and you
don't mind some rough edges somewhere
that it's definitely you know it can
definitely be very very useful and it
it's been so much more productive for me
my client was very concerned about the
amount of time it might take to see some
things I wanted and you know I went home
and I read something in you know four
hours and after that was because I
couldn't figure out how to plot
histograms and using this chart library
say but that sort of thing might might
have taken you know weeks doing it via
another page so for me it's been very
good to be very productive it's fast and
the best thing really is that you can
find very smart people for the community
you know it's like the old pipes and
paradox but it's you know once upon a
time pie some guys are really good so
even if they didn't program Python you
wanted to hire pike
bogum is that's you know i think the
case is d now thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
