to learn and licks here and I want to
suggest another way I am surg it from
rails for company and I will talk about
how to learn elixir why ipod worse so
when we start learning a new language we
hit into this three challenges we need
to sound find some practical task we
need to find good code examples and then
we need to discover important idioms and
tricks and that makes us native fluent
speaker in this new language so to solve
this issue I found for myself this site
is a Greek community site it has dozens
of different programming changes from
very easy to very complex and heart and
they support like eight different
languages you can sew them Justin
browser it's not like on exorcism II or
you just you have in browser console and
editor and you can see how your test
pass and the greatest pass part of this
service is when you solve the challenge
then you see how other people solve it
and then you can infer very cool tricks
and idioms and stuff I for myself using
it to to grope Haskell and to polish my
JavaScript skills and I found a lot of
very nice stuff which is really hard to
find even in very root cause on github
so when I start learning elixir I asking
myself whether I can use code words
about the sad part Alex you is not
supported yet on cod Wars so I connected
the guys I asked them can I help you
implement this and they give me
documentation and I implemented runner
for for this service so probably next
week same promises to the
you're Alex you're super focal worse and
then we all can benefit from this
service to to study it so I invite you
all to join when this happen to join
alexia community I'm code worst come you
can solve existing gutters you can
observe cool tricks from other people
you can invent yukatas and even simpler
way is to translate cutters from already
present land which there are cool
cutters from Haskell JavaScript Ruby
closure another for sure you will grow
also as a side effect your
problem-solving skills is not only
elixir it's common problem solving
skills you will grow your elixir mastery
and you will have fun thank
I love Tigers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
