technical lead at Weber novel
technologies and today I would like to
tell you how to make even saw sink
composable using functional programming
patterns so I won't be boring you with
the actual story behind it but just know
that many of the patterns you're about
to see are actually used on major
projection systems in our company at the
end of the talk I also give you a link
to to the wrapper where you can find the
slides and all of the code in this talk
and even more so what's the plan for
today so in the first part we'll define
basic building blocks for insourcing and
you'll see that an imperative approach
has severe limitations in terms of
composability and then in the second
part we'll explore how functional
programming principles can help us
overcome these composability problems ok
but first let's start with a quick recap
so how many of you have ever done even
sourcing ok so that's cool I think I can
skip with introduction we'll you'll know
that it's a bit about storing changes to
to the state of the system instead of
restoring the state the current state
itself I'll just skip those so what this
talk is not going to be about its any
particular framework or architectural
concerns I wouldn't be speaking also
about error handling instead I want to
focus on the programming part on on
composability and and I want to show you
how how to design a simple but powerful
API in a foreigner sourcing from a
developer's point of view so we first
need to define some basic building
blocks so first as a double model I will
be using Turtles come on in in
simulation tool kits so a turtle has an
identity a position and a direction ok
and there are three comments we have for
operating on Turtles we have one comment
to create turtles and we have one
comment to make it turn to make to make
an existing turtle turn and I recommend
to make it walk in the direction in this
face
so let's close this new closer at the
implementation one of these comments I
saw for example the creation command so
if you look if you look sorry at the
return type you see that we have an
either that's because we want to do some
very simple validation for example we
don't want to create Turtles too far
away from the origin of the plane
otherwise we actually create the turtle
ok so here is the basic demo of what
code with such a model could look like
so we define a helper common the
composite common actually where we have
a turtle walk right right so it works
first and then it turns right and then
we can we can actually have a for
comprehension where we subsequently call
different comments and finally we can
have a very simple unit test for a final
state okay so there is a slight problem
in this code well the state is pasted
from from step to step but we can just
use flat map to avoid this that's why we
Kurt we carried the functions in the
first place okay you'll see that it will
be convenient also in the last in the
later parts of the talk so we have a
model now so how can we didn't source it
so we simple the simplest way is just to
define some events one procurement so
we'll have a created event a current
event and I walked event which is
correspond to comments we we've defined
before then we need an even under so
basically at the simplest form and even
Honduras is just a function you to use
to follow a sequence of events so if you
if we look closer at the signature
you'll see that in the input you
actually take an option of state we do
so in order to be able to handle
creation events when we don't we don't
have state yet however in the output we
actually for the sake of simplicity in
this talk I will abstract from error
handling not being able to reply
persistent event is usually a very
serious problem so in this talk I just
consider that in normal condition there
has to be an output to the handler
however instead of just returning the
state we wrap it in a sum instead so why
do we do this well
simply so that we can actually chain
more people even handler application
right because the Sun this is a morphic
with with just a state but it's also a
subtype of option so we will be without
much boilerplate we'll be able to to use
it will to fold events and this is an
example of of the actual event handler
implementation so we have a case for the
creation event where we just created
turtle we have a case for an event
adjourned events where we copied the
turtle by I make it it rotate and then
finally we have some we have some we
have to somehow handle invalid
transitions so again there are better
ways of modeling this kind of a failure
but I won't be covering them today for
lack of time so an example of using this
model what we have the initial state
which is just empty that you have a
sequence of events a created event a
work event a current event we just is
just replaying those event is just as
simple as following them with villain
hunter and then we can we can check we
can make any test to check the final the
final state just note that I'm using
that value not get is dot value on the
sum type and not get on the option type
which obviously you shouldn't be using
no that's safe okay but still there is a
bit of boilerplate in this even hundred
definition we can make it better by
using a factory which which would take
care of all your place for us so for
example we can make it a factory like
this which will handle the errors for us
and also wrap all the cases we want to
support in this ops so that's much more
readable so now let's look at the
commands so at the top you can see the
command before introducing in the
sourcing and in the bottom we see that
we are actually introducing some
interaction right instead of directly
changing the state we first create an
event and then we've moved the domain
logic into the handler to me to modify
the state based on this event okay so
let's make a quick recap so so far we've
seen how to model the domain and how to
define events and even say handlers at
the simplest
so what more could we want well there is
one thing we still like in this miss
approach and it's composability okay so
what's the problem here there are two
units of composition we can consider
we're talking about even sourcing we may
want to compose even hunters or we might
want to compose commence composing even
hunters is very simple because there are
just functions so composing functions is
know about this all programming function
functional programming is about
however composing commands is less
trivial let us see why so you might ask
why bother composing commands well
remember the walk write function we had
before it's actually composite command
we basically composed to existing
commands to create a new one okay how do
you even source it how about these
turnaround where you can pose two turns
or make a u-turn so there are two
approaches the first one is to create a
new type of event for every new command
no problem is is not extensible let's
see the last UI consider we might have
also other even hunter a scenario system
for example this one computes the total
distance travelled by a turtle okay so
every time we would add an even which is
related to distance we will need to
update any handler in our system which
is concerned with distance so basically
overlapping even semantics can lead to a
model which is really hard to reason
about we could try to pull out some
weird even interesting strategies but
this much simpler to just use
composition so the alternative approach
would be just to define a small set of
atomic events and compose other
operations out of these events right so
walking right is just working then
turning turning around is just turning
twice basically this is what we would do
without even sourcing so why should it
be any different now so let us see how
how we could emit multiple events at
once so let's go back to our work write
function so we replay
the previous code so now it compute
events instead of the state so what are
we missing we need a state here we need
to pass a state right to be able to
generate the new event we can do it by
simply using the handler to replay the
previous event on the original state
okay it's important to note that this
new state only exists in memory is
little it's never persisted anyway it
only exists so that we may be able to
emit a new event and then what hold it
to we need to return something for our
composite command we don't have much
choice here we need to somehow be able
to return both events and obviously for
this to work we need to be able to
persist eventually multiple if multiple
events in an atomic way so we'll need
some kind of abstraction like this which
is able to do this and if the idea of
persisting multiple events at once
surprises you I just know that we are
not the only ones to do this i Gregg
young students store is also based on
the concept of atomic comet which
contains multiple events occur
persistent vaca persistence API also lo2
to persist multi multiple events at once
so we can compose commands now are we
good well not really because there are
some limits in in the code just so a
hearted error handling which forces us
to do this for comprehension this code
is pretty pretty much imperative the
problem with this is that it doesn't
scale all right so we need to manually
replay the events and every step we need
to make sure we accumulate events in
exactly the right order which is very
very prone and also when you need to
make sure we propagate subsequent events
in state correctly which is also ever
prone so let's see how we can improve it
and let's use a more functional approach
for it okay so we they still have three
problems we are seeking to solve but
first is how to reply intermediate
events but second is how to accumulate
new events and the third is how to
propagate state
so let's start by the first problem
replaying intermediate events so this is
the code we want to improve okay so this
is just demo we had before without even
sourcing but with this variables first
implementation so we can all agree that
is very error-prone and not very
friendly to read so how can how could we
automate it the part the replying part
this is the subsequent replying part
how about extracting the this common
logic into a helper function so
basically we have we have two cases we
need to handle creation and modification
okay and and so this is this is the most
important part of the talk because
basically the idea is that after
creating the event will automatically
and immediately reply it through the
Handler and will associate to the event
the state resulting from that event okay
so basically if we look at the the type
signatures of these helpers we actually
lifting events in two tuples of event
and state and this state is the result
of that event it's not persistent yet so
it just like it's just virtual just in
memory however it allows us to compose
and command and chain subsequent
operations and we'll see that this is
very powerful abstraction so if you come
back at our example basically we can
replace it with such a syntax we just
have to to source the commands and we
get the event and the state we didn't
have to reply it automatically okay so
so this is how our target code looks
look like now at least the reply is
being done for us we still need to
accumulate the event so we still need to
propagate the state but the first first
problem is solved so how about the
second one we still need to emit events
in the right order at the end so what if
we could somehow accumulate them at each
step of the for comprehension and that
brings us to the next part
remember our helper so we are lifting
these events in two tuples so what
if we believe them into a class instead
so that we might write a flat map method
on that class so we'll actually be
storing a sequence of events into this
class not a single one because we'll be
wanting to accumulate them so this is
what this case class may look like
so we other helper method to be able to
extract the events while dropping the
state eventually and we can also define
the flat map method and as you can see
we're just generalizing the pattern from
above
so we first extract in the current
events and the current stand state
represent represented by an in the
instance of this class then we're
feeding them include the continuation
which is just a function from state to
another source instance we return
extracting the events and the new state
and finally we were wrapping it all into
another sorest instance which contains
the concatenation of events and the new
state ok so I hope you can see that it's
easy to write a pure function to make it
hopefully a monnet of course a flat map
and a pure function doesn't make em on
that they need to follow and respect the
Malolos however instead of proving that
this implementation does it I just show
that well it's actually only just a
special case with something called the
writer monad which many of you may know
right so if you use libraries like cat
or scalesi you can just actually
redefine the source monads as an ally as
true to a writer monad along with some
helpers
so the real novelty here is that is the
are those helper functions where we
replay events into a monad just after
their creation so we can update the
return type of our helpers and rewrite
our example just like this so we no
longer we no longer see the events we
already we just see the state resulting
from the command and if we compare it to
the code without even sourcing in the
first place and you can see that it is
basically with
if if we actually move this miss helper
inside the definition of a command this
code becomes identical so basically even
sourcing that becomes an implementation
detail of your code your your Dominic
can focus on what's important but just
like a synchronicity with futures act
like you're handling with other diary
types even sourcing becomes becomes
transparent yeah so this is we can still
extract the events at the end right so
we can still well so it's a new turtle
that make it work right and finally
extract the events and so let's solve
the second problem of accumulating new
events so let's look back at state
propagation
well obviously just like we did before
we can use a flat map we can give up on
the syntax syntactic sugar or for
comprehension just use flop Maps and
then we don't have to to propagate the
state manually it's not okay so it looks
like we're already we're finally there
we've managed to automatically reply
accumulate and propagate the state and
the events in the top safe and
transparent way unfortunately I don't
have really time for it today if there
are even better ways to propagate state
because that's not that it's not really
really site because you can actually
make a map here and you can make some
modification which stay in memory and
are not represented by events so there
is another there's another better
approach you can find it in English
slides in the repo however let's see
what what are the benefits from this
approach for example one thing is that
this melodic approach allows us to
actually compose comments of different
instances so for example we can easily
write the function like this which makes
which applies any modification on to
Turtles at the same time so basically
what what we do is we we update the
first and then we update the second we
turn a couple of updated Turtles but
underneath the events were first and the
second one are accumulated so basically
we can we can say them atomic automata
atomically into an even store as a
single transaction so of course there is
a trade-off between consistency and
scalability here because if you want to
update multiple instances like this you
need to make sure that there are events
and that in the same units of
distribution right so it needs to be to
be used by weave care but if we if
you're more concerned about consistency
than scalability that could that could
be an interesting thing another
interesting application concerns
concurrency because as we see we can
actually now right
declarative programs which can be run on
an instance to produce a fight side
effects okay all the modifications we
wanted to do with the turtle while we
just we just get an object out of it
so thirsteee so the implication is that
it's very easy to introduce optimistic
locking on top of it we can easily fetch
hydrate and instance by replaying the
events from the store compute new events
using this program try to precede the
events if nothing else has changed since
and if it fails well you can just retry
until it works or we give up so it it
actually allows us to have something
similar to a software transactional
memory using this this syntax so let's
sum up
let's into diet with what what can be
the the basic building blocks of even
sourcing API
I hope you've seen I hope I managed to
to to show you how why composability is
important and we've seen that functional
approach can help us achieve such
composability and in such a way then
even sourcing actually becomes an
implementation detail of our code so if
you want to play with the code you can
find it in the following repo there is
even more than what I have covered today
is no
library though but you'll feel free to
do to pick the code and comply with its
so thank you for listening I hope you
enjoyed it and do you have any questions
how would you handle side effects in in
such code yeah basically would use some
some kind of Freeman art or Douglass
final if yes how does your approach
compose with those and if not how else
would you would you isolate those two
side effects actually you don't do side
effects in such a code you only emit
events right these events already refi
your side effects so what if you're
asking is okay how could I have some
side effects apart from anything the
event right well the way we usually
solve it is that we first persist the
events which represent the side effects
we want to to have and then we have a
projection which is code which streams
the events and applies the side effects
while guaranteeing at least once
semantics so we usually do it outside of
the part of the code which actually
creates the events because that way that
way the creation is actually side-effect
free so you can we can have optimistic
locking it on top of it and so on hi
thank you very much for the presentation
the question is following in your mana
decomposition or rather flat maps you
accumulate a state that exists in memory
to later save it somewhere what happens
if your runtime explodes at the middle
of it well obviously it only exists in
memory that's the whole point of it I
mean like did you think about like
usually when you do events or sand you
really like really care about events and
not
in them adÃ¨le well it depends on the
semantics of what you want to achieve my
assumption is that when you do composite
code when you do atomic simple commands
you want them to be atomic and my
assumption is also that if when you
compose commands you also want this
composition to be atomic so basically we
don't want intermediate events to be
persistent if we if we fail halfway
through thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
