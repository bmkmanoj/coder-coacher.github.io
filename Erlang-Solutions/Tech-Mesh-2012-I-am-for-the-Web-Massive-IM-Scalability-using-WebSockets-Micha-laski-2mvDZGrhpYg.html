work at airline solutions and today I
will talk about a chat feature I'm going
to chat about chat feature about some
chat protocols shot servers and some
tests that we have executed on the chat
server that I want to talk about so you
can see I'm in a very chatty mood today
I've also be available to chat after my
talk if you like so what is chapped
feature that I'm here it's a text-based
communication between two or more users
some of you may remember on the talk
which was a unix based application where
you could talk with other users login in
the same system it was split your screen
into two and then we have some other
applications like IRC channels which
would allow many users to communicate
and over the years those messengers
evolved so you got icq which was a
desktop application and AOL instant
messengers nowadays those messengers
integrate not only text whatever
integrated voice video you know
geolocation you name it everything is
available integrated you can see 12
people speaking at the same time and not
only messengers use this chat feature
the ability to chat with other fellows
is actually an interesting social
feature so social networking providers
integrate a chat feature in their
applications to you can see facebook
chat google talk and katoch there are
also some other new applications poking
up like talk TV for example where it's
about the baseball game play but with
some additional social twist where you
can chat with your colleagues while
watching the game or big life where you
can
comment some movie and watch the movie
with other people so again it's it's the
chat feature added to some other
application which makes it more social
and you have games you will have in game
chat systems just to enable people to
talk and put together teams which will
fight dragons or communicate on during
the gameplay so again games as we can
see especially online moot online
multiplayer games may adapt this chat
feature and this is another use case for
it so having all this in mind and
choosing picking the right protocol to
satisfy all those different use cases
such protocol should cutter to the web
most of the games or is now played on
the web mobile devices or even
machine-to-machine use cases because as
I will explain later some of the
features of chat protocols can be used
also for other than chat purposes okay
in this talk i want to say few words
about XMPP which is one of the instant
messaging protocols how many of you have
heard of XMPP okay that's good I have to
have some slides which quickly go
through some of the XMPP features and
history it started over 10 years ago
initially it was jabber which was
invented by Jeremy Miller and then it
got standardized some first project
started to be implemented including in
jeopardy which has started over 10 years
ago once it was standardized some of the
big players started to adopt it back in
2005 we got a google talk released which
was based on XMPP at the same time
google also proposed some extensions to
XMPP and there is nowadays XMPP
standards foundation which meets twice a
year and they discuss additional
extensions to the XMPP protocol
it's actually very friendly group of
people I had a chance to meet recently
and then over the years actually XMPP is
the fact of becoming a standard for
messaging because some other big
companies that offer messengers start to
integrate with it or offer some XMPP
features so you have facebook chat to
which you can connect over XMPP
microsoft also released an interface to
XMPP and so on and so on and the reason
why this is so widely adopted is because
it's an open standard it's probably one
of the key features it's secure meaning
you have some channel encryption or or
stronger authentication algorithms I can
also isolate your network from public if
you need it's quite flexible meaning
that you can reasonably easy extend
standard features of XMPP so this is why
people keep on adding new proposals for
new extensions and over time they get
standardized so others can use this to
standards that have been in used for
some years now mmm it's this centralized
meaning there is no central server to
manage I have servers federate with each
other and this makes it really scalable
and efficient in a sense that having
some persistent tcp connection actually
saw some of the issues of polling
approaches and well I would say it's
proven simply because it has been used
for folks so many years and today you
have millions of users that do use XMPP
every day I have few more slides
explaining the concept behind XMPP
here's how you identify a client it
looks very much like an email address it
has this extra bit at the end which is
called resource ID this is how you can
differentiate between different
connections of the same user who may be
connecting from mobile desktop and well
home at the same time
then this is an xml-based protocol which
has some three fundamental elements XML
elements one is for messaging it's a
message kind of element this is the one
that you will use for sending messages
to users or to group chats this is how
it looks like and the good thing is that
actually server who maintains the
connection with a user and further
authenticated the user in the first
place and this is the server that stamps
all the messages originating from users
so there's no risk of having some spam
being sent because this is the user who
first authenticated user and then all
the messages originating from this user
will be will be stopped so we have also
presents another piece of this protocol
which will now allow you to announce
that you're now available for chat or
maybe you're online but currently busy
so presence this is actually very
interesting feature which may be used in
many different use cases it's and one
more here one more element of the
protocol is info query which is quite
similar to what HTTP is so you will have
requests originating from a client and a
response coming back from the server all
requests have some unique ID attribute
and you will d French well you will
decide what the request is about by the
namespace used in this request so for
example here in the slide we have client
asking server to provide him his roster
and people keep on extending this
protocol by adding some custom
namespaces extending the body of those
IQ messages so a lot of custom
functionality can be built with this IQ
part of the protocol and this is also
why XMPP is used
not only for instant messaging but also
for remote system control signaling even
voice over IP and and other things there
are many XMPP servers as usual some of
those are more widely adopted some
others make less one of the most widely
adopted server out there is a jeopardy
which started which was started over 10
years ago it is written in Erlang cross
platform and the interesting feature is
that it can be distributed on a cluster
either because of scaling requirements
all because of photo Lawrence if you
like and another good thing about this
project is because it has been in
development for so many years it
implements quite a few extensions that
have been standardized so you will find
support for all sort of different
databases and authentication mechanisms
and many other extensions however if you
want to scale a jeopardy two really big
numbers it will not scale out of the box
there are some limitations to its
architecture like one of them is so that
all the sessions of all the users within
the cluster are replicated on all the
nodes which nodes you add to the cluster
the more RAM each node should help which
may be limiting at some point because
you can keep on adding nodes but you
cannot keep on adding RAM and also if
you use XMPP for web applications the
the web long polling maybe not efficient
enough currently in jeopardy at least
the open source version of it supports
Bosh only which is XMPP over long
polling and we having seen these
limitations and also working with the
job relief for quite many years we
decided to fork the project we actually
spoke with the people behind the
jeopardy whether we could contribute to
the project but it turned out that some
of the changes that we propose were true
revolutionary and they
probably break some of the backward
compatibility with eg birdie which is
why we created a perk of each other d
and here we focused on first making it
work for airline developers how many of
you are Atlanta Bella purrs here okay
all right so for those of you who did
work with airline already you will
appreciate being able to create proper
air link releases as an OTP principles
or having the layout the red bar like so
that you can also easily integrate other
open source projects based on the web
are built to and and there are other
things into it which make each operating
more OTP compliant so this is one focus
another one is performance and
scalability so some of the issues that
we have seen here have been solved for
example the RAM limitation of sessions
as mentioned on the previous slide this
could be solved by replacing neva which
is used for storing sessions with
external in-memory database like readies
or you could optimize some of the data
structures and other things just to
lower the memory footprint which will
again allow you to scale to bigger
numbers because you can keep more users
within the same box so Mongoose IM is
how we named up this fork it implements
some of the most popular accepts I mean
there are a lot of accept but not all of
them are always used so we just for the
time being we ported the ones which are
most popular as we can see it so like
service discovery multi-user chart
privacy list and also recently added a
feature where you can use XMPP over web
sockets another thing we added is a suit
of tests regression tests which comes
very handy when you want to build on top
of this fork so we actually see one goes
as a great baseline for building custom
XMPP services you have all the right
pieces in place not only reber and OTP
but also regression tests
and actually we have seen over the years
that every time somebody is trying to
use the Jeopardy in production in his
project he has to adopt the project
anyway for his custom needs so we see
Mongoose is a great baseline for for
building such okay mm I promised some
low tests here so here are some slides
about low testing and just to also give
you an idea how how we can what numbers
we can scale on a single box the box we
had was eight core AMD with 32 gigabytes
of RAM and it was running the latest to
open source in jeopardy among goose i am
the latest one as well as well as some
other software is on the slide we used
some false stress testing which is an
open-source load testing tool also
written airline and it can distribute
load on many nodes so we actually could
use many nodes to generate the traffic
and try to kill this one machine okay
and we use the same configuration for
baggage aboard Ian Mongoose because this
is this bit is kept backward compatible
all the sessions ninja all the users
user credentials in the external my
sequel database and the same for rosters
so we are using the same configuration
file had to tweak the airline vm a bit
just to enable so many users connected
to one box so we had to enable maximum
number of airline processors like ports
and so on and one of the first test we
run was to see how many users we can fit
on such a box to make it a bit more
realistic we populated all users rosters
with 100 buddies so what we assume that
100 is a good number of friends maybe
you have more on your LinkedIn account
and here's one of the results we can see
number of
connected users over time as you can see
actually each a birdie as a teasing two
dot one version started to lose some of
the users over time it could not keep up
with the same login rate you can see
also some cpu utilization here where it
just takes a bit more effort for in
jeopardy to login those users and this
is why some of the users are dropped and
then connections are lost and another
one shows the memory footprint where the
lower the better so you can we can feed
all those 400,000 users within something
like 22 23 gigabytes of RAM while those
almost 400,000 users would require
almost free 30 gigabytes of RAM for in
jeopardy so having those memory
optimizations some cpu optimizations we
can actually log in more users quicker
and have some spare capacity and there
are some other slides here at least for
this test where we show what was the
connection request and you can see that
if there is an overload condition
actually the system still can cope with
it but just at the service performance
downgrades and this is why you see
something like three seconds this is how
long it takes to login a user under
heavy load okay we can see also another
test on my next slide where instead of
trying to log in as many users as
possible we actually try to send and
push as much traffic as possible so that
we now we logged in less users only
75,000 but we are now trying to send a
lot of traffic and the peak is twenty
one thousand messages per second it's a
flat rate at some point of the test and
let's see how this one goes in this test
we have two phases one is the arrival
phase where we
had to log in all the users it takes
time actually for all of them to log in
then we wait a little bit and then we
start sending messages so after some
time in on the right hand side of this
slide you can see that this is where
where we are sending out 21,000 messages
per second in total for all the users
that managed to log in and this is what
we get so we already have seen this
behavior on previous slides where it
takes a bit less CPU resources for my
goose to login users later on it's
almost the same and both can cope with
the same work with 21,000 messages per
second in terms of ram actually there
are some savings here for Mongoose over
time it's not so much of a difference
but there is a pic of RAM you for each
other d and it's always better to have
this line smoother rather than than
having some pics so again it's not a
huge difference but actually sometimes
it can make can make a big difference
especially if you have a storm of users
logging in and storming your server so
this is just to give you an idea how
XMPP implementation in what mangoes are
in jeopardy can scale toward numbers on
a single box over TCP so this is a use
case for maybe pc games or some other
desktop applications or mobile
applications as we don't tcp is not an
option for web applications so i will
now explore some of the techniques on
how you can connect such chat clients
over web there are different techniques
we have heard about some of them and
during previous presentation like long
polling websockets servers and demand
socket i/o as far as XMPP is concerned
long polling and web sockets have been
used long polling have been in use for
many years now it's called Bosch and the
other one the WebSockets one has web
sockets as a standard actually I was
evolving over the last few years it's
also not yet fully standardized
but I can see WebSockets gaining some
popularity within the XMPP community
nowadays and the community is actually
of an opinion at least those were the
opinions i have heard during last XMPP
summit is that web socket will pretty
quickly replace both completely you
still have to keep wash I guess for many
applications because web sockets cover
not don't cover ninety percent of the
market yet but i think we are quickly
getting there and because web sockets
are about sending messages it's quite
natural for XMPP as this XMPP is about
the same I know of to JavaScript
libraries for XMPP that to support web
sockets there is JS Jark and it supports
web sockets in the master branch there's
also strophe JS which supports
WebSockets in in some branch and it has
not been integrated with master yet but
I guess it's just on the roadmap and if
you wonder whether web sockets are
already there here is a slide which
shows what is the status as of today how
widely web sockets are adopted it
actually has changed a lot over the last
12 months you can see that the current
versions of all the popular web browsers
do support web sockets and and it's
slightly worse for mobile devices well
not all browsers would support web
sockets for example the native Android
one does not support web sockets yet but
again I strongly believe that it's a
matter of capital of time amongst time
where we will see web sockets picking up
so now in this one more test we have
here we will try to compare web sockets
vs. Bosch which is wrong polling as i
said just see whether there's any
advantage of using web sockets and
today mongoose support web sockets but
it doesn't wash each other d supports
bosch but it doesn't support web sockets
so we had to compare those two servers
again you can see the blue line for
bosch as in jeopardy and green and red
lines for mongoose over TCP and mangoes
over web sockets you see the difference
is really big this is this slide
presents cpu utilization and as you can
see that actually web sockets behave
more or less the same as regular TCP so
this is good so the numbers that we have
seen previously for TCP where we were
able to scale up to well 400,000 users
those are more or less the same numbers
that we could see for web sockets and
another slide with memory footprint this
is even worse for bosch at least the one
that we can find in jeopardy today it
the login phase the rival phase where
users login this generates a lot of
memory overhead and can be just too
expensive for some of the dips for some
deployments so when we are talking about
scanning IM services having web sockets
which are rather smooth here this
actually gives you a better way to plant
capacity of the system and and predict
behavior of the system the more users
you can fit it within the same machine
the better because routing messages
between users which are sitting on the
same machine is cheap having well
whatever jeopardy of mangoes deployed in
a cluster setup where you have nodes
that you need to send messages between
this is more expensive and so the more
users we can fit with in the briefing
one machine the better okay hmm so
I have some conclusions here I see chat
feature being adopted not only in moving
messengers but also in social network in
games and actually this the same concept
of chat feature is hijacked by other
than I am applications for as I well
machine control VoIP and others XMPP is
one of the most widely adopted IM
protocol's out there and it's open
standard and I can also see this being
used in both games and then some web
applications if you're talking about web
at least in our tests web sockets are
definitely more efficient than bosh and
hopefully very all the browsers that are
being used out there will catch up with
the latest WebSocket implementations
because at least for XMPP disease the
future and we have Mongoose am if you
would like to contribute to the project
it is on github under ESL in jeopardy we
also build some packages for Mongoose
for different distros you can download
them from Erlang solutions and what
contact us if you if you would like to
well see how we can see if it for it ok
that was pretty much it thank you i will
be now available for some questions
questions
second
what other like see what life live
deployment sorry thank you so the
question is what are the light
deployments that we can talk about we
well we've seen some there are some use
cases published on Erlang solutions com
for example when it comes to Bosh there
was one deployed for n catwalk which is
the biggest polish social website
they've been scaling to something like
10 to 30 million online users we have we
also have oovoo which is one of the
modern messengers it also has been used
their to power the chat feature and
there are some other which I which will
probably be published on the website
over the next few weeks correct
so we went parting some of the jeopardy
features over to mongoose we always
profile them as and stressed do some
stress testing before putting them on
the mongoose branch and during summer
this year we've been working on porting
multi-user chat feature and doing some
stress test I I can share some test
results if you like and we found some
serialization issues which would prevent
multi-user chat scale to really big
numbers and some of those were removed
while porting to mangos well I have
heard of some adaptations of multi-user
chat which can scan two hundred of
thousands of users within the same chat
room the ones the distress that we have
run would have couple of thousands of
users within one chat room and message
is being sent every now and then of
course usually if you have that many
human beings it will be impossible to
keep track of everybody chatting in the
same servant chat rooms who are rather
used as publish-subscribe kind of
pattern if we are talking about real
human beings joining chat rooms the
traffic which appears and such is
usually not that not that big I mean you
can have maybe a couple of hundred or
million thousand people but the traffic
is rather minimal because otherwise no
one would be able to uh huh it oh this
can is this as many this is really many
because the way it works is that for
each chat room there is one airline
process and as we have heard over the
day today and you can scale to very many
airline processes on a single box so I
would say as many as you can fit in the
run if you would like to see some exact
numbers I would be very happy to publish
some more other test results which just
didn't what we're not including in this
presentation but we had a chance to
execute them in the past so just ping us
on this email address or we may be
published it on the website anyway
to share with others okay yes so back in
2005 when google introduced google 12 i
propose some extensions to XMPP called
jingle and well XMPP can be used for
signaling so like to initiate some peer
to peer connection but sending files
would be not efficient it's done through
the server so some standard pew pew
techniques are used here for sending
files or other media and jingle is used
for signaling and negotiating this okay
yes
mm-hm well for example Google Wave was a
real time collaboration experiment it
was based at the end on XMPP to as far
as i know some extensions were proposed
to XMPP so this is a good example of
such real-time collaboration and yes
absolutely i mean i can see different
use different deployments of XMPP
servers where people don't even bother
to publish some new standards for the
coda foundation but they actually do
customized XMPP for their specific needs
and transmit whatever they have to over
the wire which is inside of some XMPP
stanza for example collecting power
meters from different places or yeah so
the old sort of data can be transmitted
inside XMPP stanza which is like a
single message and I have seen this done
over and over again
for what sir okay we know there's no
reason not to use Mongoose IM for other
than I am use cases well this is it's
just a name that we decided to use but
it has been used for other than I am
purpose okay yes
you have this problem with Charles there
is a concept of the shirt web workers
which is also part of html5 as far as I
know there are actually already some
proposals in the XMPP community about
how to use this shirt web workers to
solve the problem you're describing
which is having multiple tabs by trying
to have the same like chat window across
all the tabs and get this window
synchronized on all the tabs every time
you get one message so again one of the
ideas here is to use so-called shared
web workers which is a feature of modern
browsers I'm not sure whether it is
already adopted within all the modern
browsers but at least some of them to
implement web workers that's one way of
solving it gosh I've seen okay so I've
seen different ways of solving the
problem with posh here it could be that
each tab actually separately subscribes
to its own channel and get separate
update this was one of the solutions
that has been introduced a few years
back nowadays I probably would start
exploring this shared web worker even
though it's not doesn't cover probably
one hundred percent of the market I
would start with it and see how far we
can get with such approach and then
maybe try to see what how to handle the
remaining thirty percent of users so in
this those libraries that were on my
slides like it's trophy or JS jark they
already try to solve some of the issues
of different browsers and different
versions try to be I try to be
transparent for the user and just
deliver whatever
the stanza you have to deliver no matter
what browser supports and I think Jays
jack has done quite good job on it so
maybe there are also some API functions
within those javascript libraries which
could help solve this problem frankly
speaking I focus mostly on the server
part so cannot tell from the top of my
head yes do you need to use XML in what
sense i mean oh yes I see okay so um
well when for example when developing
web socket support for mangoes we had to
add this like new kind of connection
which would connect over WebSocket
rather than traditional TCP and it just
happened to to use the same XML engine
as the standard tcp connection so it was
quite quite straightforward just take
the message decoded from web socket and
then pass it to xml engine as you would
do from the regular tcp so I can quite
easily imagine having another kind of
listener which as we did for web sockets
would listen for spawn some custom kind
of well tcp port and would understand
this custom well protocol act protocol
buffers as long as it communicates with
the rest of the platform in the same
manner and transformed somehow the
traffic into internal EG birdie Mongoose
representation of a message it should be
good to go internal representation do
does look like XML element does look
like a stanza so you would have airline
tuples representing XML elements
effectively but those are simple ones so
I think it should be also pretty
straightforward to encode in a binary
protocol like protocol buffers which I
guess would be for efficiency reasons
and then just use the internal Mongoose
represent a
for stanza hmm okay are there any other
questions well thank you very much for
so many questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
