the audience yeah my name is Alvaro I'm
a programmer as I wrote in the
description of the conference I'm a
writer of word because I have I'm really
interested in literature linguistic for
that of that type and I try to combine
these with Quran could you could you
describe it talk a little bit as well so
the talk was called metaphors we compute
line is taking from the 80s taking from
the book like that for short lack of
called meta portal in real time and the
main idea on that book is how metaphor
since you and the way we think how we
live how we behave and I thought okay is
this any relation between those ideas my
lack of which is a cognitive scientist
in answer
random guy writing metaphor idea red
side there is a lot of research behind
it and so on I said okay but is there
any relationship between these
programming like the way we choose data
structures the way we'll name algorithms
or understanding of problems increased
by the metaphor views like crash kills
gossip and so on or they are of killing
so I try to go is there any particular
metaphor that you think it's yours some
good idea over Mudge yeah it's kind of
hard I think currently or a good example
from the talk I think if the the one
from Josie versus epidemics yeah they
were trying to find how to do
replication and they understood it as go
seeking how you spread room a person to
person is equal tell order to equal and
it gets spread right that's really good
for understanding like to explain it to
an audience but maybe not so good to
reason about it yeah when they found the
relationship between that and epidemic
it was actually a lot of mathematics as
we tried to stop the spreading and they
say okay we can kind of reverse this map
to actually spread information yeah so
there you have a metaphor that in the
context of explanation or teacher is
really good like gossip but maybe not
that good in the context of reasoning
about the problem like a PD me yeah was
so but maybe not so easy to explain and
another one from category theory I was
mentioning discussion of also on Twitter
one since
Tomas also mentioned internship talk
there was an argument between if we
should say funko all we should say map
photo how are you brother
and the categories here is Versailles
now is functors about the identity you
should use factor this under that but
for a person to understand maybe is not
the best thing when you want to recent
mathematically about cold then functor
is probably the best thing there is
because it is already a theory behind it
yeah but maybe not for teaching and new
comers into the theory when you get
people to use the thing then okay look
why what drinking you is actually a
factor but then you expand more if the
person's interested but sometimes this
mathematical language can get far right
because over tomorrow saying on the
other book lilac oh we're mathematic
come from we don't realize that we
understand mathematics thanks to a
ladder or right that we build over the
years of going to school and whatnot so
when you are doing a PhD let's say I
don't know how many metaphors you feel
subconsciously even until you got that
thing that now is so si
yeah but for an academic person let's
say overall but it's not too much into
that right maybe that's not the best way
to get there right yeah I think you know
we talked a fair bit about well how do
you teach concepts to people and I think
one thing that keeps reoccurring in our
conversations is trying to pare down
your language as much as possible to
meet people where they are I wonder so
bunker was an example I wonder if there
are any any other things that come to
mind to you that are overly elaborate or
too far out in terms of wide
understanding I think I don't know if I
have an example to add related to it I
was doing enough about rhetoric one
definition I saw is that okay you have
grammar they say you have logic and then
you've already the oak tree and rhetoric
for was how to put all this grammar and
oh together which in programming we
kind of forget we have grammar with a
Balochi but we never care about getting
the message across sure but they say
rhetoric is about how to explain things
for the right context so it's not the
same for me ringing this year is in our
programming conferences yeah going
non foramina context so I think that's
why it's very important to choose the
right language and again metaphor we
think of higher better lower norm better
so we say we need to know where or
language because we think on this is
partial ways for example there are a lot
of implications on this way we we talk
and a metaphor that now it comes to mind
for out this obscure understanding is
with control interact we were used to
the old days of code in linear and the
code yeah a line of code meant was the
next instruction like the number were
increasing this chapter if this one it
was reordered the computer will process
the code right and I saw I think I
thought surely was shipping it from the
JVM called team training I told him that
he said that well that's one of the
great distributions we have today like
we see
cold in order in and we think that they
ordered which will be run because we had
this wrong metaphor from back in the day
of single-core day right so to reason
about some fluency and light numbers
today like amber searches are
coordinates find where the error come
from right but not how the call will be
run most of the right did you catch the
be talking undefined behavior in see
yeah yeah so he made a very interesting
point where you know I'm defining a very
useful for the compiler because even in
spun code it can just go ahead and
choose and reorder your code so long
that they that's the data activities or
accurate I think that's a good point
that's one of the magical bit yeah we
don't we don't we are very far away from
the computers of the fifties that when
you withhold kind of to destructions
yeah yeah that is kind of not what's
happening to that you never think about
the which computers are going to run my
code what architecture is running my
code right you never think about them
right maybe okay if you write for cheap
you or
let's say but in general like enamel a
virtual machine will need a different
connector right and when I rise is
transforming steps and replace to the
performance the Java 49 of a compiler or
optimizer the same of doing so many of
the ization depending on how much they
form cannot call right get what I
brought
I don't even know it's even what is
being ran by the virtual machine right
yeah which is not even the computer
right
thank you very much for speaking today
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
