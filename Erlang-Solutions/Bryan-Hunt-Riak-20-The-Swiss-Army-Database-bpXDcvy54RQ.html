which some maybe all of you familiar
with - distributed datastore written in
airline which is topical enough given
the crowd had people familiar with her
and the rumor what do what people what
are people using her Couchbase react
people doing stuff for normal a tional
databases or no this is I'll wait here
until I find the truth okay so right so
reacts basically it's inspired by Amazon
created dynamo white paper many moons
ago described type of database where you
could choose between consistent
consistency availability and partition
tolerance and the react guys they
decided to go and implement something it
was pretty similar to that and it's
written in Erlang with a couple of key
parts are written in C and C++ open
source Apache 2-0 licensed little bit
about me so it's my name at the top of
the list Brian hunt client service
engineer for basho which basically means
Manning a helpdesk that type of stuff
airline neophyte so I got about two
months experience airline really sick of
working on the JVM so just be nice with
me I all right so uh what's this crowd
here is this uh this is a developer
crowd or operations or a mixture
somewhere over there off we should do
developers all right okay I know there's
some OPSEC right over there
VSD you guys cool I'm right so we move
on structures of talks this talk sent
around four main areas introduction to
react as it stands introduction to react
to zero some information about react to
zero features and then some example uses
all right
so what is react its most simple sense
it's just a key value store a giant big
harsh map distributed around a ring of
nodes it's in terms of the cap theorem
consistent available partition tolerance
its if focus is unavailable in partition
tolerant and given enough time or all
its values will eventually crack
converge upon the correct values but it
may not always have the correct debt
values at any given point in time the
ops friendly database in that just comes
with a couple of command-line tools you
can Minister pretty much everything with
that they're really easy to use is self
descriptive things like help will give
you a list of what's available runs on
everything so while white gamut of
systems vsts linux derivatives runs on a
sex with compiler from stores for
install at home brew smart OS solaris
people are running on a bunch of stuff
pretty much everything except windows i
don't know if you can live with that and
so the basic idea is it's a cluster of
distributed nodes the performances the
performances is gained through
concurrency so typically you put some
like a load balancer in front page a
proxy for example distribute read and
write into the cluster all nodes
participate equally so there's there's
no there's no there's no master node
there's there isn't something that you
can kill on the whole thing falls apart
there's no single point of failure lose
a node it's not really the end of the
world you know replace it at your
leisure so as I mentioned you can easily
add or remove nodes it's scalable near
linear scalability so add in another box
you know you got five boxes yeah another
one you get you know the expected
percentage improvement in performance
you know it's highly value discursive
typically got three replicas of all data
which is written into it and that's in a
single react closer
it's written around an airline core so
there's there's full tolerance built
into the system both passive and active
V so you've got a read prepare which is
when you do a read it will read from a
selection of other nodes if finds the
data is missing it will take the data
and it will write it into the nodes for
it's missing it's also got active anti
entropy which is a continuous process
which runs and maintains your data
integrity it's checking building hashes
constantly and verifying that your data
is intact and that the replicas were all
identical so was so good simple
deployment model predictable performance
easy scaling less tedium and more sleep
but it was thought that it would be
better to make it a little bit more
exciting so this is this is this the
introduction to react to zero which is
our next iteration and it's it's a major
departure from what was before title of
this talk is the Swiss Army database so
it's kind of focusing on the variety of
things which are integrated into it and
how to move beyond being just a simple
key value store and when we mean a Swiss
Army database we don't mean like this
we've got an enormous collection of
mundane average bits and pieces it's
thinking of something more like a
Leatherman where it's it's quite well
crafted and you've got a small selection
of working features so couple of key
features react data types CR DTS
full-text search this goes under the
codename of yoga Zena Security's been
added configuration has been simplified
dramatically
we've got reduced replicas for when you
run into multi data center setup
obviously if you've got three replicas
of all your data on one side on the
under source you don't necessarily want
to replicate three copies of it onto the
same side as well one might be
sufficient all right so the first part
react datatypes okay soon react one
point forward there was there was
through some stuff like this there was
counters it is pretty limited on its own
you could increment them you could
decrement them and eventually they'd be
consistent react to zeros added a couple
of extra things such as sets maps and
registers as distributed data types and
basically idea is to simplify
application development without
compromising in terms of availability
and partition tolerance here's this
picture represents how you might
represent an email message we're gonna
be using this in the training material
mine site so this is an email message
modeled as a CR DT so previously it was
just a key value store so we referred to
the key and the value collectively is
the object okay so we got here the
objects we got the key which is message
20 and then we got a series of fields
which you might find in an email message
and there they're modeled as C or D TS
so first you got the map C or D T so
that's that's the overall compass
against T these are the attributes of
it's it's a subject date body and in
reply to these are known as register c
rd T's which is just a binary which I
believe in other languages can be called
a string and then response is it
contains a nested C or DT which is in
this case going to be a set which are
also binaries and those are the message
IDs for messages which have been written
as replies to this original email so
that's that's that's how you could model
something using the new C or DTS so
looking at how it was before I don't
know how many of the audience of iviews
react extensive you're familiar with
stuff like siblings client size client
side replication okay small number yeah
so one of one of the key things in
sibling in in react is is the concept of
siblings
it's it's not sufficient to just go on a
last Rite winds approach you're never
quite sure exactly what's happening to
data siblings it's kind of like if
you've got gear and you've got two
people working on it simultaneously each
got their own copy of the other history
each makes separate changes the to come
into conflict they have to be resolved
who can resolve them
the only question who can resolve it is
the person who understands the data
which is typically to developer so if
two people write concurrently to the
same object and react without paying
attention to well the commit history
which is which is in this case is called
the V clock basically how it manages it
you get a conflict
next time did you go to do a read it'll
indicate that there's siblings which
means there's two copies two or more
copies of the data if you want to be
polite about it the thing to do is
resolve them you've got to do it on the
client side as it currently stands now
that means taking down the two siblings
deserializing them figuring out what
they are merging them back together and
writing into the server and and then you
can move on and that's that's a little
bit tedious though okay so there's a
couple of simple use cases of what you
might want to do with C or D TS
increment of value
there'll be counters append values to an
object so you've got maybe you're
tracking users who going through your
website or something like that
every time that they go onto a page you
want to update the user object and when
I had the URL that they went on to him
there's a time or yeah the referring URL
or whatever and you might also want to
botch out and remove multiple associated
objects so you might have a set you
might have another 50 things that you
want to add into the set this this is
something you could do on the client
side to be a lot nicer if the server
could just handle it for you okay so
take a look at some examples so
previously if you're incrementing a
value concurrently taking the first
client okay so we go we go
we get an object from react in this case
pints old how many berries being sold at
a particular establishment today take it
down to the client it's probably a big
blob of JSON you deserialize it you got
a data structure yeah you copy that data
structure if it's immutable or maybe you
modify it in place if it is mutable
I think our language generally fear on
the side of immutability sieving you've
been commented that value serialize it
and you write it back what would happen
if another client was doing the exact
same thing as you they would get it one
of the header fields would be the V
clock which indicates where it is in its
progression of change they deserialize
that they in command that they serialize
it they send it to the server and they
get a conflict it's there's two copies
of the data no way for it to work it out
so it would then have to go back to the
server get both the siblings pull them
down deserialize them work out some
marriage logic to serialize them again
and put them back to the server which is
extremely boring ok so what would be far
better would be if data that type of
conflict resolution could happen on the
server rather than you having to do a
whole round trip down to the client it's
there's a variety of reasons why it's
unattractive ok so how would you do it
now
you create a bucket type with the data
type of counter activated initialize it
with a value and just send in command to
decrement cancer the server right
I used to append to an object similar a
similar story you fetch the object
deserialize if maybe you got a piece of
JSON with a list insider a pen and item
onto the list story sent to the server
and maybe somebody's done the same thing
so you're a conflict then you go back
again and you work out the siblings you
could just shortcut this and just say
last write wins and you just get
completely random data on the server is
each year developers clubbers
each other how do we append to an object
now okay so you create a bucket type
with the data type set activated
initializer and then you got a series of
commands which you can send to the
server this is you can send add remove a
door and remove remove all commands so
you get this you can get this stuff to
happen on the server so lower latency
less less roundtrip
much better complex nested data
typically going back again to the
analogy of JSON it's infectious
how would you typically do this before
unless you're going to invent your own
data type you'd store it on this you'd
stored on the server as JSON or XML take
the entire could take the entire object
graph to the client
doodie serialize it mutatis serialize it
back again save it to the database and
tedium again in shoes you can't be
well-paid doing that type of work I know
and how'd you handle it now so you got
your C or DTS so conflict resolution to
handle on the server you manipulate the
remote data structures by sending update
commands to react you don't have to
worry about the roundtrip
it's just basically it's a lot easier if
people is anyone actually made use of C
or DTS yeah or familiar with these type
of things you say yeah ID how long have
you been using them for all right ok
quite a while then longer than me all
right does anyone got any questions
about that
No
okay let's see alright so yeah just
wondering if I can get this on to screen
may show you afterwards I've got a bunch
of them do it it's basically you just
you just do a post to the URL and it's
just minus D and the command
just a little JSON thing so in case if
you want to add something onto a set
it's just ad colon and then the value
through for increment and decrement you
specify the command and then the value
that you're going to increment or
decrement by and it's it's pretty much
like that for all the commands obviously
if you're using the react client to be a
nice or API for doing it but all this
stuff is still available just the
command line you can do you just using
curl all right
anyone else okay all right so we move on
to the next part Yokozuna
aka search to zero so this is full-text
search and it's basically integration
with Apache Solr I don't know anyone
here from work with solar before or
loosen or Java background yeah okay
bunch of people anyone ever use Fink's
use that as well no I used up slightly
less popular is it's quite nice to work
with that okay so solar Solar has been
integrated with react it runs it runs
JVM process it runs solar in that it's
it's got some nice glue for looking
after Sollers indexes keeping it up and
running managing its health etc it's
pretty nice if you're messing around
with a little bit it supports the usual
stuff with the with the standard
extractors so support things like JSON
XML plaintext they've also managed to
integrate it with CR DTS so you can
index stray into for example that CR DT
that I showed at the start the
message so each one of those fields
about message we a separate faucet which
search for individually or collectively
so how do we search before well we did
have an original react search and that
was basically covered in a second but
the original react search we had
secondary indexes and we have MapReduce
okay so the original react search was
implemented in airline provided a basic
subset of solar functionality it was
perpetually chasing feature priority
interesting as the exercise was there
was a lot more momentum with the other
project and it was just it was just
always going to be a game of catch-up
secondary indexing search this is this
is quite similar to the type of indexing
that you get if you using dynamo TV or
whatever so you basically when you write
an object you add some extra metadata on
twit indicating that there's indexes so
it was kind of limited though you have
integers or strings and who is basically
an exact match it would be more like a
tag than you know turn-based search you
could query by an exact match so all
objects which have the secondary index
of Joanna or a range so you could store
dates as integers as well and you could
using that mechanism you could make a
selection of all objects between
particular range again its defined at
object creation time okay so there's a
couple of limitations a secondary index
obviously you don't get any full-text
turn-based query capability composite
queries require multiple range queries
so if you wanted query for all objects
which have been tagged with Joanna and
we're also between a particular subset a
particular range of permantly updates
the engine would have to do two
secondary index query
each of which would be a coverage query
as well so it would had basically 1/3 of
your notes it wasn't supported on bit
cask as well which is our preferred
storage engine it was only supported on
level DB and memory and that was kind of
a big one for a lot of people level DB
is slightly less attractive than bit
cask terms if you don't get the same
kind of latency guarantees as data
becomes older it can take longer to to
retrieve it drops down through the
levels MapReduce it wasn't really a
runner wasn't suitable for real-time
querying I was designed for schedule
there and analytics and it's basically
just not a search engine so yokozuna is
is now the preferred search solution and
security okay previously react didn't
have any kind of concept whatsoever of
security anyone who could you could hit
it over any of its interfaces could do
whatever they wanted really and it was
based upon the presumption that if you
were running on a cluster you know this
is a typical security thing like hard on
the outside chewy on the inside
somebody's gotten to the cluster they
were already allowed access there was no
point in trying to secure it there might
have been an overhead concern as well
so we react to 0 now introduces a
variety of security mechanisms so for
authentication there's trust based
security which is quite similar to what
was there originally so the users on a
trusted connection if you're connecting
from a particular subnet you know Sider
range we trust you any password which is
provided ignored passwords this is kind
of the equivalent of patchy
htaccess files and maintains a username
of password hash table checks they
provided password against the steward
hash
we've got Pam that's pluggable
authentication modules
it's on pretty much everything then X I
don't know if it exists on our sack sir
ESDS bsds do it as well yeah Solaris
originally came from Sun anyway so with
that you can just choose any back-end
you want if you want to use a relational
database or you want to use LDAP or some
stupid reason you want to use a smart
card or something conceivably you can do
that maybe somebody who actually write a
provider for react itself
and lastly certificate and this is based
upon the client providing a certificate
which has been signed by a particular
certificate certifying authority and if
it's validated and the common name
matches the requested username the
user's authenticated so you've got you
know variety of options there
authorization itself can be per bucket
so you can say this user or group users
are allowed to perform operations on
this particular book that's we're also
para operation so you can also limit
users the same way as you might on a my
sequel just springs to mind for some
reason so you can say that use
particularly users let's do gasps puts
deletes add indexes run MapReduce
queries there's a bunch of those anyone
got any questions no self-explanatory
okay right
cuttlefish this is another one with the
new improvements simplified
configuration management one of the
things which kind of occurred to me when
I first look at react was that the
command-line tools were really nice but
I couldn't figure out how to write a set
expression which would match square
brackets in order that I could append to
delete or modify sections of the
configuration file the old configuration
file was just a huge list of terms so I
understand this is very easy to work
with an airline you just basically read
it in evaluated
there's your data structure but from the
point of view of administrating it or
modifying it and odd ad-hoc ways or for
a variety of things wrapping through it
all this stuff it's a little bit of a
pain because traditional UNIX
command-line tools don't really
understand an airline terms file another
feat another thing about it as well ways
that you could very easily lose miss a
comma and miss a bracket or whatever
especially for me coming to is you know
not being an Illuminati or very lying
the error message is meant absolutely
nothing to me so as you know going back
and taking old copies of files and stuff
it was quite difficult it's been
dramatically simplified now so new
configuration file format is shrunk down
to something like this cuttlefish itself
is an open source project on my
understanding just from reading through
this commit messages and stuff is that
you can provide a mapping file for any
kind of a properties file format like
this and it will map it on to onto the
airline term term format I guess for a
better want of a better word so so what
kind of stuff can you do now that it's
being simplified a little bit we have
one thing run little commands like this
if your eunuch said man to this one just
matching her in a particular line of the
react conf file matches the if it
matches the part that says restarts a
ring size had substitute that entire
line for ring size equals to 128 and
this is edge shell as well
this is recursively on the et cetera
directories and each and every of the
rear comp it sounded like a trivial
thing but when you're trying when you're
trying to figure out how to get this
thing running switching various features
on and off stuff like this is gold dust
you know configuration management I'm
fairly hugely biased towards ansible
at the moment it's kind of configuration
management d'azur but it also supports
this type of thing were you looking to
match a specific line of a file and if
it doesn't exist appended if it does
exist to replace it
I guess this the type of stuff that only
makes sense if you if you if you're
having to do operations stuff as a daily
chore just makes things a lot easier we
got next
by reduce replicas from multiple data
centers so I think I mentioned it
slightly earlier on in the talk by
default reacts going to create three
copies of your data everything that you
put into it is three copies by default
you can increase it or decrease it but
three is generally what's going to
happen if you're in a situation where
you want to create a backup of your view
data there's two kind of scenarios where
people working with multi data center
replication will just have a hot backup
on standby it was okay that building
sank into the into the ground it's it's
it's lost flick the switch Rooter
switches over to the two new
infrastructure and you've got a copy of
everything which is running and which is
you know as near as possible up-to-date
and it just it runs from there you're
going to keep that running for a while
in another situation is where people
just want to backup the data and they
just won't have an hour an off-site copy
an off-site copy of their data may be
using a different different hardware
configuration may be using may be using
a raid system which has got stronger
consistency guarantees than what they're
running in production and for this case
it's it's a question of you want to
reduce how many replicas of your data
there are so you can configure it on it
on a pair bucket basis and this is this
is something a lot of our customers come
to us looking for strong consistency
this is another thing we just come in
and this is basically saying that you
know you're not satisfied with
eventually consistent data you want
particular particular buckets of data to
remain consistent to that that's that's
you think that can be they cook that's
come in now can be added you go look at
some example users this new
functionality but some slightly
contrived examples okay so taking an
example of just been looking at just a
workflow that I had before for I used to
work in a social media firm so we had a
bunch of stuff coming in to us we have
got documents so we are like web
crawlers gone crawling the web reading
everyone's blogs we've got Twitter so we
hooked up to their fire hose
yet other providers people that would do
provide us basically the equivalent of
newspaper clippings we'd receive all
that data a bear in mind this is also
like relational database technologies
send it down a message bus which would
act as a as a buffer of sorts we get
away storage riders we had a UUID
generator so we had something that for
every item that came in we created
unique ID for it and then it Dennis
split off in two directions of one part
will go to index writer and in our case
we put it into Sphinx so Sphinx
basically mimics my sequel database you
insert but you're not really it's not
really storing the data it just indexes
whatever you put in there and and one of
the things that you got to deal with
that is provide some kind of ID so when
you do a search you can then resolve you
get a number back you get a list of
numbers or identifiers which are the uu
IDs of the data which you've then stored
somewhere else in this case in an actual
relational database somewhere so
generate a UUID you store it into the
data store with the UUID pair pair pair
object send it off to the index writers
also with that same UUID
and then it will go into swing solution
occasionally those servers would blow up
and then we have to
Riis reindex all that data again and it
was quite painful maintaining the
integrity between the two we also send
stuff into a replica data store suit us
that's just using like slave relational
databases any questions on that standard
so basically you for you to do it now
kind of shrink down quite a lot you go
documents or Twitter and a blog posts
and stuff receivers send it down to
react lines and send it into react react
reacts going to handle the DUI
degeneration it's going to handle the
it's going to it's going to manage the
solar indexes will replicate them and it
will also handle the indexing as well so
you just got a bunch less moving parts
in another example so another thing that
we used to do is that we'd want to
create a for a given search term which
one of our clients said asked us to
monitor we'd want to index it and we'd
also want for each day they would want
to be able to get a list of every single
mention which would be made of them for
a particular day so how this worked it
was kind of brittle as well
we received data through the receiver
again this just this example being for
the earlier version of of react slightly
slightly better than using relational
database in Sphinx so we received data
we would send the entity into the react
client we'd use that to post an object
to react and we also would keep a buffer
there sorry the buffer shouldn't be on
the react client it should be on the
receiver apologies and that buffer would
contain a list of all of all the items
which we didn't cert it into the data
store
some problems with this if the job
crashed halfway through and you then go
back and you you put the items back in
again do you get duplicates have you
lost some of that stuff in the indexes
the term based inverted indexes so
everyone familiar with that concept turn
based inverted indexes ya know basically
you open in a book it's got an index at
the back which is just got like you know
airline your airline book it's got a
list of all the pages and all the terms
as you can go to the back of the book
and I'm interested in Neffs you go to
page 47 the same concept you're doing
all that that hard labor yourself and
also you can you have to write it in one
go or again you come back to the
problems of siblings so the new the new
approach which is much easier it's just
you receiving stuff send the entity to
real client and you post the object and
you also post a update to an add command
to the index C or D T so that's your
turn-based inverted index you just
appending into that constantly so it's a
lot easier to work with people get the
point of that
yeah it's simple stuff okay so really
slightly early on this talk has anyone
got any questions haha it's working
Polly its suppose that you have also
solar cluster you have a solar node for
each react node though how does it work
react react manages all that so when
react starts up an individual node at
far so it it starts up a JVM process so
you are your airline process you go to
JVM process sitting within it and and
and that's what's actually running solar
so you don't have to start you don't
have to start solar and then start react
or maintain two demons or whatever it's
completely encapsulated
right so you have one solar node perm
react no that's it that's correct yeah
and in your last in your glasses light
ha ha
that inverter based in varied index yeah
I guess solar also has like inverse
indexes yeah it's a duplication of
functionality the thing is with solar
it's going to do this there's there's a
use case for doing this sometimes you
just want a bunch of ID's you can just
say give me all the IDS for the last
hour and you can retrieve them in a
single operation and they're already
been stored in in react you get an
object pull it back and it's got all the
values where is the emphasis with solar
is more for full tax querying and more
ad hoc type of stuff so so for
performance you can use turn-based
inverted indexes and just store them
there and a key in a pen to them so you
go give me everything that was inside
the last hour but if you want to do
something specific where you're like I
want to search for Joe Bloggs and the
date was this then then it's time to hit
solar and and do it that way right for
advanced query precisely otherwise I was
guessing what's faster query to react or
solar you know I would have imagined to
query to react be faster it's just it's
just a cat what think you're welcome
anyone else
go into that a little bit more detail
sort of what you get what you lose not
in a huge amount of detail that pretty
much have to come back to you and that I
kind of focus on the areas which I found
most interesting so yeah there's been a
slight bias there I I don't know maybe
my colleague Dan and can offer some
information and that it's it's new it's
on the list of features which I'm
interested in it's pretty much down that
at the very end do you have a specific
use case that made you interested not
particularly at this man what you're
giving up and what you can actually gain
from that well I don't know this pure
conjecture we're not going to say right
now but I would imagine it's probably a
lot slower but it will offer a guarantee
that the data will always be in a
particular state at a particular point
in time I personally don't have a use
case in mind which I can think of where
were useful
maybe maybe preserve for maybe if you're
making your own an authentication
provider Hospital data sort of
observation data that sort of thing yeah
yeah possibly yeah
then when you actually when you make
that consistent query there's a chance
you'll get a I can't serve this request
right now
so there's a trade-off whether you'd
rather get a Becca I can't help you
right now please come back later when
the the clusters healthy or would you
rather have maybe some data that's
reasonably up-to-date maybe if you're
serving some information that's not
critical you want to just favor
availability maybe serve something
that's a few minutes out-of-date or even
a few seconds out-of-date but if at any
point you make a request and your
clusters unhealthy with with this kind
of strong consistency then you need to
know that you won't get no data if
there's some some kind of unhealthy
state so it just gives you both those
options so I'm you get what you want to
do with it by the the basher booth and
we can talk about it more judging by
what I've read in the tabloid press
recently it's it's generally sufficient
to just say that the patient was alive
at some time in a nice couple of days
quick question about the solar
integration do you support all the
features of a particular version of
solar is it as well defined as something
like that or are you just exposing as
much of the lysene API as you can I'd
say I think the the Lucene
administration interface is available
when you when you're running Reax so
that's expose you can go directly to
that in terms of in terms of III would
imagine yes I don't know I can't answer
right now exactly which version of the
Lusine it's it's it's it's running but
you know you can create it you create a
schema for a particular book say what
you want to index and how you want to
indexed you can you can specify what
extractors you want to use and all that
stuff
wooden thing which occurred to me today
which would be kind of interesting is
just saying if I know the same comes
with extractors for for Microsoft Word
documents PDFs that type of stuff as
well so it would be interesting to see
if you get that running
mugambi that be
quite an interesting thing and how well
would it support the the solar that we
run has about nine of our own patches
how tolerant would the the kit be for
applying those to the solar that you're
running it depends on the patches I mean
sure it was just a question of just
taking all the jar files out deleting
them and throwing in your wounds and
seeing if the magic happened
but I mean going down that route is
always going to be fraught with peril
anyway because if you are doing that you
you know you you're going to be running
pretty much an unsupported configuration
it may work it may very well work but
when it doesn't you may find that you
you know you you can't get quite quite
the same level of expertise in your
configuration or you go for support or
whatever but I mean it's it's open
sources there's nothing stopping you
from doing it but it's just it's just
that trade-off what what kind of in the
open-source version of react it's not
part of you know react Enterprise or
something like that no it's in the open
source version yeah I'd probably leave
these questions for a sales guy rather
than asking them in the talk so no
there's no reason not to ask them know
it's yeah I kind of curious though what
kind of stuff have you done like custom
stuff we we contributed one or two of
them back to the community and then
although they were that you know the
kind of patches which were sort of I
didn't think they were really gonna be
accepted it was just oh yeah trunks gone
a different direction but if you need
this feature right now you know ya gotta
patch it into three so three point six
kind of things ah can there's a lot of
little you know things that are part of
the Lucine API that's not exposed to
solar so some of them are quite trivial
they're just you know make such and such
a switch configurable you know this kind
of stuff which is very convenient for
operational aspects of running a big
solar operation but aren't very profound
you know divergences from core solar
these these modifications are they are
the other on on main are they on uh well
we made you know we we have patches and
then we grab the latest and we apply
them and we rack until they work you
know it's yeah I mean I
see any reason why you wouldn't be able
to do it but in terms in terms of
supporting it you know it's a less less
supported configuration anyone else this
solar integration do consider it is
competitor for solar cloud replacement
or I've actually heard that product
distribution layer for solar so you can
distribute to data on several nodes
otherwise you just have one solar
installation and do you do you
distribute the data yeah it is the solar
index is your distributor as well okay
um I don't know I I have no idea in
terms of like the corporate strategy or
whatever mainly mainly an ops guy it
says it sounds similar i-i-i think this
is a problem that you know it's it
people come back to time time again they
want to index their data
the one have it in a data store and
you've got to manage the indexes and
they got to manage the data to get out
of sync and it's it's just you know it's
just craziness how do the co DT scale if
you like abandon a pen and a pen forever
does it slow down significantly or a
Christmas milk John macular John it's
probably the guy to ask about that and
he'll be down at our booth as well later
on I can introduce you if you want I do
know there are there are some
limitations to it as well any any given
CR DT you don't want to grow above 1
Megan sighs that's generally the
ballpark figure for objects in react it
doesn't like when they get above a
megabyte in size you can do it but it
can it can it can mess around with your
Layton sees and it's just not a good
thing to do so there is there is there
is a limit in terms of how big you can
make those C or DTS
in terms of the performance overhead of
garbage collection and stuff like that
Chris would probably be the guy to ask
you give you a much better idea I know I
know he's been benchmarking extensively
for one of our customers maybe you can
share some of that info with you all
right anyone else you focused on beer
now I thank you all thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
