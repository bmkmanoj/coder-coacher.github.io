hear here is covered mostly one year of
work with the next Journal which is also
my my first active project gone in
production so for some basements
experimentation you can check my github
account there and so and needless to say
actually aware where I learned a lot
thanks to a great team and experienced
developers and crazy ideas and a
constantly changing roadmap they weekly
or so so and this is also a story about
bending some tools of our beloved
community for in some directions and for
for a good purpose
I like to start with with this page by
that feature in which he claims that he
laments the lack of writing tools for
efficient scientific communication
claiming that the existent writing tools
can hardly ensure that words reflect any
plausible model of reality and also that
often they methods described it are hard
to to be grabbed and underused so if we
want to rephrase it a bit more precisely
you can also ask what can our
technologies do against software erosion
or code drop so due to time and transfer
of projects from set up to 70 so next
journal is
trying to address these issues combining
text and code into a writing environment
that is also a life programming tool we
follow a computation model which tries
to be reproducible by design using Alex
here for managing code execution and
docker of the OS level to actually
evaluate code we borrow a lot of concept
from functional and say reactive
programming also to build a a web editor
that should allow you to easily publish
and probably share your methods and
replicate your results so while we are
actually improving on the social
infrastructure I will show you the today
mostly the editor which is at the core
of next journaling so well start from
from a blank page and you can insert
some the building blocks of of your
article and yes when you put some lines
of of julia code the code is executed on
our remote servers and it's executed in
isolation over some user configurable
docker image then yet you will see some
feedback on the side yeah here we
decided to support julia as a first
language and then we couldn't not
support python and our early test users
they required our that we needed to
support anyway and yeah - is kind of
experimental that it's used to set up
stuff and so yeah so
now when you what's happen when you
start another cell failing python then
you can maybe you can reference results
exported from from other cells we use
Jason to to restrict the set of values
that you can that you can export yeah
and only the values that you reference
will be actually exported from the cells
above so there is no global state and
values gets exported to the stack that
require them we also pull all the
language that we offer we support
drawing graphs with the plotly library
yes now whenever you change a cell
upstream and you we evaluated a new
result struct will be passed through all
other cells and and they will reacts
acute yeah something like this
so we yeah but we can also be better
than just these things this is an
article which was written by some
friends at the u3 University in Berlin
from the computational biology group
they provided their own doc title image
with some extra library for molecular
dynamics that's for instance that you
can consider yeah so then you can insert
some files like a Tony trajectories I
think that you can steal reference
you're in yourself and set up some some
parents and yeah so you see when we say
we we use JSON types or values to to
talk across different languages for same
language communication we we support say
richer type exchange in the case of
Python we can also serialize functions
and again you can do stuff yeah so the
picture that is at the core of this
being is it that we want to translate a
linear flow of cells with day references
and build some kind of graph of maybe
processes that will represent what you
write in the in the editor so in which
each code cell is actually a function
just of its code and and there and its
inputs so we are trying to make Python
believe he's a functional programming so
say you edit some some codes are there
and yeah the correspondent node will be
updated whatever this means we will see
it later and then only those nodes
depending on the on the node a will be R
executed giving then a feedback back to
the to the editor so more or less this
is it yeah so before I go in to the
details of the of the how we built the
graph we maybe take a tool across the
boundaries of
our Phoenix applications and how we
outsource the actual evaluation to some
satellite elixir apps to on some other
modes so um the editor application is
connected via a Phoenix channel from the
browser to to Phoenix okay over over web
socket and for the prompted act our
grant until they started with tried a
lot of ways starting with L for instance
and then rewriting until they settle to
the closure ecosystem with which they
are quite happy so far indeed they use a
closure script with this refrain
framework to the wrapper around react
event event based mostly then we use the
transit format still developed at copy
tech to to talk from the from the Java
JavaScript to their Phoenix to the Alex
field part and this is a richer richer
format them Jake built on JSON but
allows for extensible type definitions
and for instance you can exchange
keyboards closure keywords to items and
back or yeah have maps with me keys very
important for the closure people so and
okay so after so all all article
channels be they they refer to an
article manager which will civilize your
edit operations and can reveal the
article states the code cell information
so that when run command arrives he will
ask it will ask a scheduler to bring up
one of our runner application on some on
some agent in the network and this will
pick back the central Phenix app so that
they are then ranked connected from this
moment on they whatever their this graph
is can talk directly today to the editor
over Phoenix pops up so reaching the
channel topic to broadcast directly
today to the editor or any other topics
for internal communication with us Enoch
said so and the actual code evaluation
is done through alum ports on the on the
runner side we will see this later what
what is it about
so the pic of Jung stage was not the
first choice we actually started with
this tool this is a workflow award to
language Griffin in in Ireland by Jurgen
blunt which you might have heard already
from Berlin factory comes about this his
language so what what is it uniform
either is an abstraction for foreign
language interaction and pipelines of
data flow it's a mostly script based and
it's made of tasks definitions and and
queries which tie together results
from the different tasks so what we did
in the first place was to replace the
the cuneiform tosser and and build a
correspondent and Alec fear method
civilizational of our code cells which
will be then transformed into the
cuneiform ast which is our land terms so
and then such terms were then fed to a
cuneiform runtime which would evaluate
the code so while offering some crazy
features like parallelization and
complex operation on lists cuneiform
wasn't the perfect fit for us because in
order to submit the valuation you need
to serialize the whole flow so in this
sense it's the graph of stars but not a
graphics processor it if you need an
atomic war to be serialized in order to
to to evaluate so a few edit one of our
cells in in the editor you will need to
find the bottom element connected to two
days or more bottom elements and then
serialize the query up from there and
submit to the whole workflow to there to
our back-end it was fun we learned a lot
to how to structure a concept of a node
so that later we we tried out gen stage
which is the actual implementation it
you see that what the authors use to
describe it is this brand picture with
Alice want to remind you that Jen server
is
and an expansion of foreign state is an
extension of gen server in the sense
that if John further is an abstraction
of state and communication to and from
the same single process
gen stage add an extra channel of
communication between processes which
first need to subscribe to each other
furthermore gen stage implements
so-called teaming based approach you
heard Joe day before in which a a
producers want any more event than a
consumer asks for and then the consumer
will will receive a batch of processes
and won't ask again until a usually
blocking operation on the batches is
finished it is more or less what bad
pressure in a flow of source of events
and think should represent so what
actually we bypass the way demand
approach completely in favor of
exploiting gen stage subscriptions so
the idea there is that one subscriptions
are subscribed in a certain form you
don't need to to think about who to whom
you're sending sup some events mostly
like this once established you have this
dedicated channel for pushing and
propagating events and for this reason
we actually use stages of mixer type
producers consumers because they can
both handle events and also push them
downstream
yes what we want to do indeed is arrange
these processes implementing the age
behavior into a directed graph of stages
but where where the nodes are the the
stages and they edges are subscription
among them
so whenever the state the article state
hits our runner application we have a
exhaust manager which will start or
update these nodes based on their unique
IDs and when a load when a node starts
it will check its own state and will
subscribe to to the other nodes
accordingly
the graph manager will also shut down
nodes if they were removed in the in the
editor and and and staff and it will
also order nodes so that they started in
some topological ordering so that no
dependent node is started before any of
these dependencies yeah that we along
standard library for the gig in the
degraaf's module so no need to reach out
for other stuff in Erlang de Graaff
manipulation so but but what we have is
indeed a graph with labeled edges
because a cell can can require what can
reference explicit values defined from
from from their dependence indeed we
will act as languages that have a quite
a good introspection so that you can
know exactly what they define inside
this is mostly was roughly what they
subscribe we subscription API would will
do when you try to subscribe gray to
blue say except some reserved words like
to of course you can pace you can you
can put which other terms as options to
the subscription so that you can
actually think subscription data between
the zoo the two processes this is
because of callbacks which will be
triggered on both sides of the
collection when the subscription is
acknowledged so you can modify the state
of the process or you have similar cold
X if the subscription gets gets
cancelled and so
so yes this is their API for say
producing events on stage actually
extends if you see the block below
expense gen server
kha'zix on with an extra dispatch slot
with this thing you can be can actually
produce events and then as the handle
events callback which will receive
events maybe transform them and then
pass them over in the dispatch slot so
quite ODP compliant yeah
the figure similar for senior staff for
calls and info and so what is the life
cycle of our processes viewing updates
from the from the editor so assume this
configuration and the node derrick
depends on a and B and gets a call which
which changes its internal state to a
new function and the new dependency so
maybe you want to subscribe to to
someone else or we subscribe today to
the same node with different set of
required experts and then you will you
will check if you have all of your
needed dependencies and you will
actually fire if this is the case
spawning and a synchronous evaluation of
your of your tasks you will receive some
results struct back
that you will push downstream to the
three subscribers nodes of this one and
at the same time you will broadcast they
the results today to the prompting
because you know the topic off and you
can use pops up the same happens is if a
new result comes from my dependencies so
result camp
I will check if I have all the others
require dependencies to fire then I will
ask spawn and evaluation get something
back pushing down and broadcast the
result to there to the front it so and
this is other rather kind of balls and
if you this is what the reactive X
parody glue will would look like if you
have a function like our evaluation
based on parent like code and effect of
input we will actually fire not sooner
than having at least all the required
input and then we will fire evaluation
again when I mean of them changes to two
times
yes this is what happens roughly in code
we handle event when something you
arrived to to the cell we will receive a
result we will add it to the state we
will check if it's if we can fire
because we have all the results none of
them has ever or so and we will I think
schedule the evaluation of my body and
my with references to my dependencies
are I will actually push down errors
immediately to my subscribers so when
the evaluation is ready I receive a cast
with the results tracked
I will broadcast the result to the front
end and I will push it in the dispatch
slot to my subscribers which observe my
note
so for each for each language evaluation
works roughly like this we have an evil
process which receives my code
evaluation specs with body and stuff
this process owns a part to an early on
part to a language container pushes down
the the code through standard in and
receive something back to standard out
and gives the result back to the node in
question again through everything is
reachable through unique ideas so that
you know them you know your your process
yeah and this is back to the full
picture we have an editor of self which
pushes continuously it state updates to
the database and we mimic the user
interaction into a graph of processes of
gel stage processes we ever the code
when it's needed and we get something
back we propagate downstream and we
report back to the to the front indeed
it's quite colorful a message passing
picture because it's indeed at the core
it's all our message passing but it's we
use pub/sub phoenix password or PG to we
use usual calls and cast and we use also
this new
communication say classical of gem
server gem stage events which is again
in the end message passing so and if I
was finished early so if some few
remarks just one maybe is that my
experience with with Alex's of our say I
think it's a physics the language that
allows you to go from from drawings to
actually working programs in the left
then you can expect and yeah this is a
really good fit for for our lead and
that's it then maybe in one month high
school we see again here in Barcelona
Korean where our math in our founders is
talking about next journal again and
Josie is also giving a keynote there I
think and that's it thank you for
listening to this
all right fascinating stuff we're going
to do some questions forum until lunch
at 12:25 thanks for the token great use
of ports I wonder if you have bends to
handle you know when you cross the
boundaries across the languages you have
plans to have the ability to have very
large data sets that you may be
serialized in another way to pass them
through like with lazy evaluations and
database storage maybe then we learn
computer for that you don't have actual
data you have reference to to find
traction you may be done we are working
on this so it's not established but
current solution is you password
references immediate size of the engine
but there maybe we will go for content
addressing everywhere so that you can
duplicate there is
I am seeing in your nod craft a must not
a pesos theta2 two notes in djenne state
is not possible to test two tuners and
you are handing circuit these you can
configure your dispatcher type which can
learn a the other way around
yes from a node you can subscribe to
more if you choose the broadcast
dispatcher by default I think this
project yes do you have some experience
of the some performance measurements of
the specific gen states gen stage
authorties like how fast the dark data
item is protest in the whole graph or do
you have some experience on some
production environment and message
queues have beers or some crashes or how
do you handle these kind of failures in
this model so as I said at the beginning
it's not the real event way to leave the
stage because we don't really have this
such
they flow logical then because it's
mostly people typing on keyboard so it's
not about the demands or not about
measuring the flow initially which flows
which I just because this is really
discreet and this is no problem so our
problems are of a totally different
nature how tonight yeah so flowing the
graph those quadrants so we would have
done it we would have done it by hand
like picking your server storing the
nonsense
synchronizing but comes out stage
exactly yeah and I cannot the question
thanks little talks
awesome stuff I like this a lot this
reminds me a lot of I pipe notebooks in
do Python notebooks and the bring to the
end I like them a lot and the race to
the question can I use this on my
machine if you have to license buy your
product I'm sorry of course you can try
I would yeah we might that would be my
question for the lunch break one last
question
also I guess I should mention if you're
not hard to reach area like this
gentleman was appreciate if you pass
them down the road hi what I didn't
understood is have fun
as I click graph but what are the
constraints between the nodes as he
asked before when how do combine them in
practice in your project I mean
in your scenario for example is a Python
code inside your journal right how do
you interconnect them cows hoho what are
the actual constraints in your system
like you can make a reference from one
Python snippet into another does the
constraint or yeah wait I try I was so
thirsty here when you first of all both
all these languages the title doing
incredibly well in intersections can
slice the context of evaluation get me
that Julie as well are as well when the
results he'll come back he's carrying
over all the names that you have
actually exported your scripts but there
is no global state the parties close
after evaluation so result carried back
to today today just evaluated note all
the names that you can require from
other from other cells so when you then
how to complete those references to
these things you will know so on the
next execution you will tell the same
cell that you have to export this so we
actually write to find some contacts
then when when the dependent shall
execute before executing the script he
will reach out to these references read
the value in start with them or assign
them and execute this is the single but
we try to avoid global space let's have
one last round of applause for Andreya
