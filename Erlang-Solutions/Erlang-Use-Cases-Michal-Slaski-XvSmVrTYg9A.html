chance to hear the very interesting
presentation by Lev he already discussed
some of the properties of the airline
line which of the airline PM in my
presentation I will try to discuss them
quickly again but later I will focus on
showing some of the use cases for
airline as I have explained before there
are quite a few airline factories around
the world nowadays on those at those
conferences companies would present how
we used airline researchers would
present some new interesting projects
but it also turns out that not all
companies that do use airline admit that
that's the technology in their
technology stack some of those may be
feel like this is a competitive
advantage some others just didn't have a
chance to present which is why I think
that is important to actually educate
others how we use airline where is where
it has been put in production what was
the thing and so my presentation will
just focus on some of the presentations
you could find on airline dash pack.com
website I have stolen some slides from
different people here but my intention
is to once again just highlight some of
the interesting my opinion our use cases
first I have few slides just putting
features of airline here airline being a
functional language gives a nice high
level of abstraction so together with
pattern matching we get quite concise
readable programs I very much like the
comment my left that the airline code is
like what you see is what you get kind
of code its support it has support for
concurrency which very much helps with
scaling systems on multi-core machines
it has soft real-time properties which
is again a very nice advantage as well
the real-time web as we have heard
brought in some other areas like
telecoms were soft real-time systems are
needed
it's robust because it has very
interesting approach to consistent error
recovery I will not go into details of
all this my in my site because we don't
have enough time to discuss this but
here I just want to highlight some of
the interesting features which actually
make add up to a platform on top of
which interesting systems and solutions
are built
distribution is definitely one of those
it is built into the airline VM it's
relatively easy for a programmer to
communicate between the nodes in a
cluster in a ring so systems like ryuk
distributed database a relatively easy
to build at least the distribution layer
of it
is very nicely expressed through
Airlines impacts
another feature hot/cold loading it was
mentioned already today could be used in
production which is nice but it's also
very very nice feature for developers as
it as the development cycle short you
just add a new feature to your code
recompile and load a new module into
your system that you are testing which
is a very nice feature one which
shortens the each iteration of
development
Aaron is not a get o it has external
interfaces towards other external
systems and technologies it is quite
portable as you already have airline
running on UNIX windows VxWorks and such
and they will last but not least is a
feature of us for support for symmetric
multiprocessing where airline VM can
take advantage of old available cores of
your CPU I guess your laptops today have
dual core Intel sore quad cores already
but in production systems you already
see 24 corman CPUs so how do you take
advantage of this new power of your
hardware
thanks to the feature of p.m. which
allows spreading airline processes
across old available
chorus of the cpu headline theme can
actually take advantage of these new
hardware architectures
okay this was just a short introduction
and now on a couple of slides I would
like to show how this how different
industries had a chance to use airline
with success so we have games messaging
databases cloud automotive just name a
few
first comes the slide about demon world
which is an Irish company
where we use airline as an
infrastructure for the online game call
of duty black ops they have quite a few
users online as you may guess over two
million concurrent users airline is
being used here as a core server for
controlling Python tasks
so logic of the game is in a Python task
but all the distribution layer of the
TCP hunt link this is done by airline so
interesting use case where both
technologies combined together allow
them to serve such mass of online users
another example Luka
where they use also airline for social
gaming this is quite the popular set of
games that Guga is made as they report
they actually grow so this is maybe
already a bit outdated but having 1
million daily users generates quite a
lot of traffic having so many requests
per second and this is this is online
gaming creates a lot of challenges so in
this particular case Erlang has been
used to store user data airline
processes encapsulate state very nicely
the number of Erlang processes that we
can run on each machine can be up to
millions
so this is actually the way that airline
has paid for the well an advantage for
for Google packets
we have also airline being used in
messaging world which is actually quite
natural due to the nature of Erlang
processes and message passing
for example facebook chat feature which
was what a while ago but it has been
implemented with a bit of help from
airline where billion of user messages
were processed per day and for each user
in the system and Erlang process was
created and again it was not only
pushing the messages but also keeping
state of the user and by the way
facebook chat team got an airline user
of the Year award in 2009
so this is this was also good news for
them but also for us they're like
community because thanks to them a lot
of people were actually looking into our
life
there's quite famous XMPP implementation
in her line in jeopardy which implements
a lot of extensions and the dis running
it takes advantage of airline features
like distribution for tolerance cross
platform and so on which is why quite a
few companies around the world like
adapt this here on my slide I just put a
few like jabber the dog jumps uphill
hourglass but they're quite a quite lot
of fun at others too
another example of how Erlich was used
in messaging and what's up
they are actually very bright the
engineering team they have tweaked the
airline VM slightly to push it to its
limits
all of those modifications have been
published on github so we are available
not all of them are part of the
mainstream as far as I know yet but what
they have done with Erlang TM is
incredible we are talking here about
quite modern hardware with 24 logical
CPUs a lot of RAM as you can see and
those are the numbers that they were
shared with us a few months ago and
during the airline factor in San
Francisco almost 85% CPU utilization
across all 24 logical CPUs this is
really a lot with 2.8 million users
connected per box at peak time per box
this is really a lot and again of course
this required a lot of skills of the
engineering team as we were tweaking it
the VM as well but airline has been used
as a baseline platform for the system
few slides about the database solutions
built on top of our line we have right
here a masterless distributed database
which is scalable
you can add as many notes well as we
have heard action today during one of
the presentations there's drag core used
here as well so interesting project
interesting product there are quite a
few companies out there using drag
already
I just put here a few names like Comcast
the amber Boxer also some of the
classified ads are using online store
images also a react store images like
cilantro true
so this is an interesting database to
look at that there is another one
CouchDB also implemented in airline
which is schema free and it has
interesting replication model with
bi-directional config detection so again
this is one of those no sequel databases
and is sometimes we refer to them which
is being used in modern web development
but not on me and the develop beginning
it was built on top of the airline pian
some of the services outer that the use
a lot of different purposes like github
where airline is used dispatch requests
to Ruby machines the business logic of
github being implemented Ruby but
airline serving as the first layer
Heroku
again airline used the for distributing
traffic for automatic scaling so in
airline is now being more and more used
in cloud environments as we see the
growth was quite interesting
in this slide which I borrowed from
37signals the interesting thing is
airline and see comparison because when
people try out airline for the first
time we sometimes say ok well this is
certainly M right so code is interpreted
this never be fast but interesting
measurements done on the i/o intensive
Network intensive applications with some
degree of concurrency show that is not
that's not necessarily the case here we
have two implementation three
implementations in different languages
of the same chat feature of campfire and
the interesting bit is here that airline
can serve almost as many requests as see
implementation would do
having bit less code base to do the same
the latency is also very interesting and
instead of using a lot of OS processors
which are not always easy to coordinate
which is this is using just one airline
VM process and within the airline RS
process a lot of airline processes will
be found each one to probably serve each
utcp
requests but this is interesting part we
have less code we have less OS processes
to work with but still that at least the
benchmarks of I've been doing show that
this was not so much slower than C
implementation
and another use case I put here on my
slides it's a quick check it was also
mentioned here today it's well it's used
for property based testing which is an
interesting approach quite different
from unit testing that is widely adopted
here we actually generalize we have some
properties defined first domain define
first and then we can generate a lot of
use cases for free meaning it just takes
time to generate them but it doesn't
involve the user it's automatically
generated within a random fashion and
where this has been used well in very
many projects we are using this on day
to day basis for one of the interesting
use cases for this is automotive
industry the quick big company behind
quick checkered shirts quite a few
presentations on how we use airline and
quick check to test and verify modern
cards where you have
well tens if not hundreds nowadays
so-called ECU's which are small units in
a car which need to communicate with
each other they were responsible for
every small operation of your car and
now how do you make sure that all they
talk to each other there are no bugs and
actually that if those processors come
from different vendors that way I still
can talk to each other so
no longer talking about the scalability
and fault-tolerance here talking about
interesting tool quick check for testing
but the done in air line actually helps
testing also airline programs
so those were just some few examples
I just wanted to
help you kick off exploration of airline
dash pack.com website because this is
where we put all of the slides most of
the videos that were captured during
factories so you can learn quite a lot
about how people use their line what is
for what are the trends and I really
encourage you to think more about it
and I think this was really it that I
wanted to say today so thank you is
there are any questions I can probably
still take them now as we have still
quite a few minutes I will also be here
till even tomorrow so we can keep on
chatting ongoing thank you
I have a question about a hookah use
kids as an instant they use air lung is
key value storage right right
I know that they actually grow the
airline theme quite a lot and we find
more and more use cases for airline at
googa so probably what I know about
hygge is already outdated as well keep
on using airline for different purposes
okay thank you
so as we know airline emerged like in
mid 80s and since then it camp basically
a rather low profile and started to gain
popularity right after 2000
five when we all know free lunch was
over yeah and we couldn't anymore again
product
they're four months from raising CPU
clock times right
so John two technologies that utilized
properly multicores but since then
virtue safar link we adopted by other
languages like as I said Java Scala now
have
acha which uses the same extra module
message space and stuff like that
so don't you think that Erlang loses its
chance to gain to become really
mainstream language because now other
languages uses a lot provide the same
killer features of a language but they
more widely spread
hawkers
um this question is being asked over and
over again I think it was also asked the
before the previous presentation I think
that everyone has some niche here it
depends how you define a mainstream
technology
I wouldn't use Erlang for everything I
would just use it for some class of
problems where it really shines so I see
that Scala being tightly integrate those
with Java world and probably having
lower cost entry for people that come
from Java is natural choice and I also
see airline having some interesting
features which are not in other
languages yet and this makes it actually
quite tempting proposition for for
developers anyway so I don't see airline
really losing here I see tremendous
growth of interest when you see the
numbers at conferences the number of
companies hiring looking for airline
developers a number of new projects
popping up on github or other places I
see it growing and that that's just a
trend that we observe for quite a few
years right now so this discussion will
probably continue whether Scala or akka
or other technologies are better suited
to an airline certain class of problems
so like I think this will just keep on
going for now I wouldn't say that there
is like like one
one victor victory here one winner here
