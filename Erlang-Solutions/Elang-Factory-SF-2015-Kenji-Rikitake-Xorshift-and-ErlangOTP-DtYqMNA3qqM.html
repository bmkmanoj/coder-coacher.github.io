and I'm going to talk about an
implementation of our G code x or shift
star and how it's gone how it some be
implemented in our tepee and general
random number tips on their own
programming and other may be applicable
to other programming stuff ok um hi I
will I was a I was doing the ACM
workshop 2011 chair and I've been here
for six consecutive years and this is my
sixth year to be here and bay i'm very
proud to be here and talking to you this
face is very surprised that this is my
this is pretty mia this is just
photograph okay the executive summary
I'm when I make this kind of talk it's
always the same but do not try invent
your own algorithm especially on random
numbers or cryptography don't do that
otherwise you're in big trouble so why
PRN okay i use prng for pseudo-random
number generator just remember PRN geez
it's very hard to pronounce a
pseudo-random number generator every
time so why PR energy is matter I made
of I made the first stock up prng in our
own factory of 2011 and at that time I
was talking about SF empty an
implementation which I'm going to talk
about later and I propose there there
that random module random number of
reason is kind of weak then and it's
2015 now four years later and
unfortunately people are still using the
old implementation of a random module
which is actually fully exploited not
only by me but I I could exploit within
the nine hours I can I'm going to talk
to you about about it later so what I'm
what I like to like to tell you is that
we should stop using it now I'm trying
to convince the OTP team
and there's a tryst 11 supporter in OTP
team bukavu who is country enough his
name is Duncan Bunsen and he's a very
experienced called writer Olin and he
and I'm being working together with a
new implementation but anyway so I
decided to do the talk again and it is
accepted so I'm going to talk about
rounded numbers okay p our energies are
everywhere one of the audience's has
asked me about using the game using
random Lana's own game which is actually
rolling dice and I've heard that there's
a random number generator actually
rolling dice na sit with the machinery
and taking a photograph every time and
converting to the real number real I'm
real integer numbers but that is too
slow so people want to do you do the
computers you use the computers and more
faster algorithm and there's another
important application of random number
called property testing property testing
has a lot of aspects because one of the
aspects is that you put out so many
different random kinds of parameters
into a function so that so that the
function goes to go goes crazy or
functions just handles the error
property or something like that dil
there are two three major tools quick
check popper and trick those stuff all
duo are all doing the property testing
and use the random numbers very
effectively and I'm going to explain
this in the next ride but there's an
actual application about entering
randomness into the input and observing
the randomness coming out to the system
one of those is that the variation in
earnest electronic circuits a chronic
circuits are not necessarily linear
linear means easy to analyze you know
it's it's sometimes very complex so the
only way to analyze is often you you
have to change the input and
serve the output and there's another
stuff like that on for the especially
for the network management it's about
network congestion and delay analysis
and there's a utility in freebsd which
artificially drops packets randomly or
artificially delays packet for certain
periods of time which can affect really
simulate the network trouble which is
which is very convenient and useful and
for the real world business risk
analysis or project schedules is often
conducted using the random numbers
adding random risks or the schedule
delay or kind of damages affected by the
lots of incidents or whatever and
there's another important application
it's about generating passwords but for
generating passwords don't use the
algorithm I show you in this
presentation use the secure PR energies
only only secure ones please or
otherwise you'll be in a big trouble
okay um let me wrap it let me explain
variation analysis of a Panthers fielder
this is a rhetoric this is an electronic
circuit which has a six component one
two three coils one two three capacitors
and if they are they if there are actual
values are as design there will be no
need for random number analysis or press
a variation analysis but in the real
world you won't be able to have the
actual value of those components under
that they they will almost always be
having some sort of offset between the
given value and active re so if
everything is designed the shape of the
this is frequency and this is level and
what I pro
what I show you what is about the voice
filter so that cutting the lower part of
frequency and the higher part of the
frequencies as the as as designed and
without variance you don't have to worry
about the how parameters are really
changing but when you actually make the
circuit you have to allow some some
percentage of variance maybe one percent
five percent or ten percent so let me
show you the simulated result of with
the tempest ten percent variance
actually this is the cumulatively result
of drawing many times or plots
overlapped just overlapping the plots
it's so simple but the important thing
is that the cutoff frequencies varies on
not so much in this case but in some
complex circuits which uses feedback or
positive feedbacks it will be a do it
will cause some disastrous effect so
this kind of simulation is necessary
when you not just design an electronic
circuit but make a real product to sell
because you cannot find you cannot have
the design value of the parts after all
so um to make a show this is a property
test of the hardware so we're going to
do something on you have to do something
like this on a software too okay um next
topic is about how PR energy works it's
quite simple it's a almost PR energies
are designed as iterative process of the
for example when you give a seed number
one it computes put into the function
let me say it PR NC and it gives the
state it gives a seed change to c2 and
result one and when you give the sea to
the pr NZ it gives us III and resolve to
this is a pure see control iterative
process so it's really actually it's
really hard to make this computation
parallel
consistently um some people how I've
heard some people have invented a
so-called counter based random numbers
actually it's like a it's not giving a
seat but it's it gives number number one
PR number one of the result number two
of the result number three of the
readout four point five and six and so
they it's a sequential counting PR NC
but that kind of PR energy algorithm is
still not popular you have to deal with
the internal state and you have to put
in the internal state and and get the
output state to step into the next step
so um if you think about this you have
to be very careful for them for running
multiple processes simultaneously on the
same algorithm if you do not care free
choose the seed the output parameter the
output sequences will overlap with each
other and that may affect the result of
simulation or what you're going to do
very much and one specific thing for a
line which I didn't describe in this
ride is that random function or the old
implementation I introduced in this
presentation uses the process dictionary
the evil so if so the random number
begin belongs to the process so when you
generate the process used a new process
you have to see the random number random
number London up numbers I'm in the
internal storage in the process
dictionary otherwise it will be a lot of
trouble ok so
I'm not going to talk about secure
piensas secure PR NZ's in this
presentation it's solely designed for
password and cryptographic key
generations with strong security and
presumably monstery from the physical
random number generator it's very hard
to obtain physical randomness because
you cannot predict them you cannot
compute them you have to get them from
the actual physical i say phenomena such
as such as from semiconductor diode or
sampling the ambient noise or maybe the
ionospheric noise or whatever but those
are very scarce scarce resources so
don't use do not use secure pier and z's
so much I mean don't waste them please
and for all and almost always use crypto
stronger and bites / one only and
because this is a guaranteed entropy
guaranteed random number generator api
for openssl if you don't believe in
offering so you can invent your own but
open SSL is I think it's too far
rewritable than me so okay um and I'd
like to emphasize again that the
randomness I use the word entropy
because it's a technical term for the
randomness um entropy gathering takes
time so if you use 1000 bite of the
security r and z you have to wait for
certain amount of time it could be one
millisecond or it could be it could ever
be one second if in the worst case but
it depends on the operating system and
it's been it um behaves absolutely
differently between the Linux or a
freebsd but anyway it takes time so if
you if you learn them not device Vox I
that would be you have to wait and once
again this is cryptography so using only
use proven algorithms okay so in this
stock I'm not I'm going to talk about
non-secure PR energies on these PR is
may be vulnerable to cryptographic
attacks because of the many
characteristics those clearances have
for example they are predictive totally
predictive give the same seed same
result but this is all so unnecessary
characteristic when you use it as
simulation you don't want to use the you
don't want to expect different outputs
on every simulation and it for the
testing purpose when you you you want to
have the same output for the same input
so this is the necessary characteristic
and in most of the implementations the
output is in uniform distribution which
means that the old values output have
different are no the same probability
with each other and non-secure PR
energies usually have a lot of internal
state choices it will be it may be for
64-bit 128 bits or 1024 bits but it's
right it's fairly long for the actual
use and but mathematical is saying these
PR energies are not an infinite infinite
infinite sequence it's a it has a seat
it's a sequence which period although
the period is very very long so that
there would be no intelligible patterns
but in the real world non-secure Piron
and these often fail those failures
could be found from the observable
patterns by making a graph graphical
representation or can be proven from a
very short period of showing up the same
number sequence again or brute force
exploitation of computing all the
possible results of a PR NC sequence
okay this is one of the failures
well-known filers of PHP 5 on windows
not on linux I i I've heard but see
these lines and see these arcs these are
the visible evidence that this one this
PR energy is fold okay there's another P
of PR NC filers which I discovered in
2013 a game a game maker called
cryptocat wanted to do something like
this this is out output of dev you
random which is a sort of proven strong
PR NZ's in the world either the world of
radix or previous day but by by changing
the counter value from 249 to 250 they
they they made something like this with
the grid patterns and of the repetitive
stuff and this was considered a serious
bug and they had to withdraw the
withdrawal the implementation and change
the implementation so when you implement
prng by yourself please do test them if
you have to test them if you don't have
to don't okay and our OTP has I don't
want to criticize anybody in OTP team
but an embarrassing story of the
first-ever security advisory was about
PR NZ our own people for somewhat
unknown reason used unsecured PR NZ
namely random module into ssh libraries
key generation and this was found by the
very talented engineer whose name is
Jeff Kent
and he and he and slowly described how
to exploit the whole stuff in this us
vulnerability vulnerability report I
like you to read this latest ones and
this is so astonishing how is Ray can
how easily people can exploit such a
thing and now this bug is fixed since if
this bug was in 2011 and I think people
are developing Island OTP is getting
much more wider than then then then then
then but anyway if you are using in
unsecured PR NZ's for secure security
purpose to result with the disasters so
don't do that please and there's other
own random number problem in Ireland
which has been done so for so many years
but nobody is actually talking about
this many times is that the algorithm
being used in a random number routine
code AS 183 is actually old designed in
1980s when 16-bit computers was invented
and the creator of the algorithm
specifically said or written or sorry we
all wrote that it's 46 to 16-bit
computers and actually the first
algorithm it was appeared in to the
general public was in the byte magazine
do you know black magazine may be many
many okay you know then you know what
the micro computers are it's not it's
not it wasn't personal computer okay
those stop the folklore anyway all right
the the period of the sequence generated
by ace 183 I actually brute force boost
falsely X computed all the OT numbers in
in a very fast way using using the
modern computer called Mac Mini and the
more modern is a modern core i5
and it took only nine hours using single
core to exploit seven 3-run sequences
it's about 22 43 so two 243 is not
enough even for the non-secure use of
random number generators and one of the
very talented armed people Richard
O'Keefe criticized me that I was doing
nothing new either academic or
engineering perspective nothing she
completely she completed hit me and I of
course I know I know I accepted that i
received a four hundred percent and i
know he didn't criticize me because he
he also wrote me that you are trying you
are trying to spread new algorithm
that's good and that's what that's
wonderful and it's really hard for
everyone to get the word wonderful film
him but he's absolutely right so I'm
doing nothing new for this nothing new
means this is so trivial that everybody
came to do it so what I've done let me
talk let me get into the things what I
what I've implemented not invented but
implemented inventors inverters those
algorithms should be risked this fact is
much more than a much more than I am but
anyway these are five algorithms number
one SMMT olin which was which I proposed
which are presented in HTM workshop 2011
formally and also in all factory SF bay
and 2011 and it has a very long period 2
to 1 91 91 9937 absolutely no links i
think is physically meaningless of
having this long period but
mathematically saying this is true and
this is proven by the two mathematicians
i'm proud to say that to two people are
both japanese matsumoto professor
matsumoto and professors nishimura
and SF MT is also designed by another
talented talented Japanese person called
um um I'm sorry I'm nahin his name is
his name cycle professor site oh ok and
Saito and matsumoto invented another
short short period type of an empty
empty algorithm called tiny empty and
this was presented in 2012 Allen
workshop and today I'm going I'm going
to briefly talk about these exs stuff
exhaustive sea star 64 exhaust is to
pass 128 exhaustive starts 1024 did star
and plus stuff are the words the
algorithm properties and its or sift is
the name of the core algorithm and these
algorithm generates 64-bit output and
the period is kind of trivial because if
it has the number 64 the period is 2 2
64 minus 1 128 22 128 minus 1 and so on
ok about SF mt it the MT is an acronym
for Nelson twister and there's a superb
mathematician called Nelson and he he
discovered that certain numbers are 22
up prime number minus 1 will be a prime
number and there's a contest of finding
out a largest prime number in the world
every time and almost all of these
numbers are Nelson numbers so professor
matsumoto one of the inventors of
Emerson at wit my son twister given put
his name on the what he invented and
this default prng on pison matt rob c
plus 11 and r and i think it's also in
ruby and everything so it's quite proven
i think and its internal state has 624
30
to Viet numbers or better say to an 2496
bites so the internal state is huge but
the algorithm itself is works in this
way you first calculate the internal
state of the Holy big internal state and
output the output a chunk of the
internal state I'm in 32-bit every time
for 624 times and if all the chunks are
output the algorithm calculate another
batch of the internal state so this is
how SF empty works so ok and SF mty SF
means it's is for seemed oriented
fasteners and twister so it's an
algorithm improved from the original
mersenne twister and I tell I've told
you many times but it has an extremely
long period of two to one 9937 and even
longer period versions are available if
needed and you can find it in my path in
the past pastor how do you say in my
guitar archive on the past were say past
ha tag or how to say anyway history oks
FMT arlen gains a lot by knaves because
it needs bulk state initialization so it
has to calculate 624 32-bit numbers and
kniffen izing this will be making things
much faster I I I I measured very
briefly that I and on the freebsd
messina of Korra 5 and the state
initialization or going to say but gas
generation was 100 times got 100 times
faster between the pure on and see but
when you measure the total generation
time including the generating a chunks
from the internal state the speed game
is much less than 100 it's only 16 on
this is presumably because the chunking
general chunking of the big numbers is
done in a pure island because making it
nif making it an EF is making things
more complicated and gains nothing so
making it into a using a pure a line and
with list mixing actually made Singh
much faster please refer to my SMS FMT
paper or smt presentation which is
available for my own site my own website
you can you ask me the URLs later okay
and then the other one is called talent
i'm tiny mt and it's go tiny medicine
twister and the period is shoulder but
sufficient sufficiently longer than
random module 2 2 127 and good thing
about this is that internal state is
very small for 32-bit numbers for
internal state plus three 32-bit numbers
which explains a polynomial of the gin
or polynomial of the tiny mt and by
choosing or pre calculating the
polynomial you can choose up to 22 fixes
to 256 choice of also also go now
polynomials also by all means are
completely different number sequences so
by using these characteristics wise ria
you can you can make you can generate
the unloader unavailing sequences for
each process especially for parallel
computing but i first made nifs and
known if version of this but i
eventually throw away the new new
version
for the reasons described in this right
because tiny mt does not help buckland
your initialization it computes every
time of the internal state from the
given polynomial and other internal
states and the state calculation
complexity is small so even if you will
press it to an f you don't gain much and
most of his execution time of tiny mt
was function calling overhead that's
what I've got from the f prof f
profiting whole stuff and in this and in
comparing with even comparing in years
of tiny mt + SF mt SF md was faster for
some strange reason or vedas am I should
I should conclude that the overhead of
the function calling is so big so I
decided to put out all the
implementation about this and read that
the users suggest to use the non newest
version so why nifs are why so our
newest effective or our nips necessary
for random number generation I have to
conclude not really not really means if
you generate lot none lots of number
sequence one once at once means which
means 10,000 times or 100 thousand
thousand numbers of chickens at once you
will need near and that would be
effective but there's another there's a
side effect actually an adverse effect
of near that nymphs walked the schedule
so when you spend 100 microseconds in
there on a beam scheduler can do
anything any other things so that will
be a huge problem when you when you hand
handle will juggle a lot of processes
simultaneously like in the database
software like react or rabbitmq queuing
software or other stuff so the rule of
thumb is that if sniffs are not needed
don't use them this I think this is a
common sense among your own problems but
the reality is kind of tough and you
have to make the fast fast fast programs
so if nifs are really needed you have to
tune this church or and that is almost
always inevitable and don't ask me about
that please ask someone else like Lucas
Ralston or Scott fritzy they are the
real experts they they I don't know if
they if they can design the algorithms
but they observe profile profile profile
and go to get to the reason and change
it and may get get the things worked get
to sing work so Alan seizure is so
complex so don't take it for granted
okay so well so what is X or shift
exhort shift is originally invented from
by the mathematician called mazzaglia
and and he suggested that scrambling the
output of exhort shift will be making
the RNG much better better means will be
resilient to the stronger tests strong
apparent tests so another mathematician
called Sebastiano big nough he invented
and he not really fully inventing but he
calculated and try a lots of patterns of
parameters of scrambling and got to the
result of the three principal algorithm
64 * 128 process and southern 24 * and
according
to his evaluation results these are our
these are showing much better result
than SF mt or tiny mt under the test
called test 201 okay so I am NOT a
mathematician so I cannot I cannot one
hundred percent guarantee that this
result is correct but I I can I think I
can trust these people these people have
already released their own papers and
these are publicly available so please
read them if you if you are interested
in and good thing about Exorcist is
exhaustive starting classes that those
c-cold see pieces of code is in torrey
public domain so no licensing issue and
they are deceptively simple let me show
you the eggs or 664 only five lines
that's it r represents 64-bit internal
state and remember that r is not
directly used as the output all I'll
becomes a 1 or 2 and r 3 and r 3 is the
new state but the output is scrambled
with just multiplying this I don't read
a strange kind of number but this works
very on Sebastian avena says this works
very effectively and exhort 6024 this
has two steps number one is about six
lines which uses two pairs of 64-bit
numbers into one state one output state
and one random number generation output
and the algorithm uses a sort of a ring
buffer structure in NC it's much easier
to write uuuuu use pointer and the
it'd be 10 the point of value from 0 to
15 but that is not good on otherwise if
you if you if you try to use the ra ra
library I'm not saying you're in trouble
but what RA is doing actually handling a
lot of tuples so I don't recommend that
so what I what I invented was using to
pair list to simulate or bears the
implement on link buffer like structure
I'm not going to explain this code you
can you can just test run with this code
and how the pair of lists behave um it's
so simple that one lists get a shorter
the other one is getting longer but and
if the other one the one gets used up
the other one gets rich rivers and put
put the the first one and it's gone
going on and oh and no no no so I think
this is the I think this is the soul
part of my own invention on this our
algorithm I have to tell you the truth
but but since the algorithm is so good i
really recommend these algorithms
because these are so simple and easy to
prove easy to prove if they are getting
something wrong so please try using them
and anyway i also measured some brief
performance values and to get the most
out of these algorithms using hype it's
highly recommended because hype has the
optimization optimization facilities of
integer integer calculations inside but
one bad news is that Han during full
64-bit numbers on a 64-bit machine means
calculating big numbers too bad but this
is the reality of a line because in on a
long short integer only only can have
the length up to 59 bits unsigned 60
bits signed it's in the manual it's in
the internal internal representation
manual check please do check it out but
measuring this I was kind of surprised
that on the exs 64 it wasn't so slow the
execution time was less than two times
of random random means random module and
even on the excess thousand 24 it's
slower than the excess 64 but it's
approximately the same as the twice of
random so regarding the output is
getting longer from 43 to 64 bits the
speed penalty of those extra lift
algorithms how are what I think the
speed battery is worse being paid for so
this is the not the not the final
suggestion I think there are many many
more different perspectives on PR
energies but these are suggested
purposes for the alternative PR energies
SFMTA long have has already been used by
many people and especially i'm i'm so
happy that the cost is a bonus proper
can choose SMMT as a as an algorithm
from the property test and for tiny MTO
on i've calculated a 268 million
polynomial parameters when i was in tone
kill Kyoto University are you running
this okay five minutes on running 10
minutes okay learning the 32 32 cores of
a server no I'm sorry 16 close observer
for 32 days but so you can feel free to
use that
it's on github it's a huge archive but
it's on github so and for exs 64 I think
this is pretty useful as a replacement
for a random module or a year or a s 183
and for exs plus um this is this
algorithm does not gain much from the
excess 64 but if exs 64 has are some
sort of deficiency you can try this exs
the XS + + 4 for a very long period if a
very long period is needed maybe more
than 200 bit or 300 bit of an integer
number exs thousand 24 is a very good
choice okay um this is the last topic
about merging them to OTP I think this
is the hardest part and it's a work in
progress down gillmansen offered me that
to use my implementation for OTP
recently actually on january and first
licensing issues as always and about exs
stuff these are perfect me and my
implementation i just looked at my key
license and i have no difficulties and
rewrite sensing in whatever license for
to learn our own people and i had to ask
for permission so for all the inventors
of SF empty and the tiny mt about
realizing singh levi since it is to earn
people with their own license and i'm
saying their own license and vaguely
just because the recently Kenneth London
told me that our own perfect license is
going to be a PL to your no laughing
this is really our own public license
will be dished from the OTP 18 so the it
will be 8 AAPL to and the change was
after i made this slide so sorry about
that but done the the devil son that so
anyway
the license is cleared I also I am dan
and I talked over the email a lot about
this and it was expected to be cold as
new random dan worked hard about that
but as a final decision OTP team said no
random should be as this for the
backward compatibility well that was
well that is a wise decision so it's
renamed into R and I don't know if the
name will be kept the same but ramp is a
new new new routine and no no new new
module and I've given a different
project name called EMP rng for islands
multiple PR NC you can pronounce it EMP
are as your NPR n0 subject and it has
all the random compatible functions
built in which is switchable just given
an atom to a certain function so that
the internal state will be changed
actually represent one metal each of the
each of the algorithm name and the
different the big difference is that
default algorithm is exs 64 okay so what
about the future directions of this my
random number stuff okay I'll keep probe
I'll keep promoting burning and deep
replicating the good old random module
for for all the reasons all the possible
reasons and use something else that is
much better if you have your own project
try using your exs 64 some other arm
people have already done has already
have already done by themselves and they
have gained very good results and
merging our ampm PR and g2 OTP this will
be more much difficult because I have to
write a lot of tests without test though
the del vino Reese so and the Derby I'm
damp report has proposed me are quite a
few enhancements proposals such as moral
reasons or use the surprise functions
and last but not least analyzing the
performance implication of large case
large-scale applications of these new
algorithms is necessary I am worrying
about I'm worrying if the NIF based
SFMTA could crash react if we are
reacties is used against FMT this is a
distance or serious concern so if you
have any better experience on using
these algorithm in oh so that I can take
I can take care of it or i can work get
work around it for that so thank you
very much I said okay all right
questions Fred what kind of hand what
yeah yeah hmm that's a very good
question because when you when you see
when you even ok the question is that
how do I choose a period works or period
yourself and it's really hard har means
even if you see that there is a book
code the numerical recipes for NC and
the author says 22 to 30 32 to 64 is
enough enough for what they don't and
professor be Nia vigna says so16 vendor
also says that longer period nothing
does not necessary guarantee a good
random number if I think he's saying
this for from his observation from the
test results but injury in juror
speaking on his robe Sun for exhaust
safety is that 64 is enough for daily
use that such as a replacement for
random or shear shear and Rand routine
or something like that thousand 24 will
be
asian for all almost all possible
physical or maybe algorithm algorithm
simulations and he also gives 4096
version of The Exorcist our and he said
that an overkill that's what I can say
okay um the question was about their
heart above a proposal of running of
fips 140-2 that's right it's a kind of
is it's a regression test hmm where
where where they're putting it in an OTP
process a could whether you can put it
put it in our own TP testing process
that would be i I don't know whether it
would be possible but it's uh it's I
think it's a good proposal because that
kind of that kind of testing should be
needed for any any kind of random number
generators I think and lots of people
have their own exhaust shift like
proposals recently though there was a
proposal on Twitter sent to me from
local young animator of a cowboy I'm in
a cowboy well well web server he told me
that there's a implementation for the
PCG and down kundan Singh also suggested
me their work they were better
implementation of jig rod and there are
lots of lots of those implementations
because it's about how it's about how
scrambling how a better better where
you're scrambling is discovered so I
think your idea is good but I don't know
whether OTP see a team says yes to that
did I answer your question okay
okay actually actually this these are
not fully optimized among the rule of
thumb in early okay um well his question
was it are they really optimized and I
said no because I'm that to rural some
in their own communities that you have
to you have to make it work first and
make it profile then optimize and I'm
thinking about the the same thing like
you do yeah because this sift or world
lengths on especially of the shots into
the limitation of to 264 to 259 that
will affect the overall performance a
lot but that that is a for future work
so i think it's drive is over thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
