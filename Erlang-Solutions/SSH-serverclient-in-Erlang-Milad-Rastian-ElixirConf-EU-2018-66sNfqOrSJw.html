today today I'm here to talk about with
you about something that caught my
attention lately and it's not a popular
topic like they like big data or
deploying your alexia to the to
production like the other talk in the
other room but it's something that you
do and we use every day so what I would
like you to take away from this talk is
to no undress to understand how the SSH
works internally a bit of introduction
of myself i'm minlid rezian and I
started using Alex here from 2015 or 16
almost end of 2015 and I wanted to be
part of the great electric community
that's why I started to work on the
elixir cream project if you are a VM
user are you highly recommended to take
a look at it and then later I moved to
Berlin I am a Konark or instead of the
Alexi barely meet up we have a regular
meet up every second Thursday of the
month if you are in Berlin make sure you
join us and see the lovely community of
elixir in Berlin and also I started to
work in a company called high mobility
the company is in base Berlin and we are
doing we are building a developer
platform for connected cars we before
you ask we do run a luxury in the cars
but because those are prototype cars so
it still counts I would say we are we
are running a competition platform the
Porsche if you have any if you are if
you like building application for cars
or you have some ideas make sure you
take a look at this competition and you
can also have you can also earn some
prizes and also get your idea introduced
to the per ship company
we use SSH everyday from pushing a git
commit to github or get hit lab if you
will and we also push our code sometimes
if you are using Heroku to Heroku using
SSH and if you are maintaining a
back-end server sometime maybe you SSH
to the different host for maintaining
them the goal of this talk is to give
you idea of how SSH works internally so
you have better understanding of SSH and
also gives you idea how to use as a
search in your align as a server or
client I divided this talk to two main
sections the first part is is about the
SSH as a protocol how does it work how
does the keep the graphic work how does
the secure connection establish an and
so on and the second tag second half I
talked about the SSH module the SSH
server and the client can use it and
also the some unknown feature of the SSH
which is subsystems I'll talk about them
how to use it in elixir SSH it stands
for secure shell but it's an our first
name because it's not a shell but it's a
protocol to to make a channel between
two Huss having an end-to-end encryption
without anyone in the middle of it
middle of it read the data or or
interrupt the data it the man of the
main usage of SSH is of course the
executing remote server it doesn't stop
there there are plenty of software's
implementing the protocol and as you see
here if I guess they're like SSH library
our own language array is there and also
the most famous one is the OpenSSH here
if you want to see the full lists of the
implementation and see the comparison
what is different between them take a
look at this website as I said itself
it's a as I mention it's a protocol it
includes
for other particles that take care of
part of the systems we have the user
authentication layer which handles
provide number of authentication
including passwords and public key and
handles the cat the client and we have
the transport layer which handles the
initial key exchange setting of
encryption compression and integrity
check there's also a connection layer a
single SSH connection can host multiple
channels simultaneously all of them
running running together and sending
data back and forth as I mentioned the
SSH is included for protocols but the
fourth one is a bit also unknown the
idea is about saving the server's
fingerprint of public key inside the DNS
record so the client can verify the
authenticate the genuinely of the server
using that DNS but is not commonly in
use so if I put put all of them together
then the SSH when user enters a command
in the shell the transport layer
initializes the connection sets of the
encryption the authentication layer you
authenticate the user and if the user is
valid the the connection layer starts a
connection and then when a user wants to
execute a command it send it opens the
channel to the server and sends the
command through the channel so if now
that we went through the SSH if you want
to redefine the SSH it's more SSH makes
the network connection between two
computer with a strong guarantee that
both parties of the inside is genuine it
also ensures that the data between
the little passing over this channel is
unmodified and unread by if there are
person so basically after the setting of
businesses you can't send any packets
through the SSH some people use it for
bypassing filtering and firewalls
which I used to do a lot and some people
use it to forward the X clients or of
course some use it for the just
executing commands let's go through the
history of SSH because understanding the
history give us perspective
understanding why the why they stopped
work the way that they do today the SSH
was first implemented in 1995 by tattoo
alone if I pronounce his name correctly
due to the past 40 sniffing attack in
Helsinki the stinky University of
Technology Network
so most after the thing that we are
using coming from from Helsinki that's
interesting Linux and SSH and then there
is another group that start the most
famous implementation of OpenSSH which
was in 1999 it was until 2006 that both
groups implement or wrote the ssh-2
protocol and it becomes the thing that
we are using right now most of the
implementation supports - - some of them
are using SSH one just for backward
compatibility just looking at timeline
it's quite interesting that until 1995
most of the user were sending data or
network didn't have much network but
still sang in data through the
unencrypted channels and as you know
airline falls first lives in 1986 and
that might be the very reason that the
the way that the two nodes are
connecting together is using cookie
sending over clear text on that time it
was fine before going into the details
of the SSA I just go through the
cryptographic of part of it quickly is
deserve its own topic in the queue blog
Rafi but I just try to lay the grant for
the part that we need later in the SSH
section
the encryption is the process of
converting a text to a cipher using a
encryption key we call a cipher and the
way that when the decide nobody can read
the cipher or modify the cypher there
are two encryption algorithm symmetric
and asymmetric the symmetric algorithm
is a sacred key base so we use same key
for for decrypting and encrypting the
the message the plaintext and you need
to distribute the key to be able to
unencrypted the data it kind of not much
good for at least for maybe for all
cases because how do how would you
transfer the key in a dynamic
communication like like the network to
network communication the second part is
the symmetric or public key ciphers in
this category instead of instead of one
kid to 2 K a keeper which is public and
private is used a ciphertext that is sin
that is encrypted by a public key is
only able to decrypt using its private
key counterparts you need to keep the
private key private and then you can
distribute the public key without
worrying about the disclosure so when
someone sends a sacred message then they
encrypt it with your public and you are
the only one that can decrypt the
message so the thing is which one is
used in SSH you might say that a
symmetric because of the futuristic of
it but there is a catch the common
public in first algorithm is is enormous
this lower compared to the other one by
order of magnitude and it's simply it's
infeasible to to encrypt that large
quantity of data using the public key
ciphers for this reason modern
encryption use both of them combines
them together so just quickly see how
how we would work the
if Alice Alice want to send a message to
Bob at least we create a random key and
then encrypt the plain text that she
wants to send to Bob using that random
key and then she later she encrypt the
public key
she encrypt the random key by Bob's
public key and send it over the network
now no one can availed no one is able to
read the data because of the encryption
and also the speed of the public
algorithm is not a problem because a
small amount of data were encrypted now
on the other side Bob reverse the
process and and can read the data back
this middle have the advantage of both
system and in fact SS use some
techniques like this in user data
Crossing an SSH connection is encrypted
using a fast secret key and the key for
which is shared through the two parties
using the public key methods the last
section that we are going to talk about
in the cryptography then we go to the
internal of SSH is defi Hellman
algorithm it's quite interesting the way
that the way that it works is that it
generates a shirt shirt sacred key
between two parties without sending it
over an unencrypted net connection
each party uses its own pub its own
private key and the public key of other
one to come up with the to come up with
the session key and surprisingly these
two key that the cow are our match ours
are the same I'm not going to prove it
to you mathematically because it's hard
and takes time but instead I you can you
see how does it work with the colors as
I mentioned the previous slide shows
both of these techniques and actually
the way that it come up with the session
key is using this this method you can
take a look at the colors while I'm
drinking water
so now it's about the ssh into how does
it work how does the encryption works
and other stuff let's quickly take a
look at the argit companies inside the
SSH we have the client on one side which
is a program that connects to a server
of course it sends the common lock up
give me up time or desire the my git
commits with you somewhere and we have
the server which is allows incoming SSH
connection handle identification
authorization and so forth we have the
session in the middle which is started
after the connection has been
established and user is authenticated
and we have the user key which is a keep
pop key pair of public and private key
user user uses his own public key as a
way to identify itself to the third to
the other party and ask you also have to
a keeper it uses the public key of it to
to attend a defy and identify itself to
the client so that's sometimes if you
for example if you just bring a server
and try to associate to it and later you
destroy yourself and bring it up again
with the same IP you see that the SSH
doesn't allow you to connect directly to
the other side it says this the key
doesn't match that's the way that it
knows it it keeps the public key of the
server that is already connected inside
its own day in some file to make sure
that no one can switch the server or if
it happens you know that it's happening
there so when this is all most
interesting part that's the part that
magic happens and hope that you can read
the the way that secure connection is
established when SSH connects to a
search clang clang to ssh server
everything in the initial step
everything's passed over using the clear
text actually if you just do telnet or
netcat as i said where you see that the
server immediately returned its
signature that's that's the way that we
are going to
so the client connect to server' it says
I want to connect to you and server
immediately sends back the signature of
the send back the signature of the
server and also the version that the
protocol supports here if I am error
lying I am implement I have implemented
and so ch2 and now it's the client turn
to decide if it's the match for the
client if it's if it's a magic sense its
own pub its own signature to the other
side and server it is the several also
checks if everything is fine if if this
initial handshake is a Callahan Shaggy's
is is approved by the server server it
turns list of lists of pub list of in
crib algorithm that it supports and also
it sends random large random number back
to the client now the client and server
both use this random number as a seed to
create a keeper this is temporary keeper
it's not it's not the same keeper that
the user has and then later they they
exchange the public key together still
this is a public hearing is fine even
even if someone is listening to the
connection and now each side separately
uses Pro uses their own private key and
the other side's public key and use the
default Hellman algorithm to come up
with the shared session key and after
that is done as part of the work SSH
protocol the the secure chant they turn
on the encryption and you have the
secure connection
in the after the secure connection is
established user needs to authenticate
itself to the to the server there are
multiple mechanisms of doing that the
one that we that more interesting is the
common one or I will say is a password
authentication and the public key
authentication password authentication
is quite simple the SSH connection that
is exists is encrypted so they can just
the user can just send the pass
give the password to the client client
forwarded through a secure channel to
the other side but there is a it's but
the thing about the password
authentication is not that much secure
let's even though this the connection is
encrypted but it might be that the
server is compromised and by entering
your password you are sending the
password to the other side income that
the other option which is the public key
it's not like that even if the server is
compromised still you don't send any
private you don't send your private key
on the other side so that's one of the
advantage so let's check the public key
because it's more interesting the public
key authentication use the public key
cryptography to verify the clients
identity the server has a list of public
keys inside usually it goes to the root
directory of the user that SSH is like
authorized keys and when it connects to
the server it tells the server I want to
attract myself using this public key it
says the it sends the idea of the key
which is the fingerprint of the key and
the server checks the targets I can
authorization check see if that that
public key exists in the in that file or
database if it's using more advanced
version and if there is a matching key
and then if it's correct the server
generates a random key and sent and
encrypted using the public key that it
exists in your database and send it back
to the user now if the user really
claimed that it has the keeper it should
be able to decrypt the message and send
it back but it doesn't it doesn't work
exactly like that
the thing is not secured just to send
the key back again so what happens is
the SSH client if it really has the key
pair
it will unencrypted the message and then
concatenate the random string with this
with the session key session key that it
has and calculate the md5 and send the
md5 to the server server and the server
checks at least amplifier itself it is
the match the user is access grant
access to the user the last layer to
review is the connection layer so in
this layer all the records for the
services and the remote machine should
be made over channels that make the SSH
protocol a bit complicated maybe a
single SSH connection as you see it can
simultaneously have all of these
channels open simultaneously working on
the over the connection as you see here
each channel represent the processing of
single service so we have different
services running using different
channels when you invoke your process on
a remote shell it will open a channel
for the invocation and then send all the
inputs and output related to that
channel through that on that channel the
connection itself just handles packages
of channels in the different that has
open so it means for instance in one
single SSH connection you can have a you
can have a process to execute the
command and in this same time file
download the file to SFTP and for what a
number of the port's simultaneously all
happening the single connection but
naturally they don't happen
simultaneously but rather work in the
timeshare fashion to share the bandwidth
connection of the to share the bandwidth
of the connection but as I mentioned it
makes hand implementing the working with
this is / - a little bit more
complicated we will see when we are
implementing ssh client you need to do
some extra stuff that maybe it doesn't
thick but then if you not understand
that if you understand the protocol you
understand this required so now that we
have better understanding of the ssh
internal of this usage let's see how can
we use it in your Alexia application
airline comes with the full fledge
Association module that can be used as a
server or client it uses open SSL crypto
library to encrypt the communication
before digging into the code there are
some configuration that we have to make
these are the necessary beloved ssh we
need to configure the server keys so
here later we can try it from this slide
I also have it in github you can you
need to create the keeper's for the
algorithm that your server wants to
support usually these are the three one
that if you want to support most of the
clients you can use this tree but if you
are the if you are the only consumer of
the SSO server I suggest to stick to the
top one which is the which is creating
keeper using elliptic curve algorithm if
you want to know why it's better you can
take a look at this link which is an
article by CloudFlare and i'm sure you
try assembly they take care of all of
the security of our servers we need to
we need to add the SSH into the running
application as well and the
configuration or
done running gets simple ssh server is
quite simple nothing fancy you need to
mention the six directory which is the
directory that you keep your servers
private key it should be secure of
course and as you see here i I also
provided the user password that I wanted
my client to check my client against and
I want to run in 422 the return value of
this one is okay Pete or error and the
reason if you want to run it in your
production probably you want to
supervise it properly
running the basic server is I mean it's
quite simple here it asked me for the
password and then I get X by default I
get access to the airline shell it's
still not optimal but it's good enough
what bothers me is the keeping the
password because you need to manage the
password and everything it's annoying so
let's see how can we build SSO server
using public key that's also quite
simple we need to just provide the user
directory which would be your the place
that you keep the authorized underscore
keys and here I explicitly mention I
don't want to check again I don't want
to check back I don't accept password
authentication so you just ask for user
to get the public key directly and here
as you see first time I try to access to
the server it to the service it didn't
allow me and then I copy my public key
into the authorized key and it works
again the the the daemon function of the
SSH module except lonely stuff options
that you especially if you go and check
through the documentation but for
example here I added a few I add some of
them that are more interesting like
alpha disconnect function and connect
fashion and fail functions are functions
that you can use to like some incidents
or risk or release your resources and so
and here also this is the how you
receive the lights but let's see how can
we how can we access to the Analects a
share is more interesting than putting
quotes around the modules it's also
quite simple using different call back
your a function you just pass the shell
it sends the username and peer to you
and you just say IX start now you have a
lectureship the problem that I have with
this one is exiting existing this shell
because if you say system exists it will
turn off your Alexia application also
control Z doesn't work so I couldn't
figure out how to get rid of come out of
this module II just kill the SSH client
the accessibility of the SSH goes much
further than what we have seen so far
one interesting feature that I found
useful is using callbacks to handle ssh
public identification yeah so you can
use your custom date instead of looking
at the public keys inside the file you
look at the database or third party API
to authenticate the user and check the
public here so what I would like here is
to to use if you know how the github API
works whenever you put your public key
inside the github your profile page
there is a API that you I can't extract
your public key from their public key is
public so no one should vanish that
should be fine so when the SSH
connection connects with Erlang it
instead of looking at the file I want to
be called an API to get up and check if
I can access to the server
so first the there is one thing that we
need to do additionally as the
configuration we need to implement
module that implements behavior of the
SSH server keys it has to function that
you have to implement the Huskie which
returns the list of public key of the
server
I'm not interested on that one I just go
and do the default one you get it from
the file but the other one is is this a
ski this accepts few parameter and use
what it should does is return a true or
false true means the public key exists
we accept this public key and false
means this this public sorry this public
key is not acceptable
fetching user from public heals quiet
cure trivial nothing here but just one
thing just to be clear it's not just
checking if the public key exists in
your database
as I mentioned before when we when we
give okay to the SSH module that this
public key is a valid one it is starts
during sending a challenge random number
to the to the client and make sure that
the client has the private key part
configuring the SSH server is also quite
simple you just say the option is key C
B which is done for callback and you
give the module it will call your module
later as you see here I try to assess to
my local host using the using my github
account it it worked and then I try to
connect to SS s using Joseph valiums
I can't it didn't work because I don't
have its public private key if you have
laptop here we can have some fun
I already
in this server there is a message server
running if you would like to connect for
a few minutes we can have a chat there
jellow can you nice
okay
so there isn't I got interested into the
SSH in the first place was because I
wanted to write an application like a
github or get lab if you will and I
wanted to experience how the system
works because it wasn't true so
historically I work in three different
companies that they move from SVN to to
get so I was somehow part of onboarding
process helping people to pick it up so
it's I have the get dear in my heart I
also used to work as a sysadmin so I
also like SSH as well and in our company
high quality we we use a lot of
encryption and make sure the data are
encrypted so all of this cut my interest
and also to dig in how there's no such
words this is the project that the
project that I was trying to do the
clone of or copy of the gate lab we did
never get off the it never get get off
the ground because I couldn't decide
about the JavaScript framework for the
UI that was supplies but what I end up
with working SSA server that can accept
the SSH can accept the get comments and
get fit and all the features so here I
try to extract the get an SSA section of
it it's a git server which uses SSH
currently you can handle you can handle
authentication of your user through
calling your database and so forth so
let's see how does the SSH client works
and it's simple again so here I tried to
assuage to my server but it accept the
SSH password I didn't enter the right
password it canceled it let's use the
public here as well it should be simple
so here I have I said that I want I
don't I don't want to offer my password
the password so the server
the client that never asked the password
from from my UI this is a client section
and I said I want to use user root here
first the first one is just initializing
the process connection reference that as
I mentioned if you want to send it
execute a comment through to a remote
server you need to create a channel so
here is the channel part it opens the
channel from a channel 0 and then I can
send so I can send the command up time
is this is a OpenSSH server so it I can
execute the show commands and then it
will return success all of the messages
that sends back the response of the
uptime came back to the current process
I will you'll see it here you it will
receive the data and immediately in this
kind of one-time execution it
immediately close the SSH channel so if
you want to if you want to send another
comma you need to create another channel
for that that part make it a bit hard or
confuse I had the first why do I need
channels the last section of the SSH
matter that I want to cover is SSA
subsystem it's mostly undocumented part
of the abstraction of SSH protocol that
I just found it while I was reading the
LA and documentation so it's good for
something and it's good for invoking a
custom command through the SSH you might
already or you might already using a
subsystem for example when you SFTP
files through the curious use SFTP of
the file it uses the subsystem in
implementing the subsystem is outside
for you now the if you know the call box
is simple the here I implement an echo
subsystem so what it does is the client
sends a
a string binary of data and then the
server returned back the same data to
the client the most most of them are
boilerplate but the most interesting
part is this section that it receives a
data in the channel we will send the
same data back to the root the same
chant through the same Channel
as you might already guess the
subsystems are so easy to configure so
here I said I want to in identified this
subsystem as echo and this is the sub
module that this is the module that has
this implementation and some parameters
and the client part is also I need to do
the initialization of the connection
create the channel as before and then
mention that this channel one this
channel is supposed to use the subsystem
echo and then I send my data to the
other side and how it works in action is
quite trivial as well here I run the
server and here I just send the data
that I said I said what did I say here
the from the previous one I say is there
anybody out there and it white replies
me back this is this looks simple but
you need to think about the car with the
crazy ideas how what you want to do with
it
one of the example that I spent too much
time thinking about what can I do with
it so one of the example that I thought
we can do is in actually in your company
we have something called a vault system
that keeps the data securely using the
encrypted data and then everyone wants
to get the data needs to provide the
proper data one and mostly it's the
interface of is for internal system one
one possible solution would be just go
crazy you can enter
your sub system can accept graph QL
probably because graphic you'll only
have one entry and then it received the
comment process the data send the data
back to your client your data is super
secure military-grade secure secure so
it's good to use in this kind of
situation maybe or maybe if you have a
nerve project instead of bringing you
want to talk to you sometimes for
whatever reason instead of bringing a
REST API you can use this one do
subsystem to talk to the to the to your
nerve project and maybe get some
valuable data back actually the nerve
the in the previous talk we hear that
nerves femoral SSH is something for
updating the frame were in nerve land
actually use a subsystem for that reason
here are the list of references and
further innings the first one is a book
it is for 2005 but it's really good and
it's definitely it's really definite
guide you can understand a lot of in
general of the SSH and the second one is
the a lying-ass a search module of
course it's a bit maybe hard to
understand but if you know the context
is easy to read to read documentation
there is a Pssht which is a customized
SSH server written in alexia it's really
good for and maybe you don't want to use
it directly but is really good to go see
Siri
yep so it's a server that you can read
maybe it gives you idea how to use it
there is a SSH kit client from bit crowd
it's also make a lot of boilerplate
stuff simple for you and of course the
last one is SSH tunnel as I mentioned
you can even forward the port and do a
lot of crazy asad SSH this one this
project is doing that you can get some
idea how to do it and by that thank you
okay we hello
okay so we've got seven minutes for
questions anyone got anything
interesting wanna ask hey I wrote a few
weeks ago a similar project for writing
a kid platform using built-in SSH and I
got a step further and wrote as get
Transfer Protocol in alexia with a lot
of binary pattern matching which is
funny in in quotes and I wanted to ask
if you--if you know any drawbacks
regarding speech raw speed when
transferring lots of data for big git
clone or git push or maybe concurrent
work when a lot of clients connect to
the same server and you know if there
are any benchmarks or any restriction I
should I didn't reach that point
unfortunately my project failed because
of the J's using this program I'm
finding a dry J's framework but I think
what I've seen is all the when you
create a process it opens a channel when
you when you open a channel it creates a
process where everything happens to read
the process and I believe one is one of
the advantage of the airline the beam is
if you have a proper data properly sent
over through different processes it will
take care of the system so it's in yeah
but you don't know any benchmarks to
that I didn't we can take a look at
together and yeah thanks
and the other what would be your when
we're talking about these distributed
systems and they are far apart different
data centers and you said that we cannot
communicate because safely because it
uses the secret cookie that goes I guess
almost easy to break how why would you
use in order to have a distributed
system that they can talk to each other
SSH yep so top of my I don't have a
definite answer for you sorry but what I
can thing is you can have it you can
build your own network on top of
internals so you have your internal
network of the servers even if it's
there from different part of the world
you can make it for example IPSec will
be open VPN connection make a network
around them then it's more secure
compared to the other one but it's still
the thing is no one's up suggest using a
lang note over LAN so maybe we should
wait until the core project is
supporting that even though you can
secure that with a VP and it's not
suggested still because of the the the
the latency should be really low for the
to knows who can communicate properly
okay thank you thank you
you
