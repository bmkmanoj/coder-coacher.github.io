voice layer we add the voice messaging
to mobile applications and one of the
things that I do for fun is attending
hackathons how many of you guys go to
hackathons all right I feel that's cool
so hackathons are a really cool have you
basically meet a lot of people
developers designers you come with an
idea you enrolled it and roll designers
and developers build you know you crank
for one or two days build something
pitch that to you know two judges and
then compete for prices you know
thousands of dollars and stuff like that
so this is some of the projects that
that I submitted and so a few weeks ago
I sign for Angel hack which is actually
this weekend so I'm not sure you're
going to be able to be there but
nevertheless so they have like you know
this won't cost a little bit of money
not too much and you know one of the
things they make sure you have like
prices and things but one of the
interesting things is that they offer
promo code for developers that saw a
challenge and so you know I look at this
thing and you know basically I got
exposed to what it's called esoteric
programming languages I mean I know
programming language so you know that
there is such a thing as esoteric
programming languages but basically
these refined is one of these software
programming languages and you know the
challenge is you know to run this
program and the output is the promo code
so i looked at your bit into these
languages and basically there is like
ton of these languages and you know the
esoteric means that you know they're
necessarily useful but they are
interested on some way you know maybe
there is hard to compile or you know
other different things so in particular
be found
is a language which for one thing the
program is two-dimensional I mean
basically the program counter doesn't
like go sequentially but you can just go
through like a two-dimensional space and
you catch it you can change itself and
apparently it's like special because
it's very difficult to compile so you
know your figure but you know it's kind
of interesting so for example this is a
program like a random generator this is
a hello world and the way like each
character basically is a it's a command
and you know the you know depending like
depending on like what the commander's
for example this actually moves you in
this direction so you have halo disk
push this into the stack so there is a
stack and then you can just go out put
things the comas actually take from the
stack and output and then for this push
for an eight into the stack multiply the
32 which is a space and so you'll get
the idea basically this is like the
inner line feed you basically say hello
world right so you know I here are the
instructions so anyways I was kind of
like I look around and it was very
disappointed to find I mean there is
like if you go look into the wiki
they're like implementations for you
know all that you know all the kind of
languages has cob you know but you know
there was not a league here I mean it
was very supporting to find that you
know we don't have like a good
representation for elixir in this hall
of fame of the french so anyways as you
guys can imagine you're not coming from
san francisco there's a long flight so i
decided to skip the you know the movies
and you know bill and implementation for
be functional in the lecture so i was
able to kind of compete completed so up
you know i open sore the staff is here
you guys come look at it and play with
it and you know it's like you know it's
kind of like a cute thing but you know
after some of the talks do in the
morning I you know I thought further and
say okay you know this is this is kind
it cool but I mean we'll be cool
actually to have like a front end in you
know using Phoenix in order to be able
to see visualize how you know how this
you know how these program words right
so that's basically what I did so I
created like the French for for a
Phoenix and let's just grab like like a
program this actually is like an
interesting one because because
basically it's actually a program that
changes itself basically print itself so
we can see here actually that you know
it's like it's like moving around and
every time it goes it just increments
and then outputs itself so basically
what we have here is like you're using
channels in order to basically get the
updates in the screen and for every step
we are going to in or send it to a gent
server and it's like doing a one step of
the of the of the program so I just want
to leave you guys with that with a
thought I mean like I mean many this
program in language you know you know
maybe they are like useless I mean just
you know you know nobody's going to be
doing anything with that but I mean what
i found interesting about this actually
is like this concept of a like a two
dimensional program and so I thought a
little bit about that I mean maybe there
are some something can be used I mean
can be useful for something and where is
that oh Jesus Christ okay so so
basically what if actually we can create
like a kind of like expect programming
language where we can just describe a
state machine I mean like state machines
really I can be described in you know
and like you have like in a visual way
much easier than on a program so I mean
you can have here similar to be fine you
have something where you just go over
these you're going to a state and base
maybe on some kind of like criteria you
can go in this direction or here and
then basically you know you can have
like an event and an output so the idea
basically it's like you know you just
you know right thing and then
you know you have something that convert
it into like like a gin fsm or something
and then you don't need to do any
programming basically you have your
state machine right from the for this
little chart so you know maybe it's like
a pet project you know somebody's
interested in me that's some thought
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
