getting into what magic beam is and why
it was kind of created as part of our
work so I don't know if you've heard of
a product formerly known as code to meet
it was designed to allow enterprises to
share their tweet their Twitter account
amongst themselves so the back story
here is you know how do you how do we
retrieve users social media data so the
first step was they have Ruby cron job
and everyone can probably imagine how
well that worked out for us the second
Arcady incantation was a non OTP Erlang
Damon we affectionately called it in a
mirror although i believe it was
christian who named that worked out much
better than the Ruby the current
incarnation it's a distributed Erlang
system via rabbitmq pretty much OTP I
think everything other than the release
upgrades because they still give me a
bit of a headache one day I will figure
them out so what is a new mera large
jellyfish the largest the darién in the
world kanji I believe for field village
or for us a distributed platform
providing social data streams through at
the exact target software ecosystem so
just internally for us it pulls stuff
from Twitter and Facebook gonna be
mixing in some others eventually and
there's multiple components including
scheduling API workers data workers and
some command and control nonsense which
has partially been brought out into
magic beam the important part is the
workers in the context of where magic
beam came from so how do you make a
worker pool this seems to be kind of a
underlying theme for allowing developers
how do you make pools of workers we had
three key requirements we had to be able
to dynamically adjust these pools of
workers up and down to deal with ever
changing circumstances so adding more
users database problems life in the
cloud is fun other also faults isolated
between individual requests and
customers of one customers having
problems you know we don't want it to be
affecting others and transactional /
stateless so in every given step of our
kind of event feedback loop
we want to be completely transactional
there's no if something happens in one
part it's not going to affect another
part so all of our workers they RAB a
trap a rabbit mq or amqp consumer and
the fun part here was finding a
supervisory structure that fit so chaos
beams who's familiar with netflix is
chaos monkeys so for those who aren't i
see a few hands that's cool they
actually have a whole simian army but
the relevant part here is the chaos
monkeys and this is something they use
to kill off random ec2 nodes so can
probably see where this is going how
better to test your supervisory
structures or you know cause mild
concern in the QA department so in
principle what this does is you know
what happens when we kill off random
Erlang processes you know they are
supposed to be supervised right that's
that's what we do simulates you know
unexpected function calls unexpected
inbound messages I call these typos
sometimes unit testing can of course
helped a lot with this it's not really a
doesn't save against everything so
there's the fine line between not
handling common errors and matching all
the catch patterns every every single
one which is something it's kind of it
happens sometimes any we're all guilty
of it I'm sure but not very OTP in the
letting it crash sense so who
supervisors these supervisors
application masters in theory it's
Thunder beam so tunable timing of
process death what does this mean every
now and then it's going to kill a random
process in your line via of course
there's a black list of registered
processes or or TP applications to not
kill hard-coded into this is application
master because you could probably
imagine what happens when that gets
killed unsurprisingly emma is very
easily
so that's we don't actually use them
easy on our code base I used I guess
internally in RabbitMQ but yeah
generally killing off any part of an
amnesia application will end poorly for
the system and I hope you have a vm
heartbeat so we have a agentur handle
info handler it's just a little include
macro you can drop in at the end of your
handle infos for handling the killing of
a trap exited process it just simulates
a crash it returns with a non normal non
okay status so if you want to still
simulate what will happen if one of your
trap exited gen servers blows up you can
still do that you can also force kill
supervisors and non OTP processes this
was originally done for us so we can
actually kill off the supervisors
themselves because those are
unsurprisingly designed quite robustly
and if you have a multiple multiple
tiers of Supervisors you might want to
know what happens if the one in the
middle goes down so second part of magic
beans you know hot loaded beams so jokes
aside it's one of the I mean to me one
of my favorite parts of Erlang where you
could just reload the code on the fly
it's kind of magical so waiting tends to
be kind of boring we don't really have
that sword fight excuse anymore I don't
know if any of you recognize that XKCD
cartoon you know why are you guys
messing around while the codes compiling
so no more excuses in that context
anywhere so hoping it'll reload the
module if the beam file changes on disks
so really there is a nothing new here
that something has been done in other
projects and released but it also does
is it'll recompile if the source file
changes hadn't seen anything out there
that does that that watches it and it
seems to work and in this extent we
finally caught up with PHP you can
change a file and save it and test it
right away you don't have to wait for a
compile and admittedly compiling in our
project got a lot faster when we switch
to rebar from scons but it still took
more than an instant so in action
hot beam extrapolates your source file
from the code metadata it also pulls out
the include files I think those are the
only two things it pulls out you can
control which OTP applications are
monitored for change so you don't
necessarily want to reload everything
and chances are you don't have or
actually maybe you do have the source
for OTP just lying around can
selectively enable and disable the auto
magic compilation and reloading these
two are not I guess inclusive if you can
have it just reload the beams on change
or you can have it recap I'll and then
reload the beams on change and there's
manual control of this so you can have
it running in the background paying
attention to which files have changed
and say you know oh I actually want to
reload this OTP application right now
although I guess a caveat to that being
where it'll only actually reload the
beams it won't recap I'll the entire
application so a few things we're hot
beam could be better is support
additional file types at number one on
my list is early dtl files because those
are kind of awesome and it doesn't
support it right now monitor the header
files and weekly recompile all the
dependent source files so this is these
are both things which in theory i can do
based on or another open source
contributor could do based on the
metadata available in the files right
now and a code change call back to
support runtime state changes right now
there's kind of a package way of doing
that we're after reloading a beam it
tries executing a module or a function
called hot load / 0 in that module and
that can conceptually call into a gen
server into a code change or whatever I
think the only place I'm actually using
it is for reloading I guess legacy early
dtl templates from before we were using
rebar to automatically compile those for
us
so rebel for all and I guess is there
anyone in this room who doesn't like
runtime introspection raise your hand if
you dare so I guess a bad habit of mine
kind is a manual implementation of info
/ 0 functions on just about anything
that's wrapping a process it's a little
easier than sis get status it returns
just the information i care about at
that moment when i'm trying to figure
out why something's on fire a cultural
tendency with an exact target towards
live configuration changes so we use
application environments but also
depending on who we're being rate
limited by conceptually adjusting
various configuration and scheduling
values tend to open your / engineer
configuration logic and this is where
the this aspect of magic beam came from
so essentially trying to give manual
control of these running running systems
and not everything is going to get a web
interface exposing web interfaces to ops
is great but you don't necessarily want
to give them fine control over every
single piece of running application and
it's friendlier than the typical Erlang
shell and going back to the context of
getting access to ops it's less
dangerous than the average Erlang shell
because you can't just delete arbitrary
ets tables so in principle with Shelby
it's giving a simple behavior for
implementing a bespoke and easy-to-use
repple shell so very simple it's parsing
strings and executing functions that you
tell it to execute abstraction around
logic with runtime help so as part of
defining these functions you also define
their syntax and what it is they're
supposed to be doing hierarchical sub
shells with shortcut access so you can
have one shell open another for a
specific task or just do a short cut
into that hierarchy that sub shell as
well depending on what it is you're
trying to implement
so in terms of a Shelby man action as
part of magic beam it has a
implementation for this it exposes some
basic magic beam and airline
functionality as the default call back
you can remote into a node you can open
the actual Erlang shell you can enable
Thunder beam hot load of module nothing
nothing too fancy there there's also a
subshell for editing the application
environment for any OTP app so it's kind
of a short cut into that being able to
tweak runtime configuration this shell
beam essentially repple shell it's
parsing whatever you're giving it
strings and passing it into a callback
implementation function and also it
integrates the sshd support anyone here
mess around with the ear lying sshd
client so basically what this does is it
starts it for you and generates your
house key you still have to generate
your authorized key file i was going to
not include a code sample but i'm sorry
this is what the i know it's kind of
small i guess but this is a sample
callback for shelby me so this is the
application environment editor the only
thing required by the shell being
behavior is a function called commands
parity of 0 and this is a three-part
tuple the first is a list of tokens that
it'll match on so this first one for
listing it lists loaded OTP applications
a list with just the one string in it
list and then the fun to actually
execute so in this case it's a fun
that's you know going through your
loaded applications and generating a
pretty little list of it and returning
it you can also pass in some arguments
as well and it does the parsing for you
skipping down to the last one where you
want to set an OTP application
environment key so this is a four-part
command set the application name the
application key and the value so
the application and the key those are
both atoms because that's what they are
in as far as the application callbacks
concern to the colonel application and
then the value which you know who knows
what that's going to be so there's a bit
of out of magic interpretation here it
tries to guess what you're giving it so
it will first try to parse something out
to an integer then it tries parsing it
out to a existing atom then it'll try to
parse it out to a list or a tuple and
failing that you're probably just giving
it a string so the theory here being
that if you're setting an application
environment variable it's going to be an
integer or an atom or a list of things
and it tries to guess what that's
actually doing or what you're actually
passing it rather and the return syntax
is fairly straightforward it's a
three-part tuple again okay and then a
format string and a for any arguments
for it or error and the format string
and the arguments for it nothing
incredibly fancy there at that example
usage of this same module is you have
your custom pretty shell you can do a
shortcut into the app m sub shell to get
a list of your available applications or
you can bring up the actual app end
config shell and then edit it directly
so second thing here listing the
whatever is set in the application
environment for Colonel and there's
nothing really fancy there and then
actually editing a config entry so
pulling out the Thunder beam enabled
variable or environment variable for the
magic beam app and it's currently
undefined so we set it to true and then
surprise surprise it's actually true so
again nothing nothing too fancy there
more shortcut around commonly used
Erlang apps and I guess it's probably
important to mention the in the context
of the included shell beam callbacks
it's really just meant as an example for
how this callback works so in the
context of the code base I deal with day
to day it's things like starting and
stopping individual components viewing
metrics
viewing information on specific
customers or specific data feeds and of
course adjusting configuration I guess
there's some shortcuts for bringing up
process info and seeing which message in
boxes are the most painful at the moment
so summary of magic beam as a whole kind
of a catch-all project for dev ops ii
bits that have been found useful in
developing of Namira comprised of three
key pieces of functionality Thunder beam
it kills off random or lying processes
under the auspices of testing your
supervisory structures there's hot beam
which will reload modules or reload
recompile and then reload source files
helping speed up that iteration process
of testing stuff on the fly developing
stuff on the fly rather and then she'll
beam which gives you a hopefully
easy-to-use rapel shell that you
wouldn't be afraid to stick somebody who
doesn't know Erlang in front of but it's
familiar with you know maybe cisco so
designed with ease of integration in
mind to that end there's two ways of
integrating it so of course it's
available as a rebar dependency you can
include it in release as you know
permanent temporary or load only
application if it's not permanent
there's you know a magic beam start and
stop function for starting it and
stopping it that just starts and stops
the application you can also inject it
into a running node so if you have an
already existing or lying thing project
that you don't feel like stopping to
have to recap I'll to do this yet maybe
you want to be tweaking the application
environment or maybe you want to SSH
into it for whatever reason you can do
that you can just inject it into that
running node the theory there that in
our specific context was to test some
stuff with RabbitMQ without having to
bring it down without having to
recompile it or mess around with it can
just toss magic beam right in there
and then if you're weird like me and
have a fetish about configuration code
there is a callback module that you can
implement that allows you to override
configuration otherwise it just comes
out of the application environment so
command line or dot config files and
then there's also going to various
actions within magic bean will generate
events and this is the way you would
catch those so events are generated when
you went modules are recompiled or
reloaded when processes are killed and
when she'll be in commands are processed
successfully and these are things you
can capture and maybe you guys like
audit logs maybe your ops team likes
audit logs who knows so some of the use
cases that we've used that in the
context of is deployment because like I
said earlier I'm kind of I want to
figure out full release upgrades with
Erlang but it still doesn't quite click
so you need to determine which
applications you want to reload on the
fly in our case it's all the homebrew
code everything we've written ourselves
none of our dependencies create a little
in its grip that calls a you know hot
beam colon all which will tell hot beam
to reload every module that it's
currently aware of within the context of
the applications you've told it to care
about so generally a little module you
RPC into or Earl underscore call or
whatever that just calls them then you
can integrate it into your deployment
pipeline in our context is Jenkins and
every time you click the deploy button
and Jenkins it asks you want whether you
want to restart or hot load and as part
of our continuous deployment to actually
we deploy to dev environments one of
them is restarted one of them has the
hot load command issued so we know right
away as part of every time we commit
push changes whether we can push this
upstream to production I guess to QA to
end production to be fair without there
being a problem whether it'll actually
except those that hot loading certainly
yeah
kind of so our Jenkins build job hat
results in two artifacts one of them is
a little shell script that we use to
actually do the install the other is a
terrible the tarball includes the erlang
p.m. all of our code config all that
nonsense and then the deployment is a
matter of SS aging into and the
deployment being wrapped in Jenkins as
well mind you matter of SS aging into
the host you're deploying to issuing
that command the try calling the
deployment artifact from the Jenkins
build and passing it in the tarball of
the build so we I don't know if this is
answering your question at all or not
the what we're deploying based on is a
result of a Jenkins build and it happens
just entirely within the context of that
airline node so if we're doing a hot
load for example deploy the tarballs
copied over and then we issue a command
to the running Erlang notes to hot load
yourselves and they already have in
their configuration the list of OTP
applications that they're supposed to
hot load and that will then happen if
its a restart it comes down and goes
back up we do that we do that so the
continuous deployment there is where the
build happens and then it's
automatically deployed to to dev
environments one of which has a restart
happen so everything brought down the
right order brought back up in the right
order and then the other one it has just
the hot load so that kind of allows us
to identify whether you know we're going
to have problems hot loading this
further down the chain and I guess for
some context they're going back to one
of the to do's on hot beam doesn't
support the code change call back so if
you're changing your state you're going
to have a crash the next time a message
comes in sometimes you won't care
depending what the the gen serve or
whatever the defending what the process
is it's going to crash you might be able
to live with that if you don't mind a
little bump on a graph assuming you're
graphing back other times if it's going
to cause you know
200 workers to crash you might want to
actually restart it properly so and by
deployed doing the continuous deployment
to two environments that allows us to
identify what's safe to push further
upstream and what's not yeah is that
answer okay cool so another use case of
this is that you know extreme pair
programming I guess so to developers one
editor one running release hopefully in
a QA environment with people actively
using it that makes it more interesting
every time you save a file hot beam will
reload it if you want to up the ante a
little bit you can robusta fire software
as it's being created by running thunder
being behind the scenes and then
tweaking runtime configuration maybe you
want to up timing a little bit so it's a
little more it's getting tested a little
more quickly than it might otherwise
she'll be gives you the shortcuts for
doing that and then the big thing for me
in the context of Shelby my mean I'm I'm
not worried about doing any more damage
than I could otherwise do in an erlang
shell anyway but it's the ability or the
idea of exposing some of this
functionality to external Ops teams
chances are they're not going to learn
or lying if they're going to you know
props and I realized I'm making a pretty
big divide between dev and ops in the
DevOps track but that's sometimes how it
goes i suppose so they might still need
to tweak knobs and levers and responses
to graph suddenly looking more spiky or
flat than they normally are might want
to give Shelby new implementations for
common operations in our case like I've
said it's basically configuration
scaling and metrics toggling individual
components dealing with things and not
really a fire fighting capacity because
at this point we generally know what
we're doing when we're tweaking these
knobs and levers maybe for controlling
distributed components and then there's
the direct SSH access which is you know
this is kind of a red herring that you
can remove those operating system
distractions generally they can trust
that Linux is doing their thing if
they're supporting a custom app on top
of that you might not want to give them
that distraction and then a few errata
around this SSH access only supports one
private key and that's just kind of the
way it is right now with OTP I thought
it had been fixed recently but I guess
it hadn't been and this I guess gives me
an excuse to make a pull request for the
OTP project magic beaming ejection
requires compatible bytecode you compile
magic beam using Erlang ar-15 you're not
going to be able to injected on
something running our 13 and hot bean
does not and will not ever support
upgrading the Erlang vm because that
sounds really really hard and if i'm
going to do that it's probably just
going to be release upgrades they swear
i'm going to figure out this year 2012
is a year to do it so that's it there's
a website up it's open source on github
questions complaints just checking the
file time so yeah which means the hot
beam gencer it tends to make a generate
a lot of reductions so but that's that's
how it is yeah don't nothing fancy there
and then the metadata for everything
else is available with him within the
beam and he also have I didn't talk too
fast probably dude okay yeah
