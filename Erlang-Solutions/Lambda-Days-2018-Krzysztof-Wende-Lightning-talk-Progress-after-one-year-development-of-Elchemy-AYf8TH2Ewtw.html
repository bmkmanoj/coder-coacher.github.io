typed language for a linked VM okay
there's quite a few okay so the entire
purpose of it is to create a compiler
that will output a code of elixir from
an elm input that will be fully readable
so in case you ever wanted to stop using
it you could always use the output code
as as your source so there is no there's
no drawback of shifting back to your
previous set up it is entirely typeset
it does compile already it is one year
of progress I wanted to show you the
live version of it we've made an version
inside the browser that you can compile
your your code inside the browser test
it and run it as an elm and also see the
elixir output you can check it out it's
called alchemy I would prefer to even
have something just to show you how it's
spelled but generally yeah the project
is quite mature already it's gaining a
lot of love on github so I I will ask
you to mash that Stargazer button and to
contribute if you'd like to I think it's
a fun project so far I think there's
three big projects regarding as I typed
saved along with VM languages so I guess
there is a lot of a lot of space to
develop in and yeah I'm assuming we
don't have any time for questions
so I'm joining the after party for sure
so if you've got any questions if you
want to ask anything about that I'm
really glad to answer any of them and
yeah
that's a little problematic that I can
show you the the github but you can get
you can get a really fine it generally
find it with alchemy or Elm kami as a
name it probably should be the first one
in Google so please do thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
