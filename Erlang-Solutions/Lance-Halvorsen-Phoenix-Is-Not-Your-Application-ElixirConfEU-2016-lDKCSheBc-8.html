at the very end of the conference that's
really a great thing and what a great
conference I would like to actually
thank the people who put this on Jim and
Monica very much I think they need a
round of applause
so Phoenix is not your application
that's sort of a bold title it's really
more like this Phoenix is one of your
applications and when we talk about
building web applications the things we
say actually say a lot about the way we
think about them so we say things like
I'm building a phoenix app or a rails
app or an ember app or react app but is
that really true I think no but the way
we approach it right now it sort of is
but it doesn't need to be that way so
ideally we would say things like I'm
building a logistics app or an analytics
app or physics engine or a fortune
cookie app with a web interface so the
application has its own domain and
Phoenix is the interface in Phoenix has
its own domain as well so let's do a
thought experiment and this is in rails
I want to make it clear I love rails
have worked in it for a long time not as
much as I love Phoenix but considering
the response that Volker got yesterday
to his question of you know who's worked
on a big Rails model if I figured this
was going to be good so let's say here's
the experiment we have big rails app a
whole bunch of models a whole bunch of
controllers it's been migrated a bunch
of times the test so pretty good and now
what we need to do is we need to put a
new framework on it right so the
experiment is how does that make you
feel
yeah but why why does that seem so
daunting I think there's a couple
reasons one is that the application
logic is entangled with the interface
right so think about the way that we
build applications with a framework we
add
pieces of the framework over and over
and over again to build our application
like we'll add a route and a controller
and a view and templates and really like
our application is a different thing so
taking pieces of the interface to build
the application seems backwards but
we're so used to it we don't really even
see it sometimes so that's one the other
thing is that because we build
applications with pieces of the
framework at a time our application
logic is dispersed across those pieces
across models and controllers and views
and maybe even templates even though we
know we're not supposed to put logic in
the templates so when we do things this
way maintainability becomes an issue
it's much more difficult to pull things
apart it's much more difficult to see
where problems are coming from are they
problems in our logic are they problems
in the way we've wired the framework
pieces together difficult to figure also
portability becomes an issue for our
thought experiment the most likely
scenario is that we're going to have to
rewrite that application and because
logic is dispersed it's going to be very
difficult to make sure we get all the
pieces and you know that somebody in a
department somewhere or somebody who's a
user of your application somewhere is
gonna find it and complain and tests are
great but they can't guarantee that
you're gonna catch it absolutely
everything so the solution I think is to
build our applications separately first
and then layer the interface on later so
before we get into that solution let's
think a little bit about how this
happens so how does this happen so I
have a way of thinking about this and
maybe other ways but this way makes
sense to me so to me it begins with the
HTTP request response cycle and how does
that work
so HTTP is stateless but applications
are not applications need state to do
anything that's interesting so we store
state in the database and then whenever
we have a request we go off to the
database and we get new state and we
formulate a response and we send it off
and then we drop that state again so if
there are any changes to the state in
the in responding to that request we
need to write those changes back to the
database and so we lean on the framework
for data access and that totally makes
sense because we get a standard
interface everything works the same way
all across the application that's great
but what it means is that we start to
model our domain entities for databases
right so we start really caring about
foreign keys and join tables and
many-to-many relationships and those
things aren't really part of our domain
all right so this is also going to be an
active record example and mainly because
it shows so clearly what I'm I get
across so let's consider the difference
between these two things so one is a
comment class simple the other one
inherits from active record base so what
do we get with the first one does
comment things but the one that inherits
from active record base does all kinds
of stuff it does it knows how to talk to
databases it knows how to make queries
it knows how to validate data all this
stuff in this one class right so a
comment as part of our domain but the
comment model is part of active records
domain so instantly we're entangled all
right so of course ecto has a better
story than that
and as Michelle told us earlier today we
don't have any more models we had--we
have schemas there's a good separation
of concerns
but we're still thinking in database
terms right
and for some instances we need a
database and that's great use ecto but I
think in building applications we have
the leeway in elixir to not have storing
state in a database be the default we
have other options all right so models
are not part of our domain and a router
probably isn't either unless you're
doing a logistics app or controller or
view so we need to decouple our domain
from the frameworks domain and it's
great to do it in code but if we do it
in our heads and we think differently
about how we're building applications
that's where the real progress comes an
OTP has an answer for this I call the
OTP applications so an OTP application
is a behavior and what really is a
behavior so it's it's kind of hard to
explain all the nuances and all the bits
of what a behavior actually is so you
know the so concurrency distribution
fault tolerance really hard problems
the airline team spent a lot of time
getting those problems right and what
they did is distill their best practices
into these behaviors so that's one part
of it they're also kind of a design
pattern but maybe not more of a concrete
design pattern and then there are too
much more concrete bits one is that
there is always a module inside of OTP
which holds the code that is common for
all instances of that behavior so like
applications have to do certain things
and every application has to do those
certain things so the module in OTP will
extract all that code and hang on to it
then there is also a list of callbacks
which on
one hand we must implement and on the
other hand we get to implement and as we
get to implement them we can customize
our own instance of the application so
what is an application really that was a
behavior so it is a module or a group of
modules that implement a piece of
functionality and that sounds a lot like
a component maybe they can be started
and stopped independently and that
implies that they're supervised and this
last bit is the interesting bit so since
they can be reused in other applications
we can compose bigger and more intricate
and complex applications out of small
ones and that's what we're gonna do
so we already use applications all the
time so let's say we had a freshly
generated Phoenix application called
hello Phoenix if we look in the mix TXS
file we'll see that we have this list of
applications here in an application
function now that list is used to build
I believe it's called the application
resource file that dot app file and that
is something that the airline virtual
machine will use to use the application
properly so we can take a look at the
applications we have in a running server
and again we'll say we have that hello
Phoenix application we just start it up
and run observer dot start they will get
this gooey app which many of you may
have seen before but if we click on the
middle tab there the applications tab
the list on the left those are all the
applications that compose together to
make your larger application and inside
that hello Phoenix application we need a
module to define what our own app is
right and that then lib slash hello
Phoenix study X you have one area
in any Phoenix application that you have
so this line right here that's where we
inject all that common code that's in
the OTP application and this guy start
to function this is how we customize our
own application and we customize it by
determining the child processes that
we're going to start up when our
application starts we get to determine
whether their supervisors workers what
modules they're going to be and then we
determine what strategy we're going to
use and pick our top level supervisor
and then we make sure that when our app
starts those will start as well and so
that's a cool story but how does this
actually help us in doing anything so we
can approach building an application in
a different way so we can create a pure
elixir application first then we can
generate a new Phoenix application that
is the interface bring the elixir
application into the Phoenix application
as a dependency and then have the
Phoenix parts talk directly to our
elixir application so in other words
we're going to go from this some people
might call that a monolith a big box
that takes in requests and sends out
responses would go from that to
something like this where we have an
interface that takes requests and sends
our responses but in the meantime in
order to formulate its response it goes
and talks to our application directly so
let's try this out and so for an example
application
I picked the part of the tutorial in the
getting started guide in the elixir site
and there's a couple reasons for that
one is it's a tutorial that's already
out there anybody can go follow the
steps create one and do exactly what
we're doing here go try it at home - is
it's not enormous enormous ly elaborate
there's
not too many moving parts so we can
cover it in the time allowed and also
doesn't use a database it acts as its
own database so it's it is a stateful
back-end so step one we generate the new
mix application this is very standard we
just changed the name with a dash dash
module flag to make it all uppercase and
we make it supervised with - just soup
then we follow the rest of the tutorial
actually there's a few pieces that we
won't be talking about I want to focus
mostly on the gen server because that is
going to be the interface the public
interface to our application so there's
an agent and things that you'll need but
we're not going to cover right here so
we are going to cover the gen server
we're gonna build it out or the key
value store this is all the code for the
whole thing we're gonna go over in more
detail but but that's it that's all we
need for the gen server so when you look
at this file so from there up are what
are known as client functions so those
are the public interface those are the
functions that other parts of the code
are going to call and then from here
down those are callbacks that we
implement so take a look here that's a
little bit easier to see there's an
interesting thing which is that each one
of these client functions which is from
the top of the file they all wrap a
function from the gen server module and
there's a reason for that
so whenever a function from the gen
server module is invoked it immediately
invokes a callback and there's a direct
mapping from function to callback that
gets invoked okay and then these are the
callbacks and now let's start building
so we start with a just a plain module
and we inject the
and Jen server code into it and
immediately this is going to start
working like a Jen summer it's going to
behave like a gender and you'll notice
this is the capital G capital S version
that's an elixir module that wraps the
airline module which we would call as
the the atom Jen underscore server and
this gives us a lot for free gets rid of
a lot of the boilerplate there's a bunch
of callbacks that we must implement
versions of in order for the thing to
work but Jen server Capital G capital S
takes care of it for us okay so really
these the client functions and the
callbacks operate in pairs all right so
well this is the first pair that we're
going to talk about start link so we we
need to actually start one of these
things as a separate process so
startling zero is our client function
and then it wraps start link 3 the Jen
server function and we need to tell it
which module that we're going to start
and that's just the one that we're using
we also need to tell it what we're going
to pass to the callback here we're just
going to pass the out of ok and as Sasha
told us yesterday we can give a name to
our Jen server so that we don't have to
keep track of the pid' all the time we
can use this Adam now this Sasha said
effectively makes this kind of a single
thing because if you try to it since
it's hard-coded here
we can't start two processes with the
same name so it will tell us bad things
that we try to start a second one so now
that we're calling start link that's
good you invoke the anit call back and
we're pattern matching on the value so
we could actually have multiple clauses
of in it if we wanted to and then we get
the return value so this will not get
passed back nothing in here will get
passed back to the caller
this is will be this return value will
be used by Jen server internally to
figure out what to do so okay just so
that everything that's going fine and
the second element of the tuple sets the
initial state for the Jen servers of Jen
servers hold state just the way agents
do and this is the initial version of
that state all right and then we've got
the second pair lookup this is just
going and you get a name and you're
going to see if that name has already
been put into our key value store here's
the interesting bit so this the server
anytime you have a call to Jen server
module function you need to give it a
server to operate on and in our case
instead of the pit we'll just pass in
the name that we gave it previously okay
and we are using Jen server a call call
is synchronous so it will send something
back to the caller callers waiting for
it and this is the second argument here
is the thing that we're going to pass
into the callback and this could be
pattern matched on so we can have
multiple versions of the the handling
callback all right so we had it Jen
server to call so our callback is handle
call make sense pattern matching on that
the Jen server knows the pid' of the
process that called us and it passes
that in is the second argument here if
we wanted to we could use it we're not
going to use it so we prepend it with an
underscore to keep the compiler happy
and this is actually the state so if
every time you have a call back in a Jen
so where the third argument is going to
be the current state of the Jen server
at that time and we're not we're going
to use it but we're not going to change
it or transform it at all here so this
reply to is also an
reply the jhen server itself is going to
use this in order to figure out what to
do so what's actually going back to the
caller is this bit right here and it's
just fetching the name from the state
then we also return the state we might
have along the way altered this and then
that new state would become that the
current state of the machine and create
this is our last pair works basically
the same way this is the thing that
we're going to pass it a callback
pattern matching so this function
basically if it finds something if it
finds the the name that gets passed into
it it will return it otherwise it's
going to alter the state here by putting
that new key in value into our state and
return that so now now that we have that
built we can register our key value that
the module that we just did as a worker
the registry with the application start
it up and now that's built now we have
our application and now we need the
interface so we're going to build a new
Phoenix application this is pretty
standard we're just gonna call it kv
interface and we're going to not use
ecto and now we need to bring kate the
kv application our elixir application
into our interface we just do that by
adding it as a dependency to the kv
interface application and we're using a
path type dependency here that's just
easy because then we don't have to
publish it anywhere we could use github
1 or a hex 1 we wanted to and then we
add KB to the application list this is
in a kv interface we just add that
into our list of applications then we
can check again to see if they're there
and they are so now we're almost done we
just need to get them to talk to each
other and so here we'll use a controller
to do that we'll just have a regular
controller then we can add a show action
and this looks basically exactly the
same as any other show action except
that we're talking to our to our elixir
application so it's a tiny little
difference in this one action but for
the whole thing it's a huge huge change
and the same thing for a create action
so really what have we gained here I
think the big thing is isolation so
we've been able to develop the
application in isolation we've been able
to test it in isolation we've gotten our
domains separated and that gives us
maintainability and portability and if
we think about our thought experiment
earlier on if we if this were possible
in the Ruby world that task would not
have been nearly so daunting so and as
Leonard mentioned yeah I'm the author of
the Phoenix guides principle author the
Phoenix guides and you know the the
Phoenix core team we've been talking
about these things and part of our job
is to educate folks and in a way we may
have we've perpetuated a lot of the
ideas that have come from
almost cargo cult it from other
frameworks and that's useful but I think
it's now time that we kind of move on
and see what the airline virtual machine
allows us to do and embrace that because
it allows us to do so much more on so
many more interesting things that's
right thank you
thank you very
you
see this
so I heard maybe a couple questions
there so if I don't answer all of them
please let me know okay so why would we
want to do this in a new application I
think one for maintainability I think
one of the things you know we have many
of us have rails as a common heritage
what we see is that as an application
matures and grows it's very difficult to
manage they become very difficult to
manage if we begin in this way we can
add multiple elixir applications to
handle multiple scenarios right or
multiple new things that we need to do
within an application right there
isolated they're separated from one
another and I think you're asking
something about like how do we handle
state if it's not in the database like
if there's a problem that server crashes
something like that I mean I don't know
if I understood the second half of your
question
maybe it just depends I hope you know I
remember Joe Armstrong yeah saying I
think he was on a podcast maybe the
mostly airline podcast he was asking me
oh how would you build Twitter today if
you're using airline you're saying you
would have a process for every user you
would have a process for all of their
feeds and you would save all that in
memory stay fully on the server
Chris's guy
no the other way around yeah yes well no
no I Sophie you you you bring cave Cavey
into the interface so you bring the
elixir application into the Phoenix
interface I don't know that you'd want
to do that
great nothing that sounds fabulous</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
