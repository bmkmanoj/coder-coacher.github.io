queue management track actually yes this
is the active queue management track
this is we're talking about load
balancing buffers job management etc etc
etc I'll be your track host for the day
and it gives me great pleasure to
introduce the first speaker for the day
who's both charming witty and urbane and
thank you much appreciate it and yeah
I'm the first speaker so there we go so
two people got it right at the start
that is useful as the day goes on for
those of you are gonna hang out and
listen to at least some of the other
talks what you're gonna get is a bit
more detail about techniques mechanisms
modalities that you can use to do job
management queue management essentially
how you can and should be dealing with
systems where you got requests producers
and consumers and you can't really
control the rate at which stuff is
coming in the door what I mean by that
the problem at hand is most of the stuff
that we are building 10 sequences are
stuff that consumes data and all your
buildings have the producers data which
is fine too but the thing is you rarely
have control of the other end of the
system so if your building can stop that
consumes data hey you may not have
control of stuff that produces the data
and when bad stuff happens you know what
do you do so that's kind of the
overarching theme of what we're going to
be talking about today what I'm got was
planning or talking about today was
amongst other things too specific or
lying germane projects that actually
implement a bunch of active queue
management a job control and so on and
so forth one of them was Wolf's job
framework which turns out Olaf is giving
a talk about it so I'm not going to do
that the other one was just first SB
framework we
just words giving to talk about that so
I'm not gonna do that either so instead
I'm going to tell you guys a story which
I hope you guys like if you don't please
like it or pretend so the first talk
which is active queue management is
essentially the story of how I ruin my
vacation and essentially what at a very
big picture level what this comes down
to is not my vacation which was ruined
but it's about how it doesn't matter how
good you build your sister while you
build your system how much take care you
take about whatever you're building
there's certain things that you just
can't avoid and the point behind that is
there are these things called Black Swan
events which those of you who know
anything about financial systems or so
on and so forth are aware of black swans
these are the things that keep the
once-in-a-lifetime of events they just
kind of show up and screw up all of your
best laid plans so to begin with let me
kind of briefly describe my my company
what we do we or what my previous
company used to do I ran a phone company
joy by the way for those of you who are
interested in starting the phone company
don't but used to provide phone services
for small businesses which to be really
precise came down to we provided hosted
cloud communications for small
businesses which is kind of a very cool
way of saying we took a really boring
thing that used to be done by really
large systems way back when we put them
in racks and we slammed them in clouds
and then you end up with you know cloud
communications doing phone stuff and
whatever doesn't particularly matter
really it's just like buzzwords there
the important thing is the numbers when
we started this back in 99 we had about
zero phone calls per second okay one
phone call per second maybe by the time
about Oh 2008 or 2009 roller
we were running about a thousand phone
calls per second I actually think it's
about 3,000 if you look at the number of
simultaneous phone calls per sec
simultaneous phone calls if you're
running at scale it was actually about
went up by about four orders of
magnitude and if you look at the API
requests to kind of back up here this is
one of these new-age phone companies
where you could access stuff of the web
I am Twitter Facebook you know all that
kind of jazz our HTTP API requests went
up by effectively infinity it was just
some crazy number I mean you don't can
think about it by the way this is all in
one huge infrastructure that we're
basically replacing components in real
time which when you look at our
infrastructure we basically were kind of
your standard stuff you've heard this
you know how this stuff works
the thing is we had these huge clusters
we hosted stuff on Amazon we hosted
stuff on Rackspace we host the stuff on
giant we had our own hosting centers you
know multiple clusters across multiple
geographic regions and stuff oh very
cool and extremely fancy so that's kind
of the background just you kind of know
what we used to do so let's talk about
an avocation that's not the Taj Mahal by
the way that is a thing called the BB
comic burrow which is in this absolute
hellhole of a city in the middle of
India somewhere but there's some
spectacularly cool sightseeing around
there this was built by the grandson of
the guy that built the Taj Mahal as some
kind of memento to his grandfather I
guess but he didn't have that much money
so that's not marble that's actually
kind of concrete I mean not concrete
random blocks but it looks like the Taj
Mohamed it's kind of cool that's where
we were going or that's where I was
supposed to be going because that's
actually a picture taken by somebody
else because I actually never managed to
make it there that's the key
so what happened we had you know big
racks of computers there's a little tiny
failure on one of the nodes just stuff
goes down all the time something went
down so what do you do we start the note
it's easy we write everything in Erlang
life is good all you gotta do is just
restart the node and poof the stuff
comes right back up so you know I
actually happen to be that this is by
the way exactly one hour before I got in
the car to go to the airport with my
wife who really needed a vacation as to
die
hit the button boom restart the node I
mean we're talking like and when I went
down I mean everything went down Powell
in a worldwide outage not good seriously
so by the way when I said it's my
company it was my company but you know
we had a CEO which is not me and we got
a board that I report to technically and
at the end of the day worldwide outages
are bad things even if it's your company
so really bad things so what happened
that little tiny loosely coupled
infrastructure thingy
turned out to actually be a big huge
problem which we'd ever thought about
that way so let's take let's take the
problems one at a time because this kind
of illustrates what happens when you
don't think about emergent properties
what happens when you don't think about
large-scale issues that can occur in
systems or even when you do but you
don't expect these things to happen one
of those nodes went down the people on
that node who are on their phone calls
right calls got dropped because
something bad happened the calls got
draw so they promptly start calling back
that's what you do right your phone
doesn't connect you just call back so
all those calls rolled over to another
node and you can kind of see where that
one's going right so there calls
over the other node and in the meantime
the person on the other side who got
dropped it's also calling back because
they're like oh hey what happened
neither can get each other because now
they're talking to each other and you
know there's both of their phones are
busy so they both go to voicemail you
leave a message what happens to the
message that's gotta go in it's gotta
get transcoded it's got to get fun
things have to happen so CPU utilization
starts going up on even more nodes
because we do transcoding on different
notes so now the load that the node that
the calls are rolling over to is spike
spiking the nodes to do the transcoding
are spiking and people keep calling you
leave the voicemail and you call back
again because that's what you do because
you it's maybe an important call just
about now what happens is our back-end
systems that go hmm
that session seems to be timing out it
reloads the session from storage so now
it's hitting the disks so the disks are
trying to spike so our storage units are
starting to spike and in the meantime
you know this is the modern age
everybody's taking to Twitter and
Facebook saying dude what I mean what's
going on here fix this fix this fix this
hey do you know I've tell us down up
tell us down oh my god up tell us down
and HTTP requests are going in all the
social media stuff is horrible because
every single one of those we track we
log we maintain boom boom boom cascading
failures second node Goes Down and now
you get the picture right it's like the
third node goes down the fourth node
goes down the second node went down
about two minutes it took two minutes
was just kind of cool after the first
one went down the rest of nodes went
down approximately one attosecond later
I mean it was like I may be exaggerating
maybe a nanosecond but still you know
poof gone so yeah total system meltdown
completely so then you know the obvious
thing is well dude did you test another
load well yeah
you do test under load but up to a
certain point I mean you gotta have some
metrics somewhere right
what do you test against when you build
levees against floods you don't check
against thousand year floods I mean you
could say you're building an says to get
a ten thousand year flood what do you do
at some point you got to stop
that's a black swan that happens kind of
roll back you know we kind of saw this
one coming we knew this was gonna happen
we didn't expect a ten thousand year
flood we don't expect the Black Swan but
we kind of saw this one coming because
we had seen this before
we had still in a different situation I
won't go into it but the point being it
doesn't matter how well you plan our
careful you plan something bad is gonna
happen you're gonna end up with a
scenario that you didn't expect can you
plan for that can you
it's not whether you can recover
immediately it's are you fast enough to
get back in shape so the news for us was
when everything went down it took us
about three hours to come back up on the
one hand that was horrible on the other
hand we did manage to come up which I'll
get I'll get back to in a bit by the way
to take a step back on this one in 2008
during the elections there's this very
famous in the US if you're in the phone
business incident where you know there
are all these issues with elections in
the US there's something that happened
in Florida in 2000 stuff so in 2008 what
the Democrats did was they set up all
these calling centers where they said if
there is any polling irregularity please
call this phone number and they got this
really reputable spectacularly cool
phone company to provide the phone
services on the other side us by the way
in case you didn't get the point we did
that total meltdown back then that one
wasn't our fault
that was because even though they had
all we had this make spectacular
capacity we had prepared for bursts and
overloads and you know it hard we were
set turns out that all phone calls from
Ohio were going through this one single
exchange somewhere in Cincinnati that
exchange went down great nothing we
could do about that
we got blamed but you know that was an
issue
so anyhow back then there was this big
post mortem and everybody said okay well
you know this is what should happen when
exchanges go down when centers go down
and how you should recover from failures
sounds good 2012 Romney's campaign had
exactly the same thing when they had all
their servers in the Boston Garden and
they didn't have enough capacity in the
Boston Garden to deal with all their
servers but this is you think Bay of all
people would have paid attention to this
capacity management but you don't you
know stuff happens the bottom line being
stuff happens capacity management issues
overloads things along these lines and
the question is how you possibly recover
from these things or how do you actually
plan for these things or actually if you
take a huge step back how do you know
what to look for in these situations so
let me kind of take these way back way
back and put it in a simpler context
back to where I started at the end of
the day most of these problems are you
got a bunch of producers you got a bunch
of consumers previous producers are
producing stuff consumers are consuming
stuff if you got enough capacity to deal
with all the producers doesn't matter
how much you produce this talks not for
you I mean it's irrelevant you're happy
and if it's the other side if you're the
producer and you know there enough
consumers to deal with whatever you're
doing you don't care about it either
because you're happy the question is
what happens when there's a mismatch how
do you deal with that mismatch and to
take this yet another huge step back
this talk is also about Al or what
you're going to see over the rest of the
day is
how we don't learn from history we never
learned from history and I wish you know
I think in fact I'm fairly certain that
the quote we don't learn from history
has been restated originally about a
million times so there we go so what do
you do if you don't have enough does
that be the point is you just go yeah I
make it faster make it faster well can
you make it faster what if you got disks
in the loop can you make those disks
fatter well put SSDs in there well can
you do that is it still fast enough
put RAM for use caches do whatever oh
great wonderful maybe there's a human in
the loop somewhere
seriously order-taking to take a step
back a friend of mine went to Amsterdam
to become the CEO of this huge
multi-level marketing company and he
shared a bit it's this two billion
dollar a year company sure if it turns
out the entire back office was run off
of Excel and post-its it was and by the
way this is like you know thousands of
orders a day but yeah they had posted
said X cells and there's always a human
in the loop turns out that is a good
thing because that implicitly put a
limit on how much stuff they could shove
to the system there's a human to the
loop the phone rings busy that's it you
know there's nothing you can do about it
works or not depending on what you're
trying to do right um yeah fine
whoa and this is actually a no class
example your computer freezes what do
you do
excuse me a moment we're back
so you put stuff in the queue right
that's it so instead of post-its you
have some instead of just have somebody
taking calls and putting up something
over the post-it you have a receptionist
an admin who takes the calls and says
please hold and when the next person
frees up they pass the call along great
queuing this by the way is the first
thing that everybody reimplemented
what things in a queue problem will get
solved it's true and somewhere I did
something questions what did I do
maybe this I shall just click on the
little arrow and that should solve my
problem so let's look at queues buffer
blow it's buffer bloat an issue
seriously if you don't know what buffer
bloat is don't worry about it it
probably is gonna be an issue for you if
you do know what it is it probably could
be an issue for you anyhow let's make
this much simpler put everything in the
queue this is great take us as an
example system went down just queue up
the requests and once the system comes
back up you can start processing it
right um what if you can't drought draw
down the queue fast enough you now have
people blasting in on the backend and
you can't pull things off the front end
backing up eventually your queue
explodes it happens I mean that just
gonna happen back pressure it's possible
back pressure I think you're gonna be
talking about back pressure later today
stephen auskey you will be giving a talk
which includes back pressure amongst
other things so to kind of cut to the
chase yeah put a queue in there you got
possible problems if none of these apply
to you oh happy days you know this is
gorgeous
if any of these apply to you you got a
problem
you may not have a problem today but if
God forbid actually not god forbid
hopefully whatever you doing works and
the project gets accepted and or it
actually sees the light of day remember
something like 90 percent of every
single project everywhere never makes it
to the light today but if you happen to
be one of those 10% you got a problem
there possible solutions to a lot of
these things they're not perfect
solutions but they're possible solutions
the easy simple one is it programmable
in the world of sip in phone calls some
HDTV stuff too you can actually tell
people programmatically hey retry this
request after 30 seconds that buys you
valuable time while you bring your
system back up again how useful that's
in many ways one of the best approaches
if you have the luxury of being able to
do that sometimes you don't even do that
you use behavioral techniques put that
thing up you know on the neck most of
the time nothing's actually happening
back there and yet you stare at the
screen like oh hey yeah something's
gonna happen and after about 30 or 45
seconds you click reload hey the person
at the other end bought 30 45 seconds
it's awesome behavioral behavioral
psychology it's valuable
remember this their self managed
techniques that you can use airports
uses all the time you just put up you
let people figure it out you make the
clients intelligent you if they don't
know that they're being intelligent you
make the clients intelligent which Q do
I go to you look at the lines you pick
the Q that's shortest works if the
cashier vanishes from one of the from
one of the Q's from one of the lines
everybody just leaves then goes over to
the other ones you don't have to do
anything the supermarket didn't have to
do anything people manage themselves
into the other queues it works
in fact do you know one of the large
best practitioners the sons it's gonna
sound kind of weird but one of the best
practitioners of queue management active
queue management to be precise the
airlines seriously who knew turns out
they've been doing this for 50 years or
more ever since it started taking off
they know how to deal with this stuff
the point about Airlines is this is what
you always end up seeing right cancel
cancel cancel Oh suck why can't the pill
why can't the planes just deal with the
stuff why can't the airline's
just get me to my destination happily
actually turns out they are for the vast
majority of people there's some small
set very vocal said sometimes you who's
unhappy but yes they're good at this but
the point the underlying point behind
active queue management to bring this
full circle yet again is what do you do
when you do not have control when to put
it mildly something's gotta give
you got more producers than consumers
can deal with you got less consumers
than the producer wants you got to drop
something you gotta like do something
which involves not making everybody
happy
somebody's gonna be unhappy the question
is who do you pick to be unhappy and
this is the million-dollar question this
is the difference between a successful
business and in a successful business
there's a difference between a
successful application and one that you
know guys badly so one of the things
that I tend to see a lot if is this
stuff how you do active queue management
it has been reinvented so many times
it's not even funny and by the way the
way I realize that the air airlines do
this it's a friend of mine actually came
to me and said oh you're always ranting
about aqm we've been doing this for 50
years like wow okay so I did something I
could learn to
let's take the simple case got stuff
coming the queue on the left side
somebody reading off the right side what
do you do when there's not enough the
queue can't grow infinitely and they're
not enough people to read stuff off the
right side
the simplest the most obvious one the
one that everybody always does right off
the bat
it's called tail drop just start
dropping stuff when the queue filter GZ
it's simple it's also like really really
really not a good solution because you
can it's not in worth getting into but
basically what it boils down to is your
entire system can slow to a crawl
good exact good way to think about this
think about planes you got let's say
think about the US you got planes
they've got to go from New York to San
Francisco it's a six-hour flight let's
say there's just not enough air traffic
capacity to deal with people going over
if you just don't even let the plane
take off on this end till capacity
freeze up in San Francisco over at that
end you now have an immediate six hour
delay on every single flight because you
got to wait for this plane to get all
the way over there and say oh hey yeah
I'm here then you let the next one off
six hours that's bad that's not gonna
work tail drop bad idea but yeah people
do it anyhow so years and years ago way
back when van Jacobson anybody you're
not knew who van Jacobson is hands hands
one two three okay for OKC there now
we're trying to get this there are
people that don't know who van Jacobson
he's God
he's mammoth he may not be D God but he
certainly a God rescued tcp/ip back in
the mid 80s with something called slow
start probably has forgotten more about
networking than we'll ever know in our
lives and so on between him and Kathy
Nichols and a couple others I mean
they're like the genie I in the world of
tcp/ip so anyhow this guy
way back when came up with something
called red which has a bunch of vent it
doesn't particularly matter what it
stands for it's random early detect or
random early drop but the whole point is
it is a mechanism by which you can
actually figure out what to do with your
cues when they start filling up so
here's a simple way to think about this
instead of just doing tale drop which is
what you usually do when your cue fills
up get slightly more slightly more
intelligent about it what you do is you
look at your cue and you say as my cue
starts filling up the closer it gets to
getting filled up the more requests I
drop let me repeat that you start
dropping requests even before the cue
fills up sounds like a bad idea but it's
actually a really good idea because what
it's doing is it's telling people at the
other end hold hey there might be some
issues I may not be fast enough to deal
with this maybe you might want to slow
down your transmission a bit it's this
is a curve that basically says what
these are different rates at which you
can drop stuff early on don't do
anything but the closer you get to fall
so till you're about 70% full don't do
anything just take stuff between 70 and
80 drop 10% of your requests between 80
and 90 drop 50% of your requests it's an
idea it works it actually works really
well it's bloody hard to tune but it
works remarkably well they actually
blink um I mean airlines do this all the
time
classy example is in New York you got
three airports LaGuardia JFK and Newark
Newark always gets a shaft basically
whenever there's any problem with the
airspace in New York they start telling
Newark ah you are gonna have delays even
before it gets four gets there that's
why I mean it's a well-known thing you
never fly into or out of Newark between
11 a.m. and 4 p.m. just don't by the way
if you ever think about it don't
so there's about 80 bajillion different
ways in which you can do these things
there's something called thread which
stands for flow random random early
detect these are actual terms by the way
terms of art what Fred basically does is
it says instead of just dropping things
from the queue look at the actual
traffic going through the queue and say
which producer is sending to which
consumer because what you might have is
you might have one person at this end
setting a bajillion requests and
everybody else is just kind of
occasionally talking so you just shut
that one major request down or start
like slowing them down and the rest kind
of deal with it you just the thing is
you got to put more intelligence there
you gotta track things a lot better it's
harder but it's good there's another
thing called preferential drop which
basically translates to when you're
talking about inter-continental travel
you basically say you know what if
you're flying from London to New York
that's kind of a big deal you can't just
like turn back when you're halfway over
the Atlantic should those get high
priority any traffic within a given
country those get the shaft so you they
quiver length from our queue side just
to kind of like flog this dead horse is
you basically go okay between two Erlang
nodes a heartbeat between the two nodes
would be a very good thing to not drop
ever that's an inside joke for a lot of
use there but yeah that would be an
example of a preferential you know being
good about that there's something else
called whoops sorry
weighted read this is now where life
gets even scarier which is you start
doing not just transatlantic stuff but
you go you know what the London to New
York one is really really important
because that's where our masters of our
universe in our differential financial
piece
that's the route they take so don't drop
any of those but anybody came from
Frankfort you know screw them they're
not important that's an inside joke for
some other people so we'll leave it at
that
so there's a million more stabilized red
robust red adaptive red there's also
something called blue which is it's
supposedly a joke I don't you know what
it is there's something called choke
which is choosing kill which is
something that Microsoft helped out with
which about zero people use but it's
there
that's not an anti Microsoft statement
by the way it's just it is like even for
complicated stuff this was crazy
complicated and you know pass it so way
way way back when I mean way back when
because red was complicated van Jacobson
kind of stepped back and said hey I
figured out a solution to the problem so
I'm just gonna make it he modified the
red algorithms and the red mekka
methodology to essentially make it into
a feedback loop effectively what he said
was allowed the queues to automatically
sense what there's the current statuses
and figure out what to drop based upon
how full they are it is a paper that he
submitted this is in the late 80s or
early 90s 1992 I think and by the way
I'm not making this part up he submitted
the paper one of the examples that he
had in the paper was a toilet if you
think about the way a toilet is
structured it's like even if there's a
leak the tank still kind of fills up
you've seen this there's a leak in the
toilet in your house it fills up it
works it never overflows there's all
this fun stuff that happens in there he
had the picture in there it got rejected
by the journal because there's a picture
of a toilet in the thing I seriously not
making this up some people have no sense
of humor but sir van Jacobson being van
Jacobson you know basically being an
angry guard at this point basically said
screw you I'm just not gonna publish
this never saw they lie today which
probably changed the internet world for
the worst for quite a while but that's
however he did do something
he created something called Codell which
controlled to meet or a couple other
things jasper is going to talk about
this this afternoon Codell essentially
is it is a completely different way of
looking at keys where he basically said
what's important about a cue and this is
one of those ridiculously obvious things
in retrospect he said what's what's
really important about a cue is not how
many things are going through the cue
and how whether you have enough
producers a good sumers or what the end
points are what's really really
important is how long each item takes in
the queue that's the only thing that
matters it I know you're kind of sitting
there going huh well duh
what's your point it turns out that that
was a wow we never thought of that kind
of moment for a lot of people it also
means a number of things you need to
measure in the queue are ridiculously
small you just measure the time that
something case to go to the queue and it
kind of automatically fixed this a bunch
of other stuff the algorithms actually
very simple to implement
just jasper in his safety valve package
which like i said he's going to talk
about this afternoon actually has a
working version of code l in this thing
so about code l one of the things that
i've noticed is when people go about
implementing re-implementing queue
management or active queue management in
whatever systems they're building out
there everybody Riemann's code l
everybody and they all get it wrong
seriously go check out the paper read it
when you read the paper if you do
anything with queue management just read
the paper you're gonna read the paper
you're gonna go I should have thought of
that it's a couple of little tiny things
but they're important and this to take
one huge step to the side but not step
in the way of something pretend it took
a huge step to the side the problem
width accident
the problem with active queue management
is emergent properties things happen in
systems which have busy queues and so on
that you can it's actually quite
possibly an np-complete problem it is
not predictable you don't know how the
system is going to react when it gets
close to the edges it is a chaotic prop
system effectively these are things that
there abstruse they're obscure you may
think you know what you're doing you
don't by the way that's not because you
are not smart it's because nobody does
it anymore that's why it's called an
emergent property it just thinks happen
so for those of you are not aware of
what slow start is in tcp/ip way back
when in the early 80 in the mid-80s the
internet almost shut down because there
were problems in the way tcp/ip was
structured back then it is not something
that he could reason from first
principles it is something that happened
just because of the way tcp/ip swindles
are structured there's this thing called
retransmit window and so on and so forth
and whatever just trust me it is bad and
effectively what ended up happening was
I had seen this too I had no idea why it
was happening that's because I was in
fan Jacobson but the point is I was
sitting in a room does my computer there
was a computer right next to me
I couldn't interact with the computer
right here even though they're plugged
into the same router but I was perfectly
happily interacting with one in Chicago
I was about 400 miles away
so going 400 miles was easy but going
right next to me was not possible which
wasn't because of a crappy switch or
something it's because tcp/ip was busted
at the time it was like a problem and
van Jacobson eventually figured out that
it is something called slow start which
he came up with the patch for for a
while it is called van jacobson tcp/ip
and then it became tcp/ip so nobody even
remembers that there was a pre van
jacobson tcp/ip because that's just the
world that we live in nowadays it's like
you don't realize you're breathing
you're breathing it just is so anyhow
the which is a long way of getting back
to code l go read the paper take a look
at it you will see a couple of edge
cases at least one of those edge cases
is something that you will say to
yourself
aha I wish I had thought of that and
then you'll probably probably go about
saying yeah I did think on that one it's
in the code that's okay you know just do
it
everybody will be happier so testing duh
testing you do this you put an active Q
management you read the paper you do
code l test it it's gonna work maybe
maybe not because quite frankly remember
the bed about black swans they're gonna
happen there are gonna happen whatever
you do wherever you go whatever you
implement something bad is gonna happen
this is some philosopher probably said
it a lot better than me but I believe
technically speaking the term as
happens it's going to happen so when you
kind of step back what you need to do is
ask yourself a couple of things one do I
need to worry about Q management yes or
no the answer's no you're probably wrong
but let's just pretend the answer's no
okay fine great that's good that's good
I mean it's a good business if you do
need to worry about Q management
look at the things you control make sure
that the things that you control are
under control that's a huge chunk of
everything that we've been talking about
you know the origin story behind an
origin story behind er Liang you know
fault tolerance reliability blah blah
blah that's all about making sure that
the things you control are actually
under control great do that happy you
wrote the perfect application and the
things that you control will never ever
crash happy days so that's two things
you got going for you right now
the third one is you know where all the
magic needs to happen
what about the things you don't control
hey my app suddenly became massively
popular ouch
huge downloads huge server hits oh
people are using my service wow problem
good problem but problem you should know
spill games Exhibit A wow we're
successful metal issue with spill games
and queue management development Talent
where did they get people from that's
all joke you right I mean you you don't
have enough people to do solve the
problems you need to solve that's a
problem we got out there there's queue
management everywhere you just never
think about it should think about the
things to control make sure it works
look at the things you don't control try
and figure out what your business
requirements are associated with the
things you don't control and that is
going to determine the things the people
who can make unhappy back to Airlines I
travel a lot on business
I get spectacularly I get treated
extremely well by the airlines because I
give him a lot of money business money
last-minute ticket money so if there's a
problem you know before the airline even
tells anybody there's a problem I get a
phone call saying oh hey yeah yeah if I
don't buy one of those tickets let's say
I'm just going somewhere in vacation I
travel once a year I am like the last
person and the first person they go away
we don't care about you right I mean
this is the way the world works this is
what the airline's determined was
business travelers important non
business travelers don't give a I'm
not saying you shouldn't care what I'm
saying is figure out who you can who or
what or where or when you can make
things or people unhappy make those
unhappy because it's a lot better than
making the important people unhappy
seriously so basically whatever your
business is is going to determine what
your
strategy is there is no universal
strategy do go read the paper and at the
end of the day you know agility is your
friend being able to recover and react
rapidly is basically what's going to be
the difference between being successful
and not and with that I shall come to an
end any questions yes yes yeah exactly
that's it yeah I've done I know so
Pierce read it Pierce a smart guy yeah
exactly
yes um not necessarily the whole point
is you don't know it depends upon your
business that your business requirements
your situations you can postulate a good
catch but the point behind that is every
specific business or every specific
problem has a specific implementation
relevant to it so you could that's an
exercise to the reader which I always
hate you can come up with the scenario
in which that's exactly what you want
you can come with a scenario where you
don't want any of them
there are also scenarios where you can
say stuff like everything goes through
till it's 100% at which point I do tale
wrong fine whatever but you do it but
yes exactly
excellent thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
