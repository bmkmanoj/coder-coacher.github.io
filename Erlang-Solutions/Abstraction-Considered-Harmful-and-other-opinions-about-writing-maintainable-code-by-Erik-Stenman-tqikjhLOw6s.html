consider harmful and other opinions
about writing maintainable code and
basically what this is is just a
collection of war stories from the time
when I was running a lot of servers that
were supposed to be up and running all
the time and sometimes they weren't and
the idea here is that by telling you
these stories you will not have to make
the same mistakes I did so learn from
the mistakes of others you can never
live long enough to make them all
yourself
supposedly Groucho Marx or it might be
Eleanor Roosevelt as a Bram Lincoln said
don't believe everything you read on the
internet so this is very much an equal
one experiment so the N equals one
experiment is an experiment when you
don't have 1,000 subjects or a million
subjects you just try it out in yourself
and see how it goes so these are my
experiences and you might not come to
same conclusions as I did in these
examples I have rewritten the code to
protect not so innocent people that
wrote it in the first place and even
though most of the code that I will
present today is not code that I have
written myself but that other people
wrote and I had to deal with I have
written exactly that kind of code myself
many many times and yeah so don't we
shouldn't point a finger at people and
blame them I'll do that in private but
I've done these mistakes myself and
I put opinion in the title because
opinions are so much more interesting
than facts but these are not opinions
these are really only the facts that you
will get here today so the the title was
just to confuse you so this is true
stories all of them and it's just fact
about life and programming good so we
had this big transaction system that was
growing exponentially and load every
year or actually it doubled every 10
month and when back then so we in the
engineering department for constantly
running and trying to get the system to
perform better and better while the load
was just increasing and increasing and
at one point we started to see time outs
that calls that were coming in didn't
all complete on time so when the load
reached a certain level the system
couldn't finish the the whole
transaction on time and this was just
about a month before the Christmas
shopping period would start when we
would see their really really big loads
so we had worked all summer to make the
system better we had actually even
upgraded to the latest version of Erlang
out to P to be really ready for the load
that was coming with Christmas and then
suddenly things started to go bad and as
soon as the load went up a little bit we
started losing calls
so of course we had monitoring in place
but there were no processes that stood
out
we had logs of almost everything but
there were really nothing interesting in
the logs he has things going slow
suddenly so to find the problem or the
artificial problem we had to use GDC and
here is a little bit to put in your tool
belt I have of course not built a nice
little tool for inspecting your airline
system through gdb so you just have to
memorize these magic incantations and
then use them whenever you need so by
doing this we could actually attach the
new debugger to the airline runtime
system while it was running and taking
traffic and then we could see that let's
make it DC that it was spending a lot of
time in the function generating stack
traces and since we had the whole stack
in the new debugger we could see that
the call stack contained a national call
to the pith that build a stack trace so
there were someone calling get stack
drags explicitly so that was a bit bad
and what had happened when we upgraded
to r15 was that the great guy set of the
P had supplied this very nice new
feature that you get line numbers in
stack traces so you could actually see
where things crushed which is very very
very nice
no problem at all there's of course a
little bit of cost to that
so while generating a stack trace the
emulator now has to go through some data
structures to find the actual line
numbers and build a structure on the
heap and put the line numbers on the
heap in this structure and build a list
of all these things in this tract trace
so there was a lot of extra work being
done when doing stack traces so we
looked through the source code and we
found a couple of places where you
explicitly called get stack trace so
there was this one developer that had
written a bit some libraries and he
wanted to abstract away some errors that
he didn't know how to handle and what to
do with so had he had this sort of
filter function we take took a function
and two arguments and apply the filter
functions to the arguments and if it was
match somehow the function returned true
you would get back at toppled true and
the value X that matched in some way
otherwise it will return false but he
was afraid that this could crash so I
also added a catch that caught anything
and since if it crashes you want to know
where it crashes and why so we got the
stack trace because that would be nice
when you crash to find the place of the
crash and then threw this thing back as
an error with the stack trace okay
reasonable code and he also had written
this all function that could take a list
and apply a filter to things and problem
here was that Harry was expecting true
and then he would keep the
the value that he got back or it could
be false and then it meant that you
shouldn't keep the element X and then of
course things could go wrong so he
caught the problem and in this case if
someone goes wrong in the matching you
should probably not keep that element so
we just don't keep that element fine so
this way you could filter out elements
that in some way matches and then
someone wrote this nice get mattress
function that used all and a function
match and this function match actually
did the airline let it crash thingy and
said if X is equal to X then we keep it
then is true otherwise it crashes okay
that's one way of doing it so combining
all these things would mean that when
you threw in a list and did these
matching everything worked as expected
if the values x and y were the same and
matched you would keep it and if they
weren't it would throw an exception and
then we would catch the exception and
and don't keep the element so by calling
this get matcher thing on a list and
some something you wanted to match on
you would get everything that matched
from the list it works
it was perfectly semantically correct
code as a side effect it built a stack
trace every time with line numbers so
before line numbers 40,000 times per
second this was okay for the system we
had some big systems so doing it 40,000
stacked races per second was not a big
problem
adding line numbers to this it started
to take a little bit more time we were
still doing 40,000 50,000 calls to get
stacked race per second and yeah things
didn't work out so well
then so some of the takeaways from this
is that don't throw away errors if you
don't know what they mean that's usually
not a good thing to do and don't get the
stack trace
unless you're crashing and logging so
this library function that got the stack
trace and then threw it back that is
just bad on so many levels so if you
would just have skipped doing that
everything would have been fun fine it
would have kept on throwing the
exception from below up and things would
have worked not the most efficient way
of doing it but it would have worked and
not building a stack trace another thing
just to throw in there is don't use
throw when you mean error so you know
that throw is for things that you want
to do a quick return to some higher
place in your program and you actually
want to use that value an error is when
something goes wrong and don't write
lots of layers of libraries hiding too
much info so in this example I cut it
down to make it fit on two slides and in
that process I removed many of the
layers of the libraries that actually
hid the fact that you were matching and
expecting a crash in one place and in
another place you were not really
expecting a crash but handling it and
for the developers using the libraries
it was most very hard to see that this
was not this way you were supposed to
use the library so everything was
abstracted away and the second developer
dev wrote the match function that just
crashed for that this was a this
actually worked this is this would give
the right result but it was unclear what
the side effects were in this case
and of course the Allen principle of it
all is just to let it crash but not when
you want to or false
or don't let it crash if you can avoid
letting it crash brings us to another
story so I some parental leave and after
summer I came back and said oh how are
things they are not okay things are
working out well the system is up and
running and so but when we load code the
system crashes and that was a bit scary
okay well it's not every time okay it's
about every second time okay but it's
not all machines okay so at that time we
were running five machines and they were
a little bit out of sync so some of the
machines thought it was time to crash at
time eh and some of them thought it was
okay to crash at time B and then I kept
on pink going back like this and the
master verse moves around between the
system and everything was working and
you didn't really notice any problem as
a consumer because it just went through
next machine but every time we loaded
code a few of the machines just went
dead and we start to see a pattern here
we didn't see anything in the logs we
didn't see anything strange in the
monitoring tools there were no crash
dumps there were no error messages just
died fortunately when upgrading the
system of course we were doing the nice
a long way and upgrading the system
while they were running and taking
traffic and so on but while we were
upgrading the system we were logging
each step in the upgrade process and it
turned out that the problem we had came
while we were loading new code for our
domain-specific language
so we had this nice little backtracking
domain-specific language so that we
could write rules to decide on different
things and if some rule will fail it
would backtrack up and try another rule
so it was sort of Prolog like thingy
very nice for writing rules and it was
unloading a line generated modules that
was compiled from our domain-specific
language that this crashed so the
backtracking was implemented with
try-catch and the problem is that we
didn't see anything at all when and when
it died but when we realized that it was
actually when we loaded new code we
wrote the program that just generated a
loaded new versions of our generated
code and after a while the shell died
and the beam printed beam catches cones
no free slot sadface so that was nice
then we had something to look for in the
beam source code and looking just a few
lines about this place in the code where
it says no free slots and we're actually
we dropped put a sad face of course
there was only one sad face in the whole
beam code this was the only sad place in
in the whole implementation and a few
lines now it is it said should use
dynamic reallocation and if they find a
tab size here of something reasonable
like 16 times thousand 24 so that was
how many try catches the airline system
could handle at a time so in all the
loaded code in the system it could
handle these many try caches or yes
caches as they were before try
and the problem when we loaded code when
you'd load code into running system the
system keeps the old version of the code
so by loading code we actually had twice
as many basically caches as we're not
loading code so since almost all our try
cache chests were in the generated code
for the domain-specific language which
had backtracking we usually doubled up
on the number of caches while while
loading code until the code was purged
so the real problem here was actually
how we started a line so we just started
up the airline system as a demon with
outer shell and then all the standard
error output just ended up in dev null
so this nice sad face just went to dev
no I mean ever saw the sad face have you
seen the sad face everything would have
been quickly sold as soon as we found
this line of code we could just fix this
by not fixing the real problem but
increasing the size of this buffer and
then it was up and running
also as you will see we fixed the other
problem by using run early instead which
of course you should use everyone uses
from ok and in getting all the output
into nice little logs that we could
search afterwards but of course we were
not using the latest version of a line
if we soon as I looked at github for
this
I saw whoa Hertz realloc instead of sad
face so the sad face were gone and
instead it reallocated to a larger array
and everything was fine
Thank You Bjorn Agel who checked that
code in so at this time we should have
up
the latest version of the runtime system
to avoid the problem so the takeaway
always used to run I'll use the latest
version of a line the latest stable
version at least make sure you don't
send errors to dev know and of course
what saved us was the core thing of our
line that you actually run it on more
than one machine so always have more
than one machine and it's a good thing
if there bit out of sync so that you
don't crash or at the same time so the
next story is about sharing
so not the nice kind of sharing where we
give things to people but really nice
kind of sharing that the airline VM does
where it actually just have one copy of
everything so one day our system died
and we could see that now we had
actually monitoring and logs in place
that that showed us something so we
could see that there was a huge peak in
memory so it was using 256 gig of memory
suddenly and we could see actually which
process is using a lot of memory and we
could see that this was a an XML parser
that actually it was a supervisor
monitoring an XML parser that suddenly
were using memory and a supervisor
should never use any memory at all
really so what happened was that there
was a parse error of the XML file and
the partial died
and the monitor got the partial state
and then the state became huge because
sharing was expanded so how many here
knows what sharing is a few people so I
will explain what sharing us a little
bit so in in a line you have this really
nice feature that a data structure if
you use it in two places it actually is
only kept in one place on the heap so if
you have a list like hello and you put
it in a topple twice so you have the
tuples t and list ll twice in this on
the heap you will only have three words
for this you have one where this as this
is tupple and then one we're saying this
is the list and then another word saying
this is the list and it's the same list
so you can see in the little picture
there how the two parts of the top will
actually point to the same place in
memory so this is very nice
until you do something like ascend or
you do IO or anything that does a deep
copy because then the sharing is is
expanded so then you will get two copies
of the list so you can write this little
program share here share that takes two
arguments and build a structure with a
lot of sharing in it and you run it for
a second and then return okay that's
fine no problem you can call it with the
same arguments and just throw away the
result and it's no problem you call it
with the same argument and you inspect
the result with for example list to
binary and then dish you will see how
big this structure actually is and it
will just crush the whole p.m. and take
you down so of course the xml parser
were parsing an XML file and it was
keeping oh I have to do parse that part
and I have to parse that part and it
kept building this truck
sure of the xml file over and over again
which actually was just pointer back to
the same structure but when it expanded
you've got the whole three of everything
that needed to be parsed and checked and
so on so it and the XML file in the
beginning was huge so so this was bad
but it was not really what caused the
crash I mean okay we got a huge spike of
memory and it was using 256 gigabyte of
ROM but we had some machines that
probably had one terabyte of ROM at a
time but no airline system had done this
before so we wrote some programs to
stress test the system and actually
allocate a lot of memory and it's
actually quite hard to to allocate 256
gigabyte of ROM so if you don't want to
spend a whole day running the program
you have to think a little bit on how to
do it but it's possible and we did it in
some different versions of this and what
we found so one one obvious thing is to
make many processes allocate a lot of
memory in a line but unfortunately the
that didn't really show the problem it
was when one process used more than 32
gigabyte of memory and there were some
subtool you in 32 64 bugs in the garbage
collector and it just crashed when you
use more than 32 gigabyte of memory and
fortunately we had Rick and Coulson on
the team so he patched things up and
sent them to OTP which I think more or
less took the patches as they were or
wrote their own version at least
nowadays you can use a lot of memory in
a line even in one process so the
takeaway is to avoid pushing deeply
shared terms to other processes because
then sharing is expanded unless you use
as Costas and his friends version that's
not out there is it is it in r19 it's in
our nineteen
you have to turn it on okay so the
solution nowadays is dude so you might
you might you might notice a little
tinge of performance loss no one has
really seen it but you might so
therefore it's not turned on by default
but there is actually fix that does not
expand sharing when sending messages
thanks to Costas and some other
developers because yes and and also
don't crash when you hand charge terms
unless you have turned this switch on
and also be careful than pushing a
system to places where a line has not
gone before don't do it in live systems
try it out someplace first what saved us
here was of course monitoring memory
usage and logging the process IDs for
almost everything happening in the
system so we could easily find the
problem in this case yeah so there in in
that case we actually had memory in the
system but one day we ran out of memory
so we had probably one terabyte of
memory in the machine also at that time
we did have monitoring in place and we
could see which process did this we did
have logs we could see what the process
did it compared to sets sorry the
complexity of complexity in the last one
no the current one the memory we're out
of memory yes so that's usually a
problem I don't know sorry
the problem was that we ran out of
memory good yeah okay so we had a
function that compared two sets so a bit
simplified it tried to see if one set of
name another set of names like if I'm
Eric Neil stayin man I say in my when I
fill out my form but my full name is
actually mr. Neil see Eric Norton stayin
man it has to see whether these two sets
are the same in some way so basically it
did this by permuting the names that he
tried to match with the names that were
okay
so some of you can see where this is
going so when you promote a list you get
an faculty different lists of four five
names like most people have or something
like that it's not a big from you have
120 lists but you compare of course with
five names in the solution list also and
you get 14,000 combination okay if you
have seven names you suddenly get up to
25 million combinations and if you're
some finished person
with 12 names you get 2.3 to the power
of 10 to power 17 which I don't really
know what it's called it's like 230
quintillions or something like that as
what yes so just know your algorithms
and don't permute so they I simplify the
problem and this the solution a bit here
there were some details that actually
made that make a permutation a good idea
at some point but imagine what would
have happen if someone would type in
their name with a space between each
character yeah so the takeaway is no
your algorithm and don't do permutation
and if if you really really have to get
every permutation then do it lazily in
some way don't generate everything in
advance and if you're going to compare
one permutation with the set you don't
need to permeate both sets but that's
just that's just a little bit a little
drop in the sea of data so I'm not going
to give you a real story on this one I'm
just going to tell you that this is the
way it is
so domain-specific languages is not for
your own domain don't make up your own
domain-specific language I know I know
it's fun I do it all the time myself but
don't do it so the the thing and and
really that the whole point of this
whole talk is that you've write your
program once and then it's going to run
for years
and it's going to be read thousand of
times of poor people that have to try to
keep it alive and they would really
really like to understand your program
and when you make up your own language
and use your own language then someone
who comes and wants to understand your
code has to first learn your language
and that is not a good thing so there
are some languages that make this very
simple like Scala which I worked on
actually making sure that Scala got out
in the world and Scala 1.0 and we had
this fantastic feature where you could
define your own operators and and you
could oh I loved it I've made all these
little nice languages for everything
which no one else of course could read
because it would first have to
understand your language Alex here also
makes it easy I love Alex here use Alex
here but do not start writing your own
languages in Alex here in a line you can
of course do this with parse transforms
for example don't do it
so there there there are few places I'll
come to that later when you actually can
do it but most of things so so yeah when
you write your comments you write them
in English because that's why people
most people can understand it's it's the
the code is in Erlang and the comments
are in English so you can understand it
that's why you do it that's why you keep
to one language you don't invent your
own language for your comments either
that would be silly another fact
don't use callbacks because it makes
code harder to read so this first
example there I actually wrote just the
other week least existing atom binary -
list of a binary calling type and of
course a few days later my colleague had
to understand this actually he had
realised that there was a new function
in the callback interface of a called
type which he couldn't really see so
that
not read all the Seabee where you get a
callback module as an argument and a
function as an argument and arguments as
arguments this gets really confusing
when you try to read what does this
function do you have no idea it it calls
something with some arguments you will
be very happy when you read that code
and don't use macros either so this is
also code that I wrote at some time I
needed to insert timers at the start of
some operations so I just defined these
proper Franklin used macros because I
wanted to have the line numbers correct
when things happened in the log macros
and it was very nice I could save a lot
of lines of code at the end there when I
wrote the new page PDF that just called
wrapper one and export just called
wrapper one again and so on very easy
but writing it out it's not much more
code to write and now you can actually
read the code and see what it does so
that's basically it be direct be
explicit and I don't mean in rude sense
but in your code when you write it try
to avoid these kind of abstractions
which will hide the meaning of your code
from the poor reader of your code
logging you should use everywhere and
tag everything so what we did with we
tagged all the log messages with the
process identifier but also you want to
if you have some kind of transaction or
something that it's reading to your
system you should invent some unique tag
again again same thingy the ref and the
thing that can follow your code through
and log it with it so you can find out
which message is corrected to the log
don't invent your own syntax your own
language but there are some places where
you can actually embed other languages
in your language and that is when there
is a well known other language like JSON
for example so when jason is well-known
enough so that if someone have to
understand JSON code he can read books
about it and actually learn how to read
yes and codes so you could embed JSON
into your Allen code when you need to
generate Jason structures or the for the
match specification and these kind of
things you can invite your own syntax
when it well enough used not for your
own things and of course it's very hard
to avoid fallback see if you want to I
have a system that can be configured in
some ways but the first thing to do is
of course use behaviors so there are
some new nice syntax and ways of doing
behaviors in a line where you can
actually type them also at the same time
so you can have this game behavior with
the init action get state and type
functions and then you can use this in a
implementation of this callback you when
you use this you can actually also make
an explicit module for all the calls so
you don't have to see this M :
F orgs in your code but you can actually
call the function call game with the
function in it and send a module as an
argument and it will be much more
explicit what's happening and you can
also if you have to do something with
the module for example it comes from a
database and is a binary then you can
explicitly in that code unwrap it to
binary static existing atom and then you
will have instead of list existing at
the binary list B colon type you just
see call game B type B so you see that
you're calling the game callback module
B calling the function type and you're
doing it with some binary that you got
from somewhere but it which will
actually be the module so final takeaway
is from xkcd as almost always this is a
thing where we now in in our company not
the company that had these all these big
problems but this little small company
where we just have fun happy hacking or
happy studios we just have to say pass
me the salt and let me know that we have
to actually do some work and write some
so all the real problem so this is can
you pass me soul then 20 minutes later I
said I know I'm developing a system to
pass you arbitrary condom monuments
councillor well it's been 20 minutes
it'll save time in the long run and if
you hover over this he says I find that
when someone's taking time to do
something right in the present they're a
perfectionist with no ability to
prioritize whereas when someone took the
time to do something right at the past
their master of artisan of great
foresight so that's the way it is but
you will always have to do it right now
and not just patch the size of the array
to make it load
so the big takeaway is that when your
system crash the first symptom that you
find it's just the tip of the iceberg
and then someone will spend nights and
days and nights and more nights usually
hunting down the real cause of the
problem and if you have written readable
code it will go so much faster so please
write readable code for the poor system
maintain nurse thank you any questions
Simon yes it's herbal yeah exactly well
so at some point it's obvious what it
does when it becomes good enough you
just have to use your fingertip feel a
few finger drop chance lie in Swedish I
think it's German in English but yeah so
yeah I always used to like all these
higher-order functions and so on
but it doesn't make the code more
readable in most cases so it's sometimes
a pain so what's a DSL it's just a
library right it's just a library of
functions that you can call like any
other library functions you can call so
when when you're saying don't use DSL so
you saying don't use libraries no so the
thing is when you write your own
language invent your own language and
you write your own syntax inside another
language so suddenly in your airline
program you're starting using your own
language well you mean you mean you had
syntax which you're going to pause and
come
and everything yeah you're not talking
about a DSL in the sense of an embedded
- made specific language no so they're
really embedded so that suddenly in the
