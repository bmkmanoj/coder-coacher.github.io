reburn all right so yeah I'm Tristan
slaughter and it's weird having the
speaker right there this talk is make
rebar great again but obviously make we
can't have so I don't know a better word
you can't then make for this just have
to cross it out and say well rebar three
rebar again great again yeah sure so in
this talk because because uh last year
we gave a talk which introduced rebar
three and our direction and how where
we've gotten so far and in this talk
what I'm what I'd like to do is
introduce some of the changes since that
last talk as well as how you will
actually move from rebar to to rebuy 3
because it's not fully competitive not a
backwards compatible tool you almost
have to think of it as a completely new
tool that happens to use your rebar dot
config and I should ask from the
beginning if people can ask questions
the whole time please raise your hand or
shout out I don't want to talk for 40
minutes just talking if you have
questions because there are a lot of
confusing bids about changing from rebar
to to rebar three and it's really great
to have more of a conversation about it
so I don't just because I didn't i mean
i've been using this for a couple years
so a lot of these things are very quick
for me yeah
oh the question is am I going to be
addressing switching from early mkay and
I am NOT there's not much to say there
it's because it's a completely different
tool that it's understandable you have
to learn the new one or with going from
rebar to to rebar 3 a lot of people
expect certain things to be the same and
they're completely different and that's
where more that confusion comes in oh
yeah that kind of comes into this slide
addresses that a little bit so we just
had our first stable release yesterday
three-point oh and that means of course
they're still bugs but we're planning
for future backwards compatibility so
you're not going to you won't experience
completely different behavior like if
you've been using the alphas and the
betas between versions and we've moved
to the Erlang OTP organization on github
whoo which is maybe an answer to the
question of why rebar 3 / link make is
it's becoming the official build tool of
early and so this is the first step
because it's the easiest we just move
who owns the repo the hard part is
getting it into the OTP releases which
is coming hopefully as kind of talked
about this this morning in 20 in OTP 20
will have rebar three actually bundled
and you won't have to do any extra steps
in order to start building complex
Erlang applications and releases with
rebar 3
and along with that I'd like to start
with with just there's been large
adoption already we only had our first
official stable release yesterday but
companies and people have been moving
over for quite a while and successfully
there is some hard work which is what
the second half of my talk is about but
it it works it's successful people have
used it and I really that's my favorite
slide in here because why rebar 3 that's
the question I get a lot when people
find the incompatibility so it's always
important to start with before telling
you why you have to change all kinds of
stuff and your rebar config and the way
you develop because why do I have to
change anything why didn't you keep
backwards compatibility why are you
making my life harder I'm trying to
making your life harder for a couple
days and then hopefully easier for the
rest of your days is the goal we'll see
and a number of issues rebar to head
that we set out to solve an initial one
is repeatability and that's been a long
problem of not having lock files not
having deterministic build dependency
trees and that comes into play later a
lot where people are used to being able
to change anything they want and rebar
to still build it and use it and run it
and we are very strict on making sure
that you can't shoot yourself in the
foot by making a bunch of changes
publishing something and somebody else
pulling it down and since they're not
using your your exact machine it doesn't
work which makes no sense that just not
helpful
along with that we have packages we
wanted to introduce real package
management instead of having get repos
for everything that is something that
obviously could have just been put on
top of rebar too but I don't think it's
necessarily worth it when you don't
include the other pieces of rebar three
that we've introduced like deterministic
building and rebar two had a nice
problem of the dependency solution how
pollution where I'm sure we've all
experienced it that you and you include
some get package get repo and it starts
installing mech Andy down and all these
other dependencies and you're thinking
I'm not building the docks for this repo
I'm not testing this package I'm testing
my own thing why why are these all being
included we got rid of that with
profiles so that only when tests are
being a run do your projects test
dependencies need to be installed and
related to repeatability is rebar to had
some simply fundamentally broken
features that were not going to be easy
to fix if we kept the same rebar tooth
structure well what rebar to does is it
steps through the tree of your
application and your dependencies and
says I'm here what do i do go to the
next directory I'm here what do I do and
update that's had a big problem with
that because you could actually get
different results depending on what DEP
you are updating and are you laughing
update depp's and it's a common thing
that most people just say everybody
knows you just remove dash RF depths and
run it began diff if you want to update
a depth
you have to blow everything away and
reget everything otherwise you have no
idea what you're going to get and that
goes along with recursive commands which
update that that's one of the reasons it
was broken is rebar to essentially
worked like a make and that it would
recurse through your directories and
that didn't make sense when you have
Erlang OTP because OTP has a strict
structure and so we can detect what apps
are there and what to do for them we
don't need to assume that things are
spread out over the filesystem
willy-nilly okay so before getting into
how to upgrade I should I'm going to
talk about what's new since the last
time we gave our talk and one of my
favorites is dialyzer has come to the
21st century and now has colors and this
is actually really useful with dialyzer
because you can see right away where
it's telling you the mismatches are
instead of just having a blob I mean
obviously it's not the easiest to read
from from your vantage point but you get
right away in red and green the
incompatibilities and it makes it a lot
quicker to read through your dialyzer
output and figure out what is wrong
he unit why not do it too we included
Sean's a unit for matter by default
obviously you can turn it off but by
default instead of having to include a
secondary thing to make a unit pretty if
by default will output your error
messages and a nice formatted way to say
I expected this I got this and give you
just a nice green dots if it passes so
you don't have to see a whole bunch a
output when all you want to know is all
my tests pass common test how can you
possibly make that pretty there's also
one of my favorites allowed dialyzer of
simply printing the test case the suite
in the test case inside the suite and in
okay if it passes and if it fails we do
the same formatting if you were using
unit asserts in your common test it will
format it to give you a proper error
message of what expected what it got
instead of just mismatch and all that
stuff
yes directly into common test and a unit
yep I mean that's sort of the great
thing about us working together to get
rebar 3n OTP is we hopefully will avoid
that future by coordinating and having
these actually included so this was you
know these tools existed people wanted
these features let's bundle them in and
see where we go and now working with the
OTP team hopefully we won't end up into
the future where now your tests just put
out gibberish because the format changed
and we can't handle it so yet we have
another number of new plugins since the
last time we spoke back then we said
just use make if you wanted oh no
especially not right now we're not being
included in OT p them what when you
aren't details haven't been worked out
yet first
yes yes they will be tested together so
OTP using rebars will be tested together
when releases are made a seat compiler
plug-in was added same configuration as
rebar to which makes a lot easier for
people moving over you simply include
the c compiler plugin and it works the
same as you'd expect as long as you hook
it which I'll show in the converting to
rebar three slides cuttlefish is so
cuttlefish is an interesting one this
plug-in purpose isn't simply to make
cuttlefish work with rebar 3 but to make
cuttlefish something that you just
simply add right away to your release
and it works no yeah Oh No so instead of
writing so people who have done releases
you know you have your app or sis config
and you have your vm gorgs and those are
the first sista config app.config is our
lang terms which is fine for us but when
you're you know releasing react to non
Erlang developers they don't want to
open up our long-term file and start
editing it they would like a simple line
equals what value you want to set for
that configuration much more
user-friendly configurations as well as
it includes types and translators and it
verifies that what you've set like if
you say that this configuration type
this configuration key has to be a
integer and someone puts a string you'll
get a user
warning instead of early and crash dump
and but there was problems with it of
usability even from an early developer
standpoint and if you used node package
from bash 04 building releases and
packaging them into Debian or rpms you
you you would get a lot of usability out
of that but anything else it was
problematic it was documentation was
tied to rel tool and node package and
relics and rebar 3 it's just it was a
lot of work in the developers side to
start using this when it shouldn't be it
should just be something you should be
able to configure your vm and
application in a user-friendly way
without having to jump through a bunch
of hoops so when the cuttlefish plugin
does is it will auto discover your the
schemas that exist in your project
instead of you having to manually set up
overlays to copy them and it will create
your start script that runs cuttlefish
winning your release is started and it
takes care of all that bundling together
when you create a release or at are and
what we did is added project plugins to
rebar 3 to support this so what it's
able to do as a project plugin is
actually override the release command so
now when releases run because we have
project plugin of cuttlefish release
goes to the cuddlefish plugin which
passes state on to the rest of the
provider the release provider so the
cuttlefish running gets done seamlessly
inside your release and you get the
result without having to touch anything
pretty much except adding your
cuddlefish plugin and we've got many
more new plugins since last time
a quick check which I had to include
what it outputs when a test fails
because that's great of course proper a
pups if you want to generate a pups
Ralph low for actually dealing with a
pups to ral ups to having this whole
synchronized flow of doing deployments
and release generation now I can get to
how you're actually going to if you
haven't done so already moved from rebar
to to rebar three first thing you've got
to do is delete a lot of stuff so you
get rid of your e bin directory we're
not just dumping beams into the current
working directory get rid of your depth
directory both those are going to screw
things up if you leave them it's one of
the common first problems people have
experienced they start running it and
rebar three gets confused obviously
removed rebar and you should only have
to add underscore billed to your ignores
files what we the goal is that
everything that's generated is under
underscore build and that way you have
one thing to exclude and you have one
thing that you can blow away when
everything goes wrong and you need to
start over next you should probably
move some of your debts you probably
have dependencies in your depth lifts
list that don't need to be there they're
not build dependencies the test and the
docs profiles are built in to rebar 3
and so if you run common tests or e unit
it automatically uses the test profile
so it will automatically get neck in
that case in this case it will download
and get neck if you run the e doc
command it will automatically get you
down because it's in the docs dependency
list
so you're going to find everything's a
little different because we got rid of
the top level e bin we got rid of depths
everything's under build and under a
profile you have the build directory a
profile and then for example your
specific application that your building
is under the lib is still under lib the
name of your application even all the
lives including the dependencies in your
application itself live together in this
directory and you don't need to do any
finagling with sub ders and lib ders I
don't even know how those work and rebar
to really if you have apps directory or
a Lib directory where you want to have
multiple applications because we've
based it around the fact we know what an
OTP application structure looks like we
can figure it out for you you don't need
to tell us so if there's an app's
directory that has multiple apps under
it rebar three finds them builds them
and takes care of the rest you don't
have to tell it where they are this is
an important one oh yes
now they're actually like they're
different like their default profile is
dev ours is default they actually still
have a depths directory where they put
all the depths that are fetched so I
mean small things that probably should
have coordinated maybe but didn't him
ended up with a because underscore build
decks have been used a long time in
build tools turned out nearly the same
but different so with repeatability this
is very important people often one
question they ask when they've moved
over to rebuy three I edited one of my
dependencies modules and I'm not seeing
the change when I run it like well yeah
you told rebar three you want dependency
at version 1 point 0 and if you change
something that's not the pendency one
point out so obviously it shouldn't use
that which becomes understandably
frustrated when you're trying to test
changes really quickly you want that but
you want to still preserve repeatability
so we added a checkouts feature which is
simply if there's a directory underscore
checkouts and you can link to or copy an
application into it and if that
application is in your depth list it is
now treated similarly to a project app
as in it's built every time you run
build unlike dependencies which once
they're built they're built it's done
and you get those changes but it's
removed from your lock file and it
includes a specific step in creating the
checkouts directory and linking to the
app to make sure that the developer is
acknowledging that i am breaking
repeatability right now this relies on
being on my machine and i know that i'm
being bad and i will fix it when i'm
done with the changes and published the
check
app and change the version things like
that there's been a number of changes to
unit in CT to make them hopefully more
seamless and more pretty as I showed
earlier and one being you'll notice that
your when you run tests they create a
new profile under the build directory so
you have the default in the test but if
no Earl locks changed nothing is rebuilt
so it's not that you have to rebuild
everything into a new profile it's
simply link to in the default profile
and so we're directory is like dot unit
are gone because we have these tests
profiles you'll want to check your apt I
source especially if you're building
releases or if other people are using
your application to build releases
because they're going to get mad at you
if you don't put your runtime
dependencies in the dot app source file
when they build a release and your
dependencies aren't including the
release it's very annoying which also
surprisingly people started finding
circular dependency problems because we
don't allow that and the dot app file is
partially used to construct the build
order of all the applications and so
circular dependency we can't build it at
that point so make sure ya don't have
those because a number of features have
been moved out into plugins where we did
not want to include them in the core we
want a solid core for building OTP apps
and releases you're likely going to have
to add some plugins and hooks for
example if you were the developer of a
level DB you would add this to the rebar
config file in order to tell it that you
need to use the port compiler PC which
is fetched from hex add another
difference from rebar to is plugins that
is actually the
especially the specifying what
dependency to get not just the name of
it and rebar to you put the plugins in
your depth list and then just the name
employ guns but here that is actually
everything it needs to know in order to
fetch the port compiler plugin the
artifact tells it what is expected to be
built so rebar 3 is able to know if it
successfully built your app we don't we
don't try to do much understanding of
what your project should create except
for the fact of OTP applications because
those we know what that looks like we
know what it's going to look like after
it's been built but outside of that when
you have see you tell us what needs to
exist obviously this could be for
anything artifact is generic that's just
this file needs to be on the file system
after our application is successfully
built and add it to the hook and that's
a typo that should be compiled not
compiler but it'll run the port compiler
before compiling the rest of the
application overrides are if you don't
own the repository the package for what
you want to use but you really want to
use it and you don't want to fork it a
common annoyance both in switching the
rebar three from rebar to where projects
weren't compatible like rebar like a
level d be relied on the port compiler
being part of rebar to or if simply you
ends up wanting to remove a certain
dependency or something else from a
project that you're using and you don't
you end up forking it so we end up with
a whole bunch of forks on github that
are just changes to the rebar config
practically with overrides you're able
to tell rebar use this instead so this
works if you include
I leveldb as a dependency in your
application where the real a level DB
still depends on beam rebar to this will
take care of adding what I showed before
into the build process of a level d be
another fun one is converting the relics
which should be a simpler tool to use
but when you're you've grown old with a
rel tool and you've created your your
life around it it's hard to switch
because it's a very different beast
that's easier to use but when you want
to do something different and you've
already done it in a relative pain to
get back to what you expect to be the
result but this is what you should get
in the end this is an example that
actually is using a cuttlefish as well
as relics relative relics to show how
much simpler even the cuttlefish part is
in the relative example we have to put a
lot more information that should be just
defaults in many cases and we have to
copy all kinds of we have to copy the
cuttlefish escript we have to copy a
node tool we have template out the what
actually start to what the schemas are
and in rebar threes case and relex all
that is handled for you you just have to
tell it the name of your application
assuming all your app files are correct
with the dependencies we have a dev mode
which simply links to the applications
instead of copying them so you can have
a quikr build and whether or not you
want to include Earth's and the overlay
bars are used in
in this case particularly for cuddlefish
because sometimes there's overlays that
have to be replaced in the cuddlefish
configuration but other than that you
don't have to do anything for cuttlefish
to be working and now that you've done
that you can you should publish your
package to hex the plugin for that
should be included in your global list
of plugins or in your plot project
plugins that way if someone depends on
your application they don't get the
rebar 3x plugin and like it's a bill
dependency which makes no sense for if
you're just depending on someone's and
you can get more information on the hex
p.m. website I of course you have to
give a whole lot of thanks to the many
people that made this possible Fred and
Alasdair James and Hines who is going
bald because of rebar 3 he finds all the
bugs and rips his hair out as he finds
the bugs he's one of the best debuggers
I've ever known and of course Erickson
and I ug UG 24 we're getting rebar three
hopefully to the masses by including it
with OTP more questions yes
yeah you tell them to upgrade num I
should have actually now you bring up a
slide that I meant to include and I
didn't I hate that there what people
have done is in rebar config script you
can have it check if rebar 3 or rebar to
is being used and modify the config
based on that hackney is a good example
to look at for how to do that and it's a
bit of a pain but it's a good good thing
to allow people to adopt as their needs
allow it any other questions yeah yes
and it will be easier right now it's not
exactly something you it's not
documented but that's coming yep
you know ready to pastor ed young men
may be a lot of pain and I recently
discovered rivers Rochelle the whole
thing for me my yes right Fred you
Rochelle
anything else we're done thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
