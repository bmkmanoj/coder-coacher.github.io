beef but I don't know much about TCP so
move you it's kind of TCP knowledgeable
here knowing things inside out this p12
some people having implemented TCP
before as a kind of a hobby project that
one okay good but I guess you all have
used TCP hands up who have used TCP okay
you can hardly avoid using TCP it's one
of those kind of protocols that you do
it on a daily basis so this talk will be
about testing an open source air like
tcp/ip stack and the title when I sent
off the talk was performance and testing
but we never got to the performance part
of it yet but so I only talk about the
testing part this is joint work and with
the first of all the writer of this open
source tcp/ip stacks Java pari
a Paris or police from the Spanish
University in a university of a Caronia
he was kind of the originator of this
work then Alistair sitting there got him
that father he open sourced it and a
parallel Apollo network system using
this stack for buildings some stuff and
the picture under there in the boat
that's talking about really really bad
working circumstances so this guy is
sitting in this very small boat in this
horrible place in the world far away
from everything French Polynesia and he
just has to work there on things like
tcp/ip so that so if you can help them
this is the main message of them at if
you can help this poor guy then please
do so right by working on this open
source stack because he really needs
that so then then the guy doing all the
testing and writing this model that's of
course URL from cubic and I may present
it so that's how things work okay tcp/ip
you will use it it's a transaction
control protocol on top of the Internet
Protocol so TCP makes sure that the
package you sent over the Internet are
reliable that there's a sequence number
that if they are arriving in the
different order then you actually
would expect they put them in or again
such that you can experience the
Internet as a consistent thing that is
reliable that's the whole idea of it
there's some error checking some parity
stuff all that kind of things just to
make the packets that arrive to your
computer work at this suit so this is
normally done and did this the kind of
kernel of your operating system if you
use you a UNIX version or Linux version
there's a TCP stack in the kernel that's
a TCP stack in Microsoft and it's TCP
stack in any other esoteric kind of
operating system because those things
have to talk to each other so not many
people will implement their own tcp/ip
implementation because why would you do
so you always have one already
and that's probably more faster and more
complete than the one you have yourself
so that's why it's not as if people at
university start to do that and it was
actually for the purpose of doing that
but now we have an open source airlin
implemented tcp/ip stack suits
completely natively airline and the good
thing is that it's highly concurrent
let's make in order to kind of
experiment with lots of concurrency who
use this stack but also and it's user
level stack so you can actually change
that stack and that's kind of cool you
can do all kind of things you can use it
for inserting strange packets into your
network or use it to hack yourself into
systems that are not that well secured
and things like that so that's very very
good to use that kind of implementations
you can use it yourself and you can
contribute to it it doesn't have many
features so it is kind of plain TCP and
PC TCP has over the years got lots of
additions and features and there's no
Bowl implemented but feel free to do so
so our goal now was to use that well
internal networks wants to use this
these be IP stack for products and we're
asking us to test it to this great check
and then the question is okay how do you
test to check just the thing well how
does it look like this is how it looks
like it's actually just stating you're
all very familiar of state machines I
guess have you state machines okay yep
you have all seen state machines before
so state machines are very nice where
you specify
how things work and this is the state
machine of TCP and it doesn't look that
complex if you look at this the
complexity comes from lots of options in
the packets and things like that
business much more below this is take
the control flow and this picture
actually presents two parts of the TCP
protocol at the same time so you have
your server and your client and the
server normally can start a listen
socket so that's the thing that if you
start your web browser than this onboard
ata there's a listen socket and then
there's the application your browser
that connects to that lesson socket so
what the listen circuits do is waiting
until someone says hey I want to talk to
you and the someone is the browser and
that browser then sends a syn message
sinful synchronized I guess this one
receives that synth message and sends a
thin egg back to to the browser and gets
into the send received state so okay I
got my son received someone wants to
talk to me and that's it I'm just going
to true this this a little bit so this
one is in this is in the sieve state and
then this in sent guy this this browser
says oh I got my syn ACK from here I
acknowledge that and I'm an established
and this acknowledgement imagina but
this one and this one is established as
well now you have a connection
now those two can talk to each other
until one of them gets enough of the
other that says ok I terminate the
connection and then they send a final
message they are very polite so the
sender fine it gets a fine if fine thin
message sent an acknowledgement or I got
that then wait to get another fan
message and then says ok I can always
app as well and I'm back again or it
goes that way where it's a bit more
complicated to say hey I want to stop
yes ok I heard you want to stop I want
to stop as well that's it so this is the
protocol there's a group very complex
slide should be testable so how would
the test look like and now we get into
trouble it just looks like calling some
API functions but there are not that
many API function so a typical manually
written test would look like start a
socket and all the way start a listening
process and then well close the socket
again
that's a desk or if you are looking you
can actually also start and a browser
that talks to that listen socket but
that's about it which you can do you are
immediately in established that's my
point so the API is very very limited in
the sense that you have a listen a
connect and a closed of operation
there's not much more there is
nevertheless the protocol looks
difficult enough to think that with
those three operations you probably test
everything but you have to get it in all
the states how do you do that and that's
very unclear how to do that well running
it a lot of times might be the way to do
that but that's not really kind of
satisfactory okay I run a million tests
I might have hit all those kind of
possible states probably not so that's
not very satisfactory so the API is
typically some kind of those API where
you cannot really reach inside state
machine that you want to test so
although this talk is about TCP it holds
for many more systems that is difficult
sometimes to look inside the system and
make sure that you have seen all the
difficult states that you cannot reach
directly from your IP I the other thing
is that there might be some race
conditions occurring that absolutely
need testing race conditions are
typically the things that you you might
see here although you might not see them
in practice you they may pop up now on
them and there's also other things that
may have been message loss some some
kind of acknowledged bases may get lost
and never arrive this the protocol still
can't behave correctly with the timeouts
and things like that so you need a lot
of testing for this one of those things
that may may happen is that both connect
both sides want to close the connection
at the same time this could happen what
both want to close at the center how is
this handled can we can test that they
close at the same time to get the
acknowledgement and then actually they
they go to this back to the state that
we're in that's not very easy to provoke
so if things are really really difficult
in testing or if they're really really
that modest the kind of industry best
practice of solving that hard to test
systems how are they tested on what what
does the approach
and that's one thing ship it
don't write tests because it's very hard
don't bother doing it right so that's
the kind of the normal way of doing and
that's completely in our philosophy as
well if something is very very hard to
do like writing tests don't do it we go
one step further we say well if you
don't write this we want to generate
them right
so we generate the test and that's
that's what what great check is kind of
doing for us so we generate tests from
the specification and it's best case
you've seen this is the state machine
and we want to generate automatically
tests that go through all the possible
states in that state machine and for
that we need a kind of the tool and that
tool is quick check and if you present
it many many times with probably not all
of you have seen it so we'll get a
little demo here on how that works okay
and then I will go back to tcp/ip to
show how it could work in that place so
let's look at a very simple example that
most of you will have seen that's the
process registry process registrations
are not process ready a process
registration in Ellen who is not
familiar with the process registration
in airline one okay so further stages as
follows you have lots of different
processes you spawn a process and then
you can gift that process in name and
the next time you want to send a message
to the process you can use the name of
the process to send a message to that's
the whole idea of the process
registration so there's three basically
API calls that you can do you can
register a certain process identifier
under a certain name which should be an
atom or you can ask where is this at
them and you get the process identifier
back Anika sent a message to that so
that I so it's a kind of global global
in the note you are store for process
names and then there's also an
unregister but they will not show in the
demo how we do the unregistered just
want to focus on the register and the
where is just to show you how others
would look like if you want to test that
API so you can imagine that if you have
three calls in your operation or even
two calls you can have lots in different
combinations of test cases so if you
want to test the registration you have
to write test cases where register and
where is
are occurring in all kind of ways so and
I think I can now jump to that demo so
the kind of test cases I want to
generate are those here's an example of
a test case that I want to generate this
is one test case right I spawn a few
processes and they are this is this you
should read like this is a symbolic
representation of a test case it's a
call to the register Equus e spawn
function and it is bound to the variable
one and the real of this spawn found to
variable 2 and the result of this spawn
is bound to variable 3 and then they can
do a register or where is actually where
is a and I can do a register of variable
1 under the name D and the register of
variable 3 under the name a so this this
process and that process are now
registered all right and this is a DES
case and you can see it's kind of a
bulky test case and it's automatically
generated they can do a few more so
let's show you how to do that I call my
mind model and say give me some tests
and then I I generated 10 different test
cases here that are all completely
different some of them are shorter some
of them are longer and they all have
this various and register India so now
you probably wonder what is needed to
generate those test cases now can we run
them first I will show you what is
needed what is needed it's a state
machine specification you have to
specify how you can make your test cases
and that state machine is specified here
so you have some some headers where you
introduce your state machine formalism
and then there is a state so my model
has a certain State telling me what I
think the system state of their moment
is and in my state I keep track of all
the process identifies I have spawned
and all the registered processes I know
there might be more but that I know of
and then I have kind of fixed set of
names that they can give to processes I
call my processes ABCD all right I could
have chosen other names I could have
chosen more names
I could have chose the very strange
names nowadays I can choose Unicode name
so I just fantastic to try that as well
we did so that you can do all that kind
of things but I won't have a
simple possibility that the names kind
of are the same so that's why I choose
only four names because in a long test
case you will then use the name several
times properly and that's when the test
case is really interesting so then I
have to have data generators for
reproducing some random data and I have
a named generator the chancel give me a
random name out of this set
I give me a random bit which is taken
from the bits in the state a random
number so that's all and initially my
state is empty as you can see in the
last two lines here scrolling up now so
initially my state is empty so now I'm
going to fill my state by creating test
cases so each tests a test case is a
number of API calls for each API call
that I want in my test I need to specify
something so here I specified for the
spawn command I specify what are the
random arguments when calling a spawn
function there are no random arguments
find what is the spawn function doing
what it's called among spawn and a seed
for five seconds five seconds is
eternity in the large of the test case
no test case will run for five seconds
it has to make it extremely long to run
it for five seconds so did guess I will
survive my test case and then nice will
silently die so they don't have to clean
up and kill all the processes so that's
fine
the next stage now it's important now
I'm going to update the state of my
system
I add the process identify that I just
created
to the state of my system and that's in
the next state function spaces how that
works you specify step by step what the
thing is doing for the register
I have something similar can make it
slightly bigger since I see it in the
back I have two random inputs I choose a
random name and the random process of
that and I design for the state but now
I have preconditions telling me that
well the states the should be process is
in the state otherwise the precondition
doesn't hold so I should take something
that exists otherwise has a meaningless
test case and above all the name should
not be already registered because I know
that if I register two processes two
different process the same name then
things are going to blow up so that
should not happen in this
okay so there's a precondition saying
those the name should not already have
been registered then I can do this
that may make sure that they're less
test case is generated and test cases
with the same name registering twice or
not generated then I have the actual
call to L and register and then the next
state is that I update my internal state
database the name and the bit that I
have just registered that's all I have
to do so now if my register which was
slightly more complex than this form
because I have a precondition on it you
cannot just do it whenever you want and
then there's a where is and the where it
has a random argument which I randomly
generate from the name and then I have
the air language at the function at that
call and I have no next state function
because where it should not change the
state of my system hopefully right but
there's no next state function but
there's a post condition if the name is
actually registered then there should be
get the bid back otherwise I should get
undefined back that's my post condition
all the function various the register
function did not have a post condition
if you look into the specification the
register function just returns true okay
so there is no post condition needed
them with this kind of little state
machine because this is a state machine
updating the state I can generate the
test cases that you've seen on the
screen so you get those kind of tests
generate so that's nice oh now I have to
execute those and then see that the post
conditions actually hold and that's what
it's done in the property that's why it
does also go property based testing so
here I had two function tests which
gives me the test it's just a sample of
the commands that they can generate I
can use the same commands block to
generate say for all the commands that
they can generate if I clean up the
system first because I have to kind of
unregister everything that's there if I
make sure I have a clean up system I run
the commands then the result of the
commands should be okay and if not a
practical into commands in a nice way so
that's the whole state machine that I
need for this gives me those test cases
and now I can also run those test cases
so I call quick check and with the name
of the property
with the property so I this is on the
bottom of the screen I can probably get
up higher up yep
so I run quick check with this pistol
better yes that looks better with the
property as an argument so now it's just
running all those tests that I generate
and will by default generate a hundred
tests poof something went wrong
something went wrong a computer disk
test case where race is born another
where is another spawn two registers and
a spawn and that didn't work okay that
task has failed
why well here we see what is actually
happening when I'm general executed in
this test case I asked where is C and
the system says oh that's undefined
that's fine line isn't fun it didn't
never defined it we spawned the process
we asked where B was B was also
undefined we spawned another process
then we registered this process under
the name D and we registered the next
process under the name C and then said
Allan Bedard oh sorry we read it the
same process with a different name yeah
now this is a very reasonable thing to
debug because it's a relatively short
sequence but you can imagine it in real
life if there's very very long sequences
and then it's getting harder to debug so
what quick check does for you after that
it reports that this best case went
wrong
etc something happened it starts
shrinking the test case that you see
here shrinking so it takes that fast
case it's symbolic you can just throw
away things from the test guys and see
if a smaller test case also fails and it
does that automatically so you get off
the number of times you get actually the
minimum test case for this error saying
I spawn a process and then I registered
that process under two different names
and here you see it in reality so it
automatically gets you to the smallest
test case which is nice if you have to
do debugging because if you have 150
commands you have to do the debugging
then it takes you some fun that you can
spend much better with your family
so this is what you would you get from
quick check and this is what we were use
in testing tcp/ip questions about this
part so we make a state machine in our
lung like language that state machine is
used to generate automatically all kind
of test cases that should be valid and
then we run that I could just let me see
yes I could actually fix the book and
then you can see that the book and the
model in this case because what I did as
I register two processes under the same
name
yeah exactly so how do we fix that guys
so now we want to update a model so yeah
I'll write with a book about this case
you cannot have aliases for one process
all right if yet the same process cannot
have two different names that's correct
so we filter out that kind of testing we
don't generate test cases where we where
we do this so we write here some air
lung and also so you don't want the pit
to already be in the register processes
so I have this tuple in my state with
the name and the process and if the
process is already registered I don't
want to write it again on the different
name
yeah so that Clause I add here so now I
have added that then have to recompile
my module well stop it where did I get
that let's go thank you thank you yep so
I recompile and I do a recheck or a
check so instead of click check or
uncheck hope this still works yes it
works and it now says ok this was the
smallest test case that you had before I
guess whatever little bit wait just a
second I scroll this up so it recompiled
then it is a check is
of a quick check keeping the memory of
the latest failing test case and says
okay this test has failed I executed now
but when I came here the precondition
failed I should never have done this
because you had a precondition excluding
this from happening so is a precondition
for so this testers will not be
generated next time so now let's just
generate new test cases down so here we
are and now I passed a hundred and one
tests for slightly faster than
anticipated so it took one more so
another one test is executed for another
one sequences of all kind of calls to
spawn register and various and that's
done and you see it's pretty fast if it
doesn't fail then you put in your post
condition the precondition you put on
the opposed to say by the way you may do
an exception in this case and they you
have to catch the register as well yes
that's just a kind of shift of thinking
then you put the opposed Commission yeah
okay so that's how this this quick check
works back to the slides
so we need to test all kind of different
scenarios in TCP we have this complex
state machine we need to test all the
different scenarios but as you probably
notice that the API doesn't really steer
the scenarios because the API is too
limited to actually get everywhere and
we had this race condition problem so we
both use great check to generate test
cases but we also use pulse and pulse is
part of the quick check package which as
well you can also generate random
schedules world schedules but random to
test for concurrency errors and we take
full control over the scheduler when we
do so so that it's reproducible to run
such a random schedule but that's so
that's also something we use so the
traditional kind of quick check approach
if you can talk about traditional quick
check approach off a 10 year in business
then the traditional quick check
proposed would be okay let's take the
destined here you have your quick check
model of the TCP stack there's this
state machine model which generates test
cases that both send something to your
normal IP stack going all the way down
coming to your TCP stack that you want
to test and send something up and before
you probably send something you sent a
message here saying hey I expect this
TCP stack to come up with this message
all you say well by the way send
something to the TCP stack here then it
is actually sent down here and then it
gets up here gets up there you you
compare it so you compare basically the
model fire real IP stack because you
don't want to encode all the ethernet
frames all that stuff and you decode all
the internet frames etc and then you
come back up here that's the kind of
more traditional process also how you
would normally test your TCP stack
against some kind of Linux textures as
well test it you say oh we do the same
just try try to do all that and that's
kind of system level testing almost
right because it's very good for finding
for doing this on system level you have
the whole stack with all the IP and the
packaging and the encoding and decoding
in that test case so it's very good for
finding incompatibilities but it's not
so good for
keeping those special cases that you
want to hit so it's not very good for
for kind of fault injection because you
can't really fault in Jekyll you can
because then you have to open this
Internet frame and then you have to do
some things there from from quick
chickens tear that so that's a bit
tricky so we don't want to do it in that
way and if you look at the state machine
then we'll be clear how we handle that
so this is a state machine again so how
did we make a state machine for tcp/ip
and the state machine if you can't read
it now or don't catch up all the time
it's in the gizzard processes that I
will show in a moment alright so you can
you can read a bowl of later on so how
do we make the state machine well we
have they have one kind of operation
here a passive open making a listen and
socket so let's put that into a state
machine so what the state machine look
like it has some arguments and the
support you always create on a random
board you start a listener the support
number there's a precondition that the
poor should not being used because you
cannot have two listeners on the same
port on same IP address
listening to the port is calling the
actual implementation TCP connect listen
a user listen that's my actual
implementations that's what I should do
and then as a next state function adding
this to the state where I say well the
state has an IP number it has a port
number it has a socket that it got back
from from this listen thing you get a
socket back basically so I put that
socket in my state and then my next
state here well I add this to them to
the new socket so I haven't ever created
a socket by doing this that's my
specification of the listing now what's
the next thing you could do well you
could write a specification of is opened
but as soon as you do that like if your
writers of open then it's starting and
sending a sent and then this will
immediately go here and send us an ACK
and you really go here you are and
established and the problem is if you do
that you will never be sure that you can
stay there and tune the system so you
can you cannot kind of test closing it
in the syn received unless you try to
enforce that with an exit
exactly the right time or whatsoever
very hard to do so that you can't do so
it's that we use the following approach
which I don't know let's take full
control over this can be return of
having eight API to receive the same
message here that would be nice so if we
can do that in our state machine then we
can steer very very carefully so that's
that's what we do here we have a sin
precondition that we have to have a
socket and then we have a random
argument that someone in the network is
sending us the same message and now I
don't care about whether that really
exists or not but someone is sending us
a sin message all right so that's what
is happening here I generate a sin
message and then when I do the real sin
I get a has a TCP received here in the
bottom that's actually executed and
that's part of that package that we that
we test so there is a received module
that receives IP numbers and that's the
one that we actually call when we go to
receive message a basis the same message
and the next stay then would be that we
update and say well in the next state we
are in sin received and we wait for the
next thing but what about the sending it
how can we test that we actually also
sent as soon as we receive the message
because that's what the implementation
has to we should not send it as soon as
we received this message that should
send a message all right now we'll come
into mocking you want to mock this
behavior okay so how do we do that
mocking well we designed a special
language for describing the mocking
behavior because mocking is not as
simple in randomly generated tests as in
kind of manually written tests because
in a manual written test you know what's
going to happen so you can echo that but
if the system is generating a test it
also has to generate the mocking and has
to be compatible so this is oops sorry
what happens in the mocking we say there
must be a call out and call out the
system should do something what should
the system do well it should spawn a new
process we should be able to observe
that and get this this new process has a
new ID I've set some some variables
there it gives me a new socket and
I have to see a cent but should be a
cent and I get a packet back and
actually I can expect a packet and I can
check that the packet fulfills certain
criteria that this packet indeed
contains a sin and a neck which is
written here yeah so you can just encode
that in your language and okay this is a
bit of too much code to just throw at
you but the main point here is that this
code is with some kind of training
readable as well looks almost like
airline code and this is understandable
if you know the specification so you can
map this one immediately to the
specifications you can say oh this is
indeed implementing this back you
actually are waiting for syn/ack here
and you're actually forming a socket
here and that's what's happening here so
you can manually inspect that you
implemented this back in the right way
so the quick check model is a
specification of that diagram so that's
what we did we wrote a specification of
that diagram and we automatically
generate test to whether to see whether
this air anticipate follows the
specification the electric models rather
general so we can use this for any TCP
stack in principle where we have deals
cana api function set that we need but
we can also fault inject in any possible
place and that's very useful so we can
really kind not send this in or we can
close it at space state is where we
could hardly close it before and we get
that of course and then we found a
number of errors so the work was divided
as follows we at cubic would do the
testing and oh telnet
hotel solar networks would then fix the
bugs and that's I think you need to kind
of separation because whenever we
propose the bug fix and Rick came back
then I would do it differently
and he's a TCP expert so better let him
do the different fix them we were kind
of taking some shortcuts there we
probably would be best for performance
or other things so he fixes the books we
test and one of the books we found after
shrinking was nice kind of race
condition and the nice way of
using pulse for this is you run your
your system under a schedule that you
provide and then it springs it shrinks
also the schedule to the minimum number
of complex which is needed so the number
the error we found was we start a lesson
set for the process we sin we get a syn
ack back we sent an ACK and then the
system Hanks and only one out of 100,000
times it's actually hanging there if you
do not run as the stall so the suppose
you can you can reproduce that so that
dam goes to the poor guy in the Pacific
Ocean in his boat and says look this
problem and he's sitting there with this
kind of little network inside the boat
and filling out and writing some new
code so that's how we work together
there's a bit of delay because of time
differences as well as kind of satellite
communication but the word fine and then
he fixed this error for example and this
is now in his retro so if you want to
contribute this is this crap oh look in
there and and write your additions to it
he's very happy to to take things into a
stack all the things we found just to
give you a feeling of what you can do
with that is you open a local thing and
then never sending us in at all to the
remote port if you look lovely so that's
also something which happens very very
rarely and which was I don't exactly
know what why it was but it was kind of
very strange to see this have been sold
seldomly
had to do something the packet size I
think would I'd be address matching
exactly something else or whatever when
something is established then you close
at the same time the one that I showed
to the beginning both want to terminate
the connection both sent an
acknowledgment then one of the this is
the local was actually hanging and the
close never returned so he did a close
and it was just stem staying there until
the timer would say hey I tried to close
that they never got there even though
you got an acknowledgment any shooter
close so that is the kind of things we
we pick and we would be able to see that
because of quick check but also because
of the instrumentation with bills
suppose is for standard airline program
so you cannot you can also use for
elixir but it's really kind of connected
to two airline bus we take control over
the airline scheduler we instrument your
code and we are supposed to generate
non-deterministic but random schedules
and we can then rerun the schedule in
the same way as we did before and it
makes it nice to to Frank rest
conditions okay so that stands for a
post content and just simply how this is
dolmas you have your airline program you
compile with the pass transformation and
that instruments all the spawns the
links the center receives and all the
stuff and it will be under control over
of our own scheduler so we control the
concurrency and we switch and we try to
minimize the switching okay
to conclude I'm faster than I have
expected but to conclude this talk then
I can say that using quick check and
pulse have shown to be very effective
and finding those really tricky errors
that you can have in this mega acing in
the system that TCP actually is and what
is up next is that okay there's the
birds that are still left or might be
left there are being fixed by by rickie
and then we do he is working on md5
checksums as one of the additions to the
tcp/ip protocol where you can put a
checksum on the packet which is an
interesting thing to do and we will try
to test that I guess as well and then
you can contribute with your own
extension statistic IP and we hope that
this is the kind of project that keeps a
lot a long time where we can but we can
use as a showcase of how to test complex
state machine software and how to and
what you can use as a nice user level
TCP implementation questions
hi there thank you very interesting talk
regarding polls that sounds very cool is
that open source software oil is that
proprietary let's provide to yourself I
have to write my own one if I or you
just buy it that's fine it depends on
how you value your time I have a second
question that's okay
you mentioned something about you found
a race condition or something where like
one in every hundred thousand you
wouldn't get a sim back and it was
something to do with the packet size or
whatever - the packet size and content
sounds like something you could also
it's randomly yeah is that easily
combined like you've got this one thing
that you've shown us about the state
machines of TCP and presumably another
thing for randomly generating the
content of messages it's in the same
model it's only a few lines where we
randomly generate the content of the TCP
message okay so those combine quite easy
to combine okay great cool thank you
hello question is is quick check used in
higher level testing of systems let's
say more like Web API level or on higher
level protocols is it used that way and
it is feasible to use it so it's the
question is I guess is reduced for
launcher systems as well as just kind of
things that you could probably imagine
to write all the tests for yes it is we
for example we have tested the GAR
software in the Volvo and so the whole
issue level testing so the or not the
whole software but at least part of the
operating system is tested in this way
you can also use it on the top level of
a web service where you just do HTTP
requests and test on that level so you
can choose which level you want to test
it it's actually beneficial sometimes to
be on a higher level if you're not
interested in coding all the details of
what should happen in the bottom react
is another example for example we tested
them
complete system and not on all the
different modules
well they've done more questions I
suggest that we thank the speaker and
remember to provide feedback
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
