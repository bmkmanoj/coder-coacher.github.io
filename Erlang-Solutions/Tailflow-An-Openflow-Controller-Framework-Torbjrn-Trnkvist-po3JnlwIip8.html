the last few months six months old
almost so it's called tail flow when
it's about open flow so I'm working for
Ted life systems company founded in 2005
by some old colleagues of mine from CS
lab former blue two guys they are making
two products called comedy and NCS and I
would mention them briefly because they
are part of the tail flow solution so
number of customers of course big
customers small customers worldwide as
you can see here and it's about network
management so let's see so hopefully you
will learn something I assume that you
don't know anything about these things
otherwise you already know about it so
hopefully you would know you would know
after this talk what Sdn means what it
stands for at least what I think it is
an open flow what's that we're going to
talk about that too and you're going to
learn a bit about modern network
management the tailless way the way to
go not the traditional boring camera
network management so and and finally
hopefully we will be able to see a
little demo perhaps unfortunate that I
sort of broke the whole system the other
day when I restructure the whole system
before before because we have a release
in within a two weeks so I thought I
should redo everything the proper way so
I broke lots and lots of stuff but some
part might might work if we are lucky so
let's see so network management
traditionally that means lots of tedious
work I mean imagine you're working for
an operator you have a customer who
wants another leg in their VPN setup for
example that might mean that you have to
change of some roots in a fire or
perhaps Shh and configuration in a raft
somewhere maybe some other kind of
network device in your network
and if you do something wrong during
that period of changes you have to retry
to retrace your steps back and try to
figure out what would happen and if you
have a lot of customers huge networks
this quickly becomes a huge mess so what
you try to do is to automate stuff
writing scripts tunes things that can
automate lots of of the things that you
don't want to do manually but after a
while to change yes and the tools are
not as good as they should be perhaps
after a while you don't really know what
what what we have out there in my
network what is the current
configuration for example you don't know
what what how does my network look like
really you don't know really and it all
boils down to money of course so that
this whole process is extremely costly
for operators and so this is sort of the
traditional view that tell of course has
solutions for so some an acronym that
has been sort of becoming really hot the
last so now here called software-defined
networking sdn for short so I mean if
you have a large complicated system you
often try to to do to understand it you
have to make up some kind of
abstractions you might divide your
system into a couple of large components
so which sort of logic it's connected in
some way and if you start to zoom in on
what components smaller sub component
appears on with their own interfaces
with in that large component etc so
you've been sort of abstraction levels
to be able to cope with this complexity
so the question is whether you can do
that
with a in a network management situation
we have this large huge network of
thousands of devices of various sorts
heterogenous devices from various kinds
of vendors because if you could build an
abstraction then you could start
applying perhaps soft engineering
practices and techniques and the goal is
to get money if you can introduce the
time to deploy amount you can reduce the
amount of errors when you introduce this
new things or changes things and use in
your network you will see reduces costs
so this sounds fantastic but can it be
done yes it can of course so here's a
very complicated picture that I stole
from some market marketing materials so
I'm going to talk you through it a
little bit here so down here we have
firewalls routers network devices out
there in the network I had possibly very
heterogeneous network if you can
describe one of those devices in some
way with a modern abstract model of that
network device if you can't describe it
with an abstract model then something
you can so the represented also as with
some sort of data structure in your
system and if you have a data structure
then you can start to manipulate it and
do stuff with it and this is how those
products LCS and company they are or
taking advantage of the possibility of
describing devices with an abstract
model and the language used is a
modeling language called yang which is
sort of closely connected to net conf
even though it can be used by its own
language so net conf is an xml-based
protocol which make it makes it possible
for you to operate and configure devices
over the network
ok so this model the abstract model can
be transformed into a XML and can be
passed along using his napkin protocol
to configure and operate this device and
the difference between one of the main
main difference between that confidence
and peace that would not come few can
differ between operational data of
configurable data in SNMP you can't do
that really so this means that you can
both get status operational that out of
the box and you can configure it in a
consistent way using that conf so this
racist abstraction levels something you
can you can start to discuss and you can
analyze what what is the current
configuration of my whole network here
because you have it here status
structures you can start manipulate them
analyze stuff right writing tools for
them etc so this abstraction level can
be taken one level further so using
those device models we can introduce
configuration changes in an atomic way
over several devices in a transactional
manner which is kind of extremely
important because if something goes
wrong when you have done the half of the
sort of devices you want to change we're
configuring some way you can undo the
transaction and undo everything that you
have already done you can get back to
the previous state the previous state
which was hopefully consistent so device
models makes it possible for us to
operate those network devices in a
consistent way
the obstruction next subsection level
that we have introduced is called
service models again we're using yang to
model services so service could be for
example creating a new BPM leg for a
customer and then we could by using some
kind of logic break that services down
into the proper device manipulating
stuff that we need to do so at the end
it comes out as configuration changes
down here in the network so this makes
it possible to actually have this kind
of abstraction level to manage your
network in a consistent way using those
mechanism the models and and both device
models and service models so
see so you're right so to me this is
cannot software-defined networking which
makes it possible to do this abstraction
and to actually programming services in
the network that you are managing now
we're going to talk a bit about open
flow and then we're going to relate that
to us them to see how it fits into us
down so open flow to me if you buy a
firewall or a raft or something you buy
a box pizza box perhaps you have some
hardware and controlling the hardware
you have some kind of software which is
the logic that controls that firewall or
route or whatever it is now without them
open flow that have made it possible to
move that software out of the box so you
can write your own software and they
define this protocol that talks to the
hardware and that's what open flow is
about it describes this protocol talking
to this hardware so this makes it
possible for for for anyone to actually
write their own control logic of the
network device so this was a came out of
some University work I guess they like
to be able to if you're around with
things but it has actually taken on
quite of interest among the industry too
so open flow has been kind of a hot
topic the last few years
so what happens is that this software is
in overflow terms is called controller
open flow controller this Hardware here
is really just a table trying to match
the headers of the incoming packets to
see if any packet matches what you have
specified in your table and if it does
it going to produce a set of actions
which is coupled to that table entry and
in case nothing matches in the table we
have to ask the controller what we're
going to do with this packet and this
controller can instruct a hardware to do
something either send it out to certain
port or rewrite the part of the header
or you're stopped on the floor perhaps
so here's just an example of things that
exist in this table so this is a table
entry where you can you can match
incoming packets on for example what
switchport it came in through the
ingress port Ethernet source address IP
source addresses and lots of other stuff
in the headers of the packets and
connected to this to this table entry
you also have this set of actions and
the actions you can do is sort of sell
this packet out on a certain pork
through the switch you can rewrite any
of those headers into something else you
can implement for example a and network
address translation of firework for
example or you can just drop it so it it
won't get through the switch at all
so basically that's that's that's it
that's what open flow is about so it's
camel not that complicated yeah flow
rules yeah they are described that's not
the language is just a pro ghost best
spec so it sounds sort of messages to
the hardware you can add the installous
rules and modify routes and remove rules
etc they can also of course get lots of
operational data like counters and
things of that yes yep it can be for
that and it can also stay in hardware
and then you would get the reference to
it so so the control we can say that hey
you're gonna sound this package with
this reference out again or some this
packet and also performed actions at the
same time that I want to want you to do
and at the same time you install a rule
so that the na and they package in the
future that matches the same thing won't
enter the controller so so but anyway
when you have this kind of open flow
capable switch I mean it still needs to
be managed you're still going to live in
this network that operators are managing
so you still have to have some kind of
management interface I mean for normal
box here you have a command line
interface Eli or you have SNMP I'm not
coffee etc you're still going to need
that for upper flow application of some
sort you can of course choose where they
only have it on this level or perhaps if
you want also able to manipulate a
hardware straight for management
application
so so SDM versus open flow to me open
flow is just a component of s10 because
of a flu application is just like any
other network device that you need to
manage that means to coexist with all
the other network devices firewater
objects etc and software-defined
networking even though it's found to
program so the important thing to
remember is that it's about programming
networking services you want to be able
to introduce networking services in an
easy way cost beneficial way and
hopefully be these kind of approaches
can tell my soul
so how do I write an open flow
application as I started to look into
the flow reading the specs reading what
other people had done and most of the
examples or all almost all examples stop
that some some very basic simple
learning switch and down you are sort of
on your own and I mean when you start
looking into it you quickly realize that
open flow rules are extremely low level
I mean if you want to write any kind of
application on top of an overflow
hardware you need to do lots of stuff
how do you structure that and also see
inside well I was working for two LF
management is extremely important for us
for us how do you manage that kind of
application so i started to writing
program ethical patch panels broad sort
of load balancers sub trainer line
controlling controlling and mostly i was
using an open V switch which is software
virtual switch which you can install on
your linux system you can replace the
standard Linux bridge with OS as it cool
because open this which is excellent m
and open flow capable switch so you can
have you can create each bridge you
create on us is an open flow switch that
you can control from your software so
it's very very easy way to get into open
flow and start playing around with it so
I wrote lots of those small simple sort
of examples and after a while I started
to think was trying to figure out how to
structure the software in
the way and I started to remember work
which were down sort of for some 20
years ago then when it comes to
communication protocols was at that time
to as kind of a hot research topic
something called micro protocols and oh
preposition go right here so micro
protocols if you look into for example
TSP you can extract various pieces of
TCP and look at them as sort of small
market protocols for example sliding
window could be seen as a microphone
call fragmentation defragmentation and
other stuff and put them together in a
graph and you have your sort of protocol
that was a research topic and both
Cornell and other universities
University of Arizona they did lots of
work so there were system called Horus
at Cornell I think which implemented
frameworks for you to do with the sort
of library of lots of micro protocols
that you could put together to form new
counter protocol stacks and that there's
actually book written about it from from
Mason guys at University of Arizona
nautical computer networks peaches
someday there was something other
authors where the described is x current
so I played around with that for 20
years ago writing stuff in our line so I
thought perhaps perhaps that could be
something that I could use to structure
it to actually write small kind of
pieces of logic that I can combine to
actually build my software application
control them that hardware so if you
look at at the open flow controller from
the open flow controllers point of view
the switches produces a number of events
not that man events a few events where
the most important is when a packet mrs.
the table that has to go to the
controller so you're going to pack it
into the controller then you want to
take some actions you want to do
something with that packet you have to
decide what to do with it so that's an
event that's all yet rated from the
hardware coming into controller other
kinds of events are for example when a
switch connects the first time to their
controller a data path join in this case
or if a flu flow is removed from the
from a table table entries removed from
the hardware then you might want to know
about that so another entry flow remote
empty my Tam to the controller because
each each flow has timer's connected to
them so they both have idle time outs
and hard time outs so they can
automatically be removed by the hardware
so for each of those events emptying the
controller you want to apply some kind
of logic doing something that take some
action on that event coming into the
controller so I came up with this ID
uses something I called flow rates so
flow let's die d was too well instead of
a market protocol I call it flow that's
because I floated consists both of some
kernel code and also some configuration
specified or defined in a young model by
combining those flow lets in a stack you
create the actual software that controls
the open flow switch so in this case for
example we have a learning switch which
also introduces some kind of late to
virtual a2 mechanism so that you can for
example you can have one company right
likely long but but you you you write
your own sort of lay to abstraction air
so the idea is that a packet empties
from the top on the switch stack so a
packet comes into the controller enters
the first floated in this case called a
Mac learner the only thing the Mac Lana
does is to look at the packet and see
what switchport did enter through
and what kind of mac addresses were in a
packet both source Addison and
destination addresses and it stores that
information so if pakka damages through
port one with a certain store service I
store that into a database in the system
and that's everything it does then just
well finish and the packet goes to the
next floated in the image stack in this
case there are prior the our perp liar
it can answers to our requests so you
can buy configurations saying that all
right for this kind of IP address I want
it to work as an our proxy so then you
should also with this ethernet address
preferably the evening address of the
pork perhaps and if it's not an ARP
request then it does nothing so just the
packages goes through the chain to the
l2 filter in this case and the l2 filter
float in this case it adds a number of
rooms so subtly rule engine adding where
you can specify some rules for example
you can specify that a certain amount of
ethernet address s belongs to a certain
virtual net so they should be able to
talk to each other so if you try to send
to someone within that group that's okay
then let the pack it through if not drop
it on the floor and it's not allowed to
go on any further so you introduce your
own virtualization of on a little a two
level if it goes through the LA to
filter flow let you enter up with the
ARP flutter flow it in this case and
what it does is simply too ARP requests
emptying the switch and we don't know
what to do with it so flooded out on all
the ports except ingress port on a
switch so that's the normal way or
ProQuest or spreading through the
network if it's not not request go to
last one and the only thing it does is
to
set up a a path through the switch
because down here we have to know both
where the source ethernet address leaves
on what port we have seen it and also
the destination address because when we
get an ARP request the first time we
sound that you out through all the ports
so reply will enter at some point in
time through another port and we will
store that through the Mac learner so we
will have that information in the mac
database so when we enter the last flow
that we know where the source and
destination address are for the mac
database so we send down a flow rule to
the switch and make a connection from
the ingress portal eager sport through
the switch so this is a sort of learning
switch if you remove this thing it's
just a very basic learning switch so i
implemented that learning switching go
to work i also implemented a simulated
so huge network of racks with with the
computers in come connected with top
iraq switches with aggravating switches
with a knotted firewall at abroad and
they all were simulated with open V
switches and they were all controlled by
this tale flow control that I've had
written and it all worked out very well
so so I continued the work in this with
you see this kind of architecture so the
flow let as i said was consists of an
earlier module and a corresponding yang
module defining what what possible
configuration that flow that can act
upon so the configuration is described
by gang and the earlier modules the
earlier model can control sort of what's
going to happen with their with the
execution through the florid stack by
what it returns
so when it for someone to pack Adeem I'm
just a controller the packet em callback
will be called from the first floated in
the stack and depending on what that
floated returns something's going to
happen so you have three choices in this
case you can say break which means that
don't process this packet through the
stack anymore I'm done or you can say
continue and the packet will traverse
through to the next floated in the stack
or I could jump to another stack so I
can have multiple stacks of flow that's
similar to sort of EP tables we can have
several chains of stuff each flow that
have there there are sort of stateless
in the sense that they have a state but
the state is managed by the controller
the ten flow controller so when you
start the system load the configuration
each floated will be called there in it
callback function will be called so that
they can set up some kind of local state
which is returned and then a ten foot
controller maintains the local state and
threads it through all the cords through
the stack there's also an advanced state
that can actually be threaded through
the stack which is only leaving you in
the balancer so all those flow let's
configuration and all the flow let's tax
they form together something called the
switch logic in the tail of terminology
and that that simply defines the actual
software controlling a particular switch
so the ten flow controller can't can
have lots of switches and each which
will get some software applied all
events depending on how you have set up
the switch slowly for that switch or you
can also do a sort of you can also set
it up to that some default switch load
is applied to all switches if you have
hundreds of learning switches you want
to run the same software and all of
those this
no software side no no that's how it
works so I mean hopefully hopefully you
install a flow rule so the next kind of
similar packet won't end up in a
controller and hopefully you won't have
that much traffic because then you you
you you will be stuffed I mean the
controller can't keep up yeah so I mean
you you can you can write applications
like work like that which are reactive
but you can also think you can have a
proactive case where you have know
exactly how your use of traffic
engineered your network beforehand and
the push down all the rules that is
going to be valid and then you find you
so then in that case you won't expect to
get any packets happening to the control
so I'm going to mention that later on
but I mean openflow won't replace I mean
off-the-shelf firewalls and routers and
stuff just because of this I mean it
makes no sense to get packed up into the
controller like this but for certain
sort of certain problems as we going to
see it fits very well and you can do
stuff which is hard to do with
traditional techniques that you have had
before open flow
so so this is how the telephone system
looks like so it's a controller here
written in our line and it's all so
tightly coupled to the coffee product
because the company product knows about
yang and auto renders from the models of
the flow let's and other kind of yang
models it auto renders a northbound API
with not calm as numpy sea lice and
stuff so that it can be managed as any
other kind of network device or better
than any other continental device so all
these kind of configuration here is
apply depending on the events coming in
so the right kind of software is going
to be around depending on where it comes
from so you can have for example in this
case we have switches apparent a1 a2 who
runs the same kind of switch Lord extent
kind of software so they are always
going to be using this kind of setup
where another box could be one is using
another time another kind of
confirmation so that is that we gonna
release this as a part of the product
portfolio of Taylor pretty soon now the
idea is that customers are going to be
able to write the flawless themself and
the models are going to be able to load
them into the system we will of course
bright lots of flow let's that can be
used sort of the sort of a library
fashion but that is that anyone should
be able to write those kind of float is
to implement whatever kind of
functionality they want to have in their
network
damn
well the actual hardware manufacturers
has been sort of been lagging behind
sort of the specifications this
specification is somewhere here and
they're horrid manufacture is trying to
keep up with some old sort of versions
of the specifications but there are a
couple of manufacturers producing open
flow switches and there are lots of us a
couple of hybrid switches which are sort
of they have added overflow capability
but they're still so older kind of
switches and I'm not sure how well they
really work and how well they will work
on their under heavy load etc I mean as
I said it's not going to scale if you
have a very high traffic volume and you
want to process that through open flow
that won't work but for certain problems
as we will see it is fits very well
ah so this is the realistic scenario so
I was thinking about this a lot the
first the months I was thinking this is
this is this is fun to do but I mean
it's not going to be used for any
serious stuff and that some of the
customers approached us with problems
they had that we thought hey this it's
open flow perfectly so that is that if
you have a number of devices firewalls V
law and accelerators deep packets
inspectors intuition detection whatever
and you have sort of like it so called
bumping the wire devices so that you put
them wiring and run out and then wire
goes out and other and then you some
delay to traffic through and the device
does things for you each are those
devices implemented some kind of service
a firewood service or the lawn
accelerated thingy and you want to babe
it from operators so that he easily can
set up those kind of services and
tailor-made those kind of services
according to what the customer needs or
wants it turns out that apparently this
is kind of hard and quickly becomes kind
of messy to do in a traditional network
there are ways like polly surrounding
acceptor but apparently it's extremely
hard to manage it so but we'd open flow
that's very easy it's very easy to
because it's low almost like you have a
program at will a patch panel you can
easily switch on and turn program that
hardware how flow should go through that
kind of chain off devices that you have
plugged into your switch so here is a
sort of the concept of service chaining
so we have this open flow switch and
into it we have some kind of network
devices connected firewalls deep packet
inspection set cetera the tail flow
controller controls to open flow switch
we have written a certain service
chaining flow late for that who have all
those kind of nice device model both for
the flow lat here and for all those
camel devices we have a service model
force
service training but may be fine so a
customer here might want I only want to
make use of the firewall all right very
easy pounding on what kind of IP range
he comes from you're gonna control over
flow switch set it up so that he only
will empty through the firewall undone
for their own another customer might
want other kind of devices or in a chain
that should first go through the dpac
inspector down the firewall or etc so
then we very easily can program they'll
be closed which do that so this use case
is a valid use case we have customers
who are extremely interested in doing
this and it fits very well into open
flow so we actually wrote a demo that
was shown for a fair unless that's Vegas
for a few months ago I thought I would
be able to show to perhaps we can see a
little bit of it because I I broke it
kind of heavily the other day but
basically we are using open V switch
again and controlling it from tail flow
we have written sort of traffic shapers
and firewalls are very small ones just
22 as a proof of concept all of this up
here is running in a virtual machine
that will set up using very ramped to
make it very easy to to script it and
set it up for people and from outside of
that virtual machine we have just an
ordinary browser so it can go to this
VNC server and the traffic will go
through the switch and go through the
change depending on how we are configure
it and we can change sort of the traffic
limited traffic speed through the shaper
etc and well and it controlled by a sea
of course so so let's see here now
dem turn right so the whole demo was
written by meek lucky luke gory and
Nicholas please stop let's see if you
can find it somewhere
so well you have to trust my lease but
let's see do you see anything I don't
see anything
so what we can see here is this is
something video through this switch so
we can start by looking at it a little
bit and then we can see if we can change
the speed here well we have even sound
you hear it yes fantastic yes I found
board about this music on this video so
let's see if it runs there and then if
we can go to see so now I'm inside its
virtual machine you sit down here I'm
going to win after that the GUI is
broken broken by me unfortunately bad a
very nice gooey but I can't show you
that because it's broken at the moment
so let's see so this is the seal I we
are inside the NCSC line now lots of
Commerce you can do here similar to any
other candidate network device we have
to configure mode we can have a look at
the service services let's see here
right so here's configuration data a
chain which we are called asset let's
use the fine we define sort of where the
key for for this chain is the source
subnet the source VLAN and the desk
subnet that defines what chamber i'm
going to use so those aren't keith and
what's going to happen them is that we
have 22 devices so who's going to around
first to the shaper and downs from the
firewall and we also know what is the
ingress port of the traffic in a switch
port number 6 and also the eager sport
is sport on a fire and elsewhere we have
information about what ports are the
other devices sitting on let's see if
you can't see that
consider it somewhere else right at the
top you can see the fireworks apparently
there it's a bump in a wire thingy
