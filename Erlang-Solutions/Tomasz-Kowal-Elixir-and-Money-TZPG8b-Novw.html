with this meme I found someone on the
internet and it because it really
captures the premise of the stock which
is unlearning the stuff that you've got
wrong because sometimes you have the
pieces of information and you really
need to connect them to form knowledge
and you see the conspiracy theory just
pick the information it needs and lays
out all the rest however sometimes you
just think that you will write about
something because it made sense it's
connected well with everything else and
then you get a new piece of information
and everything falls apart so the first
time I had this is when I was doing
sorry doing the model thinking course on
Coursera and there was a topic about
overbooking flight so now probably
everybody knows about overbooking flight
after the United Airlines thing however
the math behind it is really amazing
because how many people don't get to the
plane follows a standard distribution so
if you have 200 tickets to sell and
usually on average eight people doesn't
show up and the mean is - you can safely
overbook average - two means of places
and you have 95% chance that you will be
alright
and in all those 5% where actually
people show up and there's more people
then place it in the plane you can
simply give them a refund of free flight
nice hotel and you will be still ahead
in terms of money so I wanted to show
that example because this is something
that I assumed about flight if I was
going to make a flight booking
application the first constraint on my
database would be that there can be more
bookings than seeds in the plane however
the financial systems are riddled with
a little misconception so this talk will
be split in two parts the first part is
about properties of business domain that
affects distributive system and my
domain is the financial system and the
second part is why would we choose a
lexer fund for non distributed system
because we ended up with really small
system and basically it's a crude
application so let's kick off with a
little bit of theory and I want to
compare a seat and base system so a seed
stands for atomicity consistency
isolation and durability and this is
something that we usually associate with
SQL databases so there are two important
things for this talk in the definition
the first one is consistency in acid and
it means that any transaction will bring
the database from one valid stage to
another so consistency in acid is about
the set of rules that the data follows
and it can be broken in case you want to
insert to the database something that
doesn't follow this rule you will get an
error the other part of the definition
that is important here is isolation and
there are two definitions of isolation
in acid first one says that concurrent
execution of transactions result in a
system state that would be obtained if
transactions were executed sequentially
and this is a really hard statement
because it means that for all
transactions you need to preserve the
order the second definition says that
transaction will behave as if it is the
only operation being performed upon the
database and this basically means that
we don't have to worry about other stuff
that is in the database so in AC systems
if we have distributed database that is
acid it needs to preserve the order of
transactions we have for example to
write one of them hits the first node
second one hits the other node and if
there is a net split between those two
sharks of the database you can run the
transaction you can't write anything
because those sharp need to communicate
and need to specify which transaction
was first they need to serialize the
data and this gets us to the cap theorem
which says that in distributed systems
and especially in databases there are
three properties there is consistency
availability and partition tolerance and
given that partition tolerance is a fact
of life
it just happens even in local networks
we can only treat consistency for
availability but the consistency in cap
theorem has different definition than
consistency in acid consistency in
capsules that every read receives the
most recent write or an error so there's
a second definition of consistency and
to make matters more complicated there's
a third definition of consistency from
consistency models and in consistency
models you will say that it is a set of
rules that must be followed by
transaction and this is a little bit
vague so it works better on example
there are a couple of models of
consistency the first one is strong
consistency and it corresponds to the
definition from cap theorem it says you
either get a most recent write or an
error however there are other kinds for
example weak consistency means that if
some conditions are met then you will
get a system that is consistent this is
again a little vague so one of one
subset of weak consistency is eventual
consistency where this rule is that if
enough time passes you will get a system
in a consistent state the other subset
is causal consistency so if the parts
are related then you will get the most
recent right and in all other cases you
will get the eventual consistency and
again subset of that is review right
consistency so if you have an agent
writing to the database if that agent
wrote something to the database it will
get the most recent right
and this is easy to implement
if for example for each client you
always hit the same chart so we can see
again an example where we have this time
similar database that it has two charts
and we give it to write and they
immediately succeed so even in case of
net split the first part is written to
the first node the second part is
written to the second node and when the
connectivity between them is again
online they just share the data but they
cannot agree and they usually don't
about the order of transactions and
that's fine for many many cases and
those systems are called basically
available soft state and eventually
consistent so our financial systems that
we are working on a seed or base so at
first I thought they were a seed and
this is because one of the first
assignments in operating system class
was about new taxes and the example was
a little bit like this we want to
transfer money from Alice's account to
Bob's account so we firstly check if
Alice has enough money to transfer the
amount then we calculate what will be
the new amount that Alice will have on
her account then we calculate the new
amount that Bob will have on his account
then we assign the actual computation to
the Alice account but in multi-threaded
system we can be preempted at any time
so let's say our execution stopped in
here and someone just sent Bob 1 million
dollars so Bob is now really rich and
really happy but then the execution
comes back to the first thread and bob
has the value that was computed earlier
assigned so this means that bob is now
really unhappy person
so in the end it's a really cool example
of
where you should introduce mutex in your
system but no one in their right mind
that the stuff in actual financial
systems what we usually do is we create
an immutable set of transactions which
specify an amount and from who to who
the money transferred and the most
popular accounting scheme is double
accounting so you copy this event to
both Alice and Bob's account and in case
of Alice it will subtract money from the
balance in case of Bob it will add this
money so this is totally immutable no
matrix is needed and the problem with
financial systems is that we can't say
if they're a seed or based by principle
because some parts of financial systems
can be a seed and some of them can be
based so for example in case of papers
transactions some banks do it in this
way if you pay amount that it's small
enough like smaller than 10 euros you
just swipe your card and the transaction
is registered immediately so the request
doesn't even come to your bank
it simply registers it for later so if
you for example check your statement
online you won't see this transaction at
all it's it's nowhere to be seen and
after a couple of hours or even the next
day everything gets synchronized and it
works a little bit like with overbooking
because that means that you can get a
negative amount on your account because
those transactions are just sent up
later and in such a situation
someone founds you from the bank saying
that you need to immediately put
something on your account otherwise like
really bad stuff happens of course
that's not the case that nothing bad
happens it's their fault so they can to
do must be about it so this works a
little bit like with
working with trade that the transactions
are really fast
for the possibility that in some edge
cases things might go wrong and I
remember I was giving a talk about
elixir and ell programming languages and
I was explaining that elixir is really
great for those systems that trade
availability for consistency so it's
really cool for those base systems and
elm which is a front-end language it's
really cool for what browser that and
browser does it's usually in one thread
and you can serialize everything and you
get a language that is much less complex
than elixir but you can't do the
distributed stuff easily it's not meant
for that so after the presentation I got
a question through from audience I think
okay so what do you do at crap collect I
was like yeah we're doing a financial
system also you can do that in a league
here and I was all duded baffled but now
I understand that it is because elixir
is marketed as something that is used
for distributed systems but actually you
can totally ignore all those fancy stuff
that Alexia provides you and use it with
all the boring crude applications and it
will work just fine or even better than
popular object-oriented solutions so now
you know that we're dealing with money
and in our case we're using direct
debits which are processed offline so
the order doesn't matter and the
question for you is how do what do you
think what database solution did we use
in our system that handles money like
what what database would you prefer so
at the end we just use portrait why
because in case where we can decide what
solution we want to use a teacher base
we would always go with a solution that
more constraining because it's easier to
eventually migrate for something that
has less constraints than the other way
around another thing that is baffling
for elixir and financial systems is let
it crush photography because people
often think that let it crush means that
we can lose the data or something bad
happens and that's totally not the case
it's almost the other way around
so let it crush philosophy means that we
sprinkle our code base with this equal
operator which isn't assignment it's
pattern matching it just checks if
whatever is returned on the right
matches whatever is on the left so this
means that in case the file right was
successful the execution will continue
normally but otherwise the process will
crash it doesn't mean that we handle all
errors somewhere else so if we have a
business logic that requires handling
the error in file right we can totally
do it in case statement but we don't
handle the errors that we didn't think
about so it's more like a happy case
programming we just restart the process
and try again and this is something that
is surprisingly useful for example we're
using Heroku 2 for our infrastructure
and in Heroku documentation you can read
the Dinos are restarted at least once
per day to help maintain the health of
applications running on Heroku and this
basically means that there were
applications with memory leaks and it's
just better to restart the application
once roughly 24 hours than to simply
keep it running and have it more and
more memory also any changes to the
local file system will be deleted so if
our application crashed because it did
something really stupid and it can't
recover from it it will start with the
clean state so this is almost the same
philosophy so again questions for
audience would you fly a plane that was
written in let it crash philosophy in
mind because I would the only language
that I know that supports let it crash
philosophies airline and by transition
elixir the problem is that let it crash
is something that we associate with blue
screen of death
like everything crashing our entire
application going down but that is
something that we usually associate with
crashing but actually the philosophy was
used even before Erlangen elixir so in
Apollo 11 there was a primary guidance
navigation and control system and they
had a shared CPU and the CPU wasn't very
powerful so each application that was
using it had a bound of how many cycles
can it use so for example for mullen
landing they used 80% of CPU cycles for
querying the system for any data so for
example each crew wanted to check
something it was something about 9% and
the problem was that there was one
faulty hardware that used constantly 13%
of CPU cycles during the Apollo 11
mission so during the moon landing
someone from the crew asked the computer
about something and the query dated
crash because it ran out of CPU but it
had also the lowest priority the moon
landings had of course higher priority
than whatever crew wanted at that time
and this is the embodiment of let it
crash philosophy we contained the error
so it doesn't spread and it doesn't
crash entire rocket but we it also
forces us to think up front about the
design so if anything in our application
can crash
can be restarted into any point in time
how do we solve the client-server
communication so for example I'm
currently working on the server part
that accepts transactions and then send
them to the bank in whatever format Bank
needs at this time so it works a little
bit like this when we get a transaction
we do some processing to check if the
data is valid and whatnot then we do the
DB access and it can also fail because
we use Postgres and the constraints
might not be met and then we do some
more processing and then we send the
response to the client and the client
usually firstly creates the transaction
saves it somewhere then sends it to us
and then after getting the response it
also saves it so it's a synchronous
thing and this is because any part of
this computation can fail so for example
the network can fail and we don't get
the response or the processing the first
processing on the server can fail and in
that case we won't save anything to
database but if the second part of
processing failed we have something in
the database so how do we make sure that
both client and server are on the same
page and there is a really great example
of two systems trying to set on the same
state it's called to general problem and
the story goes like this there are two
generals on two sides of a city they
want to attack so their armies are big
enough so that if they attack both at
the same time they can win but if one of
them attacks then they'll probably fail
and get slaughtered the problem is that
they want to have communicated this time
and they need to send a messenger to the
second general through that valley with
that city so this messenger can get
picked off and this is the perfect
metaphor of network so general a and
the messenger to the second general
saying okay let's attack tomorrow at
noon can they attack no they can't
because even though the second general
knows the day the first one doesn't know
if the second one got it so they send a
messenger back saying yes okay we will
attack at noon now if both messengers
got there can they attack no they still
can't because the first general now
knows that the second general knows the
day but it also is he also knows that
the second general doesn't know if the
confirmation got in so even with
infinite amount of messengers getting
back and forth you can't simply agree on
a date and there are big class of
complex algorithms to set a shared State
however in client-server architecture we
don't need that client our client server
architecture is much simpler than that
because server usually doesn't have to
know if a client got the response its
client responsibility to wait for the
response and in case it didn't get there
just retry however we trying is another
problem in itself if we only set a
transaction with amount from and - if we
send it twice is it the same transaction
or are there two different transactions
so how we usually solve this problem is
that we use idempotent calls with
client-side generated uu IDs so every
time client wants to send a request it
generates UUID and this way we know that
this is this particular request that's
why the client saves the request that
wants to send to us before actually
sending it to the server and also
because we use HTTP interface we use put
methods for that and this means that if
we if the server produced the response
and
somehow it didn't get to the client then
the HTTP layer can catch that for us
because put is idempotent so now as I'm
talking about it you can get a picture
of what we're working on and this slide
shows how people usually see Alex you
like great for distributed systems great
for complex stateful communication with
channels for example perfect with base
databases and how we use elixir is the
exact opposite so we have a single node
service we have a client server without
stake and we have AC DB Postgres so why
the heck do we use elixir for our system
it is because functional programming can
make it more easy to reason about our
problem domain so one of the things is
that it helps us keep side effects in
check for example if we do testing in
imperative languages it usually goes
like this
we set up some state we then run the
tested code and we check the new state
in functional programming it is very
similar we set up a data structure then
we run our tested code and then we check
the data structure so from the
programmers point of view it's basically
the same but if we want to Randall's
tests we can do it in parallel and this
is important win for us because our test
case can run in like three seconds or
less what's more elixir with pipe
operator encourages a certain way of
programming where we firstly gather data
and we have all the impure operations in
one function that gathers the data for
example reads the HTTP request from
socket or read data from the database
then we make a series of transformations
that are pure and have no side-effects
and then we return the data so we again
push something through the socket or
insert it to the database
and this allows us for very easy testing
so we firstly set up the data structure
the data structure in Phoenix that is
used for testing is called con con has
everything that we need to know about
the HTTP requests like its body its
query parameters and we also set the
response in this data structure so we
firstly build that and we have a
function that does that for us
and then we invoke our route to some
path and this basically tests all the
code that we have written our router our
controller everything and then at the
end we check the data structure if
everything is correct so for example we
check the comm data structure if the
HTML response was actually 200 as we
expected and the only query here is that
the first column and the second column
are two totally different data
structures because elixir is immutable
and it might be a little bit confusing
that you can rebind the name of a
variable it's not actually rebinding the
problem with this approach is that
sometimes in those transformations that
we want to keep pure we also really want
to do something impure like insert
something to the database and XO which
is the database library for elixir helps
us with it by introducing XO multi so
let's say we have a transformation that
doesn't touch the data at all it simply
inserts some subset of the data to the
database
if some condition is met so this is our
business logic what we can do now is
introduce the multi that we will carry
the operations for the database
throughout our pipe chain so let's say
that the first multi with them doesn't
contain any database operations
we do exactly the same as before if some
condition is met insert something to the
database but instead of touching the
database directly we use multi insert
and then return the new multi alongside
the data that was unmodified so in the
test it looks so then like this we again
start with pure data structure simple
data structure then we call our function
and we check that the data is unmodified
and that the ecto multi has the
transaction that we want to perform on
the database later so we can pass this
multi around keeping our computation
pure and then at the end have all the
database transactions run at the same
place that means that we can easily
write unit tests that don't touch the
database and are really really fast and
then we can write one big test that
actually checks if the database works
correctly the other problem we can get
is the opposite so if we want to really
read something from the database in this
pure part so in that case for example we
again have some business logic and
depending on what the database returns
we want to either add something to the
processed data or just return it
unmodified so in that case we can use
default argument so what I did there is
I introduced another argument which is
the lowercase repo the slash slash means
it's the default will be capital our
repo so if you call this function with
only one argument it will behave exactly
the same as the one from previous slide
however you can define a fake repo
module that will have the same interface
as our database and
then when you test this stuff you can
simply pass this fake repo module and
again save yourself the hassle of going
all the way to the database there are
also other benefits like for example
elixir and other functional programming
languages are very very explicit and
there are many questions on mailing
lists on forums on Stack Overflow about
how do you add callbacks to to some
stuff how do you for example make sure
that after you write something the
database another piece of code gets
invoked and the answer is you don't you
simply don't because it makes for a
tangled design and you simply can't do
that in elixir if you won't do such
stuff you just create a function that
firstly does the right and then secondly
does whatever you want to do in your
callback and then use that function so
it makes the code much more readable and
much more sane the other thing is really
great performance for example comparing
to Ruby I think in two slots Ben marks
will be talking about his experience at
BT report they wrote that they had 150
servers running Ruby code and after they
switched to elixir they have now five
and they're probably over provisioned so
this is something that I would like to
say about our case but we didn't get the
measurement and we're still in the
process of rewriting the Ruby Manolis
elixir code and I hope that at some
point I can give similar data to this
however this is probably one of the
things that helps us keep our system non
distributed we run everything on one
node and this is because elixir is fast
enough to handle it on one node the
other thing is that elixir is very
focused on getting your design right so
many frameworks would like you to put
things that are meaningful for framework
and not for your application in
different folders so if you have a
separate controllers directory or
separate models directory or separate
views directory where you have many
unrelated views that's something that is
a little bit fishy and if if you're
following domain driven design then
you'd like to put your code that makes
use of other modules close to each other
in the same directory and Clinics
currently really encourages that also if
you have a piece of functionality that
is really separated to the point that it
uses different storage solution than the
rest of your application you can put it
in the elixir application and then use
umbrella application and this is
something that resembles micro services
because you can put many pieces of
functionality in one big chunk so it
gives you the same benefits of isolation
however it's still one elixir system
which means that it saves you the hassle
of dealing with HTTP request network and
so on
of course like with everything there are
some trade-offs so for example rapid
evolution can be a disadvantage and
we've heard during the keynote that the
evolution slowed down currently so this
shouldn't be a problem anymore however
there were a couple of examples where we
needed to refactor all of our models
because ecto change to the API however
it was really painless the changes were
mostly mechanic's so we did a query
search and replace with our editors and
if the tests but we were pretty
confident that everything worked as
expected the other problem is
computation time and there was another
great subject before about how
compilation in elixir works
and elixir has this tree of dependencies
so if one module module a depends on the
module B if you change module B module a
also needs to be recompiled and there
are modules in your project that are in
the bottom of the hierarchy and 3d
recompilation of entire project and this
is for example decade with config files
so every time you change a variable in
config it means that you will recompile
everything and that's not a pretty big
deal because usually most of the modules
don't have such big dependencies and we
don't edit the configuration very often
but still it can be something that maybe
can be somehow improved the other thing
is that type system is optional and I
point it as a problem because other
languages so like for example Haskell
where the type system is strict gives
more safety net and it is very common in
elixir to pass wrong data structure or a
little bit wrong argument and of course
we usually catch such stuff in tests but
it would be great to have to enforce
type system in project so in elixir
there is a dialyzer and you can use that
that's why I say it's optional but it
works best if all the libraries that
you're using also use dialyzer and not
all libraries that phoenix uses you
dialyzer and that means that in the end
it's quite hard to use it and we simply
opted out and another thing is libraries
so there are more and more libraries for
elixir that's why I put a question mark
here I never had a problem with finding
a library that I need however it's not
as rich as languages that are
10 15 or 20 years okay to sum up this
talk was a success story of a lecture
and I think that we need more success
stories for small applications more
crude applications where we don't have
this fancy distributed stuff because
elixir could really spread in the
environment where we do the simple
design and I think we're not marketing
elixir enough for those kind of systems
the other thing is don't assume
financial systems are a seed because it
really depends on the problem domain and
there are cases inside cases where you
should switch between AC and base design
and the third thing is that elixir can
solve really hard problems like in
concurrency in stateful systems but it
can also help something solve the simple
ones and that's all thank you very much
well thanks a lot that was great
does anyone have any questions I can
come around with the mic if you put your
hand up there we go hello great talk
better thank you a question about
working with money specifically working
with rounding of pennies say you're
dealing with taxes and maybe your taxes
are six and a half percent or something
just wondering if you have any short
lessons lessons learned working with
rounding numbers yeah so for storage we
usually try to store everything as
integers and if we don't have to store
something like ratios between currencies
it's usually enough because we can just
multiply the number by 100 and for all
the other cases we use the decimal
library where we can specify exactly how
do we do the rounding and how many
places how many decimal places do we
keep in the answer and at the end we use
we only use the library in the front end
so to show the data but we don't start
decimals anywhere and that simplifies
things greatly in our case does anyone
else have a question
okay thanks for your talk
I want to ask you about specific about
financial systems how'd you handle cases
where you have a process or an
application there is handling a
transaction and then the process or
application crash you need to recover
this state to maybe
retry the transaction or what you
actually do what kind of behavioral you
is takes to implement so this is a
little bit connected to the slide about
client-server architecture so I will
rewind to that here so in case the
application crashed during the
processing on the server side and we
know the client knows that it sent the
transaction okay and it didn't get the
response the client is responsible for
retrying that transaction so that's
usually the case if something goes wrong
someone knows that it should get the
response so we push as much
responsibility as we can to the client
because only the client can know if
everything was processed as intended so
even if something crashes
on the client-side so for example
sending fails because of network errors
we firstly we always store everything
that we want to do somewhere it might be
in logs it might be in the database so
if we want to create a transaction the
client firstly saved it then tries to
send it and up from that point if
anything fails then we have a
transaction that is stored somewhere but
doesn't have the corresponding response
so that's the way we handle errors and
that's the way we leverage on the
letters crash philosophy
we have about a minute left if someone
wants to squeeze in one more question
