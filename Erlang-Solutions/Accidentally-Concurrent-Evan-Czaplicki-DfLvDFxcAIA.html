and I'm the lead developer on it and one
of the things I care a lot about is
communicating so what's interesting
about Alan sort of how the programming
language Purvi language research the tap
in the past 30 or so can be useful for
day to day stuff on the way so an
example of this is we've gotten wire
tape to go down to the phrase wouldn't
it be cool with you didn't have runtime
errors and if your audience is
JavaScript people they're like that
would be cool I want to know more about
that so another thing that I want to get
into that one sentence were compelling
is why is immutability good and I sort
of know in my heart and I know from
experience that like I'm like I like it
when things are mutable but I don't have
the one sentence where I can say this oh
just and I'll get it or be curious so
this talk is really trying to answer
that question like what's mean about
immutability and the way I understand
this is through concurrency so we're
gonna do is we're going to go through a
bunch of different paradigms of
programming and try to see what they
would look like if we built them on a
nice concurrent some nice concurrent
primitives and the thread throughout
this talk will be a little hero games -
not Mario in this case we've got a
different a different spray yeah so
trying to model a hero and some bad guys
are attacking okay so the first thing
I'm starting with is called the
message-passing concurrency and so I'm
coming out of the tradition of
typed functional languages so I'm taking
this from concurrent enough so the
missing passage concurrency you're
setting up these systems where you have
threads and when I say threads
I mean likely threads
processes the ones that are small and
they can talk to each other so ping can
send a message to the palm thread
pumpkins in the message back this is the
kind of thing we're talking about
now the basic primitive is called the
channel in concurrent ml so you can read
these types is kind of like it almost
more like a camel so you can create a
channel and then people can communicate
on it so I can send messages on it I can
receive messages on it
so send I say sending on this channel
disability and receive I can say on this
channel waiting so I get a belly and
both of these are blocking so channels
are kind of interesting in that when I
send a message on the channel I just
like to look at it until someone on the
other side like gets it and then I'm
like okay cool I'll go on and do stuff
so we have synchronization along these
along these channels and this is
actually the wave as the farmland is
nice for a single machine for
distributed system maybe it's not so
nice but it will help us build a lot of
stuff the last thing we need is a way to
spawn new threads so you can think of
this is where we have a function and
it's taking in some value and it's going
to do some stuff and we'll give the
initial value and then it'll spawn that
function you know likely thread and go
do some work so these are our primitives
and we're going to build everything on
this so to sort of see these in action
more than just a type I want to show a
simple program so let's say we have main
so this is running in our main thread
and we're going to make a channel we're
going to spawn a thread that's running
some pin code and they're going to spawn
with Reverend
both of them have access to this channel
and then the main thread guys we
finished there's no more to do now the
way these thing and palm prints are
working is King is saying okay I'm gonna
send this string along the channel and
palm we say oh I'm going to receive that
and then palm is saying okay I want to
send that and Tia saying okay I'll
receive it and then they just loop on
themselves and keep doing this
communication okay so these are sort of
our basic primitives of concurrency now
I want to start defining things that are
more familiar in terms of these things
so the first one is mutation so if
you've used I don't how I shouldn't list
the languages mutations that kind of
thing okay um you've seen it so what
does that look like when we try to think
of it as a concurrent system using these
primitives so first let's start with the
AP XO reference will be I'm going to
give a value and then I'm going to have
this reference that I can communicate
with the community I'm going to have
them get o so it has an example of this
I can say let x equals reference for me
to a thing that I can talk to you and so
I have this thing holding 42 and then I
can say get so get reference so if I say
get X this is going to equate to 42 and
you can think of this as like
information flowing out you can also say
set so if I say set X to be 13 so send
the message in and change what's in this
thing so when we actually try to
implement this the way we go about it is
I'll get an initial value from the user
and I'll create an incoming and
outcoming channel so people are gonna
say stuff to me and maybe I'll say
something back to them and the message
is I'm gonna get or do you want to get
this or sadness so all the crucial stuff
so I'm gonna receive on the incoming
channel and someone may say I'd like to
get your value please so I'm gonna send
them my value myself so just keep
receiving stuff or they might say set
hey here's the value I want you to hold
so I'll just leave with that new value
and continue this thing so now people
can say hey yeah I'd like to get what
you're holding on to someone else can
say okay here neither this and another
person can read again so one way to
think of this is like it's like the most
passive communication possible right so
imagine two spies who want to
communicate with each other and like one
comes with a park and puts the message
in the newspaper in a trash can and like
walks away and then another spy comes
and like he knows if that particular
trash can and he goes and picks it up
okay okay and maybe once I didn't show
up or maybe someone else walked through
the park and threw their thing away as
well so if this communication channel
we're like neither party knows that
other party has been there okay this is
about to take a so the final part
of implementing preferences I'll spawn
my loop which is this thread and then
I'll expose the world get and set so
when someone wants to get they're gonna
send me I get requests and I'm going to
send and I'm gonna oh yeah and then I'm
gonna wait for what they tell me the
value is and then if I want to set the
value I'm just gonna say hey accept this
thing so cool now let's say we were like
this is a great concurrency primitives I
really like the idea of the two spies in
the park way of communication that seems
good to me so maybe we can think of a
more convenient syntax so maybe instead
of saying RAF 42 we say look for an x
equals 42 and instead of X we say X and
set X 13 we say x equals 13 so in some
sense you can think of a language like
JavaScript has really nice syntax for
this method of writing concurrent
programs
whenever you see our X you're spawning
this thread so when you start making
this a little bit bigger we can say I
have the central thread that's running
things and if I say far hero health is
their team now I have a thread that in
and if I say the heroes x position is 3
here's Y position is 4 and so on and so
forth so I'm starting to spawn all these
little threads it's a cold state for me
and if I want to know what's going on
there I have to go ask now if this is
all we had in our language it might be a
problem right so you have more than here
you have your bad guys they each have
their own thing and if you respond them
all up with the same thread that seems
crazy right that seems like it'd be hard
to manage so in response to that we have
this concept of encapsulation great a
lot of times with people coming people
coming from Java will say like hey how
do you do in capsulation properly but ok
so how this might look in in in
JavaScript is if we wanted to represent
a bad guy not just funning it off the
name we'd say we have these private
variables you know X&amp;amp;Y health and then I
have these public functions that give me
access to that so someone can follow a
hero so we want the bad guy to be able
to like look
here oh and I'm just like moved towards
them or they can be damaged so in theory
we have this nice API and no an outsider
needs to know anything about X or Y or
or the health that's all hidden now the
way we can think about this as the
concurrent system is we can build it on
top of risk right so when we see the bar
X we just map it directly onto the
creative breath so we create these three
graphs yeah
so I were to actually call this in
JavaScript you can think of it as they
create this first reference for the
second reference to the third reference
and then I have these two functions that
is gonna be like the bad guy and that's
also a record so I can get the bad guy
and then use his functions I can set the
bad guy to be some totally different
thing and then use its functions to
access what's going on here okay so now
we have this encapsulation thing so
we're like yeah let's make a bunch of it
right so we have an array and it's got a
bunch of bad guys in it and then we're
like yeah this is going great
like and now we have our main thread and
it has the array and then the heroes
over here and we have this nice
hierarchy now right we can't we have
this class hierarchy and if we're in
Java maybe hero and bad guy are sub type
like entity and blanket share in it and
it's great the point I'm trying to make
here though is that hierarchy isn't the
same as modularity on paper we have a
nice separation of concerns but when we
actually start running a program things
look very different so let's say our
hero wants to look at the nearest bad
guy okay so he's gonna want to know
about this information right he's gonna
have to get those dollies
so in some sense he's able to do some
communication there and the bad guys all
want to be looking at here so they need
to know about its X&amp;amp;Y as well so as you
start to run your program you're sort of
adding on
in the sense that if a reference to the
hero's ex ever makes its way across to
here
I now can change that myself right so
I'm changing the architecture of my
application and most of this stuff
that's exciting in this program is going
to happen in these interactions so I
created this hierarchy but most of the
action is happening to it outside of
that the most egregious version of this
is if you have getters and setters on
your internal variables because
sometimes you're just saying hey
everybody you can communicate with me
like I don't know who you are I don't
care eventually when I have a bug but I
don't I don't know so oh yeah okay yeah
there's one last thing here so I removed
I don't know if you can see it right
here if the array is like okay we're
done with this well here it is still
pointing and update so this is kind of
indicating the kinds of issues are going
to start to see hero is now playing at a
thing that doesn't exist so the thing
that it removes a bad guy also need to
know that the hero is pointing at
certain bad guys you're going to get
these kind of crazy bugs because you
have this concurrent systems and just
like it's weird and now I know there are
a lot of grilling people so maybe you're
looking in this and you're saying like
oh yeah that's how the point I'm trying
to make here is just when we think of it
this way
as I can Francis them do me feel good
about so the minute Medicare as well as
like that there's something anti modular
about mutable references when I reveal
information to someone I'm also giving
them the ability to change that
information which seems weird right like
if I it's like if someone gave you in
terms of service and then you just like
changed all of it and then they were
like that's fine but
and I may be cool but I okay so this is
gonna get a bit crazier and I and and so
before we move on the next step is about
thinking about something like JavaScript
a Levin who fits into this I want to
talk a bit about schedulers so I know in
JavaScript all that's common to say well
JavaScript is single threaded so we just
like don't have to worry about any of
this stuff so I want to build a bit of
foundation about that so there are
different kinds of schedulers one it's
called co-op so let's say you have some
functions to run two functions
cooperative schedulers gonna say okay
I'm gonna choose this one and then run
until it's done so even if other threads
come in in the meantime and what I have
to finish that so when I focus on this
big guy and start it off and then a
bunch of other work comes in I'm still
gonna have to like finish all of that
work in the meantime like this guy
actually proceeds that but we had to
wait until his dough so the other kind
of structure was preempted so we can
start with the same two threads we focus
on this one we get I can do a thread
probably through we finish the focus on
this guy new threads come in and we say
you know what is taking too long let's
focus on something else and then we go
handle bunch of other threads before a
group true soufy empted means you can
just bail go work on something else and
then come back now the big point I want
to make here oh yeah so languages that
do these kinds of things go use this
cooperative concurrency that's the what
I can find online that I I guess it's
true
Erlang and concurrent values there are a
bunch of other languages that fall on
different sides of this they make their
own arguments out which one is better I
have my own opinions the big point here
is that concurrency isn't the same as
parallelism okay so this is like
whenever you talk about concurrency
going to be like hey but this
distinction you said just know it's like
the test that people will do to you
concurrency is we have multiple things
to run and we are deciding and they're
going to sort of interact with each
other in some way whereas parallelism is
just like we're doing multiple at the
same time so in example as we saw one of
them would be highlighted at a time
parallelism would just mean that more
than one was highlighted it wouldn't
fundamentally change that we're working
in a concurrent system it would just
change the evaluation okay so that
brings us to the event loop and this is
what you have in JavaScript which is
single threaded but we're still working
in a in a concurrent system and there's
this when John repeat talks about the
event loop Wayne's talking about
concurrent and now he calls it a
poor-man's concurrency cliche but at
free is just like stuck with me a lot it
it's like it's like if you want to
concurrency to be the worst so to put it
into JavaScript when you say something
like set timeout callback zero it's the
same as saying spawn a callback like you
just have this function that's going to
run at some point in the future and
there's the scheduler that's relatively
straightforward it says okay have these
things to run I'll do them in order so
if we think of a program that's using
this style of concurrency let's say it's
some sort of social website and it's got
a navigation bar and a feed of stories
and some hats on the right side so these
would be modeled as stuff as references
and then they have some structure now
with each of these things maybe you
would have some sort of a conflict
Handler
so if I click on the navigation bar
function and maybe it's modifying the
feet maybe it's saying if you navigate
to this thing I'm going to show this
kind of stuff and then that'll go away
it's done and then I have that story so
if I click on on the feed
maybe I am asking for a news story and
let's say that story is hey your cousin
went to the beach today and so in
addition to fetching the story they also
update the ad they say hey get that each
body one weird trick to getting trainers
hated and sunglasses based on what your
friends are up to
and finally if someone clicks on the ad
you run the profit fallback and that's
it just runs bad sausages so as you run
the system these things are popping in
and out of existence and that's going to
independent of the structure of your
code and when we look at them all
together which is something you can't
really do just reading the code you see
that we have a way for information to
flow from whatever Prophet is doing
through to this navigation part right so
we grow navigation bar you have no idea
that someone else in our company is
doing ads or what they're up to and yet
they have this sort of hidden way of
communicating with with our piece and it
isn't through the channels that we
explicitly set up in the first place
they can speak through that so what this
mean is when we zoom out to our hero and
bad guys is now we have like threads
popping in and out of existence who are
just like modifying things everywhere
and then those things already depend on
so we're creating the system to like
it's really hard to keep track of what's
going on and when people add new things
it can interact and release always so
one way to react to this is that was I
didn't need to do that kind of stuff
when you think of it as hey we're trying
to coordinate between these things and
we have this communication channel that
is the two spies in the park what have
we had something where it was like a
notification on your phone so when you
bring the spice into your message it say
hey go pick up the mat the thing from
the trash cans so this is kind of what
reactive programming is going for and
when I say reactive I mean what if
someone who is saying like everything is
a Street so so the kind of reactivity
you'll see in JavaScript so when we
think about this as a concurrent system
the mapping is pretty pretty
straightforward actually so instead
there's a concept of a stream where
values are coming to you we can model
that as a channel where messages are
going to be passed and so when I say
stream you can think of it as disagree
no there's some stuff coming in from the
world and it's being piped into a
channel and I have access to the end of
it I can just like hear about stuff and
the way you build up things in this
setting is with these commentators so
one of them is map I have an extreme and
I have a function that I want to apply
to all the values in that stream so the
way we do this as a concurrent system is
we know we have this channel coming in
so when I say okay I'm gonna take in my
function in my stream and I'm gonna
create an uplink stream that someone
else will get at the end of this my loop
is going to be receive whatever is
coming in here and then send out that
and then just loop and do the same thing
again so then we spawn that and we get
that Street
so when you say map over the street you
can think of it as spawning a new threat
that's doing some computation and this
gets a little bit crazier when you
realize in this case we didn't hold any
state but we can actually have threads
that are holding state as well in this
thing and we're just spawning this all
these threads as we as we use these
stream Combinator's now when folks with
my background talk about the reactive
programming as it shows up in JavaScript
sometimes they're like angry and they'll
talk about glitches and how flat map is
weird I'd like to talk about them not
because I want to be like that but
because I think when we think of this as
a concurrent system both of these things
are elucidated in some way so when we
think about glitches the basic setup of
it is we can create the diamond where we
have a stream that's giving us
information and we map square root onto
that and we do that again and then we
merge them with an equals so when you
read this code as JavaScript programmer
and I've seen this happen with a team I
was I was talking with they were at this
kind of code and then they were very
surprised when the output stream wasn't
always true right this is what people
call glitches and when you look at as a
concurrent system it's not so crazy
right so I'm going to send messages to
both of these threads and they're gonna
send messages along but nothing about
this says oh this should be synchronized
or like it just doesn't there's no
guarantee here someone wrote this as a
concurrent system there you know
spectator that the end result would be
true all the time so to run through in a
single-threaded way we can think of I
send them the number four it does the
computation and I hope that through this
is waiting so it does it does it too and
then sends the message through now I
have two messages waiting so I have to
handle them one at a time so no matter
what we are getting this witchy behavior
what I like about this example is when
once we think of it as a concurrent
system it's straightforward and what
it's getting at is if people knew they
were writing the system I don't know if
they would write it right like what if
once you know huh is that really what I
want to do and I think in some ways
streams in that they're hiding this
underlying thread structure make it hard
to do that kind of calculation okay so
flatten out this one's interesting just
cuz people from the like functional
reactive worlds like what is about math
even mean was it even mean so we can we
can give a a mental model for it at
least so flat map is like map except
instead of just transforming the
Diamonds we're going to create a whole
new stream instead so it's a little bit
trickier to explain but you can think of
this guy's spawning a thread right in
the stream as a channel that we're
talking about it's got to be that we
have to spawn that sub structure so the
first thing we'll do is create an out
street so we get our stream in and this
animation is in a weird order you have a
stream coming in and let's see what's
next
okay yeah yeah so in the end we're gonna
spawn a loop that's gonna do some stuff
and then it's gonna talk to a downstream
so the person who's you who is getting
the resulting stream is listening here
now all the interesting stuff happens in
the loop so
what the loop is doing is it's going to
be listening on four inputs and it's
going to be listening for all these sub
streams this parts a bit tricky so first
we're doing this multi receive thing I
had to find it I don't want to get into
it because it's tricky but essentially
what it's doing is whenever it gets a
message from the original input it's
going to tag it as an input and whenever
it gets a message from one of these
streams that have been created it's
going to tag it as an output so if I get
a message that's an input I'm going to
say okay cool
spawn that thread and then add that to
my list of local streams so if I get
input or something I'm gonna spawn this
structure and maybe this is going to
give me values so they'll be taking the
output I'll get that I'll send it to the
out stream and then loop again
so essentially have one path to listen
to hey spawn new stuff and another path
to listen to all the things I spawned
and forward them along so as this runs
we're going to see more and more things
get spawn so maybe we have another input
in its topic to us and maybe we have
some other thing and it happens to be
pointing at the same like so what we
have here is kind of a thread pool but
really bizarrely done so the the
question the way I want to think about
this would be let's say there's a
predict there's a situation and you ask
that person would it be appropriate to
use flatmap in the situation and then
you have the same situation and you're
like would it be appropriate to use a
thread pool in this situation and based
on this understanding of things you
should always get the dough should
always be the same answer but I don't
think that's what would happen if you
went out even if you'd ask the same
person whether they think that's the
case so okay so that's sort of a way of
thinking about reactive programming but
let's come back to our hero and bad guy
situation so I'm taking very literally
this
you know everything should be a stream
and I'm doing it in a style that I have
seen a team do which is to say it may
not be the most enlightened version but
based on the basic guidance of this
approach it's what you might end up with
it and close to what I've seen people
end up with so the first thing it's
exciting to do is oh we have these
inputs from the brook so I have to keep
keyboarding emails and I know that if
I'm paused then I want to care about
keyboarding if I'm not paused and I
sorry in wait maybe this is a good
example so we want to filter it out
based on what the pasta is in some cases
I care about the mouse or the case they
care about the keyboard and then maybe
there's going to be some positive thing
and it's gonna feed into those filters
and that's gonna make it so I don't
react when I don't care
cool this is like the 101 version of
things okay I don't know exactly how
it's gonna fit with stuff so let's just
I had to find a hero I know he has an X
and a Y and an angle and I know the
angle will affect the X and the y
because if I'm facing this direction
then I want to move in that direction
it depends and the X&amp;amp;Y also depend on
the keyboard so those are going to be
inputs as well and maybe one health and
the health will depend on x and y maybe
you're standing on lava maybe you've run
into a bad guy and the health is also
going to influence whether another pot
so let's say if that goes to zero and I
want to go into apostate and that's
going to affect my keyboard stuff and
that's gonna affect x and y and x and y
is going to pick health and then
okay okay so we have some one bad guys
so here we'll have a similar setup the
angle effect acts and ymax no health and
angle is going to be based on where are
my heroes I want to be looking at that
hero and I spawn a bunch of these and
they're all based on x and y and then
the hero should be facing the closest
bad guy as well and then maybe I want to
model the pause screen and there's a
keyboard shortcut to go there and then I
move the mouse around and then that
affects whether or not were paused and
then maybe I can not buy a potions in
the hero what I'm getting at is this is
crazy
like if I had to decide if someone came
to me and said I want to design this
game with hearings and I have designed
an amazing and current system and then
they showed me this I'd be like I don't
and so what I'm getting at here is if
the underlying representation is so
weird
does that like people should know and
take that into account right so and it's
not this thing that's Sara Lee that this
direction is bad but it's that if we use
this framework
maybe we can design something that makes
more sense that would have a nicer
structure okay so a kind of two big
points here are one federating
high-quality concurrent programs is hard
here we can you can confirm that or
maybe people say it's easy because
another one is that everyone's
accidentally writing concurrent programs
right so if you're if you're writing you
know object oriented language like job
if you are using some sort of reactive
thing if you're if you have mutation you
know if you have a bit event like you
can think of it as this kind of system
so the question I kind of want to ask
here is do we keep making things up
right do we just like keep going in this
direction where we don't have this
foundational approach or do we say you
know maybe we should learn how the
concurrency people think about this
stuff so finally finally this brings us
back to immutability the whole point of
this talk so if we want to understand
why I need abilities good well let's try
to understand it in the same way that
we've been for for everything else let's
try to represent it with some
concurrency so instead of creating a ref
like we did before the immutable kind
we're going to read only one and the way
it's gonna work is have any incoming
channel and at how can a channel and my
loop is gonna say hey someone has for a
thing send them my value and then so all
I can do is say oh you want to know
about you want to know about me it's the
same as last time
so we spawned that with the initial
value and then we just exposed yeah
which is saying ask for stuff get the
stuff so we have this thread and
information can only flow out of it now
what this means when we have a larger
system is maybe we have some thread that
cares
information and it's interacting with
some complicated system we don't know
anything about it and that systems
instructing back with us and we've got
another threat somewhere else and
through some some craziness in here the
read only reference gets passed along
here so now I have the ability to get
this information now here's the crucial
part information can't flow across this
right I can only get the information
there's no way for information here to
cross through this pathway the only way
information can flow is through the
actual avenues that I said were
appropriate ok so this is the crucial
thing it means no accidental
communication channels there's no way to
during the execution of your program so
actually these two things do interact
each with each other so to bring it back
to why only revealing information
doesn't change our architecture right
you can give the person the Terms of
Service and then okay that's the end of
the story those two things are separated
in a way that seems important ok so yeah
so that's
I wanted to say one last thing a lot of
this comes from this book concurrent
programming in and out
I love this book it's really cool I
learned a lot and yeah does anyone have
any questions
okay cool this first song of bugging me
a bit is when you were showing the
stream streams that was definition that
you should merge two species using this
framework yeah I can I can write an
implementation yeah you can define it in
different ways I don't think you can
define it such that you saw
Oh
do you think there are other warranties
although some immutability that are very
very important for writing programs
second determinism deterministic
programs
yeah yeah so and that's kind of it's
like when I use immutability in Tina
it's in the setting of function language
that single-threaded and like it's it's
not clear how to write but once you
think about accidental concurrency then
you start to see okay actually
immutability is serving a purpose in
these systems
okay so I think a couple interesting
things to think about in terms of this
are that there's like immutability
definitely does solve a lot of these
issues but there's some other Russell's
whole idea that is that you know
mutability is fine it's actually not the
problem it's just making sure yeah so
this was something I didn't choose to
emphasize here but when people ask about
encapsulation and no I typically will
say like ownership and modularity like
are separate things and when you start
to think of it in that way you can have
much better results so so yeah
definitely immutably isn't the only way
to think about this ownership is a nice
way to talk about I didn't know how to
and go seems to get away with just sort
of safe use channels and don't
well and in that that's a setting where
you know what you you know the
underlying truth you right like when you
use a reference it's not as a
replacement for something that maybe is
actually a thread conceptually
