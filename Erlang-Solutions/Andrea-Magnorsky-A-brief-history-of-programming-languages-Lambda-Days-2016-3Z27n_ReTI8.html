so I hand wave a lot so I'm sorry for
that and so yes this should actually be
called a wreath and probably incorrect
programming languages because it's not
possible to in 40 minutes go over
everything that's you know perfectly
right and complete and everything so
this is more my idea is to try to you
know keep up broad strokes kind of
history of talks I'm not um I'm not a
historian so you know don't take
everything I say with a pinch of salt
basically and I am this is the cut I
drew for your pleasure viewing and some
time blocks from Brown crisis that calm
and some I don't know I'm supposed to
say something about myself but it kind
of considered that really boring and so
yeah and we just heard filled what we're
talking about and a bunch of the history
that I'm gonna mention here so and take
this as like a way to firm up your
knowledge about him
so as Phil said and David Hilbert was a
well-known mathematician and he had a
really really interesting social circle
for example he you know hang out or was
friends with or students wit or
something with Mr curry with a mean
order with von Neumann and the during
and church and whatever so and he also
was a bit of a philosopher and and
basically he said this in a proceeding
in a conference he said that we must
know we will know but he said this
because in a kind of response to a thing
going on at the time there was something
like we do not know and we will not know
now think about how someone that is
trying to basically create the
foundations of mathematics someone like
that is told that no you won't know and
you know so he was like well actually
maybe we'll try and then so he actually
put a bunch of questions one of them
things he mentioned there Phil mentioned
and that question was there and try some
problem or as I call it the decision
problem because pronouncing German is
not my thing
and as we know also and court Google
said nope that's not gonna float I'm
going quickly because you just saw this
otherwise I could slow down but also he
did a much better job than I could to so
anyway Google and we're and what I'm
trying to show here is also that links
between the people that were involved in
this history so critical and is probably
one of the top three logisticians and
when it comes to like logic so and with
Aristotle and Frankie so we have the
instructing problem
we have the answer of no actually you
can't do that and we know that a lot of
church went off and created the lambda
calculus now I love the church was the
professor for Alan Turing and we know
that a lot of church did lambda calculus
he posted out in 1936 and just a couple
of months later Alan Turing came up with
the Turing machine I found this
representation on the Internet's and I
really like it because this is more or
less what I see when I can explain what
a Turing machine is and basically it's
you have some storage and you have a way
to infinite tape and a way to process
data which is process that information
that is there now this is a solution to
so both the Turing machine and the
lambda calculus are two solutions to
just the same thing and they they are
when I think about the Turing machine I
think okay I understand where Alonzo
Church come from and I find this really
true the Turing machine kind of super
interesting because it's nearly like the
definition of thinking out outside the
box
it's like hey how about we just kind of
think about totally different thing so
you know this is me but anyway a year
later and they both realized and coudl
and that both the solution that the
Turing machine gave and the lambda
calculus gave were equivalent so they
made this you know a thesis this is 1937
in Germany so you know it was a little
bit awkward and so this is basically the
least disturbing picture I found about
the world war so you know the silver
lining of the war if there is any and I
don't take this lightly and is that
there was a lot of research in the area
of computing and basically a lot of you
know armies were trying to figure out
secrets from our armies and so machines
were created we assumed you kind of know
this and so I'm going very very very
fast but if you have questions at any
points you know please ask so well
basically we had like any X and a px and
a bunch of or slightly hard to pronounce
for me a computer's going on and either
nearly before or after and this is also
around the time where von Neumann and
went to States and helped with the
Manhattan Project and stuff like that
and and a couple of years after the war
we have praised hopper in 1952 coming up
with the first compiler called a zero
and she not only it is but also and two
years after came up with the second or
maybe you know this is like all of this
is totally challenged so and this is the
information I found to be you know
people agree on that this was the order
of things so and this is 19 1954
flow-matic and I included some code for
a flow Matic because we're you know I
remember seeing some history and I was
like what the hell does that look like
so I wanted to see that and so I include
some I think if you read through it you
kind of think I more or less understand
what that is and I'm not saying that I
completely do but I'm saying that it
doesn't look completely alien so and
then we need to talk about John Backus
and John Backus is also extremely cool
and he was he was the actual first
programming language according to
consensus and this is called speed
coding
and he also gave us the backus naur
normal form and he also worked on
Fortran which is a language for formula
transformations and working with math in
general and this is a sample of the
program and he had to type stuff kind of
like this and I'm sure you're reading so
I'm just gonna shut up for a little bit
I assume you read because you're super
fast right so then we go to John McCarty
and we are in the year 1959 and he
worked a good bit with Fortran and and
he was trying to work on logic and he
was starting to work on AI I can think
about the year 1959 as someone that
doesn't have a huge background on
history this blew my mind
so you know he also came up with
time-sharing garbage collection you know
or stuff like that and good guy
holy knows so this brings me to one of
the most significant programming
languages and that nobody uses so much
and but the good thing about this is
that it made basically it's a first
attempt or first significant attempt to
get a bunch of people from different
places and you know the US you were
appalled to try to work together to form
something you know like let's agree on
something there are so these different
machines but how are we gonna make this
work
and so we were talking about people and
here we have I'm sorry the picture
quality is not great but we have journal
akari there we have backers we have noir
and wasteman
who was working in cobalt I mentioned
Grace Hopper before she was actually
assisting technically although not part
of the committee that worked in COBOL so
the guy behind gnar is Fritz power I'm
so sorry
it's just because I couldn't see him
here because this thing blocks my view
over here and so I'm so sorry Alan
Perlis thank you for that because I
meant to mention it and not only he
worked on on on Algona and actually
there's a bunch of people that are
missing from this picture they're also
worked on algo and he also wrote a
really cool paper called the next 700
languages so if you're interested in the
topic of pl you should probably go check
it out and okay well thankfully I have
full water to help me know I get my
Tokra and so anyway this brings us to
this thing that I'm hopefully gonna
collect right because I had to curry and
paste so this thing that we don't see so
right it's a graph from a paper called
history of programming past and future
do you want to try to guess the year any
wild guess my little bit further
72 actually and it was written by gene
assignment and in here she was trying to
draw the you know how the languages were
progressing and I basically highlighted
the languages that we talked about and
if you see that the part that I really
wanted you to see was how uncle has all
these crazy connections and I think that
is based on all the people that work
there actually you went and did order
things so that was pretty cool so we
just saw this languages right and we saw
I'll go with soccer ball with a Fortran
with so Lisp so I'm gonna show you some
list literally some Lisp so so this term
that looks a little bit complicated
because it's actually the eval function
to eval Lisp okay so I'm gonna be kind
of kind and this takes a while to grok
and I'm not expecting you to do it so
I'm gonna also show you a slightly
shorter sample of how to
grunts so you can see more or less
what's going on so there is parentheses
there are stuff there is not parentheses
that you can read and for example in
here you're conditionally checking if
it's - and the way you read this is that
the function is what is that next to the
left parenthesis and then you have
parameters and the rest I think is more
or less readable but again I'm trying to
just throw this to you and also another
thing you can do as an audience is when
you see a language you know you can make
some noise and for example you okay so I
know what the hell is going through your
head and so that brings us to the 60 so
we saw some what was happening in the
50s and that was all very like okay
we're kind of very close to the bare
bones we saw now we're seeing out the
sixties and the sixties are very very
cool so we have a pl right a PL a
programming language was and I would say
this is like discovered because it's
very very much influenced by months and
it's functional then we have basic which
is a language that I'm sure you all know
Oh conflicting opinions okay good good
let's create controversy
so when basic is language that are
really popular because it got into micro
computers and a bunch of people actually
you know wanted to you know learn how to
program and so didactical kind of idea
and the same with logo who hasn't tried
the little turtle I mean right and the
amazing thing we have a big fan over
there and the amazing thing is this is
also a functional language so that's
pretty cool and finally we have um a
language that was invented by someone
that was really conscious of created
invented and so someone that was also
part of the other committee and by the
way this his name is Nicholas worse
again one of those people that if you
find a paper by him
you should totally read because you'll
definitely learn something
at least I think I did so APL what is
your reaction what do you think is
happening here
no it's like just just okay so first
step we will read from right to left
cool okay so in this thing we're gonna
calculate primes okay so what's
happening here let's say we want Prime's
up to a number what what is going on is
with that yota there like this that
thing of the little kind of reverse J
you're gonna say that and that's the
maximum number then you're gonna say
that sorry with the yota you create a
vector going from 1 to R then this
second part the T goes to 1 is that
you're gonna drop one of that vector
then in here in the T Sub Zero of dots
XT you're gonna create a matrix that
goes say you had 8 as they are right
you're gonna do a matrix that goes like
right and you're gonna do the product of
that and whatever is not in that product
is your Prime's now I hope I got that
right I think I did but and obviously if
you have any APL like serious people and
you can correct me this is a good time
and but the good thing about is like see
I don't do IPL every day but I find that
after you kind of get it you gotta go ok
that's understandable and then you've
cut yourself going like but it is this
is the kind of synchronous succinctness
and a different way of thinking that the
inventors of this language how do you
mind so it's something I hope you know
it's useful in trying to understand what
they had in mind I assume most of you
had seen Pascal so so this brings me to
the 70s right in the 70s we have I
selected four languages
obviously there's around 3,000 languages
out there right now there anybody heard
of
and we can't show them out so I just
selected subjectively what I thought was
a good sample right so small talk who
heard of small talk
great okay cool why is it different
that's not very different is it okay so
what I find different is that M is
slightly inspired by biology and so what
I'm Alan Kay had in mind when he this
was the object orientation was about
message passing and so state isolation
right which is very different to what
we've been taught when we were learning
object orientation right so I'm going to
leave that there Alan Kay is another one
of those people that if you manage to
catch a talk or whatever that he's
worked on is extremely inspiring and it
has a lot of foresight and stuff like
that then we have ml and ml is a
language that implements hindley Miller
so and gives you type inference and it's
you know logical predecessor to a
language that's very dear to my heart
which is f sharp and you should check it
out it's pretty cool then we have a
prologue it's a logical language logic
based language so in the spectrum of
things that we're saying imagine how
this picture is building we had some
declarative stuff here in the 50s stuff
going to like slightly functional and
you could do some logic and but there
was an order logic going on and then in
the seventies we'll have finally logic
based programming language like product
it was great in France then we have a
complete opposite end of the spectrum C
which was created and to try to write
operating systems right like UNIX and
windows so I have a quote by Joe
Armstrong here of worki thinks of
product which is can co2 I'm Shrunk the
crater of burning the best things in
smoke cheese I really like that and I
really like smoke cheese - so let's go
and so here I'm showing some product
right so the way product works we
talk about logic so what you do is give
the system some information about what
is truth or you know what is the yes
basically is Sally the mother of sorry
it's true the mother of Sally yes Sally
tom is the father
Erika Tom and you say there's this
relationship of a sibling when the
parent is the same and then you say that
a parent can be a father or a mother
right and you can ask something to
provoke to the system and say hey you
know our Sally and Erika siblings and it
says yes although a little play around
with Prolog actually this is when I read
the book by prostate who's kind of speak
tomorrow I think called seven languages
in seven weeks which I highly recommend
if you're into sampling a bunch of
programming languages and and I remember
trying this and getting a lot of no or
crashes so that was funny but still
really really nice as a way to discover
a different language that brings me to
the 80s right and in 1986 Erlang was
created and by Robert who's gonna be
talking at some point and Joe I'm strong
and Mike and I'm sure you've seen that
picture this was creating the here 86
and because I'm from Argentina I know
that this is a significant time and in
football but you know with some sort of
hand involved and so and this is an
implement the actor model and basically
they were trying to create a programming
language that enabled them to be
resilient and the research was to fund
it by Ericsson so all of these things
are kind of relevant because they affect
decisions about the language and sequel
and it's the only and you know
sector-specific I would say that I'm
showing in this list because it's about
data right and sequel it has a lot of
influence from the logic side of things
so and you can obviously create your
query data and and Miranda in 1985 is a
programming language created by Dave
Turner and it's kind of like the it's
the kind of like the guiding I said like
to where Haskell want off but because
the research was copyrighted it couldn't
be spread I guess and in 1983 there was
the logical success detector to see and
this is um you know trying to make it
better I'm not sure they succeeded but
that's my own personal opinion but
anyway and here is the Merlin right so
what's happening here I think I'm kind
of wondering if I'm preaching to the
choir I wonder how many or Landers here
but and we have a module and when we
want to show something that is inside
that module we export that and we say
what is the name of the function and the
arity that's the number one after the
four slash and so in this case we're
exporting to functions and we show with
sorry so with the first one is Square
and we pass the parameter of value and
we're multiplying and then the second
function we are showing we're
calculating the Fibonacci sequence and
we're showing some pair matching
features for showing some recursion
quite simple to understand I think quite
logical to follow Union and that brings
us to the nighties so you know kind of
previous year all these very different
languages doing crazy things theories
and we see that the 90s kind of getting
a very strong trend on how the languages
what they were doing and like Visual
Basic and Delfy were kind of saying hey
let's build cookies because they're cool
you know windows 25 and then we have
Java built one run sometimes everywhere
and
then you have Ruby and Python and
JavaScript and they were also the
languages for scripting or the web and
since I couldn't find I couldn't decide
on a language that was the friendliest I
decided on the one that was the most
common with bugs you know so you know
why not and so this brings us to the
noughties and and the trend I see
emerging here is language designers even
an enterprise level saying hey with the
launch is really over so let's try to
move this gigantic thing over to the
functional side even if it's little by
little and this is how we got Java doing
something although next ticket and we
have C sharp getting some functionality
fixtures we got an F sharp
we have Scala both other other scans I'm
have told an interviewer or whatever
that they were really looking forward
are trying to create languages in the
sweet spot between and oh wow and
functional and then we have Co which is
a systems language created by Google and
we're one of the creators of C worked as
well and can something I remember his
last name and someone said Ken Thompson
and finally we have T and V is kind of a
a multi-part I'm programming language
and it's really strange and it has some
crazy features and in here for example
were showing type classes so you can
type check on on something that is not
an interface basically which when when I
think I was C and C++ and what they can
do and then I look at this my brain just
kind of goes pow and another interesting
thing about D is that they for example
includes unit testing as a you know as a
thing that it's supported in the
language natively and and I learn loads
more this is just trying again to show
you
where we are finally we're in this
decade right and we have an elixir which
is a language that is basically Erlang
made prettier by Ruby and and I'm sure
someone will get angry about that but
whatever and then we have um yeah I know
but I really like it that doesn't you
know this is the way you see it when you
come in you're like what the hell is
this
well it's Erlang and it's good because
it's Erlang and you can do distributed
stuff but it has some better tooling it
has slightly nicer syntax and one trend
that I see in elixir and Elm and rust is
that they are really really kind of
driven by community lots of
documentation better tooling try to make
it friendlier and better in general as
opposed to like well you don't know
tough luck
which is you know very harsh when we're
so many of us coming from so many
different places in our brains and rust
is a systems programming language and
with a lot of really cool interesting
ideas about how to merge memory and
stuff like that also quite even the
supported with Firefox and and sorry
Mozilla and if they do try to make it
open and friendly and it risks is what
it is right down here he said very
sophisticated proofs and I like that
it's basically a language built on top
of Haskell where you can do slightly
more push the types further and finally
pony it's a language created for
distributed systems and they bring ideas
from it's a multi part time program
language so brings a lot of ideas from a
well and functional and also have some
crazy you know mechanism for dealing
with memories and you know very very
interesting so has some really nice
tutorials so if you have wanna have a
look you can so I had to choose a
language which was really hard actually
one thing I didn't mention is l
it's also it's kind of like an ml so it
looks very Emily
if you've done Oh camel or f-sharp
it looks quite inviting and you can not
suffer JavaScript just great and because
it renders to basically it compiles to
JavaScript and you can run it so this is
some sample of what you can do with
Idris cool so I'm tempted to let you get
one yes or it does but no I want to that
so Bernie Barry Haskel like if you see
that you know type definition and put in
here we're proofing that this vector
cannot be zero cannot be empty cool okay
so and I'll make the slides available
online as soon as this is finished so ok
and so during all this talk I've been
trying to paint this this really crude
graph right so we have in the 50s all
this languages and I try to kind of
create a bit of a spectrum in here it's
all and this lower part is declarative
oh well and in the middle is functional
and at the top all that lisp really
doesn't belong to logic but it kind of I
feel like it enabled it you know I think
that's probably the thing I disagree
with the most is basically that very top
with logic and so I thought ok this is
how I see what happened in history in
again broad strokes but it's not enough
probably not so I went and checked what
else is out there right what what else
can we what do we understand about this
paradigms and why are they important
and they're you know I think the
paradigms are good to understand because
it's could maybe give you a hint about
how to solve a problem so this is a
graph from concepts techniques and
methods of computer programming a really
really good book about paradigms and
there's also a MOOC you know an online
course so if you want to follow it that
that's out there so it starts off with
functional programming and then in this
side there's logic so
you know if we can see what we have
prologue and sequel then you have
Holly's curry then into more functional
side of things you have Lacey functional
problem we Husker L or you have a scheme
and ml on this side and then you have
you know what can you do with a DTS and
here you go more to the clarity of
message passing with Erlang and AKL and
so on so forth so that's like okay
that's that's kind of cool does it
really show the relationships between
them and you can go like well let's see
maybe there's something else out there
go so M the source thing turns out there
is this graph then someone then was
interested in theta and whatever they
went and did this with data from
Wikipedia so it's as precise as
Wikipedia so I'm sorry and I mean so the
thing here is that you see how each
sheet root so when they mentioned if I
click on a link so this will you won't
see this picture again so remember today
so when he received the language that it
influenced and that it influenced it
which is it's a really really good tool
to think about this now the problem I
have with this is that um you you can
you cannot see the weight I guess you
know for example I think if we took out
the angle from all these languages and
history would have changed forever we
would have had a universe that I don't
know what it would look like would it be
better or worse I have no idea and this
brings me to this bring me all the way
back to Hilbert right and I see a
Varrick and the marked I guess strength
for this conference and that seems to be
that we're gonna talk about philosophy
right so philosophically I think all
programming language designers have to
be philosophers because they are going
to shape how we think and and it started
off with
you know someone who I'm considered to
be a philosopher and so that's kind of
where I wanted to live in and that's
that's all thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
