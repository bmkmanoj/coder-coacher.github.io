right in the weeks before this
conference
Monica sent out a list of things that
you're supposed to do if you're gonna
get a talk and one of the things with
you should spend 15 hours on your talk
and you should rehearse it with somebody
and you should submit an abstract and
the title the upsetting title bit was
difficult because this talk was finished
well finished about 20 minutes ago title
I've seen it yeah it's a third title and
I didn't spend 15 hours on the talk
spent what we've been now to us yeah so
I didn't come to your house on Tuesday
yeah so we've had a few days yeah we've
had a few days I've been to about 40
years or 45 or 50 years thinking about
the problem and about an hour thinking
about the talk and so see what we've
come up with so anything so this is
conference driven development Sam and I
meet up at conferences and then they say
can you get a talk with it yeah yeah and
then what usually happens is what always
happened to me is you say yeah yeah and
then about two weeks before the
conference you're looking at my Google
Calendar all those four weeks before
could have booked the flight that's the
first warning and they say over what
like you know I don't know oh oh my god
am I going to go to accountant well
you're looking this one you actually
live in Stockholm oh yeah this one's
easy and then and then you google your
name and conference and you find you're
in America or somewhere like that and
then you google the title and abstract
and then you write the talk so it's
called conference bidding development
now this particular talk Sam and I were
going to talk and we thought we need a
bit of time so I invited sound to come
and stay with me
he's been camped out for a while
I was only allowed in that small corner
into adoration and and and Helen's
lovely my wife is very big I said all
right don't worry if Sam leaves all it
synthesizes all over the carpet yeah ya
know
it's alright wasn't it that's fine yeah
carpet yeah and I keep saying there's no
such thing as too many things for sizes
so she's used to it a bit so this is us
earlier in the week and then well is it
this is somebody filmed this yesterday
so so this is kind of fun man it was
sweet
so this is cool watch the panic ready
for the panic it's going to come
because I was kind of twisting these
knobs and then I had to write a program
I ought to know what right so goodness
now this this demo is SOI demo this is a
talk with a lot of sound in it and and
having done live demos for years after
Donna will remember the demo we did a
really catastrophic Alire Ong that we
never ever did a demo ever again and it
kind of burnt you totally burned me yes
okay a little bit about Sonic PI which
which I'm working with and which worth
doing it's got fantastic semantics it's
a wonderful program and it's Sam's
written it all is a large user base it's
got a simple user interface and it's
converted for me that the big thing
about is component-based we met up a
strange loop and i like sonic pine i
said them it would be great if I could
remote control it sounds like you can
remote control it all you have to do is
send a OSC message to you a UDP encoded
OSC message to port four or five five
seven four five five seven and I said
what what the hell's our C never heard
of it it's open sound control so I
googled a little bit found to get
Herbert and sound control implementation
air lang downloaded it and sent a
message to I said what's the message any
double slash run play 60 and it played
in noted play Oh which is a 60 I mean
wow that's fantastic I could control his
program with about 2 or 3 lines of code
which took me five minutes to write
including the time to search the net and
download the program and I thought
that's fantastic and then I said well
why didn't you document how you use it
is also a maddening documented the most
important thing about your program
you haven't documented well because
there's actually that's the internals
because the sorry paused all for kids to
learn how to program and using network
products don't you teach UDP to the kids
that's not yet not yet it's not on the
curriculum like sequencing conditionals
you know like iteration right and then
UDP later yes I guess I think in a
second week so very interview UDP one
about seven or eight or something
so the loads up to threads and and it's
programmed in Ruby was not just
programmed in Ruby the sonic wide
distribution hidden inside it stays
quite big hidden inside his directory
structure is a complete ruby and a
complete burst of the program called the
super collider and as of the next
version adult the next complete there's
no darling which is kind of hidden
inside the distribution to anybody gets
the sonic flyer distribution gets an
airline and not only that air lang is
now or will be will be
yep installed in raspbian all due to me
sorry you you me yes so this is the felt
this is the first time the airline will
be distributed inside the sonic PI
standard distribution and it's thanks to
sound that that's happened or asked me
by inscription yeah and there are three
finds do so I would like you to treat
that because I talking to people and he
didn't bother to mention it to me or
anybody so I you know this is the great
new and I've talked to people that that
will in its turn enable alexia
applications than any other airline
applications to be quickly ported on to
the south on to the Raspberry Pi well I
have to do apt-get install
yeah yes right for there we go
that's really good and inside sonic PI
it's programmed in this weird
programming layers called Ruby oh yeah I
mean it's a funny language lovely yeah
it's got variable scope there yeah it's
got state yeah everywhere yes and
everywhere and mutexes and lot and race
conditions and lovely Dre done safety
and all these call the phone stuff if it
played safe sorry Fred say Ruby
absolutely yeah yeah yeah capsule T&amp;amp;S
yeah right okay so now I got kind of
involved in this and we started off just
doing some simple things so I wrote a
scheduler which takes care of timing
future events and gave it to Sam I
didn't actually know if you think and
then sandwich on these last night when
we do this gig but my scheduler was
doing those beats and things so it's
also it's cool it's all using a line for
I'll explain that later yes
okay so sonic PI sonic PI is something
that's got semantics but not syntax not
a language the language the language -
especially semantics in is Ruby and the
semantics are things that Sam has
discovered in building it and so Sam's
been reinventing the wheel rather than
oh he knows you've been reinvented with
so what Sam was put into sonic PI or
Linda tuple spaces you know about Linda
literally oh yes sir
you know about Linda to put spaces okay
so when I interviewed Alan Kay I said
what was the best idea that were
floating around you know in the 80s or
the 70s that we've forgotten about and
he said one of these things that Linda
tuple spaces so if you think about air
lang and Alexia to send a message to a
process you need to know the name of the
process is sending it you need to know
the identity of the person in the tuple
spaces abstracts from that with
whiteboard abstraction you just send a
message but you don't need to send it to
anybody in particular it will be you
know if anybody happens to be listening
for that type of message it will receive
it so it layer it makes it one one stage
of abstraction simpler and it's a very
nice declarative abstraction and what
Sam had done is used Linda tuple spaces
I to match on patterns that trigger
music samples only didn't know they were
Linda super spaces and he'd also done
sing lab things if there's anybody
remember thing lab ping lab done in
small talk back in the 80s it was a
language with with live controls in and
it he'd invented that as well and he'd
invented air Liang like scheduling it
was just about getting around to
inventing error recovery when he
discovered that than the language that
already could do this yes absolutely
right I don't mean now it's also
important to point out that it started
by reinventing the wheel solid PI
because it's for teaching kids how to
program it has to pass what I call the
teacher test so teachers come up to me
and say what on earth is this system
you've built what language is it why is
it not pison and that's the absurd
discussion you have to have it's not
about which is the best language what
the right semantics are what industry is
using anything that's actually a
valuable discussion my
have outside it's about convincing this
head teacher who knows nothing about
programming why it's our Python and so
Ruby is actually quite an easy argument
a half because it's obviously very close
to Python and you'd say things like
Twitter was built in Ruby which of
course is no longer built into Ruby but
enough to say that like oh all right
that must be good then you know and so
it's not it's about social arguments
rather than practical computer science
like arguments so that's why it's in
repo so sounds built with wonderful
things got this wonderful semantics and
I kind of like fiddling around with
programming languages and abstractions
and thing what can I can I describe this
in in a slightly different way that's
slightly more convenient because I don't
want to describe things in Ruby that's
horrible
so I'm looking at the semantics of
programming languages a group that can
be used to describe music and and I
thought until Sam came on Monday but
music was the language for describing
discrete events and so it's got a piano
at home that says musical instruments
it's a discrete event machine when you
play a piano note you know it's got an
on and off you play you lift your finger
of it you can't control it off
afterwards you know if you play a violin
you got bored a little and you keep
doing some vibrator oh I know maybe yeah
maybe and he said oh you don't just do a
note all in a note off you do all these
controller changes in between us Oh
golly so I thought my language that I
played muzzling new music language
version 2 on Sunday before he came I
felt bad too versioning it's like
airline used to be able to completely
rewrite the airline system in a day so
muslim' 2 is in this state I can
completely rewrite it in a few hours so
so I thought this is the language of a
herbal brew table area Buhl's so so so
here's a knob there evil but most
language got like int X therefore static
type in the language I see you declare
the X isn't that it wasn't me no OOP I
want on vibrate
where's that girl mom let's go for that
one well we brought it what what will
you know not make something loud is it
you keep talking Joey bar nevermind okay
so doc yeah we thought languages which
they index and that's a static type I
then got like like airline exa can have
any type and then you have languages X
you don't get the type that it can be
inferred a language like like town
school but we don't want to decorate my
index we want an annotation like a knob
X because it means that it's going to be
wobbled
all right and then in your program you
could say I want to play a musical note
I want to play a C sharp for a
particular duration and at a particular
voice oh that have to declare my
variables play C sharp duration X volume
y where x and y are knobs yeah so good
so we so like a programming language
does its do anything know where this
would be a variable in your program and
you just control it I also want a
programming language that I can compose
music with so music so what accusing its
instance my piano it's discrete events
we're going to say always music - Joe
and it's not like a definite description
of all musics this is not the definition
you will find in a course in music and
musicology as my own definition and
violin is scientific kind of continuous
events and then I was going to before
solving the Pomona kind of frame caps
you like in the problem of what problem
I trying to solve
so one problem I'm trying to do it's
multi with multi-level prop it's a
difficult problem so I was retired a
couple years ago so now instead of daily
trivial problems like making telecom
systems and they're they're not very
interesting we can attack some really
difficult problems like making music so
this is much more fun so so I treated I
said them to what had these in common
philip glass thomas newman yang pearson
vogner adele and Beethoven what do they
got in common about Lex what they've all
got legs
hands yes and musically I own the
musicians composers ostinato yes yeah
ostinato Dickinson ostinato overheard
this what can you do an obstinate oh oh
yeah quickly who knows what ostinato is
yes the Italians will know stubborn it's
Italian for stubborn stubbornness right
and it's in the English word obstinate
this is the root of that is ostinato so
ostinato is repeating something again
and again and again and it's a bit I
believe it to be the basis of music so
Austin Alto is a musical phrase which is
repeated many times okay so what do we
programmers call something that's Austin
altar what the program is called
something that's repeated many times a
looper for loop or a while loop or
something like that so programmers years
before programming language had invent
or musicians had invented while loops
only because there were no programming
languages they didn't know they were
wildly right so ostinato with the while
loop it plays an important part in
improvised music cyclic speaking is not
these are from the Wikipedia strictly
speaking it's not exact repetition exact
repetition is boring because why do I
think this sounds nice I think it that
says it's the next slide wait a moment
something that is repeated time and time
again your brain kind of thinks it's
nice because your brain recognizes
patterns there's a musical pattern that
repeats and you think it's nice but if
it just repeats it's boring so it needs
to it need to change slightly so I was
looking at it for examples of this and
if I can see the ostinato I don't I can
read music anybody read music good well
well done okay for the others who can't
read music music is really easy to read
we read it from left to right it's time
for time goes from left to right and
pitch goes up and down
so the notes written the top of the
store it's the high-pitched note and if
it's down the bottom it's a location
note and the duration is done by how you
filled in the note so what you can see
there one more thing is well actually
which i think is actually quite
beautiful if you notice there's actually
three sets of lines each of those lines
is actually concurrency they're all
playing at the same time so you got time
you've got pitch and you go concurrently
I mean it's expressing concurrency and
parallelism sequential code in that
direction concurrent code in that
direction and this is that this is a
pattern that repeats if you look at the
top line you always see it repeats four
times and then it changes slightly it
drops the bottom note if you look at it
then it repeats four terms it drops the
bottom note has a base note that's going
down one at a time and it sounds like
this what's there so why doesn't it go
on play your bastard pre-recorded Jersey
- that's my sound examples
 when I press the button on it then
this damn bloody Keane has the play
button first prizm what's happening
we just going to this why here again
it's look it stopped going the wires not
going anywhere
not as infirm oh
how'd you get sound out of that thing
when there's a wire this is the most
important part of this talk is the
sounds that come out of the frigging
thing we must have pulled it out gently
yeah right okay so let's go back all
right
okay so and if you could see the
repetition that's ghost ronaldo and you
see the falling base coat
okay so keep that in your in your mind
now where did the Dell get that music
from where did you get that melody from
and why was it so popular because she
stole it from Beethoven right if we look
at Beethoven the moonlight sonata you'll
notice exactly the same structure almost
exactly the same key Jesus added a
single sharp to the key but she's using
the same key these little funny little
things that the front tell you whether
to sharpen or flatten the note and it's
pretty much the same
this sculpturally is the same as the
dell it's quite nice and I'm going to
ask the question later how do we
describe this encode right
and then for example another one that's
just repeated in lots of little loops is
Philip Glass morning passages
we were next reading dance are you
that's lovely I mean it's good books
this is it from a film called the hours
which is a wonderful film and it's the
music of Philip Locke
I thought Philips well when I discovered
Philip Glass I saw all this all this
music you hear on TV when that
inadvertent is all Philip Glass but it's
not there's a group of three composers
all there they all sound like Philip
Glass
Paul Newman networks and them human and
yeah so so my theory is that music is
reputation plus variation our brains
like to recognize patterns and our
brains like variation and these are the
minimalists that Philip Locke Thomas
Newman van tiresome and vogner now I
thought were I was a minimalist a
minimalist is one who repeats things
over and over again how could anybody
say that vogner was a minimalist by the
way this is where the talk ends because
Joe's not going to stop talking about
Valda now for the next two hours just
artists be warned it just so happens I
quite like vogner all right and I was
always been looking about this evidence
of vandalism in work and I found
Friedrich Nietzsche had written that
vogner was was a minimalist why did he
say that because Vilas Ring cycle is
based from these like a hundred odd
light motif
which are repeated over and over and
over and over and over and over again so
it becomes hypnotic the affective
fantastic so oh yeah ah that's a kind of
proof of concept I wanted to think about
that can I take an entire work like this
and transcribe the easily into musical
notation and to something that sounds
nice should I play a bit to that why not
okay so this is them oh let's see oh you
know which oh no actual skip over that
ask I think you shouldn't play it
actually that's might know I won't good
idea if I can't find out how to do it
right but that is something that's going
to be my first proof of concept can I
can I describe that in an algebraic way
that's pretty short and then make make
it sound nice and it's very important to
me that it sounds nice right so it made
a little language and you see it looks
kind of like that if you take the first
two bars of I'm going to bake a cake and
you look at the top melody I just made
this to the language C 5 C is just the
note 5 his octave 5 at 16 it's a
sixteenth of a note in here semiquaver
and then a four because I've changed
octave and I repeat it 16 times so kind
of simple syntax and yeah so just like a
good impression algorithm really sorry
you're compressing that sequence yeah
yeah I mean it's just a simple algorithm
and here it's sort of just a little
fragment of code something in brackets
or a top-level the sequence of things is
it means sequential composition or
sequential just play one note off the
other book curly brackets around them
that's sort of a chord it's not really a
chord it means play these three things
inside starting at the same time that's
all it means they could be different
lengths and their various rules about
how default values are propagated inside
scopes and things and a star we have to
repeat three times yes I mean so it's a
very simple programming but you're
retreating it's right up yeah but that's
not music is it is it not no what is it
this is
listen is yet for some Don invited the
divisor help masterfully feel
I mean this is only 15 and a half hours
so I won't do you want to see it all
oh did warn you
okay so soul or debarred no right here
and stuff like this okay it took him 26
years and it was so I think it's 2,000
pages of text and if you look at the
original manuscripts he wrote this with
a little quill pen
poor sod I mean it's really really
difficult and then somebody else had to
engrave it and transcribe it so what do
we see here
well we see things that are repeated
that's repetition we see things that are
reused once they've been defined what
are they we've got a name for them
they're called macros or subroutines or
something like that so to want a
language that we can express music in
it's got to sound nice though because if
we write something in this language and
it sounds crap then it's no good okay so
the next thing is we need it to sound
nice
and that means know somebody let me know
Moke sorry no partner palace person it's
not Memphis cool Bob Moog who made this
entire but I thought with Moog
synthesiser you see alright yeah cuz
drone strong yeah okay so what I want is
a virtual orchestra but I think I have
in my front room and it plays everything
so I've got one I thought I bought an
orchestra it's about it's about 800
pound or something like that and
yep okay so after virtual officer that
there are no real instruments in that
you're saying but this is sampled
instruments and the offensiveness
program that's playing them back for the
input to that is a stream of MIDI events
the output it music though on earth as a
MIDI event will appear I'm just doing
this okay for me immediately didactic
well everybody knows that video even
you're not giving the tour now with the
event adult over here you who don't read
the events or yeah there you are there's
half of them so the other half so it's
just a very simple protocol for sending
my dad yes from keyboards to
synthesizers or from keyboard cities and
essentially it maps onto the keyboard so
you hit a key and it sends a note on
events yes you release the key it sends
a note off event if you hit the key hard
it sends a high velocity and soft it
sends a low velocity there's a bunch of
stuff it does as well but they're from
from what you're doing here there's the
maintain aspect and and all these things
all these little boxes they all talk
MIDI in fact MIDI is it minis amazing
because if you buy a MIDI device plug it
into your computer and start the browser
it's the only device I know of that can
send signals out of a machine into
external hardware without any fuss so
it's really well supported it's very old
primitive very old thing and just to
show it to you this is a standalone this
is the programmer I paid some money for
which is the Aria player and I'm just
running a little keyboard widget this is
just about the simplest setup you could
have because all in software and I'll
show you that here's C with the orea
player here's the Aria player OOP no
that's not the Aria player so it's right
up this end here like that that's the
Aria player and it's got a little
keyboard which I didn't playing some
piano notes and it's got clips here's a
little keyboard here's a little keyboard
and
and if you look at that you see this
channel let's say channel 1 and I've
loaded channel 1 in the are a player
with with a Steinway concert grand piano
and so if we play on the little MIDI
keyboard here it'll play quite decent
canna notes and if I change the channel
to 2 like that
I've got a combo okay so can load that
up with orchestral samples sixteen on
because the 16 MIDI channels and then I
can create a program that generates that
stuff and we're on the road to being
able to produce music with a computer
when Joe says music humans Bogner just
to be clear yeah well I expect me to
either bargainer that's the goal
because might earth proof of concept to
do all the vital dogma and light motif
so they sound good right okay so let's
let's look at some textual input that
takes a language like this generates a
stack sort of machine first of all we
got this language that describes music
and the output of this stage will be
MIDI events and will feed them into the
virtual orchestra right so I've got to
make muzzling to to demonstrate this so
we need a shell actually do do yeah we
can do this make must line two
and off we go starting Joe's amazing
Muslim to found Garrett impersonal
orchestra testing that the orchestra
players have not fallen asleep playing
the piano scale
playing the trombone scale playing the
Varden Aryan LIF waiting to enter your
musical masterpiece right
Oh a rat of a fourth yes thank you very
much and now we got to this point so a
lot of fun choosing while this lady was
going to say most landable and choosing
the correct boy smuggling to play so if
we do looks like play a piano and then
what do you look like
oh they asking me baby see I mean that's
a lovely melody isn't that beautiful
that's about that that's nice isn't it
yeah or we could say no well how about
CBC eg that might be better right there
you go
I thought it was a chord can you make it
a bit bigger Joseph you can see oh can
you see it
sorry no okay here over well let's make
the window bigger yeah okay yeah that's
good thank you very much
okay scroll up a bit yeah let's move the
window pretty well whatever there now
don't do this to me okay where's the
 all right what oh now that's
where jar by the way so get a pounder
yes well right so that's just a little
course they want to repeat it ten times
like this
yep repeated works and if you want to
put that in a you know so well maybe you
want to play something you want to play
I don't know you want to play a C and E
energy like that and you want to do that
and you want to do that you want to do
this and you want to do that so I don't
know yeah let's put that hundred times
now an advocate set a delay to little
gear and it's not every as long as
bloody vault and steal stuff Vegas and
like that
I mean it's not the best food in the
world
right so it's enough that's if you like
the programmatic way of getting into
this program and it's going to be one of
the relevant point it's a good starting
point that's not the only way let's get
back to the slides so where the hell are
the slides down there
Oh what are that's music window there we
go and play again so there we have one
or two little sound samples okay so I
also wanted to I want to have multiple
representations for different users and
for different purposes so I thought well
how do you how would you edit this stuff
and turn it into a musical notation
circle well you write the browser is
actually quite easy to work with so so I
stick this stuff in the browser and run
it here so we've got a little thing in
the browser let's see if it works and if
you can move the focus of attention of
the lesson platinum and sharpen them and
move them up and down and I take out the
occipital know that yeah we move we move
this note down and then move sharp
flattening sharp area maybe want to move
for a while want to move all the notes
and we could connect that to some proper
music limits and sounds of cases so we
could do that as well and then of course
we want musical notation to come out of
it and of course we're de melon Oh what
do you mean by musical notation well
proper proper manuscripts that musician
can play so we want to write stuff like
that now the typist if you think
typesetting text is easy this is my
proof of concept typeset that I mean if
I could try to set that you might
realize these are difficult subproblems
but this is a sub problem it's not the
main problem I mean this bit here
whenever I heard you highlight which bit
tap it that bit upper back can you play
that bit of know your thing no but I
could play that bit do you know if
somebody has actually pled this into a
synthesizer and played this stuff sound
good no it sounds bloody awful but it
but it's really this is this music this
guy am what's its name John Stumpf
Google John Stumpf if you want to find
the most beautiful music manuscripts the
most beautiful music engraving on the
planet nobody actually knows if it's
cool John Stumpf if you google him
you'll find an obituary and if I'd all
these documents written by his
apparently his children but there is
apparently no evidence that he actually
lived so so we don't know if John Stumpf
lived or not this is a bit of a bit of a
surprise so let's go back to this what
are we doing I've got a good question
what are we doing I don't know we're in
the talks it was it clear what we're
doing yeah kind of lost somewhere right
a moment so let's go back to this and
play yeah so so we got this browser
input yep oh what a matter and I haven't
suggest that's text input who can text
me input in their browser input visual
input yeah I mean in this kind of thing
and then of course keyboard input when
we connect a MIDI keyboard to play it in
and then so what problems I want at all
what are the primitives I need let's see
so four inputs
I want text I want the browser or the
keyboard to output I want synthesizers
synthesized music Orcas it's all this
kind of stuff here funny roots that I'm
strong mmm
how do you present mogh like rogue vogue
yeah but in Rome Rogue rogue with an M
yes yep rogue within them and I want I
want output synthesizer mogh outputs and
I want engravings and I want some tools
recording post editing improving and
taking over I've been thinking about
taking over for years taking over it
would be and I want to play like get
them
things rush Menelaus to piano concerto
and it's really you know it it starts
really Dada da-da-da-da-da-da I was
really easy to talkative and they get
the role of goes completely berserk so
my idea there is if we could synchronize
the music there just by watching what
I'm doing and then at the point where I
give up the computer desk of takes over
for a bit and there's a hard bit for you
it does a heartbeat fine we work on
computers for I mean musicians all over
the world would thank me today I think
these bloody concert pianists they could
have the bird at and move their hand and
if they move the piano so you couldn't
see their fingers on the keyboard this
could be really big it could be great
cheating Joe cheating cheating cheating
helping never think I thought which
either could try and build if I as a
music improver because when I'm
practicing the piano
Sam said I should have log at everything
I don't have a log of everything I do so
a prank can open our I'd have a MIDI
file log the log sis and I thought wait
a moment
I'm practicing the same bars over and
over again ee up dah dah I don't yes but
sometimes I play it correctly other
times I played incorrectly and I thought
well the Craig's notes probably are the
same each time and the incorrect notes
are probably random so if I can sync it
and average them I have like a button
that will improve and it would come out
beautiful be lovely yeah lovely and I
reckon realistically this this is the
sort of program we could probably write
in between five and ten years I should
think for sure yeah if we give enough
conferences so we have those little
conference book development days before
they but yes we'll get more to prevent
get it will get oh yeah not bad though
yeah no yep
okay so sonic inducer program oh yeah
Roma if this is now sort of another
lecture
you know I do lectures you see I'll give
the last lecture I gate which was in
London code unless we did a thing
together and I take that lecture and
then edit it with some stuff in the fuzz
we've got the old lectures at the end in
case we use bits of it so so this was
the road map for
I tell him how to use filling pot
laughing mm very good
we have read come on since then and we
had a goal make it is it read it in the
last one it was make it distributed and
we're so far you've been doing or Mormon
so far we've been doing it all on mama
tree and here here yeah there any cables
is a distribution cable it's a magic
cable and it's a music down the cable
isn't that my I don't mean that
marvelous what you mean like you've seen
them and me my here and then Sam can
start a program over there on his thing
yep which is connected to a Moog
synthesizer and we can take the muddling
and instead of piping it to my little
Orca still with you I've got my virtual
orchestras sitting inside my computer
just waiting to obey me I can send the
music down the wire to you
great yeah true try that yeah yeah yeah
yeah speaker work it's gonna work you
sure no no no I like right but it's what
I mean most of you think'll actually
work so far yeah okay overnight code I'm
quite confident yeah it's running
already right okay we're off we're off
we've got a chair killer which wind
anything you can play with these knobs
okie knobs on wait a minute let's see
all right talk girl B how can we have
both the screens at once that possible
no no no it know that we're not in that
window because I'd already started it to
avoid to save time oh yeah yeah well in
that window so already started it and
let's do this cuz I'm now sending the
down the wire playing the bargain arian
roof
to really change the knobs
that's better twiddle the knobs that it
sounds like vogner
no let's do dis a Metropolitan order
come on coming up Bob based on passion
they're the only it needs a drum that
synced to the beat to do that we can do
that right now cuz you ain't got the
right tempo well we almost got here I
think I've shown you almost got it right
well actually I think I probably could
do a drum the same time let's just try
to answer since that works there are
timing issues timing is really hard
timing is really hard and Aer Lingus
timing very well perhaps so does sonic
fine
yeah but only part of time we really
we're learning does timing really bill
so they can't agree on what the time is
right again Joe sitting in sitting in
okay drums let's do let's do this
playing with ordinary English so you
want like a contract this is this needs
a bit of work on it
I don't timewise now when do we finish
I've no idea anybody know when we finish
somebody how long has he known now oh
we've got 20 minutes left 3 2 minutes
left
you're useful 22 hours I'm run out of
stuff early but yeah that Faulkner never
Bogner thank you thank you so much oh no
no I got nothing to do if that sounds
like Vogue now I've got all this stuff
to do I mean it's awful lot of work you
don't know how busy I am with this stuff
and it's really I've got time to do
anything else
no it'll slice no because I think I was
going to do the first half and you're
going to do the second time yeah yeah
we're going to rehearse it together and
go through it once because Monica said
we should rehearse it did we rehearse we
rehearsed a few times yeah yeah okay
well our diof rehearsing are listed make
sure the programs can pardon once maybe
might make sense to summarise what you
just said sorry if you summarize what
you've just said and I maybe I'll
explain it yes okay so what one of the
longer if you noticed the way that we've
been addressing this problem is with I
think this slide would kind of give you
the notion of it because this it's kind
of the essence of things but built a
small components that do one thing well
this dis Orchestra only can play musical
sample you send it MIDI events play note
on channel one stops playing note on
channel one and controller changes it
doesn't have anything else at all this
keyboard thing only sends events to
something it's a widget it at one thing
and it does it well a keyboard one thing
and it doesn't like that and what what I
just recently Sam came and showed me a
graphical widget it's the best GUI I've
ever seen and I've actually really good
what it's called this some
in school in score in score is amazing
it's a research project in France and
the GUI is super super good I run in
score you know time you've got time why
I got time yeah I don't know if I can I
have a talk well no no I just sort of
talked it up a bit but wait a mo what I
felt badly yeah because it is an
inhibiting score directory and if you
start in winner let's see well I don't
know what happened to click on leaving
welcome - oh that was my search getting
South shut up no yeah oh yes I do but I
wanted to show you what oh forget it I
can't show you playing with it but in
scores wonderful because it's the only
go I know when you start it has no menus
it have no control it has no nothing
they only have absolutely nothing and it
just pops up a window that's it and it
doesn't do anything at all and it sits
there and if they're sending me messages
well it doesn't even say that you have
to know you send it messages and what
you send it you send it UDP messages to
port 7000 which contains scalable vector
graphics and it prints them so this
brilliant purple text wasn't there you
have to send them s now I have to send a
load above under messages to do that but
this means it's a completely isolated
widget it doesn't do anything at all
right that's really useful thing but
don't do anything but you can remote
control them and if you look at the
sonic PI and it Sam will show you that
I'll just show you what we would like to
do if you look at a program like this I
don't want to be nasty about it so I
won't be nasty about it where is it gone
let's take somebody like this Logic Pro
ok so this is a typical program it's
actually very good program out I won't
fault it on that but but look look at
this thing I mean let's see if I know
what's happening these these are called
digital audio workstations they are just
about the most complicated programs on
the planet using the MS YZ once you've
learnt one you've got to find out where
all the frigging menu there there are
things hidden in menus 10 levels deep
and this
because the notion that these people
have are the people that use these
things cannot program at all
they cannot express anything in code so
everything you have to do has to be done
by clicking the mouse and dragging in
stretching it and do horrible t they are
appalling ly bad interfaces for somebody
who knows how to program something if
I've got if I say well I hear little
melodies that are repeated four times
it's the brackets commerce for in an
interface it's just got one window and I
type text in and it's light sets it and
plays it and of everything and we want
to turn the architect we want to keep
the simplicity of sonic PI so that we
can teach to children but when you open
it up and look at how it's built under
the under the counter I want to make it
out of these message-passing components
so you're not saying specifically the
graphics are bad it's just that when you
actually try and throw all the things
the interaction and the display in the
same place yes extremely complicated yes
yes so family tell a bit about the sonic
pile cuz I mean it's built from the
supercollider versa do you want to tell
them about that or I want to show them
maybe you shall them yep results are
always good but what can you do with it
15 minutes left can you see the sonic PI
stuff yeah is it best to have black or
white or said what's your preference
black this is a nightclub mode so if
you're in schools you often use this
button nightclub did a performance where
I only had the white and the people said
it's lovely but it's just too bright so
we have the done nightclub mode and so
sonic pie is just an editor and it's
trying to be like Joe's saying so it's a
simple environment you can send messages
to it and also its editor as well
because what you really want is to make
sure that new users can just work
straight away with it so I don't know if
you've used any of you used music coding
systems we fall as a whole bunch of
really cool languages out there that can
make music with text variety different
languages like Haskell ones and closure
ones and Ruby ones and Lua ones what
tends to happen is they they work like a
nice library for the language but to use
it you need to build bring in your own
editor over an environment so for you
guys and ladies that's not necessarily a
problem because you're already
programmers so you're very used to using
quite sophisticated environment
late text that's your job but if we're
trying what's so important to stress
here is that when we sort of discuss our
audience that Joe is really talking
about what he would like to do in terms
of our dinner and but the simplification
is important as well because it what
that allows you to do is it allows you
to to engage a broader audience so once
you've got a simple language hopefully
and get more people using it and so with
sonic PI my audience isn't just people
like yourselves who are already
programmers my audience is actually not
you really it's everybody else who can't
program because what I'm trying to do is
to demonstrate the creativity of code
I'm trying to lower the barrier to entry
specifically to the creativity of code
and so if your barrier to entry is open
Emacs
it's not going to really work is it you
know and so or even compiling a program
is already a lot of work so you go into
the terminal you going to write the
compiled thing to open the shell that's
which maybe if you're a professional
programmer very trivial activities to do
but for non-programmers each of these
activities becomes a barrier and after
one or two they're just not interested
you need to lower that barrier what I
get to save is a lot of components we
build what we want to build with the
architecture we want is a pure message
pass component-based architecture what
will go into these things are messages
you can think of them as MIDI messages
going in and MIDI messages going out and
knob messages controlling it so if you
had the abstract of this of the MIDI
going in MIDI going out control signals
control by Nazis would be standard
components they communicate using UDP
and they are encoded in this open sound
control language now this is a very very
simple language and the nice thing about
that is we can we can make the baggage
and infrastructure so that you can write
these in Erlang or Alexia or Ruby or
Python or Perl or any bloody language
you feel like sure and then then you
have the next level of started wiring
these things together and that's for
we're not if you're a programmer and
what I'm trying to talk about here is
that there are a lot people who want
programmers yet yeah and so we want to
try and make sure that their barrier to
entry is low and so I think that once
you can program then you can sort do all
these things where you can't program you
need an environment you can just open up
straightaway and type stuff in and run
the code and get errors
straight away so this is what something
PI's trying to be and so I go into
schools and just get them to write
something like this then they can make
some sounds and so this is a simplest
program I can think of making work but
what's fun now is like typically in
schools I would just talk about
abstractions and functions right play
the function 70s in abstraction it's a
number that can go up and go down
abstractions really mapped onto other
things the world pitch hamster you up
and down so because we've got that
isomorphism between the two things we
can now choose a higher number and guess
what's get a higher note right so we can
get the kids here what's actually fun of
this point I think because we've gotten
to all this talking about message
passing and opens language roll and MIDI
what actually happens here is when I run
that code that text is in the GUI okay I
run the code the GUI then takes up text
and sends it to network to a server
which then evaluates that code the
evaluation that code does a whole bunch
of stuff figuring out what the
parameters are some triggering
synthesizers there's lots of default
parameters and then send another message
to another process as three separate
processes involved which is the
supercollider synthesis engine which
then plays the sound and so we actually
start to talk about the fact that we
actually have a nice or you were talking
before about this message a message out
already or that's why no code we've got
three separate processes passing
messages between each other now what's
really fun is that we don't necessarily
have to send the message within the
machine itself
I can send messages to external devices
so instead of saying play I can say MIDI
one and that will now send a message to
my synthesizer which you can hear and
this isn't played in super clear it's
not the sound isn't coming from the
computer the sound is coming from the
synthesize actually both of these
synthesizers played at once so in this
case what's happening is the GUI is
sending the text to the Ruby server the
Ruby server then is developers detecting
and you're playing MIDI notes it's then
sending a message to Erlang Erlang is
then scheduling that message to happen
at the right time thanks to Joseph
decode that message then goes to another
process which turns that the open sound
control protocol into something called
MIDI which we discussed before which
then goes out to these devices so we
have this nice to a function pipeline
of processes or communicating with each
other nicely over simple protocols and
the other thing I would like to say is
if people talk about building systems
out of multiple languages this is
actually built using C++ Rou GUI yeah L
the scheduler and the closure for the
synthesizer designs okay
yeah and then the supercollider was
written in C++ these are actually pretty
complicated programs and they're all
interfacing together very nicely but
they don't they're not linked together
that's the big mistake if you link
things together they run in the same
memory space so errors can propagate
between one other they're done properly
with message passing components between
them yes and probably f-sharp as well
yeah but I didn't show you this sharp
it's it's a shot on the keyboard yes so
what I'm showing now is how to generate
events from solid mile does this self
but earlier Joe was sending me messages
from his muslin three four five which
version is it three down this down this
data wire to my system and what's
interesting to see here this is the
latest version on the bottom right you
can see this thing moving around can you
see that so when I control a devices
which are connected to Sonic PI
automatically all the bells go in and
knob variable not variable absolutely
and what what what I think two are
interesting is this is an event log it's
a persistent event log that allows Pat
matching over it and it's the complete
memory of all the events which into the
system and so I could not just go back
in time and replay events I can wait for
the next events I can see the previous
events I can see event from from five
minutes ago because here's a secret from
the last bar so there's lots of really
fun things you can do when you have this
persistent event store and what we were
doing before is we Joe was studying
these messages and so maybe Joe if you
can send the message again yeah so
you'll be able to see in the event log
if I refuse you ready yeah playing the
Varden Arian list
so you can see the message coming in
from Joe system now you can't see the
code that was already running evaluated
a different buffer but you can actually
see what's going on and actually the
code which is running is this this is
what you're hearing and so this is the
sonic by doing something a bit more
non-trivial than just play 60 or MIDI
you for in this case I've got two two
things the first one is this lexical
closure here this reverb closure
basically sets up a reverb context
switch as echoey sounds and then has
these two live audio functions which are
reading audio from the sound card and
then just piping out to the sound card
so if you've got a multi-channel sankar
with 16 inputs and guitars and singers
then you can start using the input 1
input 2 and compile them out you give
them e to this separate name so this
just sets up sonic PI to read audio from
two channels in add reverb and then
output it to the standard channel so
that's allows me to hear the
synthesizers but they're not being
triggered they need to be you need to
send these MIDI events and so this is
what these live loops are now live links
are very similar to Erlang processes
they just run they're a thread construct
they're just using ruby threads but
they're also this looping structure so
it's like a it's a process in Erlang
which calls a function which is tella
cursive which calls itself but it has a
special property that the telcos live
call the end of the function uses the
name space so the reference is a
function every time so it allows you
actually between iterations to modify
the behavior as it's playing we see what
that means in a second but I'll answer
to live code and then we've got this
what you would call receive in Erlang
sync I call and select private it's sort
of synching with music
I'm syncing on this incoming message
which matches what you can see in the
event queue on the right-hand side so
waiting that message to come in and then
I'm pulling out the two values that Joe
is sending to me one is this MIDI
channel which I'm not doing anything
with and then to the B is the notes as
if it's a failing with a crappy syntax
basically yeah you can you can be
offensive if you want but it works and
seems to get what it doesn't have is you
have pattern-matching left-hand side
which would be beautiful to be perfectly
honest and at this point what this does
which Erlang doesn't do Joe what
so Erlang sinks and waits for an event
to come in right that's the important so
typically when we programming what we
care about it's whistling concurrency is
do a bunch of stuff wait for it to
finish and then do some more stuff right
but don't do this until this is finished
so you can send a message to say I've
done my things you can carry on so this
this does that but it also in that
message to say I'm ready it sends a
logical clock so what we care about a
music isn't that I do this when you've
finished I care about I do it on beats
when you've finished so it's really
important not just to wait - something's
happened before you start to actually to
start at the same time so let's
implicitly share these logical clocks
which now means that a sample now
inherits the logical clock of the
message that came in I'm playing this
bass drum house which is a drum sample
and the MIDI note on message to my
synthesizers note that and that's
matching the note on I got one for the
note off as well so I've got in this
case I've got two threads running at
once this one just sets the context of
and finishes these are actually
persistent running threads one for note
off messages one side on messages and
then they took the message out and then
the audio comes in and then we add
reverb so we're starting to see now
actually quite a sophisticated example
where we're using multichannel midi
multi-channel audio at all the same time
but each of these constructs here this
is really key for for schools I can
teach the ten-year-old child this is
really really important that makes sense
yeah and so are we got five bits left at
this point I think it's really important
to talk about these thinking but also
the live loop structures as well because
when Joe's sending these messages in if
you can if you can send the things again
yeah playing with ordinary and literally
I can delete the drum
and they've gone right I can add a drums
back in I didn't work right I can I can
change this doesn't me out or after I
won like a let's whatever I and so what
I'm able to do with this live loop is
I'm able to modify its behavior as it's
running and what's really important is
it's not losing any time because I'm
threading this logical clock three rare
you've discovered live code upgrade yes
absolutely but temporal thirty years
after we temp all live code upgrade Joe
so yeah where we didn't want to find a
behaviour also make sure them in time
and what does that really mean right so
let's let's say I have like a live look
call foo and here I'm playing a sample
called loop industrial right and I'm
speech stretching out to one bar and I'm
Steeve the one - right right lovely
right and then I have another live loop
called no beats and I'm just playing
sample bass drum house like this and I'm
sleeping for half a beat now I've got
these two things the same time you hear
well that sounds like like this stuff
without the drums with the drum right so
what's interesting is when you're
performing you're doing this kind of
modification but you also do this right
I knew and you break the thread it's at
this point and then I broken it I need
to fix it so I delete the mistake and I
started again doesn't sound quite right
yet can you hear that doesn't sound
right so this is where this is
difference we say an ER line approach
and sonic PI approaches it what we
really would care about is I'm running
the threads against unable to stop and
be able to deal the recovery here able
to recover the other threads are still
running my whole system hasn't come down
and still people can still dance to the
the things which are still running I'm
able to recover from the error we start
the thread I'm off again that's great
but it sounds rubbish because they're
not in synchronization with each other
right and that's what you care about
music you don't particularly care about
that and lots of other programming
context for that music you do and so
this this thread system we talked about
so there's the event system coming in I
use within the system itself it doesn't
have to be from Joe's machine or the
MIDI devices I can actually these live
loops when they go rounds we can see on
the right hand side they're sending
these q / vu + Q shots q / beats events
internally so what I can actually do is
I can make a mistake
blow the thread delete it but ask it to
synchronize on food right so what it's
going to do now is I'm just going to
receive it's going to wait and come back
in time right so I'm able to not just
have multiple threads running
simultaneously you cover from error but
also be able to bring the threads back
in synchronization a brawler conductor
yes precise out here at all Chrissy go
boom from there or they all play at the
same time wonderful and the cool thing
is now we've work on this distribution
thing the same system and working
internally to do this I can actually
start syncing across with multiple
machines and then start to think about
having a band of these things and also
have it at different cities so we can be
I could be in Cambridge you can be stuck
in a jam together we could distribute
the control yep look at 15 hours of the
organization could be changing what's
happening absolutely so make sense so we
watch not just not just caring about
concurrency here which we really do care
about also really caring deeply about
time and what that might mean I'm making
sure that that's threaded was in the
language but also in a way that you'd
have to explicitly talk about it as much
as you might do in other systems because
I want to make it simple enough for 10
year old kids and in this case what I
find super interested in is that kids
would when I would give a like lesson
they do play there were 17 seat for one
play for whatever 675 and and then they
would load loop this right this would be
their program to it right within a
couple of hours and then they would
write another program as comment this
out and then it's write another program
Oh didn't paste it come on sound there
we are let's come at this on there and
this one is doing that sample bass drum
house and then sleep for half a beat so
I have two loops right and so they would
if within the first few hours of working
with kids they want to do this right and
they run it
and obviously is not playing them both
at the same time is it because obviously
you all could all clearly see we're in
an imperative context the loop is like a
black hole that sucks the programming
context in and doesn't let it go so the
program never gets down to that first
loop to play the second loop and so this
high fibers I find this really
fascinating because that the kids would
say how do I do this and I'm in a school
and there's a very clear computer
science curriculum that's been created
by the government and that says what the
kids should learn and that's really it
has to be inside this box and that list
does not include concurrency does not
include digital programming doesn't
include event logging it does include
crew to include sending messages across
networks right and so the answer if I'm
being a strict teacher and teacher mode
is sorry you can't do that right and
that's a problem because kids don't like
the answer but you have to say that
because the teachers not going to to
listen to oh let's do threads right
because they haven't got time it's not
space they're letting man so this is
where as a programmer you sneak in
things right so this is where the alive
loop came in because he just just
changed her live route and then run it
and oh you get an error because live
loops are musicians and musicians have
names so this one's Sam and this one's
Joe and now they're playing the same
time so this is a case where you can
sort of sneak in these constructs in a
way that the teachers don't realize you
do concurrency kids are happy right but
the syntax is pretty much identical but
the semantics are actually much more
rich and interesting
well you laughing at oh I look cool you
don't like the syntax oh you're an inner
line programmer so yeah I like the
semantics I mean the writers think it's
nice yeah okay good yeah there's a
single elixir Joe it's pretty cool yes
yes nice nice syntax not to doubt I was
thinking I mean this is this is struck
by Justin's talks as keynote this
morning he said you know write program
in a light you know the button or a
light that flashes I mean not a button
to press could we can do this right
pressing buttons of anything impressive
but neither of em rest you can see the
vents coming in the bottom right ask
mano and grid key so now I need to
create a live loop called foo I
synchronize on what's coming in mono and
grid key and I'm going to do a sample
bass drum Harris like we said before now
you can press it which one ne ne ne ne
all of them yeah a compass all of that
we could if you wanted to yeah okay now
I notice a delay there because sonic PI
also allows its latency to make sure the
timing is working so I can actually
change it say use real time now it's
doing it for note on and off so I can
actually just pull out the X the Y and
the value of this and XY value equals
sync and then I say on V do this now
you've got any one you press it lovely
but bass drum on its own that's not so
fun so I could play like a oh you could
do you change the pitch thing to our
pitch three it's getting up to 370 oh
you want it on the actual on to on the Y
value okay go okay we presented a new
musical instrument right so you can do
some of that what's also quite fun I I
will just show this is wicked right so
he's going what I can do is I can put in
external samples I've done horse like
this key bit by the Elam you know the
dirt but that's a gauge of play the
Volta machine so I can actually play
like a ball and make it sound like a
trumpet or saddle as an anvil it's good
to see I can't read either there so here
I've got the full sample right which is
not what you want think of a yeah I just
saw again but what you can do is when
you're working with programs it's really
fun to think of these abstractions is
that I put that full sample of all the
drums or stuffs on the program but
actually what I want to do is play one
of the drums like maybe the second or
the first or the third so I can say on
set Y which is the Y value coming here
now I've got different drums on here and
I can do that with arpeggiators here so
you can start to really play around
so is that your anvils I good enough I
can change on the pitch my why so but
you sort of see how with a very small
amount of code you can start to do
interesting interactions between
external devices and the sound and the
cool thing is now is that we have
instead of just doing the sounds doing
MIDI we can set our arbitrary messages
across the network and they're all very
well timed so you have an endpoint you
write Erlang we can send you messages to
that and we can trigger your lights if
you've got on a Raspberry Pi weaving
tree or whatever you want to do spinning
things or whatever in a very well time
connect the lights in so begin when the
DMX Joe that's the future of lights here
so we could totally do like DMX things
and control whole light rigs all the
live well if you are if your list has an
API yes yes
so make sense yeah yeah we're good cool
yeah cool are we done
oh we I mean like those Francesca's does
that have like did that have any kind of
like a narrative to it I'm not sure this
is work in progress you know so
absolutely and we haven't okay so from
my perspective what I've gone and
fascinated by the fact is that that the
more local Erlang the more I see really
lovely semantics but I'm I have already
instantly find a really math way which
I'm learning how to improve well I'm
also extending the Erlang pods and so if
anyone what's actually helped me and
work on this you could if you have Ruby
programmers you can get involved if you
C++ programmers can get involved but if
you work on the beam you could also get
involved as well and what I see from my
point of view is is an incredible amount
of hard work that's done in the back end
of synthesizer this stuff is by no means
easy and if you think it's difficult to
do it on one machine making it
multi-platform so it runs on Windows
Linux and and OSX is confirmed it yeah
but it's a bugger of a lot of work for a
specific definition of fun yeah yeah but
you've already filled the swear box so I
can't say yeah no but it is it is an
awful lot of work to make this stuff
work but I think if we think the nicest
thing about sonic PI well I mean the end
result that the totality is it is very
good but the architecture is
such a petite condense extensible
architecture based on message parsing
and I think it's the most complex
message-passing application I've ever
seen but it's far more complicated to
the telephone exchange that sounds good
to me
yes I'll say that yeah but that's done
with hundreds of people yeah okay we're
done I'm done thank you we're done thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
