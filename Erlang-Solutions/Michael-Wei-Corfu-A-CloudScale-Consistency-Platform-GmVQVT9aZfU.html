Group I work on this platform called
Corfu it's a cloud scale consistence the
platform Elly's that's what we've been
calling it and a brief outline of the
talk I'm gonna give today I'm gonna
start by kind of motivating the
corporate work by talking about how
distributed systems are built today and
how Corfu wants to or its kind of built
to address kind of a issue we've
observed with distributed systems being
built today then I'll follow with what
Corfu is I'm gonna go over Corfu value
proposition and kind of a brief overview
of the internals of Corfu and exactly
how corporate work so hopefully you'll
get an idea of how the system works as a
whole and then if time permits I'll go
over some you know advances in Corfu
because it's a really evolving system so
to really understand what Corfu is all
about
let's kind of take a look at the process
of building a distributed application so
we couldn't kind of understand the pain
points so when a application developer
takes an application and is asked to
scale it out you know like this for
example this application here you know
they probably didn't learn how to do
that in school I certainly didn't learn
how to learn that in school so if I had
to build a distributed application the
first thing you know I would consult
would be Stack Overflow and ask how you
know should i scale my application if
you take a look at Stack Overflow it
actually you know tells you oh you
should take your data and put it into
Cassandra and Cassandra will you know
partition your data out and all will be
well in the world now your application
can scale independently of the data you
know if you need to increase your scale
you just need to add more Cassandra
notes and that's the application
developer this is all fine until at
some point in time you need to actually
operate on data that has ended up on two
of these Cassandra nodes which isn't a
problem you had before if you had a
single application you and you know
regular database you would might use
something called a transaction and you
know if you consult you know Stack
Overflow and ask now how do I do
something like a transaction over
Cassandra you might find that you should
install something like zookeeper to take
locks on rows in Cassandra
for example and you know it doesn't
actually stop there over time as your
application evolves developers will want
to or will need to add additional tools
to kind of restore the functionality
that they used to use to enjoy and and
there are single node systems so you
know pretty soon your system that you
want to scale will actually be literate
with multiple tools just to scale out
your system and restore the
functionality that you have before and
this is actually a complete mess right
not only do we have multiple systems
that we need to maintain multiple
programmers that want to build on this
application now have to learn how to use
multiple systems that offer very
different guarantees and probably store
data redundantly in different forums all
over the place but this is this is the
state of the art today and I think many
of you know if you go out and look at
how we build as a community large-scale
distributed systems today we this is
exactly what we do so when we took a
loan when we built corfu we wanted to
answer the question you know if we built
a system distributed system from scratch
what what would it look like and stack
overflow doesn't quite have the answer
yet but
kind of a hint all these applications
are really building kind of these
distributed these sorry these logs
internally so maybe there's a way we
could stitch that together and
consolidate all of them okay so okay now
that we've kind of gone over what the
state of the art and distributed systems
are let's take a look at Corfu and how
Corfu can maybe make the state of the
art better so this is Corfu guys this
island is going to change the world of
distributed systems as we know it
okay maybe not quite but I'm sure many
of you are familiar with another Greek
island here that has really changed the
world of distributed systems and that's
the island called praxis so not the
island that the algorithm and the reason
our system is named Corfu is actually
because Corfu is a island that's quite
proximate to prep axis and we think that
Corfu provides many of the same kind of
guarantees that paxos does and for those
of you who aren't familiar with paxos
I'll kind of give a brief overview now
Paxos is a very complicated protocol
despite what some papers might say and
I'm not going to go over the details of
paxos well I'll try to explain the core
of what paksas provides which is a kind
of a primitive called consensus and so I
can illustrate that by example so here
we have a system and its sole value a
sole purpose in life is to store the
value of a and we can send the system
some messages like we can tell the
system to set statistic a to be 1 so
this is pretty simple when you just have
a single system right but if you have
multiple systems it turns out that in a
real distributed system you have a
synchrony so when I send the message to
set a equals 2 all of a sudden that
message might not reach all of the
systems
at the same time and it kind of gets
worse if I have multiple users trying to
modify this value of a at the same time
so if I have this kind of malicious
yellow guy trying to change a now if I
stop my system it's actually really hard
to tell what the correct value or the
most recent value of a was and this is
exactly the problem that Paxos tries to
solve so the way that paxos solves it
really at a very high level is it
basically builds a kind of distributed
log over these nodes and basically now
as an application I propose commands to
this log and if I stop the system at any
point in time I can kind of inspect you
know what your values are at what
position so now I have kind of agreement
over these values and that's actually a
very nice property and it's actually
used in many systems today like you
might be familiar with the Google
chubbie work and the problem with Paxos
is really that it doesn't scale very
well so when people try to use it in
production they realize that you know
with just three nodes that can maybe do
ten thousand operations per second on a
good day and as you add more and more
nodes
paksa starts slowing down because it's
gotta send messages to all these nodes
which is quite expensive so corfu is
about taking a look at you know this
distributed shared log is a kind of a
nice property we can build interesting
systems on top of it that are strongly
consistent
so how do we so how do we take Paxos and
really make it scale out
so here's Corfu at a very high level so
what we observed when we built Corfu is
that if we separate out the basically
the control mechanism and Paxos that's
really ordering the the proposals in
fact zoast and the data path impacts
those which is responsible for storing
the values and paxos we can actually get
very high performance so I'm gonna I
know it's a pretty high level diagram so
I'll kind of go over the components of
Corfu right now so we basically
broke-broke Corfu up into three sort of
entities the first one is a entity
called a sequencer now instead of going
to all the notes and the pack so space
system and trying to figure out what the
correct ordering is a single entity is
responsible for ordering these entries
in the log there's also a component
called layout service which simply owned
helps which simply helps clients find
where the rest of the components in the
system are and next and so that's all
part of the control plane and the rest
of system is a very it's basically a
fast data path just simple storage units
that store the data that's presented to
it and I'll show you how this all works
in a second but it let's go over some of
the properties of the system first first
is that the sequencer which just issues
positions in this log is actually a very
fast it can issue these order these
sequences at over 600,000 operations per
second and it's not part of the IO path
so unlike the paxil system unlike in
Paxos when you have a value you do have
to give it to the sequencer you actually
you actually write directly to these
data units next is that this system is
scalable so if you want to add if you
want to scale out the system all you
have to do is add more storage units to
the system and a good way to think about
this is here I have basically abstracted
diagram of a log and as you as you
append to this log you actually write to
different storage units and you know
exactly which storage units to write to
based on its position in the log so for
example here I have a six storage unit
so the first write would go to this
first storage unit and you know write
number six would go back to this first
storage unit again and as you can
imagine I can add more and more storage
units and the only bottleneck I have is
the sequencer I had before the next
property is that the corfu is fault
tolerance so so we use mechanism called
chain replication and each one of these
you know stripes in this log are
actually backed with multiple bi-metal
multiple storage units and that allows
us to tolerate you know plus one failure
with F plus one failure replicas we can
tolerate F failures and finally the log
gives us very strong consistency just
like in paxos basically the log has a
complete order that everyone has agreed
upon and and we use that to to build
strongly consistent systems on top of it
so okay
I kind of gave you kind of a roll and
tour of corfu but I find that the best
way to kind of understand how this whole
system works is just to go right in and
understand how writing to Corfu would
work so in the previous system we talked
about we show
the example where a user might want to
propose a new message to a new value to
the system so here some clients to the
system is proposing that's a should
equal to two now in paxos based system
you would normally go and send a message
multiple rounds of messages to to your
replicas button so in corfu the first
thing that you do as a client is you go
to this layout service and what this
layout service does is it basically
tells you where all the other servers in
the system are and this is very
importantly this is a call that you do
exactly once once you know where all the
servers are you don't actually need to
figure out where the servers are again
unless you know something crashes and
then the system reconfigures itself okay
so once once you know where all the
servers are now you can go communicate
to whatever each component in the system
so in the next step the client will talk
to this sequencer and obtain a sequence
number which is the sequence numbers
sorry
sequences purpose and sequencer will
tell it the next address is at 0 so the
client now just writes to to the next
storage storage unit mapped to this
address and I knows this you know via a
very simple mathematical projection
which I explained earlier so now the
storage unit has stored the value 2 at
this address and as a client who wants
to read that value I can just go
directly to the storage unit because
again I know that yes that address 0
lives at this green disk and get that
the value a is equal to 2 and of course
we we support many concurrent operations
so we could have many clients talking
all at the same time proposing multiple
values so for example this next clients
is going to set a equals to 6 it's going
to talk to the sequencer get the next
address and because know from the layout
that the next address is going to that
sorry that address 1 belongs to the Fila
disk will write to this yellow disk and
store this value and you can imagine we
could have multiple clients interacting
so this protocol is very nice because as
a reader you don't actually have to
communicate with the sequencer the
sequencer is kind of out of the aisle
path I've never tailed the sequencer hey
equals 2 where do I put a equals 2 I
just obtain this sequence number which
is implemented as a very fast counter
and go and write this value which in
practice could be potentially very large
right it could be megabytes directly to
the disk another very nice property of
corfu is that if I want to know what the
most recent writes is to the system the
sequence there has all that information
already so if I wanted to know hey
what's the most recent value of a I can
actually talk to the sequencer ask when
was the last time this woman was some
what was the most recent and value that
was written that somebody tried to write
and the sequencer will tell me well
somebody last tried to write you know to
address one and that's the last token I
issued and it does this without no no
the sequencer does this without knowing
what the value is but as a client I can
go and now read address one and get the
most recent value of a without having to
scan to this entire log so so far so
good but storing a value free is not
super interesting if I want to build a
real you know system or kind of a
database out of this I want to probably
actually store different values so next
slides I'll actually show maybe a value
B being stored and this actually gets
more interesting so
we're gonna augment the sequencer that
we have to actually keep track of the
most recent values for you know each of
these objects a and B so when a client
goes and you know asked to write B it
actually tells the sequencer hey I want
to write B somewhere does it have to
tell it the value of B it just needs to
say hey I want to write B and the
sequencer will issue it a token for B
and so here are the most recent rights
to a was address 1 the most recent right
to address sorry the most recent write
to B is to address 2 now the cool part
is now since everything is on a single
log and not partitioned out things
that's like modifying these objects at
the same time which if you remember from
before is actually a hard thing to do in
a partition system like Cassandra it's
actually very easy when we have this log
right so in fact all I have to do is
write a single entry that says a equals
1 B equals 9 and now at you know a
single address both of these objects
change kind of atomically which is a
really nice primitive to have and I
could and that's without taking any
locks in the system or really doing
anything outside of the standard
corporate protocol which is very nice
but so this transaction is actually very
very simple right and it's not very
interesting so what if we had a more
complex transaction like one that
contains a conditional so this one this
transaction is going to be a lot more
interesting it actually wants the client
actually wants to only modify B if a
equals 1 and the way corfu execute the
transaction is like a light in this form
is that it computes a read set to enter
write set so and it allows that tells
the client or the client execute this
transaction optimistically meaning that
the client has some value of a and B
this log is kind of chain
underneath it so what it does is if
first executes if a equals one so the
client you know in its rolled already
read pay and it lasts read a at address
three so it stores in its read set that
a was three and then it writes and then
it looks at the next statement which is
B equals seven but instead of writing B
equals seven to the log it saves it to
its write set so the next step here is
now the client computes this read set
and write set and sends this transaction
off to the sequencer but only the the
read sets and the sequencer will either
we'll look at its the current addresses
that it has and you'll see okay it
hasn't actually changed since and no one
has rip tried to write to a so you can
go right you're right set I don't care
what the right set is you can go write
it and now B is equal to 7 so kind of
have a much more advanced transaction
happening here without any locking again
and let's examine a different case let's
say another client came in and wrote a
equals 8 which would actually you know
it caused this in condition to be
incorrect and now the client doesn't
know it that a equals 8 yet the log is
kind of growing asynchronously so it's
executing this transaction thinking that
a is equal to 1 so what will happen here
is that the client will go to the
sequencer and say hey a plus 3 I read a
at 3 but the sequencer will say oh no
actually you can't write because a is 4
now and as a result the transaction will
be aborted the client will retry and you
know it'll go and read a close aide
it'll get the correct value and move on
so this allows us to have you know very
simple transactions with very high
performance and without sacrificing any
consistency and that's a pretty powerful
construct in corfu
so looking at all that you might be
thinking well how does Corfu compare to
you know other systems maybe you've
heard about you know distributed share
blogs before so you know paxos as we
discussed earlier is you know a
distributed shared log and the way Paxos
work is works is that you know every
single replica impacts those kind of
shares the same log
so in Corfu we take that concept of a
log and we just shard every single or
partition every single address in the
log to different login units and that
lets us scale out without sacrificing
the kind of the consistency that paxos
gives you and another system that you
might have heard the distributed shared
log term from is Kafka so Kafka does
something very different
it it partitions data into something
called topics and each topic kind of
grows on its own individually and the
big difference between Corfu and Kafka
is that in Kafka if each one of these
topics contained you know objects like a
and B as we discussed before if I want
to do something that like the
transactions we talked about in Corfu
because everything is not on the same
blog now I can't easily do or kind of
create these transactions anymore
because I've partitioned these logs out
separately so hopefully that kind of
gives you a guide to the world of
distributed share clocks so Corfu is
about more than just a distributed
shared log we also tried to build a
programming model on top of poor foo so
to kind of take a look at what this
programming model looks like let's take
a look at these two guess they're
supposed to be routers so if you are a
distributed system programmer and you're
you know system contains some routers
you might create a simple Java class
encapsulate some properties about the
state of the router this is a really
really simplistic model so I'm kind of
going to show you how the core fluke
code actually magically takes this code
and actually turns it into something
that you know works on top of the shared
logs that we just discussed so so the
one of the things you'll notice about
this switch object is that it contains a
piece of states and in this case it's
whether this which is turned on or not
and that's precisely the what we were
going to capture into the log so the oh
sorry the class also has this function
which you know programmers call to
change the state of the switch so to use
this switch in corfu there's actually
just pretty three pretty simple lines
that a programmer needs to write in
order to utilize it the first line is
basically some you know boilerplate code
to get a copy of the Corfu library and
the second piece of code is actually
code that actually automatically wraps
to switch around Corfu and the system
extra court the court who actually
dynamically instruments the logical
switch class to redirect any
modifications to the state of the object
into the log and the third line here
oops sorry I meant to do that is the
program were actually calling you know
this enable port function and instead of
because the Corfu library has automatic
already re instrumented this class
instead of you know going and changing
this enabled property to true what the
runtime will actually do is it will
sorry it will write enable port true
into the log and it will play back all
the most recent modifications to the
object
before returning and update the states
before returning back control to the
user and what does it she accomplishes
is that if we have multiple clients that
are trying to access this object which
they've accessed in the same way now if
they execute the same set of code
they'll actually all arrive at the same
state because before they make any
changes to see objects that change will
get recorded into this log and before
they and before any function gets
returned to them that object will be
updated to their most recent state so
yes we could also talk about this so
some more advanced work we've been doing
with Corfu includes supporting multiple
objects so in Corfu we have first order
support for multiple objects so like
before you might want to store you know
up the objects a and B in the system and
it turns out that something that you
will want to do if you have multiple
objects is that you'll want to actually
find where B is and well find where the
B's are and find where the A's are and
usually in a kind of a log based system
that requires kind of scanning through
this entire log which could be pretty
expensive if your log is really long and
has a lot of different objects so you
know most systems that have to deal with
something like this do pretty something
pretty standard they kind of index the
entries that contain B and contain a and
if you want to find where all the B's
are you go and consult the index but
this is pretty expensive and also making
sure that your indexes are up-to-date
it's not a super it's kind of a painful
operation so in previous work we
developed a system called back pointers
it's pretty simple basically every
single entry contains a pointer
to the previous century so all the a
entries contain pointers to the previous
entries and this system is you know
great
unless you want to read all of the
entries which is actually a pretty
common operation when you want to find
the state of a so in this system you'd
have to do four separate reads which
turns out to be pretty expensive so we
actually modified corfu based on you
know recent work to actually make a
pretty simple change to the way we
replicate so before we replicated using
this simple replication protocol trick
called change replication and you know I
just thought before that just men you
know like for in this example all the
even addresses went to one set of
storage units and all the audit
addresses went to another set of storage
units so we actually realized that we
could make a very small change to the
way things are replicated you see when
people talk about replication has kind
of engrained into your mind that oh you
know I want to replicate so I should
make exact copies of everything but then
we realized oh actually if we kind of
just changed away we replicate a little
bit we could actually build this index
you know for free basically I'll kind of
show you how this works so what we
actually do is we have two layers of
storage units now the first layer is
going to be the same it's going to be by
address and that allows us to easily
find addresses in this log like before
but the second layer will be by by
objects so I'll have storage units
that's dedicated to objects that's RA
objects and the storage unit that's
dedicated to be objects for illustration
and in addition to writing to you know
the address now for every single a right
I also write to one of these stories
this a storage unit
and you know at the end of all this all
the athan up on a single disc and all
the B's end up on a single dis and I
still get the kind of scalability that
this log gave me from before but now if
I want to find all the a in trades I can
find them all on this storage unit so
that was a pretty good innovation so so
corfu was actually something we're
trying to use within VMware so in VMware
you're probably familiar with our
products that we have called NSX and we
are looking at actually using corfu as
the backing store for NSX and kind of
the way we envisioned it and the reason
I gave a switch as an example is that
that we're going to take the existing
Java model that NSX uses and basically
redirect that on to Corfu and that's
ongoing process project but the goal is
to actually yes sorry and if F is a is a
software-defined network product VM
ourselves yes so I mean yeah so it's a
software-defined network product that
manages hypervisor Zion connects o
hypervisor switches together but so NSX
or the the has a database basically that
stores the properties of all these
switches and configuration data and the
plan is to actually store these on top
of corfu instead of their existing
system and the reason that corfu is
attractive to them is that it does
provide this strong consistency that
other scale systems don't really provide
we also so if you remember this from
before diagram from before have a
project called one data which plans to
take you know all these different
interfaces that programmers are used to
and map them onto corfu so you can
imagine having a Cassandra interface
that instead of writing to a Cassandra
server actually takes those requests and
funnels them into this corporate log and
if you have you know what these systems
are basically doing is generating logs
on their own so if you can consolidate
all this log all these logs into us you
know as a single entity we could reduce
a lot of storage overhead and we could
also take data that's you know
represented in Cassandra one way and
present it another way and my sequel so
that's that's the one data efforts so
finally we are an open source efforts
yes we're on github but and no it's not
a source code dump we are we're actually
we're actually very dedicated to try to
making corfu really a production ready
kind of system it's not there yet we
have 51 open issues and it's quickly
growing as people are really using it
but we already we're really where we've
already dedicated though you know rather
large team to really making sure that
corfu really gets used both within
VMware products and both hopefully
outside of VMware products so you can
check out the source code today you'll
probably run into some bugs but it's
also an active project that you know
every day they're seeing new commits so
it's not something that you know we just
wrote a paper about and dumped a source
code on internet it's actually something
that we're trying to make you know
something that people can use so and you
could take a look at it and see if the
object models changer change what you
how you see distributed systems so
that's that's my talk thank you could
you explain what happens how you recover
from sequence of failure please ah so
that's a very interesting situation so
let's jump back to the slide with a
sequencer hopefully very quickly okay so
so when the sequencer fails what happens
is that clients notice that they can't
talk to do two sequencer anymore and
Dave you know they go and find the fly
out service which elects a new sequencer
in the original version of corfu if you
go and read the papers it actually turns
out that the sequencer is a it's not a
safety requirement it can actually hand
out completely wrong tokens and the
system will work but not very
performance lis because nobody basically
the storage units that we have guarantee
that once you writes to an address that
address can never be overwritten so if I
write to address number one the storage
unit has promised that nobody else will
write to one so it's actually the
storage units that are enforcing the
safety guarantees of corfu yes yes yes
so yeah so yeah so this layout service
just brings another sequencer up ideally
it has you know the most recent address
that the log refer it wrote to for
performance reasons yes how do you deal
with the holes and slow clients so if a
if an client gets a sequencer that's a
sequence it's far in the future what
happens to the existing ones if a client
crashes before we're actually writing
the commands right so we have a
mechanism called hole filling it's
pretty simple basically if a client
requires to sequence No
and doesn't write with them in a
specimen at a time another client can
actually go in and safely write just
junk to that entry and when that client
that slow clients let's say comes back
up you'll try to complete his right but
it'll there will be a hole there and you
have to retry with a new sequence number
the consequence is basically that there
could be a lot of these whole entries so
we have a process that goes and collects
those whole entries and compacts the log
I was actually gonna ask about
compaction so does this just grow
forever what's the process for right so
shaking log yeah so yeah that's a very
important question it so in the case of
these objects you know we're we're not
storing any history every once in a
while you might want to check point this
log a pretty standard mechanism so there
is a garbage collection process that
basically goes and scans the log and
when the application at some application
requested rate takes them only the most
recent or take captures the state of
these objects and writes that the most
recent state into the log you can think
of as condensing all the entries into a
single one so sorry a couple of
questions one what happens you in your
when you reworked how stuff was stored
on disk your new version you end up with
all the copies of a particular object on
a single disk hasn't that just destroyed
your redundancy oh so so this is
actually well no it has not because
actually turns out that a is on this on
this unit and also scattered across
these units okay so yeah so it's that
it's it's it's actually nice in terms of
recovery right because I can actually
feel my recovery outfit all these notes
on the top okay because the data spread
out across them and my other question
was going to be to what extent have you
done any formal verification of the
properties of corfu yeah so that's
so that's an interesting question
we don't have a formal model for Corfu
but we are working on building a to do
model checking over Corfu so yeah yeah
my I enjoyed the talk and especially
about the reflux stuff I have been
following the project on github actually
ok so I see all the commits roll in and
all the comments and stuff but uh I was
curious about the the object store which
you know seems to me I guess I would
call that a materialized view of kind of
the state of an object yeah yeah I mean
is that is that a fair characterization
of yeah so you could think of a and B as
this stuff on the top that's in the
materialized video did this does the
reflex storage also use chain
replication and it goes through this
compaction process yeah it's kind of a
variant of chain replication right so
you can think of reflex as generating
dynamic chains so zero is actually a
chain that's predicated on you know what
object was written to it so which means
that in order to get the full chain you
actually need to know that it was
written to yeah but yeah so that answer
your question
any more questions right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
