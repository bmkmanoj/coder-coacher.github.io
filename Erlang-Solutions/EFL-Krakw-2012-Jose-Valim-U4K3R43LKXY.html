today is about the new programming
language on top of turning purple
machine call that answer I'm not going
to spend those three minutes talking
hire me to do X or Y be back here I
actually want to tell you why creating a
new language and why I think it's
important because I think this way
showing the rationale behind my
decisions and I think it's I it would be
easier for me to make an impression with
you and have you getting started playing
with it right so we stopped anyway to
answer some questions and the first one
I will start answering his life so why
I'm creating MZ and two the 0 2 a little
bit of background so I perceive a guy I
knew them all and I have a consequence
accompanied Brazil called Allah for me
and they come from a wrestling
background right we which we have 20 we
are 20 people and we work with the
companies in Brazil and the reason why
we are attractive to to those companies
in resuming startups or on the road is
because our goal one of our goals is to
deliver product refer to 1000 so we aim
for technical quality and this is a
little bit hard to do with the web
because the web is on shaking I have
almost eight years working with lab and
if I look Carlos developing
magnifications 10 years ago and how I
help today the techniques the
technologies we use the change and we
have a bunch of revolutions living
longer and how like Lucy Coe people are
trying people who were trying Broncos
and what I think is that one of the
attractions the web is changing now
because I think that in the next 10
years to have doing we do stuff forever
be okay we again different from me to
today so I keep that weight to the
direction we're moving out it's good for
the link minute and we could friends
your community as well right and I'm
going to show you some cases which
proves his point rights the first one so
let me some questions first who works
already work with web help somehow okay
good and who are the speedy early okay
stay is a protocol I google it has some
ideas and if you use chrome the browser
Chrome name is jamayne we're using
spirit and it's also a problem I'm going
to talk about so one of the things that
if you go to ask them today you are
going to see in you use chrome or
firefox into them or a past hear me to
see that your browser is 64 request to
the server and that's because that was
Michelle right I wasn't reduces the
number of requests to have to leave this
arid nazca they can and you see me to do
64 right then this is a little bit
broken because it works basically this
way when your website or with your
browser goes to the amazon web page it
will open back for connections to amazon
service right and then what what happen
is everybody say hey ilysm sent me this
page and then it thanks to request to
amazon and an amazon response tag and
just after i saw response back your
browser can say nothing with this image
nothing is other image right so you can
see that the seats they are in serious
right they are not have any problem the
connection ARLA but one connection could
not have priorities right this is what
we call a keepalive connection right so
what is happening your browser closed
access to an observance and give the
connection open and one of the things
that speeding is easy is there a
protocol pipeline which is basically the
client saying hey I want this page and I
want to sink in centerfield straightaway
right and then the server is going to
reply what he has and any people give
more responses than normal request
because Erica see you later waiting in
this image right so I'm ready sending it
to you and then this can give a good
experience when the user is using the
website because the page is way too low
much faster rate so what's happening
here is basically that we go and grow a
lot around the CGI approach which
basically you had a browser like this is
very old umbro attract so many using and
eating using the netscape browser which
may be probably not even heard about it
and basically well this approach
basically you have the relatively
request and then have the CGI it's the
company interface that's personal
information and invoking a process
that's going to get information back so
we have this business staff right I have
requests someone process the request and
send it back and is approaching no
longer works right because what about is
that we want to have kind of improve the
connection to purchase them down the
connection whenever we want right so
what happened from the connection we
want to have better abstractions and not
use the abstraction that people are
using like 10 years ago which is
basically around five simple braking
system processes all right so this is
one of the want to be Franchitti better
connection and the second thing that
proves that air landing thank you there
they are good alternative for the future
our maritime right so what's happening
is that it doesn't matter in the future
if you are going to use html5 to user
applications or your buildings iphone or
android devices working next time for
sure is that logic is moving from the
server to the client right the clients
their game is worker right this is good
because it's a broad shift okay so every
time have a project shape is a good
opportunity to introduce new
technologies right and it also requires
long-running connection right you have
your iphone your
like you have 30 careful if you
synchronize to its friend you need to
connect to the service in itself you'll
be all the tweets that having the last
eight hours it can be lost friends and
me to open a connection and exchange the
data Brandon barossa see it increases
uncertainty protocol as well because if
instead of sending one night either send
800 we have a very percentage that's
good then the third case is more time
for all right I think developers day has
the special happening for a long time
ready then we are going to in the future
using more and more courts typically
happen in top but the fact that my
machine has four cards right it's very
six-figure to get to get service and a
60 course so it will be nice to have a
technology that can use all of these 434
so giving other kids I asked you the
question which technology is well known
for heavily mainly long run compare
connection right it's all right right
you can you have very good reports of
people like Pig and using websites web
sockets only selling machine and I can
get a half million connections open
right there is an application for device
called whatsapp and those guys are going
to have two million TCP connections in
just 10 they have whole infrastructure
in just one machine money today so
that's awesome so this parameter patient
right I want to provide variables for
the web so now that you know that the
next question is what so what I'm trying
to achieve don't you have school biology
so another thing another background then
is that any part of the little sperm
already use or heard of rain soon rails
okay a lot of people that's nice come on
in rails like one of the biggest web
frameworks out there not internal size
but in terms of people using it right
and rails main focus is not on speed is
unproductive its own developer
productivity okay so the idea is how we
can how I can make the environment more
productivity right this is one of the
goons Nancy I want to be marketing to be
more productive right and the second
goal is also related to rails because
rails is looking top of language
hopefully and Ruby's extra name and room
is extremely extensive alright so the
second goal is accessibility right but
this is kind of a hard line to walk
because we need to be careful because it
is try to mix those two extensible it
cannot sue 12 early because it languid
parts and its basic compilation step and
you need to play off the good server so
we need to control the line here right
so this is the second goal accessibility
the third one is that I see what Alex
you to be able to do the same things a
developer cooking environment which is
basically be able to be distributed on
vacation without full software so all
those songs should work I should be able
to distribute
easily right so the term goal is
compatibility X you should play nice
garlic okay so this is the second factor
and why I'm trying to achieve
productivity extensibility and
compatibility so how high want to
achieve those goals so now i'm going to
give you a quick run of Alex your
features ok and show how they are they
into those books so the first one is
home iconicity where it is the police
yeah lovely so the white your comic
olicity is that you can use the language
construct to express the link itself
you're letting is my trunk right it has
an angle track format and you can build
and faster like to do it for free ok and
Alexei is also go my colleague and we
provide several features are around his
home ethnicity so for example here is a
little code right so I'm checking if
some reason Adam and that'll make sure
they are represented by the collar and
you start with this call right and then
represent internally as a double with
three hours the first one is the
function
from show me the second one is the line
where the functions is happening is
written and the third one rgr exciting
capacitor dysfunction and all 17 items
is going around this secret expression
right even operator so if you do one of
those two this is actually this is
actually a call for functioning plus a
21 and with the arguments missing
garments 12 right and then this is we
can do that direct right we have similar
feature day but what early what is your
ads that name doesn't our Michaels so if
whoever you wish list I have the idea of
macros which is basically cold then is
equal to generate cobre and that's kind
of the productivity and I'm able to
generate code that can do the work for
it is great so our economic example of
Marcus is to define and last thing which
is not wasn't off do right so i can it's
true to this all right now using the map
romance that I defined it like a dumbass
true do this right this is a very single
sample in the the good thing with
matters is that we can define
domain-specific languages and this is
important because frameworks libraries
they can provide matters they can
provide instructions that do the hard
work froze right when we look at the
surface is these people but what's
happening underneath is also work right
and that's the way of the Mississippi
language is it actually what is
happening behind so on example you can
do now is ideal to be specific language
and the context of the web server is the
power right imagine that you have a web
server and there is a request you need
to respond to user pass
right but the way you want to respond to
this request changes if the request for
example basic science is asking for an
HTML page are the clients asking for a
json representation of an object when
required right so how you could do so
present way to do this right so I
respond to the request and it's the
format HTML which is rad I'm going to
end our template but if the format's
Jason I'm going to convert this report
to Jason is actually simple right but
there are a lot of stuff happening
behind the scenes because what this
needs to do is that it needs to build
your request and see what the requested
factor is false right so every time you
were in fast web server your browser
sensibilities oh I except HTML except
Jason but if you don't have anything to
write you can send me whatever which is
a star that star because I me whatever
i'm trying to render it right and then
it let me know what the client wants we
need to know what the server has
available to give that right so in this
case we define an HTML and JT and then
we are going to negotiate the format we
need to check out our passwords one
response has and decide which piece of
the pool you're making work right which
would be triggered template so this is
divided an idea of having macros
constructs that can do the hard work for
me and these to look first sequel from
outside okay the second feature tnx is a
good definition and this is funny
because like for me to go Joe Armstrong
he said something to deliver lame
question famous about her to which the
main feature of virtues to actually have
right and then it has it basically an
alien you can write this you're defining
a simple water right and what I can put
in the model body as a very limited set
of instructions you can put any group
ticket both functions but you cannot put
random call that is right I cannot do
this so reactor you can do that right
well then why do you want to do right
right you want to bring something when
you're compiling a lot right the idea is
that you can make things with matters
right so we're a mascara cognizer 90s
right now I have this has many things
this has been a macro that can generate
functions in my module and then it
integrates it have sex all these boy
butter plate all right and it's doing
all the work for me again it's
generating it's heading is about the
abstraction story so those are the two
features that I think they are related
to ability right Stacey home ethnicity
and markers and you can do this kind of
stuff internally use parcels forms but
it worked here is that cheese is
supported by the language for you to
achieve the sink neighbor you actually
need to write me much less boat right
and we go if let's go last words right
as I say there is no code better than
total okay third feature is related to
accessibility in the future stop
protocols now another trick question who
use it closure or what we close early
okay even as next time if are
interesting to close on this facility
somewhere near least try closures are in
DC and total houses idea of protocols
and basically the following imagine that
i have an application
and I need to convert a structure or I
need to convert something to james gray
in everything that could write a JSON
library like this okay so basically i
defined on board of Jason and I'm going
to define implementation right so to
Jason and when the item I want to
convert is at least I'm going to do
something if they are not convert is a
binary I'm going to do something else is
that I want converts another i'm going
to do yet something else right and this
is bad because imagine that i'm using
this library and at some point I
realized that using a range instead of
lease would be better form application
right now I'm busted because lesson
number C because the implementations
they are written in the first code right
don't wait for me to add how to
serialize a race is it actually copies
code put it somewhere and change it
right the whole idea of protocols it
have is to have an ha communication
right so we've Alex you and will be
similar enclosure it's basically
different protocols i say i want to
define a practical JSON and to implement
this product all you need to implement
the to Jason function right and then you
define the implementation of the
protocol alpha exact inside inside the
same things are in different protocol so
here I will define the communication for
lists for my varies from number and then
if a future I want to use a race I just
go there and define an accommodation
progress right there's no need to make a
resourceful so this one of the 15
features that help really sleepy so i'm
not i'm not walking on the design that
the person that wrote the library first
place
they're not structured as a person a
great okay therefore features is the
place for math ability right and
basically there's no conversion costs
for kalyanam predatory receiver right so
calling xor function parameter is the
thing is the same cost including an
American function primary and you can
call each other there is no extra cost
right and that's because they are
utilizing abstractions right so again
what to have that houses many spaces
those modules sorry those modules
represent or reflect on this right and
then when you want to call some
international function you're basically
using you can think that are using the
column great writing a thesis and
flatten and then theory is the same idea
right so if i wrote a post in a module
i'm just going to call something in the
act on that everything's this morning
and the site called Eric generate at the
ends letting the same right but a little
too weird con selfie nieta meetings a
very simple rapper so to go girlie at
least singer and then you're calling an
earning function and finally the more
natural idiomatic way to do this in the
next year would actually to set up some
reference so i can say that when i come
across something least I should call
something about this and the next thing
is that those secrets didn't happen a
compilation pipe at the end you can
write another code that when compile has
not advanced Callanetics it right at the
end is just white coat and you're going
to use it whatever water so we have
other features like references
tiny free cards but I have time to go
into it we have a head start well I'm
going to show me soon so the first
question last question is my right so
when things are happening so today is
kind of the release of the website I put
a lot of work wrapping up with the
documentation and putting up a website
where people can go and check and have a
gang started guide and learn more about
the language in March I want to release
the drill operating version of an expiry
Andrew and recycle jumping 20 log night
is because i want to show that this is a
commitment right I think that the point
we are now is a very solid point and we
are ready to be 10 in six months great
or something like that and then the
other thing is Mabel to do the matter
release of title in newton s like what
diamond right and is a fast easton
factory work buta round the socket which
is basically i'm trying to build a level
web framework around la web servers like
cowboy the entire visiting and give an f
&amp;amp; 2 so we it's easy for us to solve the
problems thanks partly the beginning of
this talk so if you go to the website
The Times didn't work even the link
there is a game start guide at the top
and I say so you can follow us on
Twitter and Alex your link and the
websites and theory laying the arc and
that's it
yeah that's a good question sister the
language is too very fresh right it's
hard to already have the internet way to
do things right I think this is
something that will come with time I
even sometimes when i'm using the
language that i wrote sometimes I miss
something is it wow I didn't want it
this work right the times are suppressed
you are impressed by how they interact
so I hope so I hope that eventually when
people start to use it they can see a
convoy and they can say like oh this is
the idiomatic way of doing X or Y and
the community can be on top of that our
new song by real-life ratings so so this
is kind of a question during part of
rare start and the thing is so I have a
kind of it by this point and i don't
think that nao Alex you can consume how
provide same things offerings not
basically because of the things that the
lingual spare time right so then you
have some kind of
and the fact that in Ruby you can
basically distort things when you want
you to move it back stuff these suits
very well with the idea that our rings
helps you to do rapid prototyping right
and this is something that I find hard
to be even if have explicit compilation
step so what I want to do basically is
that the rapist is great for this kind
of stuff I think it's hard to be it in
for design applications but we are
seeing a lot of new applications coming
out so which basically for example why
dont je s get about abstraction because
keep on moving stuff to the client when
people are there like let's say don't
mean on the server and in those cases I
think and it really could be behind
those doesn't even use two cards right
we have we have really we have really
better tools to transpose the community
so that's the idea I want to be the
framework doodle Sinatra from Judy so
game is going to be very successful I
and oriented about resources because
you're going to do it guys that you are
going to make new socket so long one
connection excellent idea no it's
basically well yeah and protocols I
WebSockets myspace is basically we build
applications both from the server to
walk sciences so we want to be ahead
have resolutions
inside until on purpose so everything
else warily it is going to be in another
library which is back and try to i'm
using this valve library to as the
requirement within certain time in which
to do something their family comes from
the dome at library but that is is going
to be a general purpose efforts because
I you're doing things which should be
done coboy looking nitrogenous stuff we
were you time yes so the depression is
about the duplication of efforts because
we have web web frameworks and I've
started an insight we're using our
service I'm not reducing the web
frameworks because it I cannot reduce
them so ain't right no idea I want to
use the early its structure the maximum
i can and that's something I will brush
across YouTube your idea for you have
something during that visit well there's
no reason to duplicate therefore just
join you ever feel I think that a person
that knows the petting zoo let's suppose
today to the new projection or landing
learn about Alex insanity but if this is
slow eventually change for some people
they start attitude I think to be like
very fertile to hold on to our right the
difference is just there is no semantic
the difference just in syntax and then
any tendency text is easy to learn so I
think it will be able to unlike in the
future to be able to get authorization
from people and the facts are to grow
art for real and community</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
