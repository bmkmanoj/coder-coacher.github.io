it started with a 500 error when getting
an unknown path on a staging server
which shouldn't happen I have a
catch-all cowboy handler that serves a
nice 404 and that's just completely
messed up the slides one sec yeah so
first check the logs for that machine is
log file and it's empty so that
shouldn't be possible anything that
causes a 500 usually prints an error log
and a question a sore too maybe there's
some sort of stood out buffering that
only happens in production mode and if I
do the same thing a bunch more times
I'll get something that's all try that
and success sort of okay so what's going
on here it's got application logger
exited shut down the loggers clashed
well that explains why logging was
behaving a bit weirdly okay so it
crashed in my cowboy 44 handler and the
reason is undef functions undefined and
the function was inspect really inspect
being called with two arguments an empty
list and some options okay what let's
have a look at the line at qwest on the
stack trace pointed to the second line
so the expression that crashed was this
which for this request was equivalent to
inspecting an empty list so what's going
on here inspect generally works the
things I log on startup inspect stuff
just not lists and it's only happening
in production well a staging cluster so
not really production but production as
far as mix is concerned never seen on my
local machine never seen in CI so what's
different between board and locally I
think I remember hearing someone talking
about elixir consolidating protocols in
production I don't know what that means
but interact is a protocol light I think
so let's try compiling and running
locally with mix in fits pod and no luck
okay time to get serious that's me being
serious over sometime and with with some
help from the Alexia community we
worked out that elected inspector list
inspect doesn't seem to be available as
a function but the actual file its
contained in the dot beam file is there
in the slug I downloaded the slug and
checked and it seems to have been
compiled correctly and code ensure
loaded which loads a module if it isn't
already just seems to behave completely
randomly and to be clear this isn't just
between builds this is between deploys
of a single built so the same slug the
same compiled artifact after some more
experimentation it looked like this
problem was only ever happening in the
first call to inspect for some data type
if if that first call was done from a
cowboy handler so I could avoid the bomb
by calling this on startup inspecting
every day to type I could which seemed
to suggest that this was maybe a bug in
elings code loader which led to a github
issue with all sorts of scary labels
eventually we worked out that this was
actually a red herring and the reason
the being called from a cowboy handler
made a difference with just because if
it runs on that startup it was running
earlier and actually the cowboy handler
was irrelevant this is a lightning talk
so rather than keep you all in suspense
I will jump to the answer first I should
say it wasn't me who solved it it was
this guy who is Louis who is awesome
quick note about our deployment process
we're mounting compiled slugs these are
slugs compiled with the hell oku build
pack but not running on Heroku with
we're mounting them with overlay FS
which means any file system lights by
the application don't change the actual
slug the up herb the mutable layer was
in / temp in a directory you need to
each dr. container instance unrelatedly
we add a continent script that land
immediately after a deploy completed
that among other things cleaned up any
files in / temp within last modified
time older than 2 days ago you see where
this is going since the things in / temp
are overly FS up
directories this script didn't change
the actual slug so whenever I downloaded
it or put it on anything else to try it
again the bug disappeared it was all
correct but it just marked the file as
deleted in overlay FS so they were
hidden from the docker container which
led to sadness depending mostly on
whether a given beam file had already
been loaded by the Erlang vm at the time
the cleanup script LAN so the problem
only showed up with inspect because all
the other files and protocols had bit
were loaded and exercised earlier on
that start up but not inspect or list
solution move the upper directory out of
slash temp</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
