concept of medians and how that affects
the way you think and now that affects
your programming so we talked about ways
that people change their perceptions
based on the words they have in the
idioms later and how important it is to
build up this kind of tacit knowledge
the idioms
what's your up to lately now what you
working on well right now I'm very much
into elixir language about 15 years ago
I was into Ruby I still have
but the mixer is giving me the same kind
of excitement but I had a brilliant way
back then and so I'm just playing I'm
teaching myself a whole bunch about how
to write code in his multiverse it's
distributed leader in world
and why not airline why why is it elixir
that gets a pretty good question and I
actually unlike airline I actually
worked with Joe on his Ronnie book but
for me Merlin's never felt like a
language where I could describe to us
one of the things I like doing is to
share what I know write books whatever
and Erland for me was always just a
little bit too obscure
whereas elixir has all the power grow
act that has a more approaching syntax
and then on top of that it has a lot of
things that airline doesn't have like
the magic
so it means I can both show the language
also show the things you can do nicely
thank you very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
