lambda nice first of probably dozens so
there's a franchise of nights of lambda
today the proper the respectful one and
then there's the night which is not so
Peter computer centric version so my
name is Gareth ended up we're gonna beat
em and Tommy about some kind of weird
topic but I'm super excited about it hi
this is like one of those things where
you're you know the frizz geeking out on
something where you just you love
something but it's really weird and
you're a little frayed even know
anything about something so much this is
one of those topics I'm glad to be among
people here to there so I'm not ashamed
telling these things but I wouldn't I
wouldn't be get this like son without
typical so this is about helping coaches
they're beautiful
sorry lens so no one ever stops down
here but here no one isn't touching down
here anyway so pretty usually I say so
forgiveness I want to describe you what
what the topic of beauty is related to
function so to do that I want to sort of
step this concept of the functional
program forgiving general is this idea
of correct so you write some code and
people generally want to be correct and
in certain circles correctness has a
really high value you'll hear it all the
time is this you how do you know this is
correct now is this correct code and
they're all such ways to reason improve
and it's a big center piece of software
prudery I don't like this terminal I
don't like the term correctly it implies
that there's some sort of absolute
standard there's a god there's a
programming God that says you know
whatever you're doing here's the
standard good luck you're going to get
it correct or incorrect that's nonsense
softwares now there is their standard
software suffered a series of
experiments it's in we're trying to
computers and two things do things for
us in some sort of social context and
just like in any social setting we're
going to get things wrong we're going to
guess at something we're
you know our requirements are going to
be so called requirements we're going to
be wrong to solve the wrong problem
correctly actually got something that
does this thing and then we make it
correct or not that term 2x is
irrelevant you take that thing and
observe and then say is it working away
with additive is suitable so standards
of absolute truth bother me in general
they bother me quite a bit in software I
prefer to use this term intent so if we
talk about software rather than thinking
of in terms of existing correct or even
in terms of mi clearly expressing my
intent so as to say when I look at this
code is it clear what the intention of
the authors so that's that to me is
something we can actually think about I
can say this is the you can say this is
it correct I have no idea that's really
kind of a silly thing about now so I
like in 10 and associated in 10 and view
here so something that's clear is
unambiguous you take a look at it said
this is makes sense to me that's
beautiful that's my technique for this
purpose presentation you might say a
beautiful coat isn't it implies with
some coding guidelines I say it is if
it's really unclear code if it makes no
sense that's ugly code doesn't matter
how aesthetically beautiful this syntax
and semantics and the program structure
has a lot to do with clarity but really
at the end of the day are you expressing
yourself so that others can understand
it doesn't matter what the syntax looks
like yes yes I say that's beautiful no I
say
of the range that's that's the backdrop
so I'm going to try to do is prove it
prove but hopefully persuading the
functional program gives you a really
good shot helps give you some tools to
create beautiful country Brady's excited
about that as I okay seriously she
writes off for so they can be effective
in communicating with other people from
the software we life so clear 10 here is
a very simple function of pythons only
be using two languages in this
presentation Python in early this isn't
either but if people here know vuitton
bill so i will explain this I've used by
that means it's very simple the author
awesome greatest you look like pseudo
code so that is the idea here this is
actually runnable you can send us into
the other line interpreter you can run
this perp IM tripper you can run this
disk eval python code and it's fairly
straightforward but the death here is
setting a function definition you have
two arguments there danger item array
this little equals gives you a default
so if you don't specify the Soviet this
is a default value and here we have
array is an object with
method when you are out we are operating
to folk Java C++ we've got our nap
programs ok so everyone's a programmer
Ivorians at camp everyone who's in / oh
please raise your hand most of you
should be ok i just know that i'm going
to hear would say functional some
functional derivative including lists
132 so i probably get up a proper
feeding an approaching the quarter so
extent so consider this then if your rx
way to the merits partial program you
consider this a way to possibly think
about persuading others to try so it's
still it's still will be available many
of this will be like duh duh yeah okay
got it all right so there's going to be
needing this may be some sort of I may
not actually be persuading you're
already persuaded or maybe there's a
model here you can volumes here and help
to evangelize I should think this is
valuable for the human race quick so
what's happening here this thinks what
we need arise the only person that's
going to do initialize it red so we pass
it an item and here is an optional
argument already if we don't ask this in
it's going to get a default of an empty
list we're going to do is perform an
operation 10 on your red with the item
image from the array so naively looking
at this I would say display uglies I'm
happy as a reader of this saying I
understand the intention of the
programmer so therefore this thing
that's might be alright so let's run
this in see what happens so I'm going to
print in it erase that's enough as a
print statement in Python and employing
the in it
the neural and as you would expect I've
got an array here or a listing of them
with a single element of one reason why
is everyone cool with this no surprises
this is what one would expect now let's
call it again I'm calling an iterated
with the same thing by the same type
thing but I'm getting this and getting a
list now that is two element now I am a
Python I've used my not for many many
years in the first time I saw that I was
very very surprised have not expected
that's a surprise so now my question I
don't understand what this often means
but I think I understand this muggy
above or maybe intentional I don't know
that's what I'm infused they'll try it
one more time just to make sure yet
we've got a third one you're just going
to keep on this thing and somehow we r
you taking some kind of state which is
somehow global look around aware but
here's what's actually going on you
understand away Python functions are
constructed it makes a perfect sense so
here let's describe some context that
will help us understand animals so
what's going on the air in Python when
this function is created this array is
an actual attribute of functional so the
function is essentially an object of my
content these attributes ease our
arguments are optional pronounce you
metadata or information about the
function catch to develop family
function
so this array is an actual attribute and
what we're doing here is we're modifying
attribute of the function so we're sort
of doing metaprogramming probably by
accident i'm gonna guess this is not it
it is it's a strange function but I
event this was happening I modifying an
attribute of the function so every time
i call this i have this works well side
effect something's happening outside of
the function in this case it's the
global definition of this function
itself and every time i call in an array
i modified this past winter function and
of course and they said to that liquid
course that's exactly what makes sense
to me all right so this is this topic of
content what I'm going to do is go
through different models of structuring
an interface program units I'm going to
go with a forensic function ranted I'm
going to move to a pure function and
then I'm going to surprise you sometimes
and the intent here is to talk about
this idea contact so in a famous example
he saw as idea of clear clarity of
intent is bound up in knowing what the
heck is going on knowing what the heck
is going on I'm upon that on post
through a little east of your model and
asked the question was what's going on
what's the context of a contract so
let's let's take our favor here I've
joins yeah I think for a lot of people
usually become up when you see veterans
plenary function programmers but variety
I gave this talk in Asian Elvis which is
probably than that but almost everybody
different see shortly so I'm shorteners
like overly I am on board without
forensic so let's look at this our big
blast of Python code this is a class
definition in pipe same syntax as before
so traffic pipeline and we're creating a
class of type account there is no super
cluster and we have these things which
are functions but they're bound with the
class so they're one of our class
definitions of their cold the whole
methods so the method is bound to an
operating instance of the class Gator
object that odd has functions attached
to it so this coupling of state and
functionality basic top drawer Travis
and these functions have a separate unit
which the reference to the object so
when you call this thing that gets an
implicitly and you passed a reference to
the office
town this self is basically like this in
Java or C++ or C C sharp but it's past
explicit but there is no implicit
self-reference you can rename a
commissioners box okay so these are the
functions and what we're talking about
is account that can be initialized as a
constructor and you can withdraw funds
from it you can deposit funds into it
and you can review the balance so this
is a type this thing goes a tight it's
got some functionality associated so
let's look at each one just a understand
why this is code to run or shan't go all
right so this is the class and this is
the anit function this is a convention
in Python you can latch and cringe and
hate Python a lot of people do they
don't like to stay but this is
effectively a construction so when you
call when you create an instance of a
class that is a great an object python
this gets called and you're passing
these arguments so this already affected
the initial deposit and assignments back
I probably create an instance of cool to
move on to next one withdrawal same i
need up a better a bunch of you're bound
to the objects and get us forever itself
i'm going to draw in a match we're
taking money out of a baker so we
applied a min function years make sure
that we're not taking out more than we
have so that's kind of business it said
oh yeah the intent of the author here
engine is to make sure that we're not
taking out more than is in so we have a
minimum of mountains then next thing
here we're going to modify the house
okay as a function here a balance it
allowed we subtract allow for balances
on your side then finally we returned
from that fall what we actually took out
because I might not be what we pray for
deposit is a separate app even worship
and finally we are going to query the
balance and refer here so easy this is
now creating an instance of the account
so I have an odd preference here I'm
going to invoke the method office so
this method which we defined boundary
our withdrawal 50 and that's the amount
of time I'm going to get the new balance
using our function or method depends and
I'm a producer the result I withdrew
pointer dereference still have reference
and then a cast meeting us at safeway
different at all right so now the
exercise here so that's the set the
exercise here is to think about context
remember the original thing we have this
kind of confusing thing that they know
about or a reason about the code to
understand question here is what we have
to understand about this function
understand what's your mom so looking at
this thing I see a cell from out so i'm
looking through this and i'm reading
this reading this reading this and then
boom I hit cell balance as a reader of
this I'm picturing what balances where's
it come from how is it initialized what
is it so I have to then understand what
that context is this is effectively
global state like low state you
initialize something and then you
reference later the American said you
probably want to know how I got there
how would how was initialized in Oman
sex these things are called
it's variables are bound to the instance
it's like global state but it's within
the object you're the same problems with
instance variables as you do a little
state you have to wonder where they came
who can modify you modify at the same
time like this like this so here's
here's a case we're self balance self
that balance is being modified by the
withdrawal and also other possible so
thus more context I need to worry about
what happens if this thing is being is
at the same time but there are things
you have to keep in mind so you know I
of these themselves or continents on the
other world we're just keeping track of
if you haven't run these two things
without control without synchronization
kumari or you're probably going to be
checking out furthermore this
initialization of this is fix this the
initialization of valence in the case of
where you're hearing from ultras and
inheritance so you know it's ray about
Bobo is you can hear it you know source
power with power comes great confusion
if we have we have Bay's account we know
that it is a superclass to make Summer
Sun something we all have to pledge make
this stuff up but you see this in
overall time so now we don't even see
the work now how much anywhere not to go
look in some other location and this can
actually blue not into a tree of
extremely complex interactions so so
then oh oh you have a lot of things you
can potentially have to deal with how
many people have debug this sort of
problem where you have mixing but you
blew now to other things you have some
initialization
state where you have no idea what you
got no idea 20s context so to understand
what's happening with withdrawal
function you need to understand all this
stuff really Yujin and you get the same
sort of mysterious behavior that's the
first example you're doing prints and
what once what yeah it's magically
horrible it's like it's like a horseshoe
looking like it's not entertaining it's
bad so so you go here and say this is oh
ho this is the world over so the way we
can fix this problem by getting rid of a
class and that's the next example so we
look at both now shown basically there
how state management become very complex
and then plis it and contexts that
you're not easily aware of that
undermines the meaning and attentive
something so i called this only code
it's not beautiful it's not it's
terrible maybe you know maybe the base
glass case here is ok that's a I can
understand for this stuff that's tight
and this faction who I think mostly
looking at that result is room you use
oh oh it works have inheritance it were
to do this in order to have all power
and magic as some somebody set here but
if you use clarity and insight in the
projects so let's fix that and move this
thing is why file functional this is a
thing
I don't think such a mature but what
we're doing is this is we're going back
today let's see we did catboat we didn't
have like object op imagine reference to
some function everything was a function
so we can do that easily we have sort of
an object oriented API so this is the
same idea but there's no class it's just
for functions I'll go for you but we
have the same basic API so there's a new
or initialize something we don't
withdraw deposit I'm going to get a pass
same behavior same business logic
different method different approach
different sort of power your objects
only function it's let's take a look at
you so in this function oriented there's
no object so we have we have to store
pelota so what I'm doing in the payload
being the valve we have to manage our
balance in some fashion so what I'm
doing is up using a dipped and this is a
map structure in Pikeville and this is
how you create so the curly brackets say
that the limits the dict and then I've
got a key and a value it's a convenient
way to ship stay / i'm going to use a
bunch of different things i could have
just use the values of you should
totally but i chose to use a dick here
because it's gonna be alright so now the
withdrawal function is taking rather
than self which is found it implicitly
it takes a specific account so now I'm
passing it for that I used new to trade
the cap into withdrawing the past a
calculator back in the days when we
leavin functions this time so I apply
the same in function and then allowed i
subtract the balance and this is how
Python this is not you
I bit square brackets this is Keith so
that's this is the value this is the
battery's going to take that down so i'm
going to subtract the allowed amount and
the reassignment to account and we
return the allowed it's the same exact
algorithms music same business logic
different similarly the deposit i'm
going to add the amount of balance
there's no return this is implicit none
same same guy and then return it i'm
going to return the balance that they're
going phones so much oh ho to know to
function at a point functional audience
because if I said functional this guy to
do like functional but we'll see all
right so let's look at context here at
caesars so we created quite the account
so this is returning a dick but we don't
care with that it's it's black box the
API handle sites instruction let's draw
up a passing that in but we don't come
out withdrawn we get the balance it's
our new balance I'm going to print it so
it's exactly the same with just a little
change here but here's the context so
this question is remembered in the
communities of pleasure idioms 10 is
this context a matters and what we've
done is we've removed this object
oriented class hierarchy problem then we
just have a function so we do have to
worry about balance you do have to worry
about where this you know what is this
thing where does it come from ok and
then it contains a spell so we still
have to know that but so we're
interested in this thing but there's no
chance in this code here of implicit
behavior because we've removed
inheritance we've removed multiple areas
there's no handles this is a function
and this is sounds great so it's there
so kind of
it's much more simple here are two
functions what happens if we run these
two things in turn what happens if we
run run these things in the same at the
same time lapse your no idea that that's
that so that's what that is one answer
well then I eat later like other just
works but in fact you're in trouble here
because account is being modified this
is the recipe mop up here and the amount
of light here so in this case you have
to worry about that we need to take how
am I going to synchronize this I'm going
to copy a measure of this code which is
not press it in the executor proper you
can safely that's my bangles of
authorization let's still contacts that
you have to worry about the afternoon /
would it be nice up just like memory
after the gym every action there's no
new there 13 is no free there's no fish
we don't worry about memory management
or but this code you have to make me
worry about intention right at practice
yeah so the so the yeah so so the
conservation years by moving through
over to this you lose polymorphism which
Britain's really what's going on and
then Polly more important my morphism
there is saying I can apply the same
functions through a single object and
they behave differently I would argue
that that's even in my event beta point
that that's even more context and you
don't have to work I have made that
point because I didn't draw any players
want to keep the sort of context the
point simple but in fact in oh oh that
is big decision yeah well this dynamic
your dynamic the dispatching in the
universe's only know where things are
going so you know others even more so
this viewer thing you're still you have
to worry about which is on a space
function oriented google you simplifies
and maybe slip how that thing is
initialized so there's less context to
learn just by making that one to say but
you still have the currency company
still need to worry about how does this
stuff going to behave when accessing
perfectly then any language you're going
to have things like this I mean this is
Python this is where a little bit see
you this goes up by a factor of 10 or
more probably more whatever the things
you to keep track on to know of the
features of languages language and
looking any particular language this
context thing undermines the clarity of
the clarity off how clearly is this code
be community so this is still a problem
so let's try to fix this by before
moving from a function
purely for me to a purely functional
world it looks like this same exact API
but there are two differences I'm going
to highlight them this function remains
the same in this function remains a
similar the two functions that modified
account we're going to change because in
a pure functional purely functional
world we don't want to modify things we
don't want full side effects previous
version we had side effects we want to
get rid of those things and make a copy
pretzel syllabus so here's the
withdrawal let me change this rather
than modifying account you never
modified how do we make highly change it
how do we change something we can what
we don't we create a copy of with with
the correct state so we do allow for the
new balance here and then we return
rather than a modified account which
return to value sets up this parenthesis
here meaningful tub so two elements in a
couple we're adjourned the amount
allowed because you're still interested
now but here's the cool thing we return
a new account it isn't about here's the
old version we're modifying account in
place boom that's side effect so we keep
calling the single same amount we're
going to change the result of this is
going to be different every time ramada
another way of looking at side effect is
that changes the universe outside of the
function so this is a side effect and we
do a side effect like this you have a
problem with concurrent taxes if you
don't modify anything you've removed
that problem so rather than not flying
in a place here we're creating copy the
make next output is going to be
correct States but the immersion wasn't
fun similarly the deposit same idea for
the new balance and I will create a new
that is a new time you've never modified
that's over so here were modifying the
account in place that's aside so we're
gonna get rid of that thing here's how
you use it instead of the previous one
which looked like this where we just
think we just have single value we're
actually going to have two values here
as a result of that function call but
the rest looks very similar REM getting
the balance on the original getting on
the of it so there's no changer this is
effectively immutable this is the new
accounts and still going to get the new
balance from the updated economy
proposal the all makes sense were not
modifying something we're creating it
now that's it so here's the context
there's no lo there's no inheritance or
the polymorphism there's nothing
complicated there ok good now what about
different access new movie one is this
process though uni happily you pound for
freds and this runt have the same
results consistently over time yes yeah
it's true based on what we see here
that's true but what I is it overly
worried about this is context is this
all going further in the English and
that's a big question my vitamin loves
the month I state I mean by that will
love the modified its own function will
be calling but if you're not careful so
very easy to change things in Python so
now on one ramp this will say it's got a
complex but you know I'm creating new
things in it sound weird but what we're
really worried about is a stuff that I
don't know because if I not things to
change so it is true that this code
naively looks like it's both sided by
free i can be safe but i still like
metal
context you worry about what other
things can be going on here that's why
we've Linzer so we have other all sorts
of things in the throat or code if we
don't know in 10 days so now I'm going
to be something which will actually
purely functional it's not just a
functional model but it's actually they
do that we have to move from Python to
something else python is not functional
or not purely from you can't use you
can't use Python safely in this context
dude why decide can we move to something
which you can this is early so I'm going
to let you absorb this block of code
this is really it looks sort of like I
thought what I mean not really yes
certainly the same shape same line count
airline is kind of like to have done
functional languages if it was very
simple from a direct and does I think
this quote straightforward so let's go
through the same four functions and
you're going to see the same habits are
moving from Python the early don't worry
basically the same thing will go fir so
the Python version the duration of the
new account was watts per tradition of a
dict so it was something able to have
the balance in her letting there is no
where there is an outage but let's go
this is a convention interlink to create
some sort of structure and it is a
tumble so there are two elements in the
couple patrol about racism in sup 201
and to this lower case account is called
an atom in early basically just
represents itself an atom is that can't
be changed its not variables it can't be
bound to some other
it is the same as the number one number
two it's just human readable this Mako
case in other languages you might do it
and you know let you know Red equals y
oro Napoli setting rather than passing
one around which represents we're having
caps in constant already reading you're
going to meet to know intentions so
that's what that's all on Adam does in
in our way and here the initial deposit
is passing so I'm representing the
payload of the account with that perform
next withdrawal the same account that's
the payload have passed into the amount
at early this is kind of very cool
people here at work they're letting
overlay so this is a really cool feature
another highlight so I'll had mentioned
your alliance or later is it follows a
logical about social competence where
things are sugar Falls so these are
expressions so i'm going to call about
this is a functional also i want to call
this function with a couple arguments
and what will happen is early i will try
to try to match the patterns the shape
will Peck you a pattern of this argument
with this first are even with this in a
second area with that if the first
argument is not a double this will fail
you'll get an error so this will not be
called successful if it is if it is a
couple of element 1 3 4 etc it will fail
because this is too now will not match
it has to be a couple of two elements
the first element
is not that the atom of how it will say
you can't have doggie but it won't work
you can't pass the number one your
professor stringing it has to be a cap
then finally it will bind to this
variable this variable the value of
balance so it's basically a way to
assert that I expect is first argument
to be an account it's like type checking
without can check it's very cool I
didn't define a pipe wrench made this
this little thing up but I have
effectively the same the same for our
safety it's just a runtime check so it's
going to be patterned after lunch bowl
and it's going to succeed or it's going
to fit in this case we hope it succeeds
available balance and then I'm not
always be bound to the second the second
or the rest of us pretty straightforward
I'm going to calculate the minimum of
the mountain balance as we expect
calculate the new balance and then
return allow and then the new structure
it's exactly the same as the same things
similar with deposit same idea here
ready two valves from the new account
and then this is even easier I just
return the balance for Gabriel's wool
right put it off the line this becomes
very second name you just sort of create
these things in a pattern match but like
from an expression standpoint
exactly exactly the same as the Bible
here's how you use it new account it's
the same idea about shuffle here
withdrawing my update account balance my
new balance and occasional so what about
context here so this is a payoff for
using normal so that's my context
there's nothing outside of the sack to
worry about I'm even less worried about
the new word brother boarding what's in
that with like that dick and less
worried about it in case you're lying
because it's kind of tight here and I'm
you care with this country I just know
that this is a basically what I'm
looking for somebody's telling us that
account and here's the balance I don't
care like from a from a little early
today after you care of this game fun I
don't not worried about this you
implicit factory they had created stain
and worry about I just noticed this is
my AP on the menu balance etc so there's
no context here that I can see anyone
see any other context outside sponsor me
would ever have to worry about
you through by the virtual machine get
the room nooters running on drawing the
power supply if we're not earth if we're
about yourself yes that's true at that
boundary so we're going to provide a
boundary there but i would say given
that there's structural is something
that you can help the elders I've seen
here saying what's the number will
change the subject even though it really
doesn't affect it yeah I'm sure that
would be a gene I don't know if that
would be a matter of context in this
book for this particular function so
that's context maybe a little for life
so the observation was that you do have
to worry about this because you're sure
assuming that town is going to be that
definition all the time what else if you
want to add will help sway up add more
elements this time and so that's going
to affect the all the different
functions intercession that's true but I
don't think that out for this for this
particular expression as somebody
reading the scope and that's that's the
point here do I have to worry about
anything else for this particular
function I think answer to definitely
you know
I don't like you're bringing up for the
future let management of the system but
that's not this function this function
to me is context right i think i'm
pretty sure deposit so here we have a
concurrent problem right is this threats
it is as very fit in early you can't
modify hey there's no way to change
state there's no contention for state in
your life that's why our line was known
for its concurrently support concurrency
you can have all these processes running
as long as your functions are it in this
way which is the side-effect free or not
you can't change the variables no choice
in some case it is safe so I don't worry
about concurrent access I can look at
this stuff than just reason about what's
going on free of context so this is the
point of us our program it is a
propositional calculus two loops from
the sort of the illogic of saying X can
possibly equal x plus 12 saying X
dependably can never equal x plus well
there's no value of x for which this
will never be true your admissions are a
little
so for me doesn't that's the soul as
also to remove from like this imperative
model but we're saying you take this
change this do this whole whole thing
you know over here do this we're sort of
scattered all the fish go to a
mathematical expression expression which
is true or false and that's a beaut
ability so just this step of going from
things that could change the things I
can't change and animate a maintenance
of logic moving from putting things into
memory from asserting truth with things
like this moving from assignments
logical statements we will remove a huge
swath of things to worry about I want to
give you an example gopher for me that
is beautiful but so the meat for me
moving into a functional territory where
you're cutting out a bunch of contents
which could potentially confuse you
surprise things and undermine the idea
what is this supposed to do what does
this person mean when here's you access
code functional programming will greatly
simplifies so that's the deep so i'm
going to show you an example so the
plate over here comes with a series of
essays rpj potter and the specular 1990s
and one of the chapters will on an
algorithm or could contain the album of
the greatest common room so this is a
description of
grace coming down there you go up to
integer values what is what you put
value what integer is the highest value
that community like you lee into the
tube and so the six and two then I'm
dancers 2603 the answers so basically I
do this II caliber this is how you get
this is how you answer the question what
is the GCD of these two numbers so the
basic idea is to divide the small
integer into larger and keep the
remainder or that simple if the
remainder this hero the divisor that is
the thing on the bottom is the GC
otherwise you replace the dividend with
the divisor the divisor the remainder
the loop it seems simple but I read that
anything like I guess I understand that
in theory but I really really do
encourage the animals okay so maybe if I
look at the code and you have a little
pseudocode maybe I'll maybe this will
help you understand so here's the code
this is pseudo so he s utica this is why
I'm it's exactly the same with the
exception of like death in this poem so
how does a good job of representing
suitor all right so that's that's the
definition in English okay I got it
confusion let me read the cove api
functions so then I started to read the
code m is the absolute value of ham n is
the absolute value n well and is ok
looping on this first am that's the
they're the at this point right here IC
champ and that's the remainder and then
this is switching and looping here I are
less understanding of this than I did
before and I didn't have money for this
is not this is not gonna be my
understanding he'll make a much more so
I want to went back to the English okay
so the five even Boehner not really God
and then I said well I'm gonna imma try
to write this in there early because I
know they're like is function language
it's going to help me to give me a
better shot of reasoning about let's go
let's go strip away the context that's
endemic to this so here this context
I've got this is State that's changing
is tip changing this is a loop see
that's maintained there's projects all
over the place this is basically a
context changing machine but I have the
reason and I my book my brain simply
can't I have to pray that this is right
f execute of the test it and I just hope
it's right that's such a basic policy
program so here here is my attempt my
first cast in early okay so step 1
divided and keep the remaining juicy
news function to arguments and I don't
need to handle this somehow but I don't
know what's going on I'm just basically
trying to get
down as quickly as possible great that's
something here's the years the miniature
division doesn't fit the remainder and I
know I handles and because i know i've
ever tried this in this is Sarah so I
know that much the remainder is here the
divisor is a juicy okay so this is going
to do something I don't know what it's
going to do the result of this operation
Ichiro then return the divisor which is
in that's the thing on the bottom so
this so far represents I can start your
reason about what's going on if this
represents so far what's going the next
part soldier I also plus the dividend
put the visor advice of the remainder
loop so that took me a while to figure
out what's going on here here's the
remainder so this is a pattern match
applause and early you can create
different you can create multiple
function clauses so this is kinda like a
gift like a conditional expression here
and we call this function it will say
does this pattern match so if the free
versions one will it match we will not
match one is not zero so they will say
only what efforts are given 20 will this
thing match you'll return whatever
so make sense the second version is
whatever is not zero so that's the
remainder so that's the amount of a pub
called non zero remainder to be pedantic
but it's just the road the other
remainder and then I enter into this
bispecific Falls right so I need to loop
when I hear the word loop in a
functional language I know it's a
recursive call so I'm going to call
function the same public that's what you
call fat fingering thing you're holding
all right back ok so I'm going to I'm
going to do the loop so i got a call and
I can replace you so I'm flipping some
supper ok so I'm going replace to
dividend the divisor so that's the
dividend here's what the top part that's
the remainder that's 10 so the divisor
goes over here that's the end part and
the divisor of the remainder that's the
remainder here so this looks like Eminem
and loop I don't even know was fortunate
but I'm pretty sure it seems to be what
is being said it so I tested it in the
world around the code 5 so I know I have
a working out with remember the premises
whole thing is intent when you call
function do something it's a pretty good
sign that you don't know what you're
doing and you're trying to communicate
and the fact is I don't know what this
does I don't even know the call
basenotes a function so I'm running
stuff and often if I don't know what's
going on let's talk do something do this
thing that's working I don't know what
it is so I need to fix this did I feel
good let me shift something holding some
while we fiddle Sunday I also spot here
that there's a problem if this is eros
in a blow so I can fix that by catching
the zero case up here and returning him
so that's what's going to go on here is
going to catch that and i'm going to
call this something else well what do
you call this what is what is this
outward what do you do something don't
look at this thing and the best thing to
come up with was this all right so
here's the case of zero so avoid line /
02 again pattern match with zero return
town so this case I don't even know this
stuff I know it's related to this
algorithm called GCD underscore
something and I'm handling remainder is
slightly reduced so I know it's going to
work everybody but this is still not
very clear what the heck is this I don't
I literally don't know what this is
doing so I'm like well this is why this
would one the plane I was thinking just
like my thought process bull I don't
know what this does but maybe if I can
think about it but recent about the
arguments that's being worked on look
these operation I might be able to
figure out what's going on so energy
puzzle puzzle pieces where you try to
think okay here's a there's a piece
that's going to map into this area nice
try it and it doesn't fit sometimes you
can just turn it and you get low and fix
so what I'm going to do here is
basically turn post pieces doesn't bit
this is weird I don't know this is I'm
just going to like kind of mess around
and see if I bring
kind of get all this so I'm looking at
this thing going okay that's n that's
the leg out that this remainder now
wonder if this remainder is actually em
because this is maybe this isn't a
remainder after all maybe this is down
so what I'm going to do this next step
is just sort of turn the pulpy so i'm
going to change this thing from
remainder to Pam and see what happens to
my brain this is quite random flailing
so I don't know but I'm trying to
understandable decision so just playing
around so now this is this is M and M
alright so now my brain says okay this
looks a lot like this up here although
the arguments are reversed so what
happens if i simply reverse the
arguments so i put the n over here in
the 0 pre make it look like that I don't
know what I'm doing it your own Center
try we'll see what happens so I flip it
so I have to flip this as well that's
the second pulse up make this consistent
I have to flip these two that means i
have to flip this one and this one and
then this one in this one so I'm
polluting the arguments I need to flip
the call they're basically providing
computing operations here that don't
modify the function so I'm testing the
single making or but let's see what
happens that's what's up so one from
this Phyllis flipped so now it's ready
to really look like it so I have honey
I'm kind of like having hope your spring
cool the other thing what if this isn't
n but it's aunt maybe I got it wrong I
suggest it i called it in because the
thing told me they call it man but maybe
it actually am going to turn the things
you have going to replace this with em
and now
flip this so that can read from em
that's going to come and change all this
everything else stays the same that's
almost so they look at it like wow this
not only looks the same sort of it is
exactly the same so I can just get rid
of this thing and I have to put anything
at all right I can just replace out this
if you look at this thing this GCD
handle actually call it do something
does I don't know what else it's exactly
the same and 0 mmm right except brother
mcclung as other suppose this other
thing I could just do this that's really
excite and I thought wow if I you know
myself or three lives when I can this is
right I like so happy because I went
from this crazy straw life ended too
logical that's just that's just like a
matter of county lines but then
something truly magical and looked at
this and I didn't understand the
algorithm up until this point I saw down
here's the algorithm the reason that is
like this move all the stuff off this
point was completely opaque to me this
is reasonable to saying this the
greatest common denominator of any two
numbers in one of those is zero the
other one is the answer I thought about
that Mike ok it has to be writing 20 can
be divided by anything and the greatest
number of the highest look this is this
is some doesn't accommodate a positive
or negative so you'll see this washer
negative of a negative is passed in so
that's the approximate that you want to
check let's as soon as possible we
didn't bring a butch excellent any
positive number is going to be the
greatest common
that's just like that just so we're
state basically stating a fact but if it
isn't what we doing this is effectively
a search strategy which is just flipping
so I'm going to perform the division
here and get the remainder and i'm going
to i'm going to try again but i'm a flip
the order so i'm going to basically flip
back and forth chipping down one side or
the other side along the way using
integer division and there's something
about energy division here which gets me
in a couple of at least go where it's
got manometer but assuming that does it
does the trick i'm flipping back and
forth until I converge on Jill so I
start with a bunch of things and then
put the cumin customers so that's a
strategy and at that point like you know
I don't fully understand why this works
but really to kind of sketch things out
you know you'll see okay I got this this
is the remainder anyway you the diamonds
that but assuming that that would get me
make some progress and it does this
strategy is try think fairly clearly
reflected here if we go back to the way
that we originally described this
dividing people are major the members
here uh and we look further at this
thing to me to me to my brain none of
that as a pair but when we look at this
thing if he comes in here it's the
clarity of intent is clear right the
intent is good that's me is this working
so this is the brave newell of functions
so when we're fed refactoring and
changing our approach from you know
mutating state and managing all
complexity related to programming
language that we're moving to sort of a
well reasoned approach what is going on
here what am i human San does it work
yes that was enough that's not raw not
done yet what does this mean functional
programming languages let you do that
more effectively than careful I believe
there's just quite the incontrovertible
try to make the case okay so this isn't
it what's fun to do this is the
centerpiece of functional language
culture program to answer the question
what its function do this is this is
function program so he was like do
something what does it do what is what
is it doing what is what I call this and
that process let me enforce me that to
further clarify further clerk or further
clarify that's what I use an awesome
program fluidly every day my rep
programs I'm thinking about what the
heck I'm trying to do what do I mean a
date what is this supposed to do and
trying to make this clear as possible
it's a hard process and this is
something that's very common my work it
isn't a matter of like bureaus and
saying oh I'm a red philosopher and
worth it you know it's a matter of
getting the computer to do what you want
but that isn't the final goal the final
goal is to be clear we put yourself to
become validity cobbles and that's
something i call not something i also
install rubber it up leaders with rubber
duckies not good
simlock spends a lot of our ducking is
when you put a little duck be anything
something I but dr. Keats and go duck
out there and you explain something to
the duck that can question you but when
you're explain something crazy to the
duck you know you somehow know that the
duck knows that it's crazy and applause
you said I know you don't believe me and
then you have to go figure and that
whole algorithm the looping changing I
couldn't justify the topic could we get
the dog to believe me when I was because
I didn't understand it myself it looks
like sorry not I don't get it good went
up then you go in and how about
understand what's going on what's going
on and then you explain the strategies
try to find the register not it up it
looks like okay okay we get and you're
here at me because you underneath so
this is process of sort of not settling
so last minute myself we have this idea
but programming you want to express it
as you clear it it's not there
t is more work to me ok so this is the
context you want been going through all
this stuff Tommy I think I make a
consent of the crisis and software
because marshal program is all this
whole topic I'm sort of being deliberate
and clear it's been pretty well studied
back in the 60s does like refer to be
discovering the principles of almost
half a century if you're talking about
so I wouldn't say that there is a crisis
but really how many programs that you
know actually vertical think about this
and for whom clarity of the 10 is
important most programming language a
language give you a tool to express your
content more clue and that's why I think
they really represent not just it's not
just concurrency multi-core and all
these advantages it's to help
programmers really be deliberate and
very very communicative and very very
clear so what's the pale is it just
because you're being clear you want
express yourself clearly that's some
arbitrary principle I think the payoff
business when you get up code and you
walk away from that code and you have to
come back to that remember the premise
was that coding is an experiment you try
something you see how it works and you
go back to change it so you might you
may lose abelian if you got wrong it is
a feature
give the modify behavior it's constantly
changing even if there's growth sitting
there for years it's always subject to
the possibility of change we come back
to that thing and you come back to a
well-reasoned clear statement of the
tent you can then reason about how is
your change it's a conversation it's a
conversation with yourself conversation
with your colleagues if you're writing
this code for your colleagues and
yourself is same thing social you have a
responsibility I have responsibility for
laying down clear coherent sensible or
well reason code is we're going to come
back with something if we have no idea
what it does you cannot effectively
change it if you've ever debug code
that's insane and chaotic and completely
incoherent you understand much its cost
time it often creates more about so
you're actually go in the reverse
direction rather than fixing something
to make it worse fair ever seen ever run
into the K squared mixture of you credit
to other else right because because you
have no idea when you heard you ladies
the perfect prison before you had no
idea to hear she was doing it was no
clear it and you're just confused you're
struggling and you're thinking that
global variable set here where that
people class hierarchies over here
you're trying Frank and just made this
work and it does but then other things
been both a mess this model throat an
English functional programming languages
help you to cut is you
tools to do we'll push that into history
so we can start to really be responsible
and clear and thoughtful program so to
me that is pure unadulterated angelic
pristine beauty wow this is question
time there's no reason we r we having
time where you just take this oh you
just take let's say visit not know hey
take most of those questions mm-hmm no
you have to put it in forms like a
shepherd you know let's imagine that the
other sort of sort sol de
object-oriented paradigm sheriff here
probably your perfect Leroy and then was
to the vet because you use multiple
inheritance any good like you can have a
lot of object-oriented nests without any
inheritance at all this might be read so
the other the observation was that i
cheated i hope i exploited great
weakness but for his programming but by
using inheritance and even using
multiple errors which even the most
seasoned aggressive and reckless
programmers can address this what is the
point of object-oriented programming if
not to divide I'm sorry so classic but
what's the point I'm not talking about
the throw the SSR definition the
Franklin
definitions message passing it isn't
message passing optra in programming
today is job it's c++ and what doesn't
matter how he wrote in an email how long
ago put his attention vision for small
the reality is human mental operated
patterns and design therefore job data
for c++ and those things are there for
euros so if you're a network csharp same
thing these things are designed around
here so if you're saying well we don't
do this inheritance then I would say you
don't need oh you don't need the double
useful let's go back to see so I don't
think it's I don't think it's unfair to
Poquette because that's why it's that's
festive person and people tend to
practice to eat it while you can use it
differently i Justi don't be any of it
so these languages you know if you want
if you're stuck in oval and job moved
closer if you're stuck in hobo embassy
sharp F sharp so fine language within
your ecosystem that is politically
viable that isn't elbow and just may not
use it I'm trying to like you know this
is a religious discourse this is like
I'm trying to be reasonable as sort of a
data but as a person as a scientist and
start thinking rationally about things
i'm not trying to be you know paint some
sort of religion and functional
programming i would say this if you're
interested in like if you think that
there might be something some validity
to this if you buy any of this stuff
pick the function language that is the
next nearest to your and that might take
some research like if your type if
you're really into types and math
Haskell is your is your range if you're
sort of dirty and low level I'm at early
Rolling is a very pragmatic language it
doesn't get caught up with itself as you
can see it's very very direct if you're
in netlab
you that sharp go yes I was talking
somebody who wanted to use Haskell
because it was so great and pure and
pristine that's true but this person was
in a.net show f sharpest is a great
functional language even that content or
Campbell open so there's all sorts if
you really want to be dirty and the
lists are kind of functional closer to
these very very good language if you're
back to the debut and there are
therapists there are constraints in
Scala could conceivably make it fun for
me but it certainly call the function
language myself oh this one you can't
avoid the question it is ok so let's not
call it Opie yeah let's say that some of
us programming message passing paradigm
when you move to punctual I mean unless
you use something like hypothesis you're
still you still have to someone solve a
problem that you have various kinds of
things that sometimes behave in a
similar way so I know you're going to
have something like type classes again
if your language or you're going to be
right rewriting a lot of code because
you know you have some kind of logic
that withdrawal slip or accountants you
have 10 10 types of accounts that
different for something wait will not
going to handle the buddies so the
observation is that you want you there
easier domains for me age that are
independent of a underlying
implementation so you have sort of
layers of abstraction and you want to be
able to capture behavior or something
and you can be able to row different one
different payloads at slack
do you have some behavior that's this
level you have seemed to be here with
that level you don't want to be
combination code old Lester that's
amazing there are patterns in function
language handle that so there are so in
early so depends the language definitely
depends on language it only is a
dynamically typed language it doesn't
have it doesn't have types it doesn't
have a hierarchical types especially
level primitives that represent numbers
and lists and very straightforward
language and that the payload can be
sort of typified and there are
conventions and you're like dude you're
describing they're done all of you
basically basically from duck typing so
you have something that complies with an
interface so to it it provides a service
pump exported set of functionality was
it actually call behaviors sure all i
can do that and you can pass in a module
name where you can pass in a number of
functions on that can provide sort of a
high level or low-level behavior to be
looking so that's the better look sharp
you've got a really rich text absolutely
if we're really about connecting ok
later a really rich type system and you
can do dispatch on the type so you can
you can cap you have the same function
and you can throw it in different type
you know you can't imagine function if
you have to guarantee hater that we want
you can pass in a function to that
function and have its delegate lead so
they're different patterns of doing it
it's very convenient available but lets
you do lots of things a little bit
harder but it slows you down a little
bit and it doesn't get its all explicit
it keeps it in front of you in the
function call so you have to look
upstream it makes the context right it
limits the context so rather than
putting all of this implicit behavior
you
because of this sprawling landscape of
ontology I think you're modeling the
world and this is of this is amiss is it
all these other things right there
French here's the call back all that if
you want to know if you want this thing
to do something specific and I don't
know what it is give me a call and I'll
call and then you find the API for that
and pass it so basically taking Bobo and
inverting football brother than the ball
up here it's all down here in front
that's explicit that's what is called
very high life do something
expression problem and every every
programming language word excels offers
at least some solution to the expression
growth maybe well none of them offered
it the perfect solution between all of
them try to go as far as they can yeah
observation area this is called an
expression problem and one of the ways
of looking at the imperative versus the
functional code the previous imperative
code provides of statements statements
that are executed and the other one is a
series of expressions which have are
more easily reason about in terms of
meaning so if you can somehow rain will
your your code or your language whatever
by are we using to be more expressive
incentive expressions you can achieve
that I would already by the language if
you have an HP I don't play around just
trying to see what happened project we
have something on the side and see what
happens nothing should ever be accepted
because someone else says it you should
try an experience and you can you know
learn learn alternative approaches that
effectively achieve the same thing is
over go but do so kind of different to
different way than you can say I like
this better I'd opening I rented a
situation where I hadn't get something
done I was trying to do what I said he
actually called a taxi to do and I just
found that it was too much work and I
just need to know cabin so that's a
confession this is a religion I'm coming
before you know confessing cos I did
that so I think that mean you know the
is grammatically speaking there's a lot
of parties
we go along so you get it in the same
way that you can do a lot of good you
can you like they're lucky to have works
just wrong yeah yeah I think so lucky
bastard Thatcher bags felt all use you
own rules what we're going nobody's odds
ratios down France in the day because I
showed you the
but if you have poor of actions whether
utilizing that complicated up I didn't
used to get lost once and you could have
just created factions of creating my
account make based on the changes that
way completely exactly the structure
over them and so we you have a moral of
those songs that I've reached directly
into account that knowing that is later
a learner or cash
pretty hard to maintain
lets you decide that you want a new
structure and you track them down and
you get a small operation you yeah just
very so the observation is that I've
decided I'm decided encapsulation where
you want things be a black box if you
want to sort of to feel the defined
black box in a way that is sustainable
and truly black and the approach of the
functional functions here is that you
have this payload that kind of leaks out
in the world so you're creating this is
accountable and those what can be done
to that long way and because you have
functions you can have them all over
placed into modules in different parts
of the system so how do you actually
represent this thing in a cozy way so
there's two ways of looking that one
would just be you can do it through the
other type system that will help the
great deal to glue things together early
doesn't get it up is a bit wild and
milena in that case so then you might
have to rely to convention so invite by
convention and early this wall going one
option so you know modules notice the
life cycle is paid that's very common in
early but I would also i would kind of
go further I don't care like so what a
202 points so what if you have functions
in different purposes as long as the
functions are well-defined and
reasonable you can understand what they
do
with it oh why do you have to have a
camp life why are you trying to draw a
boundary around all things that are
related to love this thing why don't
have a function over here that can do
something else I mean why is it that
there's nothing that you give functions
different flexible
I thought they they know their
instructor okay so and that doesn't
bother me as long as you know is it if
this is what you're doing clear you know
as a coach to actually practically
maintainable and unreasonable I think
answers in these cases that you could
assert can have another modules which
can handle it and then also let's say
you have a fact-checking and you've got
sprawling put all over the place as long
as you can come back to the function as
a recent about when things break like
you have a violation or something or
something failed at least you can now
recent about it now going through
spaghetti program because your code is
basically designed to create one there's
one hundreds of side effects there's no
way to recent power so even if you're
the worst the worst possible saviors
tried it I still think as a superior
state because our code is reasonable you
can approach that Kevin fixed problem
even the worst horrible things are
striking it's better than most right
back any language no I'm just rated by
that book driver we left
observation about the cancellation
charges
so in control inheritance levels they do
a struggle pillow well it will be much
but them yeah so about this so you're
concerned that if you use these patterns
and non functional language you try to
make up non functional language look
functional you're going to lose sort of
the expressiveness well that is it
starts to look hummingbird rentals from
python is pretty weird that's a weird
thing I would never expect to see that I
saw that I feel like what is this person
trying to prove here why you know so i
would say this good reason to not use
Python so i mean i said i tend to use
you use idiom that language want you to
use but the fact is there are bunch of
languages of you tremendous job you know
really isn't one of them you know
there's not a lot you can't do with this
language all the system interfaces are
very very good you just move over there
and you can solve same problems not
without without the pickle but I would
HIGHLY degree I don't think you want to
I don't think you want you to see and
try to do this I don't think you're
going to be I just think about of time
but this is the payoff for functions the
yards of banding is a range for the
bandage if you don't have this is a
party group
I think you're missing think it's it's
useful for you so encouraging if you're
not at least a bit about the stuff to do
it experience it and then you can take
home run so that thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
