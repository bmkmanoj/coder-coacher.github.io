associated local social games are games
to play the process by devices and
evolving and well composed of two
components station generalization and
the secondary sector now we click on
server side now I just need a point to
start with is what happens in a one-way
well increase the rate on the 10-year
players coming back today to play our
games systems which are and once it pops
is basically the doctor sorry charge to
run so so the graph is made of
so this was a 100 point of view
and he walked mainly our baby a
subsection of the mostest
it was the first car to Kaname been in
practice for structure that's repeated
said when you develop different level to
take this is the cloud means dating when
is from outside you see a metal
structure going to s closer to the town
you see that each valve is made of
national groups like smaller clubs in
Connecticut close at one to five again
is particle moves like is Kournikova
this is fractional repeats itself over
and over circuits grows here there are
two T's to be able to and popular where
someone says this is pretty cool we cool
any robot for you to meet the schedule
and probably this may be much CPU is no
politics second limit for was up to this
week and says oh wow this customer
expects in advance of certification
so I want to know how many instances are
we using to a Christian worker for being
immigrants per day which are amazing
what we have so how did you decide how
to draw so we together with you
obviously she allows working out for us
the application system of several that
was the end of 2010 and I was in
position in small things and everything
we specific robust Eve okay so one thing
we find at least designers responding
and the team as well the point was I was
going off from one team where I follow
the media and was running a team that
was working on scratch and then I was in
the position of looking at the past
experience of our first one and take
this
I wanted mission things and I wanted to
provide using which tools and so on
so what we learned from our first well I
think the thing elimination first is
complete automation worship and when it
was the time putting like our 60
Application Center well it wasn't here
and it will just about repeating what we
like using automation to like check we
were actually able to reconsider and
that's all the you started seriously
so this is not a single really good very
good
who's giving us the second thing we
learned was that a little first week
well if through the network and these
system in the Planning Center and you
actually could be reception
accommodation
so on the other side is through this
commission is my host can suffice and
resources so easy it's become a problem
you just have capacity regret this we
can solve a song so there is a mix of
using support much
was that maintaining installation of
Spanx understanding how to move the ball
of rock which is part of our from a
sequel to raise and move with other
solutions and in general maintenance
work was made from databases hello sexy
quality and efficiency
so this point why we were still thinking
well maybe a ground speed automatic was
targeting well one possible business in
producing games is it's very hard to
predict within successfully okay you
might reach to me other users
at all and you might wish community knew
this three weeks afterwards we might
reach them one yet so much so it's very
hard to estimate up front of the project
if you wish at me first actually we need
which are mostly is fashionable and of
the area is like sample vultures sheets
to the people we need to complete the
crafts and Steven
you need to somehow respond to this
event is another thing that is is we
release a new version every week because
being online means we can very often and
we need to quality product
Mexicans offer great unity and the
changes the platform are synthesizing we
need to be able to share easily and in
mobile time to allow decisions and you
can increase it if you look at how the
market works is some to be this week
yes there will be well defined and you
have any cow provide these resistances
and this is connected network which
would have been more efficient and the
rest is kind of unique in what why
being able to post so easily
so to answer the question where is the
resistance of all the more thing
so so and wages propagates easily across
with satisfaction because if your
company serving as a beach immediately
the whole stock with the slowdown or at
problems what that means that if you
deploy these kind of systems on top of
that center there
by out it's a kind of frustration so you
will always switch okay ready you will
always be some control on factor of the
country consoles so if if you can
require of this game why is that the
capital it wasn't actually driving this
country of the two parts something
dimension was very common exactly is the
fact that the system is stateless okay
so because it's matrix then it needs to
be able to work with the state which is
the world one of providing sex so you
see people can start speeding
application servers
it might take on that is the name is
their every need
okay computation of waiting to happen
and I need to go and fetch my states
from some diagnose a precise boxes
so from this approach that somebody
wants to original these are something a
bit weak but it is more second thing of
all them and these went finally here the
basic setup and your screen in fact that
it froze
because you know when you do the best
estimation about surface of data to
understand we then use the restroom or
not well visual physical thing much
logic it does much from this to this
side till they were the user is working
on at the moment
he's also they're able to use soon maybe
can people see the cold and it makes
some distance from these very common
scheme and try to think about it well we
can see the more sense to flip this back
around and say well that's a good thing
when I can see are you going to visit
with my data in order to formulate price
so now if you can see a common approach
you know there must be a student
so those majorities and I didn't work
out the way we do this code because he
always has a very personal thing on this
is the mental problems that we face when
we program and any look at them in that
and try to get to the amount of these
province and other interesting thing is
that any store which is called may be in
a state so I spoke about things 27
seconds into the talk so that's the
beginning it was not the book in any
sense if not a complete story about how
they do state so preaching is bring
around a dual density speak
place it ever comes in his mind with
much immediately so what I think is that
this day most contacts and languages
don't they're safe way or infrastructure
to have a steady state and that's why
sales of innocent are so common
okay because normally as a major place
for them to go where it will be the
co-operative of main book and everyone's
kind of stands out in this Miranda okay
so language which are programming of
state and explicitly state so but you
already know that the processes are
basic process which is this more than 30
bits of machine that can field you can
send and receive messages by also
enhance which will be framework which
the frame of the provider self-regulate
radio this can easily implement and
somehow to Lincoln whose behavior that
application robust and foreign and
specifically right now the entrance
sacrifice for implementation and what
provides is a way to turn based level
process into disabled and
this request an interesting thing that
there is one single process is that
implementation is very simple and the
more they will be thinking that is very
simple so here is copied this state of
the discipline when you don't want me to
do we just we implement
I'm from of Quebec's and aside how he
was how Excel very behaved so when you
can read many countries about ability
now for you so for me to do it is for
max is basically you know that every
single person of some kind and you know
which are messenger seeding from who
yours interests and what's the current
state now with this information
you go ahead maybe decide what we want
you to react to this message which kind
of reply you want to send to their
original sender of the message
thank you find your final state so right
when they stop you see that the state is
reverse thrust engine that we know how
to handle when you are on the safe in
something you think you might start in
the state you might end up in an
in-state but everything is very explicit
the estate is local to the sender you're
drafting these are very different from
what you see common so we have a very
small entity okay gents and we're which
are the worker states these contain
translated in the process you can use
the response from the press from tides
and five names into looking at
requirement without suffering which is
saying
to produce independent Prabhu so
something which was hard to find out in
this action we found without prick ridin
critter and stop wembling six wagon so
now that we found this little algebra
and the Situationists disuniformity
capacity which is well defined in this
capacity and each CPU power the one who
is to put them together can you start a
virtual machine on the situation as you
start adding your first gesture and then
III you keep adding them and you get a
decision let us you need to expand your
setup you can actually go on and just do
the same again provide of the races and
CDT within seconds and so on and you do
it'll be more anymore so now that the
recipe needs that enemy comes out of the
box which this concept of clustering
where you can connect with some machines
all together and work each other
and every single side which is a special
kind of inspect and the worship however
we said in two sets forth in Africa both
together so nothing is everyday service
because is overstated
looking internet single courses
independently okay and producing tools
so if you compare this models you see
the to lean towards truth very different
structure on one side it looks like a
network of team where everybody is able
to produce group is acting the same way
and on the other side is Henderson can
be more complicated
you are something that knows about rolls
by machines needs to be connected in a
specific way in order to be efficient
and where is the beginning of time some
quality needs to stop and search in
addition states from someone so that's
why I'm showing that the quantity you
need some form of this unit of base rate
can fetch a second beginning and linear
state when you're finished doing your
job so two arbitrary in the teacher
deployed we use ominously at office now
other additional it was meant to be a
file storage however you just over theta
what we work for us to store this will
be half and what's why because well
since we don't need to use none with a
much most requests when he answered
without
we don't mind the fact with
experimentally physical resistance
closer
candygram he made artists we don't
really care so much more performance is
pretty resilient
okay and just very large capacity we
should come to the best class you can do
with ten to the fourth to ever no
traceable rate and since the assumed
spelling me as we are easy so it is
because we can grow we can't amazing
avoid worse people actually stop working
for us and if you think about it there
is uniquely scalable database is using
TDD okay it's all about operations is
not about just doing assessment of a
rocket so you always have capacity and
doesn't make it time to look for a
bigger more capable octopus but he's
available exactly in the same way to a
single instance so if you verify with
performance across your entire
deployment there are laws which are
previous and Rosh Hashanah and on
semi-trucks
the resin is uniformly absolutely from
any point with your system so you could
see the divided this scheme Aveda yamas
necessity
a more interesting take of this kind of
the politic studies to see the pattern
is kind of spread okay all around the
infrastructure and this is the very best
way to see it so this there are
instances where you throw them into the
drug abuse and drug abuse is call me
traitor and as you see now the
conversation how our deployment looks is
very uniform is equal in every point
where is really fast and spread out ten
interesting thing is that a street
clothes are called the toilet what you
see is kind of what we were seeing
before in Simon st. Patrick changes we
see a takeover deployment but still you
correctly they were think and you follow
on going in we go to the second path
okay again so I was mentioning at the
beginning of these kind of fraction way
cruising through this is matching in how
your instruction is being with the way
across we go and go to school and in
generational is matching things context
worldwide
okay because the weight capacity is
actually also you know from you say
is more if I retreated and Panthers are
always the same
so some messages I want to read you from
the stories like opposite the same color
scheme on the toilet rebuilding this
network of Pierre dispensable containers
to keep reading over and over a desk
opposing my work exactly for the
application your body when you may not
be able to exactly say but I think
that's taking about it understand are
your system wants to produce book there
was no transponder system how do we
follow the path will be produced with
the boundaries abstraction is actually
something important that if you're
matching between story then when
revenues match and you will have less
pressure on two things
so now happy talking for a while and the
told in the beginning so is that
Americans forget how many instances we
may need to understand for communication
that Swami you play yesterday in going
browser game so Figaro native West
African trash becomes me every time the
changes
one in this basket that will be a little
problem so you know maybe 300 businesses
and what we need is about it and with
these I 2013 so this is almost is needed
is not only an exciting all boxes around
and both diseases are precluded from the
low when we talk of the Amazon okay
savage goes Chris whoa small guys you so
and so and also there are some passcode
and even over our conference which go
quietly in pain of how meeting
satisfaction
especially as a single team community
goals are fascinating conference other
questions yeah so what we were using
before service and from ours are you
going to use organic so can actually the
protocol scanning for modification okay
my house we have a few different ones
and peppers for the Citroen is positive
it was successful and it turned out to
be a much smaller regardless when yogas
and proved also that the whole concept
of our space which is under faders in
the massive week and it really frees you
up from all these need of services and
some things since I said your choices
and some things we go and actually one
thing instead chose to use and then
perform the same digits at the top price
the game ecology then we actually need
the Ruby
kind of sandwich will be grouped
together with me and in order to be able
to match
- usually game on
yes
so
because we so we have 80 and we feel
them
this mystical 16 heat because I from the
radius look at my graph somewhere weeks
going to fancy dinners on a nice week
six are basically 12 are displayed in
school campus Africa and - so
yes okay so the question is seeing that
the next time at a school friendships
paper the beginning and same from yet
and the question is what do you do is
the machine dies in between the two
events
well who is that
amplified meals we've mentioned this
division seven closely so you wanna say
what work is mutual dependency by the
loss you think you can afford and of
course if you want to choose you can
choose where you want to save your
session we say five minutes because
that's visible means you can save 40%
back over these crises in this
assignment that is all they always
needed to decide is the insensible
points to say first-rate somewhere else
because things change okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
