takes place in a post-nuclear future so
the story usually goes as follows you
grow up in a bunker and then when you're
all grown up you go out in the world in
the radioactive world and you fight
monsters and complete missions but in
full up tree some very persistent
players found that by a certain complex
set of actions you could leave the
bunker as a baby so that meant that you
went out in the world as this tiny
person you could still fight and shoot
and everything but your point of view
was really really low and and you took
ages to get anywhere because you weren't
going very fast and well I think I think
we've all seen them write some games are
we really complex systems and they are
usually written with really tight
deadlines and so that means that bugs
are basically unavoidable and so for
instance falling of the world or having
a person stuck in a tree our things that
happened once in a while so I guess this
talk is a bit about how maybe functional
programming and functional reactive
programming particular could help making
games more testable I guess or easier to
write even let's start with the basics
what are we talking about reactive
programming
a synchronous dataflow in computer
science talk is basically when you have
an environment that gives inputs to the
system and the system immediately has to
adapt state and give an output to the
world common examples robotics sensor
actuator and controller cycles you have
music we see when you press a key you
want a sound to come out a grease and
spreadsheets are often given as a like a
prototypical example though I thought
robots would make for a better picture
functional reactive programming is
reactive programming but using
functional building blocks so you can do
map filter we use and use higher-order
constructs basically the original paper
was by Colonel Elliot's and Paul Hudak
in 1997 and it made quite a stir at a
time functional reactive animation I
thought I think it was for sake of
completeness I'll say that there are
libraries which are closer to that
original paper which is uses events and
behavior to describe a system but I went
with another library called el area
because well to be honest it was easier
to understand for me and it's been
written by this at the time PhD student
ghirardelli Pat's I who then when Tom's
to be a game programmer and and he had
quite a lot of nice examples to clarify
what he was doing so we have two main
data types I guess parameterize data
types the signal the signal can be seen
as a function between natural numbers
and a data structure and basically what
it is is time varying very values so
your stream or your signal is being
sampled at
m's and you get that value back then we
have signal generators which are sources
of stateful signals and it can also be
seen as a function between natural
numbers and I guess values except that
what you get what you can then picture
is at every point you have a generator
of a signal that starts at that time T
and with those contrast you can
surprisingly do most of what you require
in a game frp allows you to declare the
behavior of your system from the get-go
by defining it be defining it as a
network of streams of interconnected
streams and as you can see it is really
easy to conceptualize so that's the
sales that's the sales pitch you have
you can think of your game as
independent streams which are
interconnected and you declare that as
your whole system which is easy to think
think up conceptually sorry so when you
look at this network this actually can
be directly transcribed to haskell as
follows we have the random number player
monster and game over streams or signals
being being described there and then the
ends is an io action where you render
the frame based on your states that
render frame can be replaced by a more
generalized output function like
rendering the frame and triggering a
sound for instance or rendering a frame
triggering a song and saving the states
or whatever it is and this network is
used by by running in true signal
generator is used by running it through
the start function the start function
takes a single generator and
transforms it into I guess what is the
step operation and once you do a join of
this this network you've defined it
moves your network one step forward
through time as it were so it's very
much a side affecting action the loop
you have here is the game loop it runs
2060 times per second in order to
display the image you want to see in
your game so let's talk about the
different components here we have an
external input so the read input
function here we're going to feed
actually sampling the external input
that we have by feeding direction keys
into a direction sing and we can use
then the direction key signal which
issues from that into our general
network so that's external input that
external input could also be something
coming from the network or mouse or
touch or whatever whatever you need then
we have self-contained stateful signals
which is basically something you'd
picture as the first one would be to 58
etc just a series but you can also have
a random number by just making your
random generator go from one number to
the next then we have stateful signals
which are dependent on other signal and
I think that's where the main part of
the game logic resides so that takes an
initial state initial player or initial
monster it takes external inputs and
other signals as is as a suitable so
move player here and wonder or hunts are
pure functions they are really the
calculation taking the previous state of
the signal and the other signals and
calculates the next
state of that signal I think I think
that's that's a very important point the
main behavior of your system is
described by using pure functions and
then we have signals which are I guess a
gathering and processing of other
signals using the up applicative
operators lecture ok let's look at this
graph again you'll notice that it's not
an acyclic graphs right you have cycles
you have a player the depends on game
over but game over also takes the player
signal because obviously game over is
going to depend on what's happening in
the rest of the game and nothing is
going to move once the game is over so
you have you have dependencies like that
so that's a bit of a conundrum isn't it
because like it means declaring things
in function in function of other things
which have not been declared yet we use
game over in player while game over is
only described at a variant so this is
allowed by the fact that signal
generators are will not fix instances
and then we also use Haskell
a blank sorry recursive do extension
which allows you to declare that but
conceptually there's another point as
well is that we're not really having a
cycle when player the terms means game
over it's a time varying signal so what
we're going to do is have a player
actually depends on a delayed signal so
that means we're going to have player
depends on whether game was over in the
last front of the loop so that means
that while it looks like we're using
things that are defined at the end and
it looks like sorry that we have cycles
actually we're we're not really having
cycles we're having dependencies on
delayed signals okay so what else would
be needing a game apart from monsters
and players and flesh eating plants and
other things what are the things that
are really common in your opinion sorry
config yeah we also need can but in this
case I was actually thinking about
levels and high scores and more were
sort of infrastructure bits so that
actually requires some sort of more
intricate use of those concepts so we
have our signal generators which
actually can be represented as a signal
starting in time T and that's also what
we're going to use to have dynamically
or levels starting later on in the game
so what we're going to do is use the
generator function here which takes a
signal of signal generators and returns
the signal generator we're going to
actually start at that level at that
time so what we're going to have is play
level layer level function
for or individual level so we have one
play level with flesh eating plants at
one play level with vampire bats and one
play level with with underground
adventures or whatever and we can
pattern match on the level number to
determine which level we're having next
and we're actually going to switch out
which generator is being used to
generate the current game signal so that
means that when our bull signals as well
this lever is now over we're going to
switch to another play level function
and on the above level we're going to
keep track on which level we are at now
and which level which we should play
next this is not very clear so I'm going
to add a little drawing so here in our
game we might have several levels we
have our general system which has games
in it and then in every game you have
levels and the level sort of calculates
whether the level is over and then when
the level is over the game sort of start
a new level and same for the game the
game level when the game level is over
it says to the upper level well the game
was over saved my high school start a
new game and sets we initialize the
states and so this way you can play with
several levels of sub network switch
which allows you to have what you
usually expect in a game and if this is
not super clear don't worry you had to
stare at it quite a while then that's
not only it's like Andrea said we need
guns and what those guns means it also
means keeping track of the states of
individual bullets so in a game you will
need to have entities which are being
created on the fly so having just a
monster and a player is not in
you will have to have a dynamic sort of
number of streams acting at any point in
time so one very simple way to handle
this would be to have a signal of an
array of bulbs for instance so that
means that you're manageable function
would then sort of look at that array
potentially adds any any new bolts
depending on whether someone is pressing
the shoot key and the position of the
player or it would would prune any any
sort of balls that would have hit
anything in the game so that would be a
possibility however I think there are
more elegant ways in the fact that you
can define a behavior for every one of
those bolts individually and then use
generators to create a source of bolts
which will create bolts as you need them
and then you sort of make a collection
of them and and basically add new bolts
signals when needed and filter out that
ones when they've hit any any component
in the game or when they reach the outer
limits of the game so we're coming to a
slightly more hairy part so far it was
it so far it was very I guess beautiful
and simple and everything but when you
arrive at physics you're dealing with a
different kettle of fish so I think if
you have simple physics you should roll
your own because it will sort of fits in
the toll framework however if you get a
lot of moving bodies and different
interacting things and floppy things and
God knows what else then it makes sense
to use an existing physics engine a
physics engine is a bit of a black box
you define at a start you define your
world so gravity
find your bodies that moving it the mast
velocity acceleration and stuff like
that and then you sort of push time
forward and and you see what comes out
of the box so this doesn't fit at all in
in our signals sort of general streaming
thing unfortunately again the library i
was using had a few a few functions that
could be worked to patch all this in one
is execute which basically is lift i oh
it's allows you to execute an i/o action
in a signal generator so in in your
network and then you have an effect full
action which allows you to take that I
an i/o action and get an actual signal
out of it which you can use in other
parts of your system so that means that
with execute to initialize your physics
engine and with effect full you get out
the position of your bowl that is
bouncing around in the system at every
iteration of your loop ok let's look at
rounding up what we looked at so what
are the cons of using frp in the game as
far as I've experienced well I think if
your game has a sufficient level of
complexity you will have a lot of
streams to manage more importantly if
you add new entities to your game that
might mean that you will have to affect
every other single stream and change
those functions of transfer functions
for every single stream because it might
interact with every single one of them
so that that can be quite a heavy
process I think and maybe someone that
bears thinking about in a more
high-level sort of way then as I said
with the physics engine you have some
added complexity with handling side
affecting that doesn't necessarily fit
in
in that streams sort of situation so
there was a physics engine but there
might also be handling assets in a sort
of intelligent way not having them all
loaded in memory when you don't need
them anymore for instance then there's a
question of performance I think in the
gaming industry they use languages that
allow them to optimize as much as
possible to bres every single second out
of things because what is going to cost
is the graphical pipeline is going to be
the physics engine you want your game
logic to be as compressed as possible so
that the experience stays really really
fast I guess so the question is whether
Haskell and this in particular with its
tree of Io refs in the back end will
provide the performance that is needed
for for our game so that is still
against an open question so on the
positive side it's conceptually simpler
you only have to think of every entity
by itself as a system with other
entities coming in to impact on it on it
then there's a testability so we have
pure functions that means we can do
property based testing on those on those
entities so in this in this property
which is not immediately clear it tests
whether when the player is in a in a
position within the world whether it
when you move it it will still be within
the world so that's sort of avoids
having any fall of the world box in your
game then there's user testing so
unfortunately games obviously are all
about user experience you cannot bypass
the user testing because that's the
whole point of the game you cannot have
automated testing of games that is just
a fact
but the the Plus that you have with
functional reactive programming is since
the behavior is fixed by your network
the only things you need is capturing
the initial state and capturing all the
incoming events and you can very simply
replay a situation so for instance a bug
tester could go record at the point of
the game play the bug and send that to
the developer the developer can then we
run that sequence change the code and we
run the sequence again and see whether
the bug is still occurring so that makes
it really really I guess easy easy to do
to test I think this is also the case
with other games to be fair but it's
just conceptually I implemented it in
like a couple of hours for my game so
that is really really easy to do and
it's also i was inspired by elm which
which does a similar thing for its
debugger so Rhonda so the gaming
industry might be a bit skeptical
because this is not a critical system
right we don't need provable correctness
for our system I guess correctness
almost comes second to the user
experience but if we can prove if I can
have the same user experience the same
kind of performance and a better sort of
conceptual view of what's happening in
the game and a better way to maintain it
then I think we have a chance to
convince them my motto thank
we have some time for questions and
anybody has any questions and I can run
around like an eejit cool well I had one
so there are also functional way of
composing a lot of things recently there
are lenses how do you see them feet like
because I've heard lens would be very
good for saying i have ever seen we've a
lot of inside object and i want to
change one particular object so I focus
on one object move this one and then
let's say a process next event and that
would be a different framework what do
you think both sink and play together I
guess the question was lenses are also a
way to get a particular component out of
a data structure or of what's happening
do you think both frp and lenses could
play together it's it's possible it sort
of depends how complex the structures
are that are you're playing with I guess
once you have a state that is a bit a
bit heavy than definitely using lenses
would make sense I guess
hi what is your opinion or have you
experienced any issues with garbage
collection dr. because what I've tried
is to use a sharp in unity with rx2 to
do some functional reactive kind of
programming but then we run into ya
issues with the amount of garbage being
produced which actually caused the lag
and in the game loop visual lack and
that was due to some technical reasons
also them apparently improved the
garbage collector but i wonder how does
haskell perform in this aspect have you
seen any issues or okay so let's be
completely fair at don't have an
enormous game so I don't have lots and
lots of components so it's actually not
been an issue yet so far ok well let's
discuss afterwards thanks i do have
caution and so have you experienced
experimented a little bit with the
component game component systems like it
as an architecture you know kind of a
like unity but trying to bring that idea
of components into a 4 p and how could i
go there if you target no I've not but
that would be interested to to have a go
if you have references
is the code for your game available on
github or something yes it is cool yeah
i can i can post it great anybody else
what thank you so much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
