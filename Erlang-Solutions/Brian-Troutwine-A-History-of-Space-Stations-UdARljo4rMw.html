cardinal sin of not having my slides
ready to go there we are
all right so by trade I'm a software
engineer and I'm interested in complex
critical software systems so those are
systems that are so large they have to
be made over a long term by some sort of
organization and critical in the sense
that they can't fail and when they do
fail very bad things happen so what I'm
interested in in particular in terms of
research and learning how to build these
systems effectively are our techno
political artifacts so that's that's a
bit of technology that influences a
political organization like a business
or a government and the the organization
influences the technology and I'm work
or I'm interested in and also worried
about failure in such system so how do
failures influence the evolution of this
technological system and for me in my
research in learning how to build these
these complex critical systems
spaceflight is a huge boom because it's
also that same sort of Technol political
artifact and it's extensively well
documented through time so what I want
to do in this talk is examine one aspect
of spaceflight which is Space Station's
and I want to take that concept of Space
Station's from the earliest theorizing
and the first part of the 20th century
all the way through to implementation to
the modern day so the early 20th century
is a fascinating time for rocketry and
it's a fascinating time because it's
it's a moment in history when theory and
practice are rapidly intermingling you
have you have people like constant until
akov ski you have Robert Goddard you
have hermann oberth all theorizing about
rockets working out the fundamental
mathematics the fundamental physics to
make spaceflight possible and at the
same time several of these men are
working on making their theories
practical practical realities so in
March 1926 in Auburn Massachusetts
Robert Goddard achieves the first flight
of a liquid-fueled
this rocket looks kind of goofy because
people weren't sure how to build them
the thrush chambers at the top and the
fuels at the bottom it only flew 41 feet
high and it detonated in a Cabbage Patch
but it was sufficient to demonstrate
that it was possible to build rockets in
1930 in Berlin Hermann Oberth who had
written about rockets in 1923 inspired
by the practical work that Robert
Goddard had done flies his first
liquid-fueled rocket and then Sergey
Korolev in 1933 in Moscow inspired by
both Robert Goddard and Herman Albert's
work flies his first liquid-fueled
rocket so you have you have people in
the United States in Germany and in in
Soviet Russia in the Soviet Union flying
rockets and theorizing about how these
rockets will work and the one problem
for these researches is that rocketry is
very expensive not only are the
materials and fuels expensive but the
fuels especially are very dangerous and
danger if you don't want to die around
dangerous things implies cost so Robert
Goddard works to get contracts from the
US Army Hermann Oberth works with the
buy more republic the German army to get
funding for his rocketry research and
and working for nation-states is kind of
a deal with the devil because
nation-states have a lot of money
but they have very particular or
peculiar ambitions for their money
so Verner von Braun who was Robert or
excuse me Hermann Oberth student and was
actually in that photograph of Hermann
Oberth continues to work for the German
army as it turns into the Nazi army and
he gets to build a rocket facility and
this is an overflight by the RAF of
Verna von Braun's rocket facility in
Penn amudha Germany and and in this
facility he builds aggregate devices a
series of rockets one two three four and
the aggregate four is a very impressive
rocket it uses gyroscopic control which
Robert Goddard had proved out in the
United States in 1933 to very accurately
control its flight path it's liquid fuel
it has a relatively large payload
but there's that deal with the devil
thing the world actually knows the
aggregate for by a different name
the v2 so in the last days of the World
War two
the Nazi government launched thousands
of b-2s in in a bid to break the resolve
of the Allies the Nazi government
actually invested a lot in super weapons
they kind of felt that they could
develop these weapons that were so
terrifying that their enemies couldn't
oppose them and they had even wackier
plans in the v2 and I don't I don't mean
wacky in the sense that they're amusing
I mean wacky in the sense that they're
completely unhinged from reality and the
one that fits best in this talk is
actually called the space gun or the Sun
gun what it is is it's a giant mirror in
space that has a little control tower on
the side opposite the Sun and what this
mirror is meant to do is focus the Rays
of the Sun on enemy cities and then burn
them from space so this is this is
taking research that Hermann Oberth did
in theorizing about rockets
he also theorized about space stations
until coffee did that that's taking that
research and putting it into an insane
military application and even though the
rocket scientists are working with
governments you know the rocket
scientists aren't dreaming about blowing
things up with their rockets they're
dreaming about doing weather observation
they're dreaming about learning about
the upper atmosphere they're dreaming
about photographing the earth to
discover things that we can't see up
close you know they want to be
scientists they want to explore and the
the prevailing notion is if you're going
to explore you need in place to explore
from so hand-in-hand with the early
theory of rockets is the theory of Space
Station's the theory of okay well if
I've got this rocket then I can lift a
station and then I can keep going back
and forth to that station and I can
observe things and you have to Laskowski
in 1903 who writes about a rotating
orbital station to produce artificial
gravity so that men can do astronomical
observations above the atmosphere you
have Herman nor doom in the 1920s with
his the problem space travel
who describes as well another rotating
station 30 meters in diameter and you
can see that the the outside it is
indeed a massive laboratory and the
thing that I find most charming is to
transition between sides you can
actually take the the spiral path in the
middle and there there's like a charming
brick stairway to get to the other side
so the working notion for rocketry
experts becomes if you're going to have
human exploration of space you're going
to need a space station in orbit it's
considered an essential and necessary
step for sustainable exploration of
space and there are recognized problems
with this there are recognized unknowns
and in the 1950s a series of rocket
scientists write or rocket scientists
write a series of articles and Colliers
the first article of which is man will
conquer space soon and it describes a
program by which the United States and
the free countries of Europe can build a
program to get into space in a
sustainable fashion and Verner von Braun
and Cornelius Ryan proposed a thing
called a baby space station so before
building a large space station we need
to understand certain things in
particular one of the huge unknowns
about space flight at this time is the
effect of weightlessness on mammalian
body will our will our hearts be able to
pump blood will our eyes fly out of our
heads you know nobody knows answers to
these because the only people who have
ever been weightless have been people in
plummeting elevators and they haven't
really been able to tell us about the
experience so to that end in this
article von Braun and and Ryan they
detailed this experimental satellite
it'll carry three rhesus monkeys one of
which is strapped down and has biometric
probes in its body and then the other
two are allowed to move around so that
we can study using television which is
relatively new at the time how the
rhesus monkeys adapt and we can see how
the strap-down monkey how its body
changes and it was to be a two month
mission and usually when I introduced
this if I introduced it to children
they'd ask well how do you get the
monkeys back and the answer is you don't
you burn them up when you're done
which is hard to tell the kids yeah yeah
so then they go on to propose an
observatory and this should look very
familiar from the early theorizing it's
meant to be this massive Space Station
with hundreds of people ferries going
back and forth in space space planes
coming up from the earth to deliver
scientific equipment to to bring
resupply so experts in both the Soviet
Union and the United States they expect
to build space stations in near Earth
orbit and then go on to explore the
solar system that lasts until 1957 so
the International Geophysical Year
happens in the United States declares
that it's going to launch the world's
first artificial satellite studied the
earth the Soviet Union
Sergey Korolev is ordered to to beat
them and he puts together Sputnik and I
believe less than six months and then
launches it so the Soviet Union puts
buttnik into space and this success puts
pressure on the USSR to claim more
firsts so it becomes a political need to
shape the space program to be first in
things and indeed they have very good
success in 1959 Luna 3 takes a
photograph of the far side of the moon
in 1961 Yuri Gagarin becomes the first
human being in space in 1965 Alexei
Lenin on does the first EBA the first
extra vehicular activity he goes outside
of a space vehicle in in 1966 Luna 9
succeeds in making the first transition
or transmission from the surface of the
Moon and in 1969 Soyuz 4 and 5 achieved
the first docking of tomb and crafts in
particular what I find very interesting
about Soyuz 4 and 5 is not only did they
decide to dock to space craft with
people inside of it they decided to go
ahead and switch crew at the same time
just for giggles
Sputnik puts pressure on the u.s. to
catch up with the Soviet Union so in
1961 Alan Shepard becomes the first
human being in space he rides the
freedom 7 and a ballistic arc goes into
space and then comes right back down a
mere three weeks later John F Kennedy
addresses the United States Congress any
says that by the end of this decade we
will land a man on the moon and return
him safely and and in his proposal at no
point does he mention a space station so
he has committed the United States to a
political aim of beating the Soviet
Union and in doing so has has defied the
common notion of what is necessary for
long duration sustainable spaceflight so
this influences how the Americans start
to plan out their lift vehicles how they
start to plan out their program of
research to make the Apollo project
happen and all Space Station research is
stopped because the the new aim is
merely to get to the moon in 1965 the
first American EBA happens this is Edie
white he bounces around at the end of
his tether just like Alexei later Nam
did nobody can do effective evie a work
yet so there's no construction in space
Gemini 6 and 7 in 1965 achieved the
first rendezvous Germany can't dock so
there's no docking and transfer so they
station keeps they merely just sit next
to one another but rod it was a very
hard problem because space is weird
orbits are weird
in 1966 Gemini 8 achieves the first
docking this docking is done with the
Agena target docking vehicle which is
basically a big dumb radio transmitter
that's made out of the lift vehicle that
brought the Gemini up in 1966 the first
effective EBA has done so Buzz Aldrin
crawls around on the outside of his
gemonese spacecraft and he fiddles with
some he fiddles with some construction
work construction work Buzz Aldrin also
has the distinguishing Buzz Aldrin's
also distinguished by being the second
man on the moon but he does have a very
interesting first in addition to the EBA
he took the first space selfie
so Apollo 8 in 1968 is the first manned
lunar orbit so in the Soviet Union the
Soviet Union realizes that the United
States is actually serious about
abandoning sustainable spaceflight
they're not going to build a space
station that may realize that
politically they have to catch up they
also need to achieve a lunar landing
ideally before the United States but
they're behind and they look at Apollo 8
say oh this is going to blow up because
the Apollo 8 looked pretty dangerous it
was only the third flight of the Saturn
5 only the third one usually Rockets
blow up a lot while you're developing
them but Apollo 8 didn't fail and and so
this combined with the unplanned
decomposition of the Soviet n1 rockets
really put a damper on the soviet lunar
project and it would eventually be
canceled and and much of the technology
will show up later because they had
gotten quite far in it and then in 1969
humanity reaches the moon Neil Armstrong
and Buzz Aldrin both stepped out they
left some scientific equipment they got
back in and they flew back home so the
success of project Apollo really Spurs
the Soviet Union and the United States
to switch gears so the Soviets focused
on expanding expertise in space
operations they start to focus on that
sustainable path to a future in the
solar system and the u.s. focuses on
opening up space so so NASA coming off
of project Apollo is really enthusiastic
about laying the groundwork for a Mars
mission and and this for them means
solving the lift problem of developing a
cheap to operate space vehicle to to
build a station in orbit and then after
they build the station to then prove out
all the techniques that you need to get
to Mars having a cheap to operate lift
vehicle also dovetails nicely with
NASA's increasing budget problems as the
success of the Apollo project really
kept slashing NASA's budget because we
wanted to in the United States pay for
the Vietnam War instead so in 1971
Soviet Union launches Salyut one Salyut
one is the world's first space station
and it's very difficult to see in this
photograph so there's a diagram of it on
the left-hand side you'll see the Soyuz
spacecraft which is the ferry for the
cosmonauts it's it's a little more than
a pressure chamber and then some seats
and the descent module and then there's
a larger module which is the round bit
at the front which has the docking
adaptor and has more moveable space the
salient one is based on the the Alma's
which is the Soviet Union military
reconnaissance station so the notion was
that you would launch the station you
have people inside take photographs the
United States actually tried to develop
these things too is called demand
orbiting laboratory which is a it's not
a good name because it was not a
laboratory was meant for spying purposes
but because of the development of
automated spy satellites the United
States never develops that to help prove
out the concept of military
reconnaissance station the Salyut one
the civilian craft was launched instead
and the salient one was really an
experiment so the crew were meant to
prove out station systems to to prove
that you know the the water reclaimer
work to prove that the oxygen generator
work and study their own adaptation to
space so at this point you know the
Apollo project had had generated the the
longest duration spaceflights but those
flights were relatively short so the
biomedical component of Salyut one was
particularly pioneering the the Soyuz
crew you know man Salyut 1 for 23 days
until fire broke out and causing them to
abandon the vehicle
so because the Salyut one was expendable
you know it could not be refueled it
could not have repairs done to it
there's no point in staying inside of it
if it might catch fire again and besides
they'd already been there for 23 days
and they'd already collected science to
to demonstrate that they had to fall
into pieces so they were going to land
unfortunately the the crew died on the
way down
a valve meant to equalize pressure lower
to the earth opened up in high
atmosphere and they were exposed to
vacuum because at that time due to
overconfidence I think in the
effectiveness of the soil uses of
vehicle they didn't wear pressure suits
so they were just in a short-sleeve
environment so as we go through these
space stations I kind of want to have
like an inside baseball view of the
station the the most important one I
think is the operational lifetime how
long did the space station exist how
long were we able to maintain this this
machine in space and the Salyut one had
an operational lifetime of 23 days it
was expendable it once you ran out of
consumables that was it you were out of
oxygen so in 1973 NASA as a part of the
Apollo applications program launches
Skylab so after the Apollo project ended
NASA has a lot of hardware left over and
Skylab was one was the winning proposal
what to do with that hardware the Skylab
itself is a repurposed second stage of a
Saturn v vehicle in the place of liquid
hydrogen you have the orbital workshop
so inside of a fuel tank they built a
science laboratory and then the oxygen
tank in the Saturn five second stage was
for dumping garbage in the top they've
added a docking adaptor for the command
module and then there's the Apollo
telescope for studying the Sun
unfortunately the launch of Skylab was a
little off nominal so Skylab is supposed
to look like this it's supposed to have
two solar arrays on either side two arms
that come out it's supposed to have a
micro meteor sealed that sort of pops up
off the top of the orbital workshop and
provides impact deflection and at the
same time provides passive cooling for
the orbital workshop itself heat is a
really difficult problem in space
because there's nothing to wick at all
so you have to explicitly radiate it or
continually be in shadow and then heat
yourself unfortunately during launch the
micro meteor shield popped up
prematurely in the atmosphere and was
ripped off and when it was ripped off
that happened to take one of the solar
array arms with it and at the same time
to to add insult to injury it pinned
down the other one with metal garbage so
the the rather than abandoned the Skylab
because it was very expensive and they
believed that they could repair it the
the first Skylab mission was sent up to
cut off that metal strap and then
Charles Conrad strapped himself to the
outside of the Skylab where there were
no EBA handles and then he lassoed the
end of the solar arm and then pulled it
up just yanked it up and then because
they need a shield from the Sun what
they did is they got a bunch of tent
material and they attached it to
expanding arms and they poked that tent
material through one of the scientific
airlocks
out over telescoping out over the
workshop so you get this curious little
tent
thing that pokes out of the Skylab this
is a hugely impressive ad-hoc repair
mission you know otherwise this this
multi-billion dollar space station would
have been left to rot it would have just
simply burned up and once repaired the
Skylab was a very effective laboratory
so this is scientist astronaut Garrett
at the Apollo telescope scope mount so
before Skylab humanity had never been
able to look at the Sun in a scientific
fashion not mediated by the atmosphere
but with Skylab we were able for the
first time to study the Sun to start to
understand the sun's processes to
capture solar corona emissions in real
time the Apollo or the Skylab also did
earth observation so to figure out how
crops were growing to try and find
faults that we didn't realize existed
and and this is Chicago
I think Chicago looks really nice both
up-close and from space
Skylab also grew crystals so one hope
for manufacturing in space is the
production of crystals for industrial
purposes that have a very pure structure
because in microgravity crystals we have
found out through experimentation grow
in a much different way than they do
closer to the earth biomedical
experiments on spiders were done as kind
of a get children interested in space
again this particular spider is named
Arabella and it took her three weeks to
learn how to weave her webs and the
astronauts kind of gripe that the
spiders were more popular than they were
the main thing that we learned through
Skylab is what happens to the human body
during long-duration spaceflight so the
astronauts were themselves guinea pigs
this is Alan bean and he's only a gamma
tur which is basically a space bicycle
and he's doing the metabolic activity
experiment so what NASA doctors are
trying to learn is as we're in
microgravity environments does our
ability to digest change how are we able
to arrest bone loss because it would be
a real shame if we in in a big hurry
launched off to Mars and then found that
we starved to death halfway there
because we weren't able to effectively
adjust the diet
for needs and in a microgravity
environment and and Skylab made a huge
advance over the Salyut it was much
larger it was also not resupply belit
was also not extendable it was
monolithic but it was larger because it
was built out of a rocket body so it
made it to 171 days and then as we go
through because it's kind of hard to
keep numbers in mind I kind of want to
compare graphically as well so you can
see how much further Skylab was able to
go unfortunately Skylab was a one-off
there was no repeating Skylab in
December 1974 Salyut 4 was launched and
I've skipped from Salyut 1 to sell you
for because Salyut 2 &amp;amp; 3 were the
military barrett variant of the Salyut
body they were actually called Alma's
but the Soviet Union being very
secretive would launch these things than
just call them extra so use or Salyut
excuse me it was easy to tell that they
weren't civilian vehicles because they
use military military transmission
frequencies but I don't know much about
them because there's still kind of
secretive so we're just going to skip
them so whenever we skip numbers they're
just military stuff in between there so
Salyut 4 is meant to prove out the
designs long-term durability is it
possible for us to sustain these
machines in space and to Soyuz missions
Soyuz 17 and 18 perform solar and
biological experiments you know how do
our bodies adapt what does the Sun look
like but so Soyuz 18 in particular did
much to advance Soviet microgravity
medical knowledge through
experimentation of devices on the
cosmonauts one was called the penguin
suit so one problem with being in space
is that our muscles atrophy because
we're not using them so the penguin suit
goes around the bottom of your foot and
it provides continued active resistance
to your feet because it's basically a
spring and it makes you look a little
bit like a penguin the other one is the
cheapest suit this is basically the
opposite of a G suit so instead of
pushing fluids away from your legs
it pushes fluids toward your legs
because in microgravity it turns out the
fluids pool in our upper torso and head
and the chiba suit is meant to suck all
of that back down to help you readjust
to living in 1g and by the end of Soyuz
18 a rich green
mold was growing throughout the station
because the environmental system broke
down it wasn't repairable and it was
clear that the stations were going to
have to be repairable if they were going
to be suitable for long-term habitation
because every crew that comes up brings
funguses they bring bacteria they bring
microbes and you need equipment to
filter that out you need cleaning
equipment and that all has to be
replaced and repaired
apparently the Soyuz 18 crew was very
relieved to have their mission
terminated early and the Soyuz 4 as
befits a long term mission was a
significant advancement over Salyut 1
and made it to a full 92 days oh I keep
skipping over that and you can kind of
see that visually but it is a
significant advancement in the Soviet
program Salyut 6 was launched in
September of 1977 and Salyut 6 is a
revolution because it can be resupplied
so all the stations before were what
what are called monolithic they're not
resupply and it achieves this by having
an extra little feature so this is the
Salyut here in the middle this is the
station this is the Soyuz which is the
ferry vehicle and then on the end you
have the progress the progress is a
Soyuz variant that has all of the
environmental systems stripped out and
its cargo instead and what it's doing is
its docking with a new aft port on the
back of the Soviet or in the Salyut so
that the cosmonauts can unload this
thing the the progress and the Salyut
also have the interesting capability of
using pipes built into the the docking
built into the docking clamps to channel
fuel and oxygen into tanks that exist on
the station so the station can be
continually replenished while major
systems last the only limitation here is
that the progress is kind of small so if
you have a particularly large system
that needs to be replaced to say a solar
panel you don't have much capability to
do that so resupply dramatically
increases the lifetime of the station
and and increased lifetime decreases
total cost so you can get more science
out of a thing that's already in orbit
than having to continually relaunch
something every 40 days increased life
times also teach the Soviet program how
to coordinate and train
for ad-hoc repairs so if you have this
thing that is important you have to
learn culturally how to care for it you
can't just abandon it because there was
a small fire you have to deal with that
fire and and on the Salyut 6 the Orlan
is first tested the Orlan is from the
cancelled lunar project it was meant to
be the the lunar excursion suit but the
soviets realized that if they're going
to have these long-duration spaceflights
in terms of space stations they have to
be able to get out and crawl around and
the Orlan was tested in 1977 the last
soviet spacewalk had been in 1969
there's been an entire class of
cosmonauts that have never done a
spacewalk and the Salyut 6 lasted for
683 days so it really really was a
revolution even over Skylab which was
much much larger the ability to resupply
is a significant advancement in in this
particular technology at the inn in
April of 1981 STS 1 is launched so the
Americans have been trying to solve the
lift problem and this is the first
flight of the space shuttle while the
Soviets have been building these
monolithic stations and launching them
the US has been building a pickup truck
to the Stars and and NASA promises
because they've entered their hard
boondoggle era that the Space Shuttle
will be able to launch
you know once a month and they'll
they'll be able to resurface satellites
and this is a cutaway of the Space
Shuttle the Space Shuttle with a hugely
complicated machine but what I really
want to point out is is just how much
the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle
dominates the vehicle is a vehicle
that's designed to to move things and
the ambition for the shuttle in in what
NASA you know went hat in hand to
Congress to get funding for the ambition
for the shuttle is to cheaply launch and
service sensitive satellites so the
shuttle actually flew quite a number of
Department of Defense missions as well
as do microgravity research so here for
instance is a photo of a shuttle mission
where the shuttle captured
satellites that were already in orbit
that simply needed refurbishing to to be
effective satellites and then to be
relaunched refueling things like that
and there's a shuttle in its early days
did a number of missions like this
coincidentally the shuttle is ideally
suited to assembling and servicing
large-scale space stations so NASA still
has its eye on the prize it still wants
to get to Mars it doesn't know when and
it doesn't really care how but it knows
that it needs this capability
unfortunately the shuttle is limited to
two-week missions which denies NASA
operational experience in long-duration
spaceflight so because shuttle mission
missions are so short every minute is is
time lined out you do these things and
because the missions are so short if
there's a mechanical problem that occurs
you just abandon the mission and you fly
back home
so NASA becomes this organization that
becomes incapable of having lack
schedules of having downtime of having
just goals for a day and letting your
astronauts work through those goals
April 1982 Salyut 7 is launched so
Salyut 7 was nearly identical Salyut 6
Salyut 7 was intended to be the backup
for 6 but with Mir launch continually
being delayed they did not want to lose
their edge they wanted to keep having a
station in orbit so they went ahead and
launched the backup and they reinforced
certain segments of the station to give
better experience in modular
construction for the mirror and Salyut 7
or an account of growing confidence is a
lot more crowded than salya 6 both with
more expensive scientific equipment and
both in terms of people so the solutes
would have a nominal crew of 3 and then
you could have guest cosmonauts and
because of the way the environmental
system was designed if you had guest
cosmonauts you had to burn what people
referred to as an oxygen candle which is
a device where when you heat it up it
consumes the the consumable in it
produces oxygen as it burns so they
would have to put these things in and
they would have to have extra carbon
scrubbers because the station is really
not designed for this so a series of
breakdowns actually makes Salyut 7 much
more interesting in the history of space
construct
so on September 9th 1983 a pipe and
salya's unpressurized engine bay
fractured so if you'll recall Salyut 6
was able to accept resupply Salyut 7 had
that same capability because it was
identical but one of the pipes broke and
because Salyut 6 7 was was still
relatively young it was decided to try
and repair it
so in april 23 1984 cosmonauts kidman
and solo you begin a series of 5e VA s
to repair the leak so to repair this
leak which was called a coffin problem
in in the planning material it was felt
that this was not a repairable thing
what they have to do is they have to
open up an outer bulkhead during an e ba
and then have to go cutting through
pipes they have to replace a bunch of
valves and all of this work is
non-trivial on the earth and and they're
doing this in space where your tools
float off where you have sausage fingers
because your gloves are relatively
massive so it's a very difficult job and
you can see that you know April 23rd 26
29th May 3rd August 8th that takes them
a long time to achieve this aim and it's
also worth noting that the Orleans suit
limited them each one of these e VA s is
less than six hours and the reason it's
less than 6 hours is because at the 6
hour mark you run out of primary
life-support inside of your suit and you
don't want to run out of primary
life-support so when on february 11 1985
power was lost aboard the Salyut 7 and
it began to free drift
so the ambition for the soviet program
was to have continuous occupation but
because of logistics problems because of
delays they didn't quite meet that that
ambition in the Salyut 7 and so the
leaving crew mothballed it and put it
into a low-power state to be picked up
by the next crew unfortunately because
it free drifted it had to be decided do
we fix this or not and the Soviet Union
have cited yes we will fix this and so
you t 13 was dispatched to repair the
station now the Soyuz the the Soviet
program is invested in a lot of
automation and the Soyuz is meant to
automatically dock with its space
station but the station is dead so they
have to use latest laser rangefinders to
to guess intercept direct trajectories
to dock with the stead station that is
tumbling in space they managed to do it
but when they get inside the temperature
is negative 10 degrees Celsius all the
water pipes have frozen you know huge
huge mess in sizes so the cosmonauts had
to wear fur hats fur coats fur boots and
when they would get too cold they would
have to go back into the Soyuz and warm
up and that's where they would have to
sleep but eventually they got they found
out what the problem was
there was a switching mechanism that
would switch to the batteries that
needed to be charged as the the solar
panels fill up a battery it would then
switch over the switching mechanism
failed and ironically the Salyut 7 died
because it drained its batteries turning
its solar panels to charge its batteries
that it wasn't able to keep charging if
this if the station had had continuous
occupation this would not have happened
because a cosmonaut would have noticed
there would have been a little alarm
going off and it would have been a very
short operation to to replace this thing
so this really underscores that space
stations have to be continuously
occupied because in space any minor
issue that's left untreated becomes a
major crisis because space is a very
harsh place but once repaired the Salyut
7 hosted an other three missions as well
as a flight from mir to Salyut 7 and
then back again which is the only time
humanity has ever flown from one station
to space station to another and then
back again and what they were doing was
they were taking expensive scientific
equipment out of Salyut 7 to use on Mir
previously all of that expensive
scientific equipment would burn up in
the atmosphere when the station
deorbited and Salyut 7 of being
basically identical to Salyut 6 operated
for 816 days so roughly the same as
Salyut 6 it was not an advancement to
the art but it was an advancement in the
state of the art of logistics in in
repairing craft in orbit in February
1986 the MIR base block is launched and
Mir is the first modular space station
and it's intended to be continuously
occupied so they've learned the lessons
from Salyut 7 and and Mir is basically a
Salyut with a docking knob or node
instead of just a mere front docking
port in March 1987 Caban 1 is launched
and Cavanaugh's 2 working compartments
in an unpressurized experiment
compartment and it goes in the aft
docking port and you can kind of see it
off to the the right on the up to the
top the stretcher the thing with the
solar panels on the outside is the Soyuz
so that's the the ferry crowded in
November 1989 Caban 2 which provides an
e VA for airlocks that provides a cargo
bay which can also be used as a backup
for it for EVs and it provides another
experiment compartment in 1990 in May
crystal which is a furnace compartment
for growing crystals an astronomical
observation compartment and most
importantly a docking module for bran
bran was the Soviet Union's space
shuttle variant which did fly once in
automated control unfortunately for me
or on December 25th 1991 the Soviet
Union completely collapsed so there was
no money for anything anymore all of the
the plans for launch had to be scrubbed
in June 1992 Presidents Bush and Yeltsin
agreed to cooperation of spaceflight
so Yeltsin agrees to fly cosmonauts in
the space shuttle and Bush agrees to fly
astronauts to Mir in partially
constructed as it is in September 1993
the Clinton administration has has come
into power and the u.s. vice president
and the Russian Prime Minister not only
do they keep Bush's proposal or planned
but they add to it by agreeing to
jointly build a space station in orbit
so this the the United States since the
Reagan administration has been wanting
to build what's called the Space Station
freedom a bit on the nose Reagan but
what they agree to instead is to have
international cooperation in in
constructing and maintaining an orbital
facility and it's to be the
International Space Station the
construction of the ISS will occur in
three phases phase one is the
shuttle-mir project so the shuttle will
help complete the mirror
and ferry equipment back and forth the
mirror replacement supplies scientific
equipment phase 2 is the construction of
the International Space Station itself
and phase 3 which is the phase we're
living in right now is the operation of
the International Space Station phase 1
is vitally important for both partners
the Russian space station program or the
Russian space program is running out of
money you know with the collapse of the
Soviet Union now it has to exist in a
market economy where a market economy
did not previously exist and the United
the u.s. space program has not had
long-duration space flights since Skylab
for in 1974 so it's completely lost the
organizational capability of dealing
with something like that
so I may in 1995 spectres launched
Spectre is to be the place where US
astronauts live and where they do their
experiments most notably Spectre has
four solar arrays so it provides 1/2 of
the power of the MIR space station in
May night or in November of 1995 a
docking module which is an adaptor for
the space shuttle previously if the
shuttle was to to dock the Christelle
module would have to be moved because
the space shuttle would bump into solar
panels and destroy them and then in
April of 1996 priority has launched
which hosts earth resources experiments
and it's to help prove out techniques to
be used on the International Space
Station so Mir you know it's an
significant advancement over the
state-of-the-art in that Salyut 7 was a
one-shot deal once you were done with it
you know you could not extend onto it me
or however theoretically can continually
be operated continually replaced it's a
modular Space Station and it's hugely
complex for the time unfortunately by
the time of the shuttle Mir several of
Mears modules were nearing the end of
their life times the the collapse of the
Soviet Union had put a real damper on
the project timeline covant one was
described as dank by more than one
astronaut the environmental system down
there failed pretty badly so is mostly
used to collect trash balls of water
formed regularly behind wall panels and
had to be mopped up those balls of water
would then
breed fungus and mold but even despite
those problems even despite those
problems Mir was a very human place and
had well advanced the state-of-the-art
you know significant amounts of science
were done both on the cosmonauts and the
astronauts and in Earth Observation in
solar observation in observation of
comments famously though Mir suffered
too near catastrophic system accidents
during the shuttle Mir project the first
occurred in January 1974 1997 one of
those oxygen candle candles that I
talked about earlier instead of
gradually burning and producing oxygen
produced a blowtorch instead and
severely burned the module that it was
in and and polluted the station's
atmosphere and it took nine minutes to
put that fire out the worst one occurred
in June of 1997 when an experimental
docking technique was attempted with a
progress craft one of these multi-ton
vessels and it slammed into the spektr
module significantly damaging the solar
panel but even worse puncturing the
Spector's hole so the station started to
leak atmosphere so they had to abandon
the specter the trouble with this is
that the specter produced one half of
the station's power so they had to
figure out a way to reroute power and
that was a significant repair effort and
and because of these problems and
because of the upcoming International
Space Station the MIR was finally
abandoned after five four thousand nine
592 days which is a significant
advancement over any of the previous
space stations in November of 1998 the
International Space Station base block
is launched and and the base block base
block called Zarya is mears base block
so at the core of the International
Space Station after the after the the
close of the Cold War the core of the
International Space Station is Mir the
second module connected to the
International Space Station in 1998 is
unity unity is a connecting module it
just has docking birds veda comes in
2000 and it provides station life
support and houses two crew Spada is a
Salyut space station so the core of the
International
a station Izmir and Salyer in in 2000
the z1 trust comes and and this is a
place to connect up equipment in 2000
again you get the p6 truss and the solar
arrays so the space station draws a huge
amount of power and to give you a sense
of scale of the space station these are
two astronauts doing an e VA tour to
finish the installation of one of the
trusses and their diminutive next to the
space station in 2001 destiny is
launched destiny is the first u.s.
laboratory in space since Skylab and
this is the inside of Destiny when it
was unpacked when it was just installed
in 2001 and this is the inside of
Destiny five years later with all of its
equipment unpacked Canada arm comes in
2001 Canada arm is an update of the
shuttles arm so it's a crane for
manipulating things and the cool thing
about Canada arm is that it can crawl
around the outside of the space station
it can move itself by inch warming along
Canada arm can be used to help move
astronauts to hard-to-reach places it
can also grab what's called Dexter and
and Dexter is a dexterous manipulating
tool for repairing components or moving
components around and and you know I
don't want to go we don't have time to
go through all of the modules of the
space station but I just kind of want to
go through its construction to give you
a sense of what an immense effort it was
to produce this thing you know the
European Space Agency the Russian
Federation NASA the Japanese Space
Agency made this gigantic orbital lab
and you know it's not even not even
finished yet all these pink modules have
yet to launch the ISS is absolutely
massive the cranes effectors and crew
transport set it apart as being uniquely
adaptable and it's a human object that's
meant to be tinkered with it is meant to
fundamentally advance humanity's
knowledge of living and working in space
over the long term and and you can see
that the initial concepts of what a
Space Station should be a rotating
device that had hundreds of people on it
turned out not to be true in practice
and one of the things that I'm most
interested in in
one of the experiments that are most
interested in and the space station is
the beam which stands for the Bigelow
expandable Activity module so two
problems with building in space are the
lift weight of a thing and the lift size
of a thing and the beam is meant to
prove out the concept of launching
something that has a fixed weight but is
able to expand its size and this was
actually launched this year in April
2016 and the ISS is a significant
advancement over the state of the art in
Mir it really learned from Mears problem
and it's been operating for five
thousand eight hundred twenty three plus
days and what really strikes me is 385
plus people have been aboard the
International Space Station and it's
still going and it's meant to continue
to go into the 2020s unfortunately for a
thing that's called the International
Space Station the US Congress actually
has excluded people from participating
in the project people countries one such
countries China so the King Kong one
launches in 2011 and it's meant to help
China prove out space station technology
so that it can build its own large Space
Station and it's a little more than a
value like an early salyers it's not
refuel able it's not expandable and they
do buy but biomedical experiments on
themselves and they have a limited
lifetime 26 days it's said to be 30 days
in total tiangong 2 went up in September
of 2016 and they're still up there if
you look at Chinese TV they will
broadcast segments of what the
astronauts are doing they ride up and
basically a Soyuz they dock like a Soyuz
and they live as if they were living in
a Sal you and that's 15 plus days and so
the timeline of these space stations
there's there's quite a bit of overlap
as as the the nation states sort of
learn how to build them and how to keep
them going and the question I get asked
when I talk about safe space stations is
why you know why not have a lunar base
why not just go straight to Mars like we
did with the moon and the answers are
space stations are a safe environment to
do long-term biomedical research you're
never more than a few hours away from
being home if something goes drastically
wrong
Space Station's are a safe environment
to do to learn logistics of
long-duration spaceflight so say your
oxygen generator dies and then your
backup dies well then you just launch
another one up you can't do that if
you're on the way to Mars it's more
expensive to do that if you're on the
surface of the Moon Space Station's give
us a platform to study the psychology of
high-pressure isolation so being in a
small crew in a tin can for months at a
time what does that do to a mind the
United States learned in the shuttle-mir
project that several of its shuttle
astronauts were not suitable for Space
Station work Space Station's influence
lift vehicles so they they they provide
a a broad context for problem solving so
when you start to imagine what should I
build you have this notion of long
sustainable habitability in space when
you're designing vehicles and underlying
this there's a broader answer and that
answer is because Mars is there you know
since the start of the 20th century when
people first realized that we could
escape the Earth's gravity well we've
wanted to go to Mars and and to my mind
to reach Mars will require the work of
our better natures you know the work of
nations in cooperation not not an
opposition in war you know President
Kennedy when he was talking about the
moon project you know when he said that
we would go to the moon he said that you
know New Hope's for knowledge and peace
are there and I fully believe that if we
actually do all the work if we learn how
to harness complex technical political
systems to reach Mars then we will have
found new knowledge and peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
