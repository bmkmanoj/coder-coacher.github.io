cancel the monitor okay sunshine members
in the audience tonight okay I'm
basically program to haverford a her
like a hobby mmm Cynthia life d'ivoire
work but a well known in the airline
community center we almost want the bed
Francesca up Jay yesterday well that you
threatened to kill me from New York so
that is all we're going to talk about
bits in taxes I brought up a partner
forbid syntax for java don't get up in a
few weeks but i was playing with i'm
actually a chief scientist in a small
pretty startled push technology but
let's forget about work for a while
before job happens let's focus on our
life me today and i decided to take two
offers a marvelous hacking physical
Harper making things the other is
paradigm which is by thinking like it's
gotta do all my research &amp;amp; Co top again
see what can happen so in the harbor
world will make things like this on the
left here we have a drill broke have two
12-volt car horns what happens when you
put that together it's a non-lethal
human defense system more than 20
decibels of a trigger-happy noisy
components on there but they put your
door and invited kids over it's great
for football matches on the void is that
photo cube is actually joystiq designed
by my children most of the hardware ID
is designed for my children under get me
to build things they design pieces of
papers of the health of the cube debate
asteroids but keep the book it into the
monitor and it is joyce's it comes an
asteroids game it had to be furry that
was a strict requirement
tyro other good things like this you're
more of the things I like a better life
start from the low level any products
and filled with olive oil rather than
buying a zigbee I build my own or death
protocols because up into distributed
systems protocols that's the area that
interests me mainly though I'm dating
this Hardware bugs page as i plug in the
power of the wrong way it blows up I
have to make more orders my wife gave
some happy but I decided what any action
take two things I like to do one quote
them together never done anything in her
this was yesterday I hadn't done that
this is what I've done that's nice
you're seeing it today that should be
awesome so I have to have one of these
these are pretty awesome good travels
quite extensive Asian Punk's vest you
can wear off what a few well Fabolous
this is a like there's a million power
battery back tons of a Wi-Fi access
point keep apartment are going to do or
a flash drive and expose it so that you
can share files with people so it's a
lifesaver you can plug in your phone you
can put in your laptop your iPad to get
an extra bit of power and it'll ask four
or five phone chargers I'm using today
is kind of like Stein answer it's gonna
be the network that the robot is
attached to another robot you can see
here is a little wireless dongle and
this is a repeater so this is actually
connecting to the access point which is
this and it is getting a fee that I can
connect to my laptop is also connected
you need a piece of hardware to hack
this is a robust a in the bottle in the
car boot sale last weekend for separate
you typically get them for
100 second hand and I chapped its brain
so I put a wire inside the infrared
receiver use it with a remote control
and so i hacked into that cycle control
of with a raspberry pi so we're going to
be simulating remote control commands
this infrared from early which is what
happens when employers that stuff
together okay so amazingly so get the
full functionality of this robot you
basically just need one or like 11 it's
a pretty simple hug and this one or a
question is an if normal sapiens tell
you can tell it in salute very simple
it's got some type of wiring time and
then there's a hard I know API top of
that so they don't actually have to try
to be in device that tells us what to do
and you can just have a high level
convenient function but will call them
into that telephone chance of this a
viewer hundred functions you can call it
to the robot to perform so you could
wrap this in their language EP in the
web servers in whatever you want what
simple connected up your twitter feed
whenever you receive a choice roar
remember someone said something nasty
about you make the loop set let's see
what I mean image okay so that's as a
buffet
I have a VNC server running on the robot
so why ya bein seed into the robot go
turtle okay might be can you see the
next sort of the nut terminal screen so
this is my terminal shell session on the
robe off and I've got an airline project
there which as you can see is fairly
recent I'm going to spawn an Arlington
okay in order to start with the robot so
there's a startup sequence kind of a
performative own card it's not exactly
or not be working because it's a hack
it's not supposed to work the way I'm
using it so you take the black wire pull
the wire apart let's grant you turn the
robot on what does its thing then you
connect the black wire everything's fine
i'm avery about the punch in its brain
there so we can tell the robot lot to do
so i'm going to load its sapiens module
here we go wasn't very exciting it's
very exciting and then the fun begins
won't give up to sit on it I would like
to see wait until it
whistling whistling giggling
differential that's right so our the
phone for all of the family so the
reason I've been things like this is
mainly because I built in for my
children this using of the neuron is
fairly new but it actually makes it
quite easy to build and interest a
little toys and my kids so that's it for
me will the short talk
whoo
cobian get home soon hopefully we'll
start barababa sapiens and we've got
this one before mon cala designer five
questions yes now if you control the
each morning on its own at all jessica
if you remove the brain there are nine
motors in there you control individually
so you can for example filter body you
can move the arms and hands individually
you can move the feet is this a place we
can walk forward or back so you actually
stay was a great I might take the brain
that necks and use the raspberry pi is a
new range so i might do that next I
don't know if the kids have Antonio
probably want to do so Hollywood huge
first that they'll probably have
something of that station at home what's
the door and reverse Anjali so the
hacker is well known or didn't have to
do by the reverse engineering I don't
think I need installment of the rapid
body it was fairly simple for 240 dir
command protocol over two over the last
35 that was just a matter of branding
and international exposure to sender
burn my modules which had most of the
rough mountain functions that are
betting functions there
comment twitter- they are moving the
legs walking forward or backwards and
various special sequences like karate
chops fighting sequences roaring
whistling stuff like that it's very it's
already controllable results of these
buttons plug sensors so on the bumps
into something you can get a signal from
that as well so there are other aspects
of the robot you can actually hack into
going into the speaker to speaker on
texture as well which is somewhere on
attitudes are you smart with your kids
yeah I didn't mean expose them to a
visual programming language called
scratch so scratch stage plug-and-play
visual mountains together rather than
properly align in fact my 7 year olds
learning fighting because the very
strict language of record language for
kids to learn and it's very good reading
material on how to teach kids policing
program from San Nero is multiplied them
whether two of my other kids are
learning a scratch so every kid is
different maybe will be a hairline
program will say oppression questions
awesome thank you very much
and to start I want to give a little
background I personally laughs matter as
a hypervisor and basically the whole
thing start off when I I had one server
the internet of the whole of one server
and then share me with two other people
and what's to virtualize so as we reach
a decision was which kind of
virtualization to use VMware has a sucky
limitation on memory and then hit some
horrible things with user management
linux and kvm I just wasn't comfortable
with that and I stumbled about smartness
and so I said some get some great great
features I reread some since it's not
very valuable that once our zones which
is a solaris virtualization method which
pretty much is a bare metal
virtualization so it doesn't spawn a
kernel but you have a whole virtualized
set of applications in your zone and
there's d trade which is a great tool
for observability and taking a look into
your application measuring getting some
idea of what is going on their stead of
s which is in my opinion the prawns best
pal system you can get at the moment and
there's crossbow which is a very very
cool wave of network virtualization
within one operating system so you can
make bridges little switches on there
and then you can go and make flows was
like saying okay we have ten percent
tickets lost on this connection and you
can really go nuts on that and add staff
and test and play around and then as kvm
which is voluminous people already know
this for years but in as an heiress
environment this is really something
you're great because you don't only have
this zones are very powerful if you can
run your applique
in solaris at all just 5km so full
virtualization and can pretty much run
everything there the big part there are
something smart as it doesn't do very
well and it is a single euro system so
you have the root user and the root ah
so that's it and you have to share this
with your other people running stuff on
there to create the MS to modify the
nstar in stopping which is just doesn't
feel right getting multiple people would
access the one I think everyone can sit
beside of that and you only connect one
in system so okay in my case it's not a
big deal I can run everything on my one
system but by now I have free system so
I thought you would want web central
management there's nothing like this as
matters and you really need to expose
success to this global zone to the
hypervisor to the internet that is also
not a very nice thing to have so there
are some great things and I really want
this green box I really want everything
in there because it's for hypervisor in
my opinion best you can get right now
but I'm very upset about the things in
the red box because honestly all of them
are not very nice yes one solution
called Smart Data Center from join the
people make this madness but this again
costs money and since i'm doing the
server or did the server on a purely for
fun basis i can't pay I don't know what
the prices are probably kind of thousand
dollars i would have to pay per year to
get the server running and that's not an
option for you so it's pretty sad yes
please can you explain that
reasons for those limitations this way
the system is built and giant releases
smart way is as a basic version of their
hypervisor and it is a single system
solution so the default solution is to
have one route cues are there which can
do staff and they're there is no
communication between systems of you
have two of them you will have to access
the global zone to create EMS workers
virtual machines and so that's pretty
much too it's not it doesn't have to be
a mutation and will come to this limited
but from the bare metals matter system
this is what your status it's a solaris
oh that's right it's a solaris is that
is Godzilla back there is a very
self-focused operating system so it's
not a general-purpose your estimate is
it doesn't have it on just partition it
boot from USB stick there's no n
consistent storage of data on it so all
these things go to keep users at our way
on the next book and so on ok so
basically that's very sad and this
worked I was looking like when I comes
out as it and I found out I can do what
I want with it but there's one thing if
there's something you want and there's
no solution if you didn't know what he
wanted you always have to do it yourself
so I sat down and figured okay I want
this and I really wanted they weren't
really bad and I started building
something the first iteration was based
on closure script in the nucleus and
sucked a lot and the second iteration
was the Sunderland and got a lot better
and the certain duration
clustering in there and the fourth
iteration we run all that as a little
hot go to go to where it is right now
and basically is f up if you want
something to it so what we have now we
have a central user management we have a
ssh key management which means you can
from the interface refuse access to
virtual machines and they are also keys
and the moment a thick layer of access
to the machine you have a very fine
grant permission controls for your users
so you can give them access to start
viens but not stop them it's like
someone who's doing operations work
maintenance want to be able to stop
machines afresh but don't want them to
stop the customer cheese and you can
really find rate in this because it's
this nice structure you have a system of
roads or groups are they on to call us
so delegation of permissions to multiple
users and for the virtual machines you
can do all the stuff you can create and
you can edit them you can destroy you
can start stop there in a web UI you
have a no VNC server which is like a rep
console you can go into graphical
interface for kvm machines and your
console for the large machines which
basically gives you access to see the
console of this we have an ssh key
management with access features of zones
you can do snapshots of machines so roll
them back and force you get some metrics
for your virtual machines or from the
user interface and you're the smart a
prison to pick the best hypervisor if
you have multiple ones you can set up
roles which look for certain
characteristics and you can raise them
by points and then go in the end we pick
the best one so customers algorithm
because I guess people have different
preferences once it will get one
everything on the 15 and then on the
next event
next press ok half govans is and half
goes in here and give some metrics for
the hypervisors which like show you the
cpu usage on the hypervisor level and
you get warning spent years starch push
degrade your brake failure there's a big
item I tonight school from real control
a copy that is on your open source
license I you can ask and the degree
icons will you go on to start patient to
see everything is fine oh no I should do
something there's a lot of cool stuff
like a distributed details you can
around each transcript over multiple
physical hosts collect the data
aggregates and just pay them and you
have a virtualization for the sutras you
don't get more data but you have light
and heat maps you get in the UI from
this distributed thing and you can go
over a bracket in the seat map and see
hey okay this process taking a long time
to write a long time to read or does a
lot of syscalls and the whole thing is
built on top of real course I guess most
of you know this is a framework better
least is the same frame of react the
database of going on which is pretty
much abstraction of distribution there
so systems built for failure so one
house phone go down and the system is
running on the other horses and doing
all the work and it's using CRT teas
which is a very nice kind of data type
to store some of the data soon all of
the data and which has very nice
characteristics on rhe prepares and the
data
and how they merge together when there's
a difference so even in the case of the
real network petitioning and some of the
ninky Arsenal today here image together
quite nicely quite expectedly okay
Sierra T stands for concurrent
distributed data types but the CSM are
your goal it's also standing for common
virtual for coconut and something else I
forgot basically it can use everything
for see the part of the data types which
are built to be edited in two positions
and two areas of ones and merge together
and give no data the student emerged
it's always come out in a kind of making
sense way so it's not like I don't know
you're using react no okay so someone go
to last five wins so you don't get the
latest data back but you get a sensible
merge of all your data back when after a
partition they has meshed together
there's a very nice feature so it limits
the probability of data loss in the case
of network failure or not failure baby
Jesus all too good a system that has
very high uptime and probably the best
for you guys is it's wonderful open
source everything's on guitar and it's
one percent free you can use it there's
no limitations released under the CDD
else or kind of permissive license yeah
so that's a cool stuff and in the end
that's really something that made me
happy and so i'm personally using it
like nine months out of my server I know
other people are using it and there
some commercial people who are using it
by now some universities are looking
into it for departmental internal stuff
and you can there's some interesting
people about 500m smokers in general on
the internet you should read up ok
that's general that's 50 that's what I'm
talking about so I will just talk a bit
about what I've learned in this year
year and three months by now and because
there are some interesting things and
the once i found out that building one
big application even earlier is another
good player you end up with gazillions
of lives of course of logic in one on
vacation it's much better to slip out
have some network interface between
applications and like building another
layer of OTP and servers on tropical
vacations don't copy just what he
observes across and you can use mine and
but thing about like the username is one
application which is entirely standalone
you can use an other projects if you
like and you don't have to use a rest
the service for doing I suppose
messaging between user interface and the
backends is also you can use on your the
central system doing the Lord's one so
ever the API some of the Webster that's
a single server so you can have all the
small applications work on their own and
you think one big thing make a good
interface it's important i use wrench
for example and tcp a perk for
serialization and then extract the
interface into library so you have a
library times I've okay
example the user management applications
course now and there's a lips now so if
you want to use this same logic of user
management people using your vacation
you put into the staff can set up it's
not settle somewhere and I'm happy with
it it also makes building the sink for
me a lot easier because I can just fix
one application and something's broken
order to do all the day thing and the
mtns trick yes we've dedicated we
separate release yes separate releases
really really only applicate own package
of pure release via package system which
you can separate we're really really own
get a report there is no code sharing
our other libraries of course and the
ndm district I found it very nice and
each server is broadcasting this
presence over Indiana's there's a
library and a server library i wrote i
copied half wrote half and which does
broadcasting and opens the TCP socket
and just some handling about when data
comes in and nice it's a little bit like
OTP over tcp because the server goes
down since at least x 4m vienna's are
very short and the client libraries are
smart about stocking up service at the
failures sort of disappears and can use
another server then if it comes back to
the ambient as announcing again next
comes up again so there's a nice way of
automatically handling network failure
the three different machines also a
failure giving you have more than one
system of fault if you're one system to
third second and
yeah let's see yes things it's really
nice so does a little note the Lansing
because you can have multiple services
they all end in as podcasts the client
library is also listening to NBS
automatically propagate spools of
servers they are interchanged and used
so you don't get a really metric load
balancing that you get around which is
quite nice and a big thing you shouldn't
do it's one big big mistake I made don't
model for reputation and there's a typo
earlier it's called Jason and the web
interface the web api uses rest-based
Jason like nitro ever see today and I
had the great idea that if we store the
data all the way from the top to the
bottom JC a very nice time serializing
it in the end which is true the weapon
if it is really easy on this one and it
makes the logic a lot more complicated
please don't do the mistake I did I am
now rewriting all the backend code to
use records again because it's just
easier to handle it nicer and it is a
horrible mess Jase is nice and good for
transportation but don't start it use
something sensible rate of your
conversion records you can easily access
stuff in there they are you don't get
suddenly because you're the type or
somewhere and you get past VD and
passwords because in one thing place you
think oh I thought up a three
nwt sorry Inuyasha you see how it rolled
out I called password all the things
don't happen to those records and it's
easier to check able if you can just
deal eyes on everything please don't
mother for protection yeah enderlin they
are very very good things were going and
there's for torrents are self healing
there's the street assotech and you know
a preaching to the choir here that's why
I'm not talking about this part of the
verra I want to talk about the mindset
which is the best thing I took from our
and when I but I look at early I in a
person I think it's like an English
gentleman you know I'm picked this don't
it didn't pick this because I'm here
actually think it's a very nice and yeah
I'm allergic and other name is there
like Miss kisses like running around
crazy kids and their dividend a problem
there going Wow problem it all excited
and run around and to stop doing stuff
and heading to their computers and
unorganized and screaming around if you
look at the guy you probably can be
buying what I need and when you tackle a
program in earned its kind of different
at least how I perceive the culture of
the mindset of the community the little
program has would like the English
gentleman takes us three o'clock tea or
450 and ocean when your beauty here in
the UK and it sits down with some skulls
and things about it only goes to the
gentleman's club chance with repairs
about the problem as a good night's
sleep gets up some sausages some eggs
and some one afternoon
sits down and all this problems all
about it laid out in front of them and
he goes right has five legs of coats is
heavy and goes off to waive the fee map
and problem worse know the solution
works and that's really something which
I find very special about rope which is
in- the best thing because everything
else you can easily copy in CLE much
leverage and such as mindset of think
first do later instead of just open
let's do something and it's something I
perceive is very special and very unity
and probably the best thing about the
language or the community at all that's
some bad central to the unit process
interaction sucks to say it quietly it's
very horrible in a very problematic and
you have to use standard error standard
out or nifs if you can write your own
code and the moment the program doesn't
behave exactly as Aaron ones to which
means it talks of a standard in a
standard out there is no output after
one of them is closed and both of them
are closed means the program trusts if
this is all the case everything is fine
if you have a problem a problem program
for example that takes the input waste
costs and into clothes that's a
processing gets the output there's no
clear way to reversal you can write a
header ugly script then you're back to
the
sky here and if your application expects
one of them doesn't closest my standard
will sell or closes the things stay like
forever because Alan doesn't terminate
it even if the vm travels it's just a
sec and which is why one of my
application actually has a peak ill
minus 9 somewhere in the stop script so
the application stops probably a
contract 60 application a unification
but I personally think that's not very
good behavior to work from the other
side and there are not so many libraries
sometimes you come along something and
that just isn't the library file which
languages which are more prominent you
probably get fat and given you have to
choose between types badly with their
libraries probably and but it's their
son missing until aunt I'm writing your
own libraries for stuff you like what
you guys can be good since you have
control over them and one thing I am I
always get angry when I do releases is
that people don't vary that is and they
put them on get up and use a master
branch and nothing else there are no
tags or versions there are no branches
for versions so you have to rely either
on a key-hole cash or just hope that
they don't break the master branch which
I can tell you you shouldn't because it
will break I've run into this a few
times the side of my experience of ours
our language I won't so happiness know
it's wrong okay and that one said I want
to give you
look in one of those applications and
we'll talk about snob the right version
because it's in my eye of the most
interesting separated application
because you can really understand alone
it has a great value for other users
because right management was a problem
that always surfaces somewhere and there
are some very interesting technology
choices it and so basically what's not
us it's right where it is that users
that groups or roads it has
organizations which is a mechanism to
automatically distribute or create new
permissions from certain events for
example when you play a vm you can
create permission of this p.m. in
certain groups like you have a admin
group who can start stop them reboot
your the user group who can just start
with you and this can be organizations
and the roads and organizations can be
automatically created this in your
permissions and it's Tommy standalone
doesn't depend on any other companies
and 50 which means it's really reusable
for everyone and there's a nice client
line we would do that's all the mtns
stuff for you so you don't have to worry
putting the client library do the calls
and you can use a privilege so there are
those 36 there's a user yeah user and
the organization and group and so maybe
why the relation between user and group
is pretty much right delegation and it's
called root for historical reasons it
behaves more like a role sorry for the
confusing but I don't want to go through
my
words and changed every google her role
because I think I won this match it and
don't laugh so the user has a list of
groups to which she belongs to the most
and when the star gets carried away use
a health survey permission it first
looks at the user has itself are one of
the group as a commissioner and the
relation between user and organization
is a user does things in the name of the
organization and so there are eight
genes which trigger event in the
organization in five or six sample that
would be the creation of the end and the
organization again has certain rules to
create permissions in groups after
minute so it's like a full circle you go
there and the organization doesn't hold
any permissions themselves they're still
italia opec two Commission's I don't
know what they are and the users is just
using organizations as I'm doing it in
their main and most of the rules and
then the most of the permissions are
salty doors so that's how the data is
arranged in 50 and the whole thing is
built on top of three across so yeah
this nice real green and I stole it from
dash of the ring with permission I asked
them and they actually sent me one and I
think I get money for the rain when they
see it presentations and so each user
lips on three nodes each organization is
or three notes is distributed one node
fails the users still there were two
other nodes and things
happen and since making a stop in Syria
tease even if you do something and you
have outdated views that comes back they
merge together and there is a garbage
collection algorithm to and clean up the
CMT's I don't know probably if you only
to Sierra tease that would be exciting
if not it sounds very mundane and it's
sewing at very high high quality
Lawrence you have a very high
availability and you have something
that's called eventual consistency on
your data which I decided is good enough
for me you might see it differently so
the user or group of the organization is
built on top of this CR 80 so yes last
bedroom ah sorry laughs right with
registers for things like the username
or password hash which pretty much means
we have outdated path of here in purple
here only the one that is nua it's cat
which is this here the key bus is very
sucky life but good enough for things
like username or password since its
behavior gets egg if you have two
different passports you want the newest
one to be available and the things like
permissions or groups and organizations
are startin something is called in
observe remove set which was set that
works away if you have an addition here
and the addition here they go together
if you have a deletion here only things
that we're here gets to leave it if
there's addition he or space in there so
it's a very much it behaves pretty much
as you expected for a set where you can
have to remove things and you much loot
liya which is creating a lot of garbage
which you have to keep a lot of
information that's why there's a nice
garbage collection either
in there which is very exciting and
keeps the marriott also fixes and
outdated data a bit like reacts activity
entropy algorithm just less smart more
just cavalli and okay that's how the day
kind of thought which I currently find a
very exciting thing to see other keys
are great and then you have this mdns
and wrench server the server side yep so
once it's ever comes up and started
broadcasting hey I'm here this is my
domains as my appeases my part I am a
snob server you can use me and on the
blind side there is a cooler which is
one of the pooling libraries fireline
JCP to create a connection and the mbms
listener which says oh I found some
small and goes propagate the pools with
TCP connections so the client can start
using it if one fails gets removed from
the poor and the default timeout is set
to 60 seconds so even if you don't have
a fail communication after 60 seconds or
dead server get removed automatically
other than that gets that point I wished
I witness behaves if it reaches the
treasure is removed and only
and when it's new discovery so that's a
client side and that's snob any
questions good I did a good or very bad
okay was it you told us to hold another
route I use for testing problem in some
places which is a bit tricky since the
GPL but the proper guys are very nice
when you ask them allow you to use it
for other open-source licenses an unit
of course for some unit tests and react
tests for integration tests of a whole
system to local Buddhists and were you
actually starting with movement system
and try to how hot does this we have
this is a division test and what real
tests were following me and that it was
positive for reup in the first place it
creates for instances of your
application and from react tests you can
remain you place it so you can drive
them you can take notes down an app you
can do api call its rating the
distributors check second it's creating
the whole thing and you can do it can
check everything with it no failure
recovery which is very very nice for
distributed systems but did you usually
attached because you were
core of information independently of the
distribution of use and very much easier
to use that he use your core and
actually I have to stalk it into some
manipulation because the real test on
petrol is really only working with react
so there's some ripping out of react
specific bits happening and but a lot of
the logic could apply to General Allen
distributed applications and so if you
rip it up Bowser yeah sorry rip out the
remaining react orbits you could have a
system which does not start not stop
communicate with a note do remote
function calls from the note and
independent from the palace approach as
if
a crisis and the same approach the
leather top 300 and the hypervisor are a
little separate she calls it's a bit
tricky in sniper assassin team called
global zone which is a damn metal
hypervisor and the common understanding
is that it's very debt to run anything
there since it's running is rooted say
it's in the course if you don't want so
there's only a very small service in the
global zone which pretty much is only
executing commands there and that
connects to sniffler which is another
company we can get the commands for this
so there's no distribution going on on
the hypervisor I think what it is I
think I probably in them so you
presumably have some UI to create some
83 is up yellen's
that is they approach yes that next use
the same distribution approach- your
duties at the moment because it's all
still storrington jason and i want to go
away from this but it's a big task to
remodel on your bacon theta no it's
corpses in JC slight representation so
align terms with list for Aries and
lists of two bills objects it was a
talented directors no but also its
distributed over the same kind of
framework on top of react or different
for the different kind of theatres
different being else and yes because a
was an exception which was network
Avengers and since that you eventually
get differently peace is not good enough
and currently is handling it pretty well
and but it's one of the big areas where
there's a ! where I need to do some work
on and everything else I'm very certain
that the eventual consistent approach is
good enough and since when you create
again it gets much it's okay if you
create in your deep try script okay
there's no harm in eventual consistency
there's more harm in downtown at least
so how I think which might be wrong
okay oh yeah said that sells maybe
separately yes so how what kind of uses
with your visitors in the head of Revere
a general-purpose user authentication
you're pretty much can do everything was
it where you have users and roads you
can ignore the organization's if you
don't want them you can also you know
the groups or roles if you don't want
them and have a certain set of
permissions permissions are very simple
they are a list of binaries and they
match if they match and they don't
measure that don't match with two
exceptions of the binary underscore
means here can be everything in the
permission so example that for example
that could be a commission the claw
machine underscore start which would
mean the user can stop every virtual
machine I and tree three dots of the bus
which would mean everything from here on
so vm gotta thought would mean
everything that starts with the
intentions and then you can query the
service leaving you les Commission's we
have our education with tokens to get a
total back with your cabin it's a
session token for web application and
the token is mapped to the user and
which is versatile so as I acknowledge
word I'm Michelle
right and so it's memory only while the
other stuff goes from the back end so
talking today that disc so the tokens
are pretty fast yeah so everything that
has users and permissions could use now
if you have an intervention consistency
and if you have sometimes wish you could
ignore the ball metrics that just make
one I recognition for example also would
work credentials so like next week
eventual is closely inventions pretty
much right now unless you're in the
perfect so M eventual consistency here
works the way that and if all nodes are
there it's pretty much consistent and
eventual consisting only means that if
you have like a network petitioning you
still can work on both sides and then
they get inconsistent but when they go
to better their back together which the
venture will happen they are eventually
consistent again but again this thing if
your head was at your appt with it if
not you're not to see depends really new
approach on the topic and on what your
application needs 454 I made the
decision that availability is more
important than consistency mostly
because I find it kind of icky that 12
providers go and tell you and yes our
flow has 99 percent up time so your
application about 99999 halftime the
application can have 99 of my 90 look up
there but I like I doesn't dump your
writing I think if I'm going to sell
someone i have time i will have to prove
it with my own stuff that works and
first
don't see Emma zones if I has the same
up time as a clutch the guy is down
quite often maligned of the state which
is partially probably because they have
consists of ice okay something a little
heavy I hope you enjoyed it and for
coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
