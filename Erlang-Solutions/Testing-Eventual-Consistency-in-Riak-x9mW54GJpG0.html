so actually this work was done by by
John Hughes together with Scott John and
dizzy from from that show so I've been
working with bash on some other stuff
but but this should really be John
giving this talk but unfortunately
fortunately it couldn't come so I'm here
giving the talk in his stead okay as you
all know all the cool kids these days
are working with big data because it's
big right so what do you do when you
have big data well it's too big to fit
on any single machine so you have to
store it across the whole number of
machines so you distribute it and then
of course you're using a long because
what else would you use so distributing
it means it's scalable you just add more
computers to your cluster and then
everything just works the data you
typically replicate the data so that
each piece of data is stored on a number
of machines which means you get full
tolerance and low latency so if one
machine goes goes down you have the data
on some other machines as well
high-availability the same you can you
know if you're asking for something and
just get it from the closest machine so
so that's where you get the low latency
bit and 11 system for this is the react
system which is what what basho is is
doing which has exactly this this model
so what you lose as Thomas mentioned in
this scenario you get all these noise
these nice features but your query
language is much more restricted so you
can't fire off arbitrary SQL queries and
in the rear case what you had is just a
key value store
but for a lot of purposes that that's
actually correct that's that's all you
need and if it means you can handle huge
amounts of data then that's fine okay so
what's the problem well the problem is
we want to test this we want to check
that's our react database it's doing
what it's supposed to so you have to you
know somehow we need to ensure that is
correct this is by the way this is how
John looks like when it's thinking
really hard okay so we have to
somehow test the react implementation to
make sure it's correct well the first
question is what does that even mean
what does it mean for a distributed
database to be correct where you can
have nodes going up and down at any time
you know it's not even clear what
correctness means in this case so what
do we do well I'm from pubic so the
answer is of course we use quick check
or property based testing as we've seen
a little bit about today so but still we
still don't know what correctness means
so a good approach in this case is to
start off with the simplest possible
model of of your database in this case
that you can think of in this case let's
just go one key one value and a naive
model of how the database works you know
we know that's not going to be a correct
model of react but if we start out with
that model we're going to find out where
it doesn't match up and then
incrementally we can work towards a more
complete specification of what correct
should mean in this case so that's a
nice a nice thing with property based
testing that you can it not only guides
you towards a crack
implementation but you can also guide
you towards the correct specification in
cases where you're not quite sure what
the correct behavior is okay so let's
look at an example of how this works so
here's here's our database react in the
in the cloud and these guys are 22 users
interacting with the database so for
instance the first user puts 0 so
remember we only have a single key so
when you put the value just put it's
just a value there's no key that's only
one so the first used to put 0 the
second user does get from the database
of course you c0 you can then do a put
with one and then the second the first
user again let's support and of course
it gets the newly put value one so we
could we could I now write down some
unit tests of course with various
sequences of guests inputs and then try
to figure out what the correct answer
should be for each of those but that's
not how we do it with property based
testing because it's really boring and
time-consuming so what we do instead is
we have quick check generate these these
sequences of gets and puts so quick
check would generate a test case like
this with a bunch of gets inputs what
some arguments no telling which user is
doing the put and what value and so on
and then we have a model of all what we
think react should be doing and in this
case the model is just a single value
right the value that was last put into
into the database and then we run our
quick trick runs this sequence and then
for each for each command in the test
case you have a corresponding
state transition function that modifies
the state accordingly so in this case
the put when you do a put you'd replace
the the value in the in the model by the
value you put and get wouldn't change
the state at all and then at each
command you check some post condition
for put there's no post condition forget
we'll check that the value we get from
the database is the one that we're
expecting so that it corresponds to what
the model says is in in the database so
that's our super simple super simple
model of of react which we're pretty
sure is going to be incorrect but it'll
be interesting to see where it breaks
down so let's look at that and then
hopefully that will guide us towards a
better specification and actually
working specification okay so here's an
example with just a single single user
to do a put with the value zero we do a
put with a value one and then another
put with zero and then we do a get and
what we what should we get here yeah you
kind of expect zero right and that's
what the model our simple model would
say zero but in this case react came
back and said no one which is very
surprising just looking at this sequence
but in fact there is some there's some
more stuff going on so there are two
ways you can put a value into react you
could either create a new react object
and put in the database or you can use
an old react object that you got from
the database and modify it some way and
then put it back so in this in this case
the first put is a new world of course
because we haven't actually we haven't
seen any react objects so it has to be a
new the second put we've updated the
object that was returned by the first
put so when you put something you get
the newly created object back I guess
but then the third put instead of using
the object that we got from from the
second puts we put a new object in there
so that's a clue to what's going on so
what's the the Bashaw guys said when
when we found this was that well you
shouldn't do that you know you wouldn't
something you've got you've got the old
object here why would you create a new
one you should juice should use the old
object of course so this is just see and
what's the reason for this well the way
react keeps track of what value is is
the most recent ones when you have lots
of of Rights from different different
users and said there's a vector clock
which is pretty much just a sequence of
numbers and then when we were doing this
the vector truck kept the counter for
each user how many times have that user
touched a particular value so in the
first put here the new one the value you
put in would have been touched zero
times by that user or one not sure and
then we do an update which would
increase the vector clock for that user
by one so you'd have an object in here
which which had been touched twice by
this user and then we put a new value a
newly created react object which would
add a fresh vector clock so we'd have
it would only have been touched once by
this user so when it's got to react
react so well this this is an older
value than the one because the one has
been touched twice the 0s only be in
touch once so the 0 was discarded and it
kept kept the one so okay we shouldn't
do that so so fine it's not a bug that's
just how how react works I wonder if the
users know that so anyway so you know
you shouldn't do it but the question is
is that clear to everyone and moreover
is to clear that if you do it that you
could actually lose the data you're
you're putting it so so it might be you
know the intended behavior but you know
is it is it is it a good behavior maybe
it's worth thinking changing it which in
fact the the bash of guys did later but
ok for this for our model now and what
should we do you know we found out that
the simple model wasn't enough so what
we have to enrich our model in some way
to handle this this behavior so one one
thing you might think is well we could
put the vector clocks I guess into the
model and model the behavior of these of
these electric shocks and then we
capture this how this works but that's
not what we should do now that would be
complicating the model more than
necessary I mean we don't really care
from from users perspective we don't
care about the vector clocks that's just
an implementation detail that we don't
really want to see in the specification
and in this case it was you know it was
really a bad test case you shouldn't do
this right so why don't we
that into the specification and make
sure that we don't generate these bands
bad sequences where we do a an object
and then it new so we're enriching the
model so that we keep not only what the
value is in the database but also the
last view of the value that each client
has so when it does get it gets a view
of that value and also when it does it
put I suppose and then when when when
you do a put we only allow that these
update puts unless you don't have of you
don't have a react object in which case
you have to do a new but if you have one
you have to update that one and then all
the all the tests that we generate would
respect this precondition so we would
never actually generate this bad
sequence from before so that means we
can we can move forward we're not going
to see that that particular problem when
when running tests so then you know the
next question is what happens when you
have more than one user so here we've
got two guys writing and reading from
the database and so what happens if they
if they write at the same time so this
guy right 0 this guy writes one what
what you get from the database if you
read it after after these two operations
well the way I think you can configure
this but but the default behavior is
that you just get a list of the possible
values back so you get sort of a
conflict so you know we've got multiple
rights here and we don't know which one
is more recent so you get order
but then if you you know this this guy
does it get he sees all the all the
conflicting values and then it does a
put then since he's seen the conflict
the put he's doing here will resolve the
conflict he's got all the information
here so when he put the two here we're
going to replace the 0 &amp;amp; 1 by the two so
if if the other guy yet does it get
after this put then he's going to see
only only the two so the way we're going
to model that is instead of just keeping
a single value in the in the state so in
the model will give a list of values or
bag of values keeping track of all the
possible conflicting values that we have
at any one time and then each client has
a separate view on what's in the
database which will be also a list of
values which can be different from
what's actually in the database and when
a client does it put then you'd replace
the values that client has seen would be
replaced by the value that is putting so
to model this conflict resolution you
get something from the database and
there's a conflict then you look at all
the values and and you reconcile them in
some way and you put back a single value
as a stir that's the new value so that's
that's what we're going to do all right
so example so get first guy there's a
put second guy does it put first guy
does get so we've got a conflict so he's
getting 0 &amp;amp; 1 I
there's a third guy we chop does another
put with two first guy doesn't put with
three so he's resolving this conflict
between 0 and 1 by putting three and
then there's a get again by the first
guy so what would we expect to see here
turn 3 yeah so we first guy resolve this
conflict but the two there wasn't in it
so the two should still be there and we
should see two and three oops actually
we didn't yeah so that's a that's
interesting so what this turns out to be
is that is a vector clock optimization
so so react doesn't keep a vector clock
for each value so 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; &amp;amp; 2 don't have
different vector clocks so it just keeps
one vector clock for for the entire
object with all the possible conflicts
so when when the two is put here it
loses the fact that 0 and 1 this put
here updates is newer than the 0 &amp;amp; 1 it
just sees at this point it's the 0 1 2
in the database and it's the three is
not new than 0 1 2 because the two over
here has not been seen by by this guy so
it'll just went when the three is put
it'll just become a bigger conflict
between CR 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 ok so again this is
this isn't a bug in react this is just
how it works it's just that we didn't
fully understand what what the behavior
was when when writing the specification
the model intentionally right we were
writing the model partly to understand
what
the correct behavior should be the
actually how should we model this in a
better way so we had before we had the
state of the database was a list of
values and then each client had its own
view of all what values were in the
database and then when we did a put with
this conflict resolution replacing the
clients view by by the newly put value
but in fact this time that not be what
really happens so so it didn't really
replace those particular values in the
clients view as we saw in the previous
example so what we can do is just change
change the models to instead of keeping
track of of the list of all the values
that a client think is in the in the
database we just need to keep a bit
saying is the clients view fresh or
stale so in this case when the first guy
here does it get you see zero and one is
view is fresh it's just done a guest
from the database but as soon as the
third guy here puts the two then the
first guys view becomes state now the
database is 0-1 to the first guy thinks
it's only 0 &amp;amp; 1 and then when you do a
put if you have a fresh view then you
replace the the state of the database
but if you have a stale view you just
add whatever value you put to the list
of conflicting values but so far we've
really only and we haven't really done
any interesting distributed stuff right
this was that supposed to be about
eventual consistency and and really the
react cloud here is just a single a
single note you haven't really done
anything about this distributed fault
Laurent replicated stuff so let's look
at that next so how does it work well
the way it works is that you use store
by default I think each each key value
pair on three different nodes so when
when accounting does it put then that
would be written two to three separate
locations so that if one of them goes
down you still have the value around you
don't lose anything so if you do a put
zero and then the the third node here
goes down what happens when you do
another put and the note is done well
then in that case well it's writing to
the first two because they're up but
then this guy is down so it's writing
the value to to a backup note so every
key has a sort of list of all the
possible backup nodes in in order so if
if this one will be down there so yet
another one where it would it would
store the value and then this guy the
fourth the backup node remembers that
you know it's not really supposed to
have this key is just holding it for for
the third guy so when the third guy
comes up again when it's rebooted
they'll be a handoff so so the before
the backup node will notice that the
third node is back up and it'll send
over the key allowing you to that note
and that's called a handoff
okay so how how should we test this well
you don't want to you know go out and
find a huge cluster of of machines and
start taking them down at random points
in time because that's not really going
to work so I think what you were doing
was you pulling out the logic that were
doing this and testing that logic in an
isolation and then so we generate the
sequence puts and gets as before but
instead of just having one node and
always writing to that these would write
the value student arbitrary or two
arbitrary fallback nodes so instead of
actually taking down notes we just
simulating notes being down by putting
values on on different nodes so that's
that's the test case but then what do we
want to you know we want to test
eventual consistency so eventually
things should become consistent you know
when this eventual eventually happens
well one way of doing that is to say
well first we run our operations and
then we just run as many handoffs as are
available so after we've run this we
pretend that all the nodes or up and let
them do all the handoffs that they want
and after they've done that we expect to
see a consistent State so if we do a get
after all these handoffs we should
really get something assistant
okay so that's that's what the test
cases are going to look like but how
what's the you know what's the correct
you know what does this mean to be a
consistent state down here so here's
John thinking not quite as hard should
we remodel the locations i mean we could
keep track of every time we do a put
which nodes were up whether we're
written and then model exactly what the
handoffs are doing to keep track of what
we expect expect to see in the database
in the end and maybe you can guess that
the answer this question is again no
that's also going in to too much detail
too much implementation specific detail
for for the problem that's hands so we
chose to do instead is to say well we do
the final get then we might see a value
if it was put at some point if it's been
put at all then it could conceivably end
up in the final get but it must appear
in the final gasps if it was put and
never replaced so if we don't have
anyone with a fresh view resolving a
conflict involving this value then it
should still be there
so that's that's easy to to put in our
property and then we can we can run it
so here's an example so we do put 0 you
get less you get 0 another get and it
puts this replaces now the 0 and then we
do a put and in this case we expect to
see one and two we might also see 0
that's I mean if we did it wouldn't be
an error but we should definitely see 0
or C 1 and 2 because we've been post and
no one's replaced them so what do we get
well here's what's actually happening we
do the poet but then these two nodes are
down so it's only put to the top nodes
and then when we do the get the top node
is down and the other two are up so this
guy gets not found instead of 0 and then
in the rest all other nodes are up so
you do get it gets 0 it puts one this
one puts two and then we do the get in
the end and then we only see one huh
that's weird
so remember that the the very first
failing test we had where we were doing
a put and put new and then an open and
then in you again and you weren't
supposed to do that well this is exactly
what's going on here so the first the
first put up there is obviously a new
one but then we were expecting this put
to be an update but in fact since the
second the get operation return not
found we don't we don't have an object
to update so this pooch would be a new
put new instead of a put update and then
the clock magic will just discard this
because the put this put here will
create an object which have been touched
once by the first guy putting 0 and once
by the second guy putting one and this
object that comes in here has been
touched once by the first guy and never
by by the second guy so it's it's
strictly older then the objects that
soldered in there so it's going to be
lost so this is the first bug which
wasn't actually a bug it was just
working as intended that comes back when
we start looking at distribution and
notes going up and down and this this
hand over hand off business
so now you know we there's an actual bug
in react so react isn't eventually
consistent lot it wasn't eventually
consistent it is now because once once
we found this of course the the bashful
guys quickly fixed the problem and and
the fix as I think I mentioned was
instead of using a vector clock that the
tracks how many times each user has
touched a particular key it tracks for
each node it keeps the vector clock or a
an entry in the vector clock for each
node which means that this this
particular bug goes away okay so what
what were we doing here we were using
quick check with which let us now start
off with a super simple specification
which we we knew it was wrong but it was
very helpful as a starting point to
start with a simple specification
because we didn't really know what what
the right specification should be and I
think if we'd started trying to write
the correct model from the beginning we
wouldn't have thought of this this fresh
and stale view business so it's a very
helpful technique to just start out with
a simple incorrect specification and
then validate it against the
implementation see where it goes wrong
and then gradually refine the
specification until you get something
that you're happy with so let us you
know understand what's what we meant by
correctness which is very helpful and it
reeled a potentially serious bug that we
it would have been import
suitable I think to find this with with
conventional testing just because it was
quite a specific case we have to take
down some nodes and then bring bring
them up and bring down the other nodes
in a specific order that you wouldn't
really think of doing if you're writing
tests by hand and another thing was that
once we found this in the battle guys
sat down to fix it they had this nice
property that they could verify the the
new implementations against which I
believe was was quite helpful so the
good news is react is eventually
consistent as far as we know thanks the
quick check thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
