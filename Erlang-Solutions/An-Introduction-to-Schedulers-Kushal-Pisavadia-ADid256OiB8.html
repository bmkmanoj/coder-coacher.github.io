you for filling out the room as
character said I am Keshava savatya and
I'm here to give you an introduction to
the schedulers before I do that I'm
going to briefly talk about why I do day
to day so I work for the government
digital service which which is an
organization within the cabin office the
cabin office is a central department
within the UK's civil service and civil
service has been granted executive
powers by the Queen and that means I
work for the Queen so du/dr started by
building up that UK if you go tick up
that UK at the moment it looks a bit
like this it replaced older sites like
Derek gov business link and many others
with a simple single site for the public
to use it's the best place to find
government services and information
online but we're not just fixing
websites we also build and run digital
services which means building them from
the ground up or working with
departments across the country to
improve their current offerings so
things like the registered voter service
where you can register both for an
election within five minutes on your
smartphone while you're hanging around
with some friends in the park it was
used by lots of people early this year
but we had the general election in the
lead-up to the general election that is
and it saw a peak during the
pre-election period when question time
announced it and it saw about 200,000
people all tried to register at the same
second I think we heard live any given
second from about 11 o'clock till
midnight
which is really impressive the other
thing we that we do is provide
visibility to a lot of the government
services that there that we offer so
here you can see the vehicle contacts
from yours we've got information here on
the transactions per year the total
costs and the car
their transaction we also show you the
live service usage so you can see how
many uses on right now I really like
this screenshot because it shows 39
years online but the date underneath
says 8:00 a.m. on 25th December some
people on Christmas morning prefer to do
their contacts but I'm not going to talk
about any of this if you're interested
you could hear more about what g-guess
is doing my colleague he's called Phil
Potter
he's sitting right there in a blue shirt
and he's speaking tomorrow on registers
in this room at 3:30 it's really
interesting as a project because it's
the core building blocks of data that
government may begin to use and should
start to use to open out the information
that we hold right now but like I said
I'm not going to talk about GDS I'm here
to give you an introduction of
schedulers and one of the motivations
for this particular talk it's because
it's been hard to go to a conference for
the last two years without hearing about
this thing it's everywhere and it's from
my point of view just like to get a bit
annoying but there was a discussion as
part of not long ago where someone said
the pace of change in this space is too
much and schedulers feels like it's too
daunting a topic to even begin to
understand so I want to do this talk to
dis the mister pile of this kind of area
of schedulers so things like me sauce
americaine kubernetes and swarm I want
to help you understand when you should
use schedulers
and when you shouldn't but more
importantly on to show you how they work
the other personal reason I'm giving
this talk is because much like the young
boy in a sixth sense who sees dead
people wherever he looks
I see schedulers
now I'll explain this later in the talk
but that's one of the biggest personal
reasons if you're giving this sort the
talk is structured in three parts I'm
going to introduce schedules I'm going
to talk about kernel CPU scheduler and
then I'm going to talk about some other
schedulers building on that information
that you'll unit them now the other way
to look at the structure this talk is
this three questions what our schedule
is how do I use them and Hardware
swapping the third one is really
important because as Garrett suggests at
the start many of you use schedules day
in and day out you just don't know them
you don't have to spot them I hope to
help you figure that one out so let's
start from the ground up the job of a
scheduler is to fairly allocate work and
I want to emphasize that word fair
fairness here is an artistic term it's
used in a lot of academic literature
around scriptures but it's an important
word here
it's not about statistical fairness it's
not about probability or any other kind
of game theory terms that you might be
familiar with but it's a way of saying
that schedulers I've done they optimize
whatever you tell them to observe or act
upon that's it
so don't judge them beyond that there
are three stages for a scheduler there's
a scheduling set an allocation step and
then a binding step scheduling
determines the sequence in which
operations executed what is the order
then there's an allocation step where
you set aside the appropriate number of
functional units what do you need to
complete the work and then the third
step is the binding set where you assign
those operations to the functional units
where you do the work three stages
scheduling allocation finding so let's
schedule with a simple example let's
schedule an equation so e equals a B
plus C D so if we were to place the
letters here a b c and d of numbers 1 2
3 &amp;amp; 4 from your school education you
might do something that looks a bit like
this
i've put brackets in to emphasize the
ordering here in the UK education
cisterna subvert is body mass a bracket
audience division multiplication
addition and subtraction but it's just
the way of saying that you have to
complete the multiplication here before
you complete the addition but the other
way to describe this equation is as a
tree
so you know that to get to e you have to
do some addition operation and then
before you can do the addition operation
you have to complete either a times B or
C times B for those operations to the
cabeza and addition here is commutative
so the ordering here doesn't really
matter and I'm going to come back to
this diagram a few times over as I
describe some common scheduling problems
so I've picked four to talk to you about
today there are many there are books and
books and books I've bought a lot of
them in my preparation for this sort but
I wanted to pick one before because
they're the easiest ones to explain what
you need is known there's the
unconstrained scheduling problem or
essentially you don't really have any
care about the work you want it done
eventually at some point in time you
don't mind how I schedule decides what
to do so whether it has to
multiplication units or one it would
have to do either one of these
operations then the addition unit and
then the work will be completed now
there is a time constraint of scheduling
where you might want all operations
completed within a finite number of
steps so I've picked two here so if we
take again the same diagram and we chunk
it up into two steps we know that to
complete everything in two steps we'll
need at least two multiplication units
that we can paralyze those operations
and then at least one addition step
every wooden slipper cool and then and
then there's the resource constrained
scheduling step so let's say we only had
one modification unit and one addition
unit we know that we can't do so many
things at a time so in our example here
we have to do a given multiplication
then another and then finally completely
so I've seen some common scheduling
problems already so let's look at some
common scheduling algorithms you've got
things like the as soon as possible or
ASAP scheduling where you do each
operation one at time into the earliest
possible control sir the as late as
possible scheduling algorithm where you
do each operation one at a time into the
latest of some control set list
scheduling which is really common choice
for solving the resource constraint
problem that we just saw
so where you schedule each step
sequentially choosing each operation
based on your constraints whatever they
well and then force director scheduling
where you distribute operations
according to a weighting most commonly
this is time and that's how many people
tend to realize it and so things like
choosing a weight for each operation in
the case of your various MapReduce jobs
so you might want one word count to be
computed faster than another in Hadoop
and there's also been packing where you
want to either minimize the number of
units used or minimize the number of
units left idle this is really important
with regards to container schedulers and
I was trying to find a good example of
how to visualize this and the best one I
found was pretentious because it's it's
kind of perfect for this so as you can
see the block to spelling out we're
trying to complete each row and fill up
each row as we play the game of Tetris
and that's kind of the idea the very
very simple idea of bin packing and bin
packing is really important because we
don't effectively use our instruction if
we curse why amazing good do not afraid
of really so much subset books for
example but they could concentrate on
one of the bigger points with a mister
which is a electricity usage so now we
know the basics let's apply it to
something a bit more concrete
let's look at the kernel CPU scheduling
so like I said before the job of
scheduler it's a fairly allocate work in
the case of the CPU scheduler it manages
multiple operations and decides which
operations get the CPU utilization right
now the real challenge of this of course
is to make sure applications get a fair
share of CPU time for some CPU schedules
not all they refer to this as a time
slice there are many implementations
which use different terms I'm using this
one for now and I'll use a different
example later on so there's that word
fair again
so the kernel needs to share that the
school CPU or CPUs among many
applications running as far as users
concerned at the same time now the way
that the kernel does this is it
virtualize the CPU for you because you
as the user can't really be trusted
the basic idea is to run one process for
a little while then run another one and
then another one and so forth and by
time sharing the CPU in this way
virtualization is achieved if you wanted
to if your interest is writing C in
kernel code you could write one of these
in a few hundred lines of code in a very
very naive way you'd essentially take
Siskel's that you'd provide using Lib C
and in a round-robin format just flip
through each process based on the
Siskel's that our sauce needs to
complete and as a result a CPU can then
be very happy doing what it's designed
to do well which is run wonderful many
threads of operation and it can keep on
ticking along just fine
so let's look at a slightly more
concrete example in the CP scheduler now
let's look at the linux 2.4 CPU
scheduling there are other good operate
systems that are available I just pick
mimics because I like it and now if you
look at the 2.4 CPU scheduler the kind
of structure that it used underneath was
tasks list containing all of the
processes and all of their work that
needs to be completed and be
we'll read right lock click the whole
thing so what the schedule would do it
would look over this task list it would
select the task to execute based on some
criteria some algorithm some of those
that we've seen already and then it
would pick one to run now the criteria
commonly that you might know and be
funny with is the priority of the task
so the party tells the schedule to help
to organize the processes in this queue
and using this lock it would unlock the
the queue to read through or to write
them to it and sort the process lists
based on that priority and pick the
operations to run based on the
priorities the priority tells the
schedule how to organize the processes
the British operations the the 2.4 CP
schedule had a number of shortcomings
the biggest one is it wasn't efficient
they had to iterate over all tasks in
the task list every single time if our
task list was huge it would use up a lot
of time just trying to read through each
time and see through that entire list
it's also really bad in multi purpose
environments so a lot of time is spent
swapping it out at the task where you'd
probably pin a single CPU and leave
let's say the other seven CPU gets ATP
is running unused whilst this single
queue is being inspected so it was
rewritten in 3.6 by an individual called
Ingo Molnar with a lot of help from the
wider Linux community the goal was to
easily handle multiple CPUs and perform
independently of load so instead of this
structure of a single block and a big
list this looks like this it's at the
priorities you have very different
processes which are 1 340 and it gave
each one its own queue and each one its
own lock this was a significant
improvement but it wasn't great it still
wasn't perfect so it was rewritten again
in 2.6 and later version 0.6 and it's
called the completely fed scheduler
that weren't very good by the way and
this particular case uses a red black
tree instead of a bunch of cues and it's
really interesting if you want to see
all of the maintenance discussions and
two point four to the various steel
rotations of two point six today because
there's a little available on Gmail you
can you can read all about them and the
back and forth between both the Linux
community and the BSD community around
schedule is is also really interesting
but I'll leave that as an exercise for
you to investigate and I definitely if
you're interested in this kind of stuff
I'd highly recommend you look at FreeBSD
scheduler as well but before we saw some
common scheduler things
ASAP lifts and pulls directed well these
are the terms that are used in academic
literature in scheduling world but they
have council fights
counterparts sorry in the kernel cpu
scheduler they have these names scared
under school is the prefix things like
by phone are all and other FIFO being
first in Purcell are being round-robin
and other is userland it's what many of
you tend to exist in because they say
applications they also have short hands
that you might have come across already
so things like TS AF RR and question
mark now if you ever see question mark
as the scheduling policy be slightly
worried because usually means there's a
bug in your scheduler so maybe look at
your documentation or rebuild your
respective arrested but if you wanted to
understand what scheduling policies use
for various of processes you can use a
whole host of simple tools to do that
so with PS you can look at the classes
you get in command here you can see just
a very short list I've generated looking
at a few of those right now you can also
control how the colonel schedules your
processes
some of you might already be familiar
with nice when you run a program with
module modified scheduling party and
here's an example where I run an echo
hello with a different scheduling party
than the default nice isn't it sorry
utility ready it was using the early
days of mainframes and it's a way of
being nice to your counterpart and to
reduce your CPU consumption but that's
really about batch computing and those
days might not necessarily apply to us
today and it's still in use however and
it's still useful but it only applies to
the processes that run in that other
scheduling policy that we serve that we
saw before there's another tool that is
a superset of nice and that's called CHR
T or change real time and with that you
can manipulate the real time attributes
of the given process so in this small
example I've just printed out the
scheduling policy for the process at
page 16 so it's got the policy is
first-in first-out
the priority here is the 99 but using
CHR T you can essentially define these
things together and I've got a small
comparison here nice and CHR T secure
but if you have a use nice to
deprioritize a process or increase the
priority of a process you can do the
same thing with change real time and you
can change the actual respective
scheduling policies as well in that
process the other nice utility that you
can use it I only so if you have been
doing any backups that you find cause
you some issues at 3:00 in the morning
cause it to get woken up you might use
this application oh sorry this tool to
either idle a given IO for the disk IO
for example for a given kid or to
minimize the priority we given process
but like I said earlier on I see
schedulers where by lip and it's this
thing it's this structure again and
again and again IQ or many cues a lock
and then some kind of selection
algorithm over the top so we've seen
very briefly with the kernel CPU
scheduler and it exists in networking
land as well so if you've not come
across this it's somewhat out of date in
certain areas but the Linux advanced
routing and traffic control how to
exists at lar TC dot org and it's just
an excellent online manual and if you
want to know more about how the Linux
networking works it's probably a really
accessible read to go through the
website and in I want to pick up on a
particular chapter that's chapter 9
where it goes into queueing disciplines
for bandwidth management so it's the
same structure again so things like IP
route to IP set multicast routing all of
these are backed by scheduler which have
queues and a second there's selection
algorithm so let's look at an example
that you might want to do yourselves you
might want to make the network scheduler
imitate a higher latency Network let's
say a mobile phone because you're an
Android or iPhone developer or you're
doing something using mobile websites
and you want to test how your respective
services respond so there's a tool that
you can use to do this so this is the
command everyone understands what that
does yeah
so this is a tool called traffic control
it's the shorthand is TC and I'm now
just going to describe what that command
does so you invoke it using TC the next
key word along is heyou disk which is
short the queuing discipline so whenever
the kernel sends a packet to an
interface it's cute against the queuing
discipline and everything commonly
starts at the root node and then there
are various four classes
depending on what you're doing so if you
haven't done a packet filtering you tend
to add a queueing discipline on to
whatever your network devices in that
particular case then what you're doing
here is you're adding against the local
device on the root node okay a new sorry
a new rule to the local devices here
it's all running and then we're setting
a network delay 500 minutes less net n
here stands for network emulation so if
you wanted to you can set this to
whatever delay you want it to be but
then you can then delay all of your own
your traffic you wanted to so we know a
bit now about CPU and network schedules
but there are schedulers beyond CPUs and
networking some of you might use a
database
one example is post-race I'm going to
look at so Postgres is something called
auto vacuum and you might come across it
before it automates the execution of
vacuum and analyze plans the commands of
your tables that is the actual auto
vacuum process can be tuned and it can
be configured depending whatever your
needs are but by default it just runs
according to the default scheduler and
if we look at the dots for Postgres
which if you haven't are incredible and
as documentation for any date where it
goes it's like miles ahead of anything
else the documentation I'm just quoting
directly from it there is a persistent
daemon process in charge of starting
auto vacuum working processes for all
the databases it will distribute the
work across time I tend to start one
worker within each database every
defined settings and that sounds a lot
like a scheduler to me and if you look
at the code of photographs that's
exactly what it's doing underneath
but at thoughtless presentation I said
one of my motivations for this tour was
containers and some of the container
sketches so let's look at two of them
let's look at cuban entities and doctors
sworn let's try and look at the actual
code so here's some go code and i know
you've seen go before and i'll try and
describe what this is so it's spreading
a an interfacer called scheduler and the
interface scheduler expects a single
function to exist called schedule and in
this case it takes a pod which is some
configuration for a node and then some
way of listing out all the minions or
all of your respective nodes that you
want to deploy onto dr. swarm does
something very very similar they just
happen to use different words and in my
opinion they're identical so again it's
written go we've essentially just
changed scheduler placement strategy
scheduled for place container hartford
container config and then their array of
nodes to apply them to in the case of
container schedules they optimized the
bin packing problem it's this thing that
we saw it for this idea of placing a
thing based on some of the fun in a very
very simple way now with many schedulers
they optimize in a very very simplistic
manner based on what have you tell them
to observe some kind of primitive so in
the world of container schedulers they
might have primitives like CPU or a
number of instances and then you can
choose to add your own like response
time and all of these things are tunable
because schedulers are very very
simplistic things so it's up to you to
define what good looks like so in the
world where you define what it looks
like you might have some kind of thermal
node with some kind of service running
on it maybe some other kind of service
running on it and then all of a sudden
you
to run many thermal nodes with many
services but because it's the cloud
these are thermal nodes aren't ephemeral
because we've chosen them to be their
ephemeral because it has bad IO or
you've got a noisy neighbor on there is
a reality and we can't trust me this
stuff and that's maybe why we hand or
choose to hand a lot of this power of
control down to a scheduler and in the
case of the schedule of what it would do
is understand whatever your primitives
are that you've defined of what what
good looks like and then move things
around depending on what your accounts
are so it move your services across
depending what you need but I'm not
going to talk in great deal about what
Kuban entities or things like that
actually do if you are interested in
there is this individual called Kelsey
Hightower and he's been probably
spending like the last year now just
helping people learn how these things
work and most of his thoughts about
demos if you're interested in like
understanding how a lot of these
container skitters work he's got loads
of really interesting talks that show
you how they work and try to introduce
sample applications so things like a
given Java app running Postgres how to
do you know the kind of cloud friendly
cloud native databases that might
attempt to do some kind of inventory
consistency consistent but yeah his
videos are excellent and and always
entertaining so if you're interested in
that that's some stuff you can
definitely check out Kelsey's tools but
we've covered the CPU use we've covered
networking covered databases we've
covered containers where you might run
to a nice thing for them and we can keep
on going up the stuff so this is a photo
at baggage claim an airport and I don't
know might you but every time I could
baggage claim I think it's just a load
of keys with a lock and in my case I am
this election algorithm because I know I
care about which is my bad but many
baggage claim systems at airports are
run by pieces
so if you came in through abroad and he
flew into terminal five today yesterday
the entire baggage claim system what 705
is a scheduler it's a bunch of keys with
a lock on them and it's an application
that uses the CPU or scheduler it speaks
over a network a scheduler to a database
a scheduler and there are other examples
as well in the real world Premier League
football games offset by a scheduler so
before the start of the season keep me
to decide which games get set it aside
based on the competitions that various
teams are in so things like the
Champions League Europa League or
Premier League and also on a few special
circumstances things like you can't have
both at the big Manchester teams playing
at home on the same day because but as
much as United in Manchester City
because you can't have there just aren't
enough firm police in Manchester there
were that kind of influx of traffic the
train stations can't handle that kind of
load and it goes beyond just football
and there are a lot of interesting
problems in the space so this is an
aerial view shrimp bridge in Nottingham
in this photo you can see Natyam for us
with their ground and also shrimp bridge
cricket ground and it turns out you
can't have both of these events playing
at the same day as well because there's
a very very narrow bridge of the cross
from the train station or white car to
get there in a lot of cases but just out
of shot is also Notts County they also
have a fairly large war ground so you
can't have all three of these teams
playing at the same time and it's a
really really interesting sitting
problem how do you deal with that kind
of movement of people across trains cars
space whatever it is it's a lot slower
but it's a infinitely complex for them
where it's probably a good decision to
upload that to a computer and like I
said
I see schedulers wherever I live and
maybe you start to agree with me and
maybe you don't that's okay
but the job of a scheduler it's a fairly
allocate work there's that word fair but
there's a schedule that I've missed
there's an entire family of schedulers
I've been talked about there's the
person that wrote the code and they
schedule their own time they forget
their own algorithm Pomodoro brute-force
time constrain whatever it might be
there's the person that plan to work and
they would have their own fair approach
based on their own objectives and then
there's a person that asked for work so
why are we so willing to trust the
software that find it harder to trust
people honest even if they wrote the
schedulers in the first place it feels
like we should be able to be better than
you can choose to hand over knowledge
work to schedulers but they're not a
silver bullet they don't solve all of
your problems magically they were
whatever objective that you set and they
optimize decision space fairly according
to your own rules that you sir
so you can probably do a better job of
handling certain things over a scheduler
they're not perfect you can probably do
a better job of capacity planning
because you can choose which are the
primitives and trade-offs matter to your
organization without the money time
resource usage uptime you know co2 usage
are we friendly to our environment and
based on the context of your business or
your organization you probably want to
control that instead of handing it off
friendly blindly to a random computer
giving it you know access to your 80
best seconds so don't blindly give all
control to the scheduler think about
what they're good for where they can
help you they break where decisions
would be too slow to give to a human you
don't want to hand that to the you don't
want to hand a person scheduling well
you don't want to sorry you don't want
to hand over scheduling CPU operations
see you a person so don't blindly give
up all control and even even worse don't
only believe
Thunder pitch about skitters you for the
last few years we've heard a lot about
containers and your we're only gonna
hear more and more and big organization
have seen that there's money in this
space just be wary don't trust
everything before I finished I just want
to end on this brilliant quote from
Eileen well how much of the work that we
do is actually device to help us focus
on what's really important it's helped
us fairly pick on what to weapon for us
as individuals based on our objectives
and who's got a who's got a question
question question ooh
here we go hello so this is working okay
so you talked initially about the three
stages of scheduled allocate and bind
which one is the most complex
complicated and all of them believe
they're right whatever the problem is
that you're approaching is where a lot
of them tend to agree on so in the case
of CPU scheduling you tend not to worry
about the kind of initial scheduling
step because other processes are giving
you that information all the time and
saying go do this work for me and so
it's kind of the allocation level there
that's the biggest burden but things
like
the kind of football sports schedulers
for example that I showed before their
problem there is more around
understanding the entire complexities of
what there is and potentially missing
things out so I guess sorry I know it's
very bad answer but it just depends on
your yes so you mentioned in your talk
that the is an interesting discussion
about the linux 2.6 scheduler well I
find that simply by typing those words
into Google and OLN AR any other
questions you have a question so I had a
problem of organising a conference talks
at a so the earth attracts in the order
so that sounds like a scheduling problem
classic and it was or I tried to just
naively do some sort of solver they got
weight give weight to different things
and then and I gave up after maybe a
couple of hours and so I think I should
probably be leveraging something there
that because I didn't this is probably a
lot of research in this area that I so
what it's something like that where you
have maybe Anand Rose that scheduling
posses would seem on space sit
relatively simple you could do like
round-robin
but a case where you have a lot of
different weights in the case of the
football the matches and all the
different variables and weighting how
would you what are some of the like
fields that you would approach there
what like to go research and learn more
about doing actually doing that in case
of that I wouldn't necessarily go to
academic literature
alright go is I probably I mean we have
a number of people here who've come to
the conference who would paid to attend
and they were interested in certain
topics so in that particular case you
probably want to ask your attendees you
already know ahead of time that they're
attending because they've they've paid
so you can just get them to vote based
on what they they are most interested in
and just kind of map that out
accordingly because it's a bin packing
problem then in that case it's here as
interests are they aligned you can't
meet everyone's needs but you can do the
majority your least well was they so in
this case it was like length of time and
others bunch of other weight like more
logistical issues as well and it was it
it was like a simple voting it was a
solver that was like I looked in this
the solver space is that does that apply
here is that leader Tetris for except
the tetris model would you use which has
to do some sort of analysis and and
perhaps waiting a best-fit is there uh
what's the tetris algorithm like this
well there's loads I don't know I'm
honest right now what I'm thinking about
is what are people interested in because
that's the biggest thing like the as
much as having the perfect schedule I
can fitting everything in based on time
matters the reason the conference exists
in the first place is because people
want to attend it and it feels like
that's the core thing to push towards
first it happens a landing is yeah and
then and then using that information
gives you the kind of core primitives to
wait things on so then based on interest
then you can do the other primitives
like do they fit the time is there
enough space for questions and
discussion and coffee and lunch and
everything else yeah else any other
questions okay thank you very much thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
