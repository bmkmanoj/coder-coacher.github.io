stuff this office of child
Perez biology which to me is the most
preposterous Lee lofty absurd talk title
I could think of but the motto code
meshes you go bigger ego so weird like
to shoot for like the universe applied
to software is why not right so as
background to this I was a pike a Python
conference in Chicago 2005 I heard a
brilliant guy at Alex Martelli talking
about abstractions and talk title the
talk is not interesting but the Q&amp;amp;A
session afterward I thought was a good
talk but the Q&amp;amp;A session was what
inspired me and he said that programmers
should read if you wanted to give a good
program you should be folks that have
nothing to do the program have to do
with anything other than program so as a
liberal arts student I'm like that's
great I want to like go you do vocal
training they don't make you a better
software though you know poetry or
whatever else and so I asked the
question Alex what should we read a
recommendation Justin reading reading a
list for us to go eat and I thought of
it they said it read books on
architecture read books on building
cathedrals office buildings homes
through that they'll understand
interfaces and all these other things
that's fine I didn't do any of that
because I have a problem with this model
of software as architecture to me
software has nothing to do with physical
structures it isn't so much gravity
isn't subject to wind and rain and many
of those things that is far far far more
flexible and an organic and so organic
we'll wait a minute organic so I started
reading books on biology and this was
you know many years ago and over time so
there's an amateur biologist scientist I
picked up some things and I think
there's a lot to say from biology
applied to software and this this is the
gist of this talk so somebody asked
apparently this is not listed in the
guidebook see so those of you who are
here thank you for like betting on his
title you have you I
what I'm about to talk about is using
biology to inform our thinking about
software to provide a mental model to
help us inspired or informed or confirm
or deny certain suspicions that we might
have so we look to something outside of
software going to look at our echo
chamber of software developers and
conferences etc go to a different
community take what that community has
and then applying not religiously but
sort of selectively so I'm going to do
that I'm going to start with a personal
rant of mine and that this is the
classic interview question this is the
classic barroom conversation topic you
know what is the problem with software
today so you all have your various
theories but if the correct one is of
course mine which is the problem with
software is designed so this is a fairly
absurd statement just like the title
right I'm going to be quite a certain on
language today I'm not talking about bad
ism I'm not talking about design errors
i'm talking about design so i'm going to
bet that most of you are just adequately
disagreeing with you know you're like ok
your role this is not a problem design
is an integral part in a central part of
software development ok well let's see
what happens here so now I'm going to
get into some biology stuff I'm going to
get into some science stuff but I want
you to be very very clear about this I'm
actually not allow scientists I'm a
program I'm not informed when it comes
to science I will say things that sound
like science that sound like I know I'm
talking about but I don't so don't for a
minute things I'm a scientific person
here i will tell you things that are
wrong but here's the point you never let
facts get in the way of a story what you
never left ask like an underlying the
power story we're going to focus on the
story here so if you see something
that's wrong here say nothing briscoe
claw through it most of its way ok so
I'm talk about design I need to talk
about the human brain from it so this is
biology this is funny because i'm
actually using an example here which
comes from like my fifth-grade education
which is wrong this is a an outdated
model of left brain arrived in turn down
the greatest far more complex and you
want so this is a gross erroneous
simplification but it's a good
so the human brain right side left side
hemispheric the right side has the sort
of ability to envision forecast process
synthetically abstractions on the left
side is the one that kind of rains the
stuff in again gross over
oversimplification I am NOT a life
scientist but think of these sibling
these terms so we have this ability to
sort of see things that don't exist we
also have the ability to physiologically
experience these things to the point
where it's very difficult at times to
determine to differentiate fact from
fiction so if you've ever had a dream
where you woke up and cold sweat
elevated pulse what's happening
something is occurring in your brain
that's reforming your body but danger
your body doesn't know the difference so
humans we have the ability to see things
that don't actually exist but we
actually believe that they exist so you
see things and are not mind's eye that
don't exist but we think they actually
exist this is the crux of the pack of
this problem of design the ability of a
human being specifically so dolphins
don't do this there are smart
chimpanzees don't do this very smart to
conceive of something that is not in
this world but you have to
physiologically experience it so we sit
in the room as kind of the big brain
right who here is an architect don't do
it is a trap architects man that's bad
that's not good in it see this thing is
going to look just probably give you
life prices so i think i have actually
called it an architect so so what does
the architecting the architects sits in
the room in my job I don't like the term
like okay so the architects sips of the
room and forecast the genius the
inventor the summoning the power of the
universe to say the software shall be
with us it doesn't exist but in the
brain of the genius
right you know these can you be rumbling
Stratasys person in a room of the white
board saying most of the things
providing most of the answers if there's
ever a question is always an answer from
this person because it's the brain
synthesizing generating solutions and
I'm pushing them forward and then the
minions program time now that's a bit of
an extreme statement but when you look
at the way software is designed built is
buying a large through that function you
have the genius in snow may inspire the
visionary the Creator who puts forth
design and then the minions carried out
so this individual interesting Lea's
courses concepts reportedly the inventor
if you like let's just say he better
file a story excuse hi mom later so here
this gene is this inventor this creator
says this about genius quote genius is
one percent inspiration ninety-nine
percent perspiration it's kind of cool
you know the between is it's very catchy
but it's surprising I think so here we
have an accredited genius are going to
credited inventor and accredited creator
taking this idea of this ability of the
human being to forecast something and
inverting in its a know what real genius
is just a small fraction of what you
think it is it's a small portions that
the inspiration is just a tiny little
slipper the great majority of genius has
to do with effort for Paul Valery is a
late 19th century poet flaws from
essayist not a programmer but has
something very interesting to say about
creativity and invention so it takes to
this is a quote takes two to invent
anything the one makes up combinations
the other chooses recognizes what he
wishes and what is important to him
they're an interesting quote genius is
the readiness of the second so that is
the chooser to grasp the value of what
has been laid before him and choose it
so this is very very interesting this is
a little bit of line with Thomas
Edison's quote but it's a step away from
it it kind of inverts it and says that
genius is not so much the inspiration
point but it's a selective process so as
we apply this model of biology I'm
thinking
this sounds a lot like natural selection
what is natural selection in this case
well we're looking at darwin's finches
of course variation so this is the
process of invention the first lays out
a series of combinations of options the
genius comes behind says oh I'm going to
pick this one of course nature is not
sentient is not forecasting it's
reactive it turns out that this one is
selected because this one can get eat
the seed forget to the food and gets to
live and exist and reproduce and so the
program that caused this particular
option to manifest if preserved it's a
form of selection we call selection
because it's easy to think of it that
way but it's really survival and rub
through replication as a program that is
replicated and survives so isn't this
interesting are we talking about genius
as an inventive process that isn't
actually genius so I want to take a look
at something that's very specific here
and and go into some details of an
invention of nature that is
extraordinary I by anyone's definition
extraordinaire it's not just superficial
selection it's an invention that works
photosynthesis so again I'm not a life
scientist but I'm going to pretend this
is I level stuff this is actually very
complicated but basically photosynthesis
two phases the first phase takes water
and light uses the light bust open the
water molecules so you get oxygen and
hydrogen damaging is not not necessary
so it's cows valves at the cast office
waste delicious oxygen which we all love
waste but it takes the hydrogen as an
election and it converts it into a
molecule that stores it as a high energy
electron the second phase takes that
electron and shoves it into carbon
dioxide which against from some other
stores the areas or the air in this case
shaw's it into carbon dioxide we get
sugar delicious life-sustaining sugar
it's a remarkable process let's take a
little look into it the first phase the
dark the light phase is called the Z
scheme it's two phases it's two very
interesting pieces the first one takes
the water busted in part in two parts
you get oxygen office waste and the
electron goes up this gets charged with
the photons and then tumbles down we get
ATP out of that process so that's a
molecule which it contains energy and
that goes off and that goes off into the
next phase but then it also goes through
a second the second photo system
photosystem gets raised again and
tumbles down and creates NADPH these are
both these are the molecules that
contain the NADPH contains the electron
that feeds into the second cycle which
is the calvin cycle and this is where
the hydrogen electrons are shoved into
carbon dioxide to krogers so it's taken
science nearly a hundred years to figure
this out I figure out how the heck does
photosynthesis work it's so remarkable
that it's been demonstrated that this is
chemically the only way to actually
accomplish this there is no other way to
accomplish this result it is by all
accounts a a fantastic and brilliant
invention so this is Earth before
photosynthesis this is not an actual
picture of Earth before photosynthesis
you're wondering this is actually a
picture of Titan but believe a Titan
resembled earth before it was oxygenated
oxygenated by photosynthesis this is
Earth after photosynthesis yes I like
this one atmosphere green life
ecosystems food chains all the things
that we associated today with our
existence wonderful so imagine if you
could take credit for inventing
photosynthesis just consider this for a
moment Thomas Edison got credit for
inventing the light bulb that's big
photosynthesis basically terraform earth
it allowed this conversation to take
place without it we wouldn't exist to
imagine the power of this vision the
creative genius that took place
undoubtedly in an off-site meeting that
the cyanogen cyanogen psyops sign back
to you again I'm not a scientist the
sign of bacteria got together and said
hey let's put together a vision soon
our vision for Earth and here's here's
what they also create very tight we're
going to maintain atmospheric oxygen
levels and supply all the organic
compounds and most of the energy
necessary for all life on earth that is
bold that is like a very good investment
if you're if you see you're like yes
we're going to back this company and it
was done through this what of course a
bit of a joker right there was no vision
there was no design but yet what did it
accomplish so yes it's anecdotal but
look at this this is the basis for the
variety of life that we have the process
this particular invention right just
just I mean it's impossible to actually
grasp it but just for a moment
contemplate the variety of life right
and as we zoom out we see more and more
and more and more and more and more and
i would have to click this 23 more times
to represent the 8.7 million species
photosynthesis is just 1 billion
invention you can spend a lifetime
probably some millions of life done
thousands of lifetime's researching the
brilliant inventions of the geniuses
that actually never existed so it
certainly seems to be possible to trade
brilliant breathtaking efficient design
without ever designing so let's rein
this in a little bit and talk about non
craziness let's just talk about software
formula P rinchen says never design
anything that's not a precise minimal
answer to a problem that we can identify
and have to solve now this is an
articulating natural selection but it is
certainly a step in that direction
pressure O'Keefe computer scientist
start with the simplest thing that has a
chance of work computer scientists again
not articulating no design but taking a
step toward that direction
David Allen not a computer scientist to
my knowledge getting things done this is
we're getting to GTD comes true you
don't actually do a project subtraction
of a of a thing that goes above right
the mechanics of change you can only do
action steps related to it not a
software developer so we are talking
about these things it's not as if this
is some crazy topic right and so for
many of you you're thinking oh I forgot
the most important part here this is the
drunken stumble so this is what Peter
was alluding to before so drunken
stumble is a methodology which beers
natural selection you lean I do here i
guess i can i can demonstrate it here so
drunk istanbul is a way for drunk people
or i should say not very smart people to
do you know productive things so you've
had too much to drink it's hard to walk
strike here's how we do it you lean and
then you stumble forward like that that
was automatic i did literally did
nothing i didn't think about that i
leaned it up a dick up sorry about that
was probably like extremely alarming to
you it is so I just leaned in a
particular direction I wanted to go that
away and then I allowed instinct and
gravity to propel myself forward there
was no thought involved so this is a
methodology that is two parts you mean
that means you can want to go that way
that's our direction or vision and then
you only ever do the next obvious thing
so it's kind of a humorous anecdotal
equivalent of natural selection we have
evolutionary pressure and then you have
sort of mechanical steps that are led in
that particular direction so for a lot
of you and I get this all the time
you're just talking about agile right to
say to me I'm just talking about agile
so first of all please don't say this
because it hurts my feelings every day I
wants the thing the band members want to
think that that band is the unique sound
in the universe even though that
balanced and sounds like you to the
clash or whatever so when you say you
know your sound you sound just like you
tune the clash the banners are like no
we're completely different from that so
first of all please that hurts my
feelings second of all against their
some commonality this an overlap but
they're very different and let me take a
shot
because it's fun I love to take shots of
place so here's from the agile manifesto
this is how software's biology is not
agile continuous attention to technical
excellence and good design enhances
agility this is from the manifesto I'm
kind of shared picking an obnoxious
quote here this is a claptrap this is
something that would appeal to an
organization that is so incompetent that
it has absolutely no chance of
delivering software now we think wow
after technical excellence of good
design absolute death sounds break I
want that build projects around
motivated individuals right so there are
some organizations that have never seen
a motivated individual everyone here is
motivated by definition while you're at
a conference so we see motivated
individuals we see this and think how
bizarre right but there are
organizations where this is actually a
novel idea working software is the
primary measure of progress there are
organizations that would measure
progress by these I documentation most
of us here would reject that so there's
a sort of set of common sense principles
at nama I'm taking a little bit of a
shot at agile so I'm going to give them
again from their props so taking a bit
of a shot here but a gel is really a
methodology that is corporate facing
what I'm talking about has absolutely no
chance of making money I'm not going to
be a consultant to services around this
is fun I'm just having fun here so
please don't tell me softwares biology
is focus on the mechanics of a solution
to understand how nature solves problems
I'm towing design solutions use damaged
biology to inform inspire and confirm
our ideas of software construction this
is all this is it like religious dogma
and I'm putting forth so I'm not trying
to start some new movement here this
should be fun we should go to go pick up
a book on some completely unrelated
topic read about it sail this is really
interesting now I'm going to actually
share this with my colleagues and maybe
we can tinker and draw some inspiration
from it or my goodness this actually
resembles what we do how interesting is
that so it's just a mental model nothing
more we don't want religious dogma we
reject that biology rejects that so
speciation is an example right so we use
natural selection is kind of a big mad
at example but speciation is a very
interesting thing in the fossil record
we can see what appears to be
revolutionary steps classic Darwinian
evolution talks about only small
incremental changes there is no big
change in a classic Darwinian sense the
fossil record suggests otherwise and
suggest that there may be an occasion
where where evolution is very very fast
and creates revolutionary change so the
question becomes in my application of
this software you know can we lever for
revolution well let's look at this olin
over closely this is called punctuated
equilibria and it's generally not in
vogue right now there's a lot of
evidence against it one explanation
where you can see these differences in
the fossil record is this allopatric
speciation is basically geographically
driven speciation very common way for an
organism to become two species or
multiple species so here's what happens
we have a lizard or a tadpole or
whatever that is and it starts as a
single population at the top and then
moves south and it's split by a river or
cows and or something on Mount chain on
the left side is one ecosystem on the
right side as a notary ecosystem they're
isolated they can't interbreed each side
has a different set of evolutionary
pressures let's say on the right side
fruit is just out of reach the seeds or
whatever these things eat and so getting
a little bit wedding in between the toes
will help the lizard to fly a little bit
further and they start to use the air
but over this this either is no such
pressure so it doesn't achieve this sort
of webbing sort of flight capability are
they evolved independently and here we
come to the bottom and we have this
problem can these things interbreed if
they have diverged genetically they
can't two different species but let's
say we see some fossils down here after
they've come together we might be
inclined to think wow there's some
magical power in nature that takes this
lizard and gives it the power of soaring
of gliding when in fact what we saw was
pure evolutionary incremental change but
we're tempted to think that is
revolutionary that's biology let's apply
to google maps not biology now boom at
google just released an update to Google
Maps I don't know
ago and I counted the changes out of
curiosity in my opinion in the opinion
of all people I know every single change
that they made was data it is
universally a terrible terrible change
it was a revolutionary change now if
somebody had consulted with Google and
said look allopatric speciation let's
consider your options here we have
something like this we start with what
I'm going to call the works perfectly
fine version of the loom at all that the
WPF version for short we have an
ecosystem that's being driven by perhaps
consultants perhaps Google some sort of
VP within google says we need to
revolutionize our interface and we have
this sort of frenetic change and we got
to change everything here to make it
better and that's this ecosystem over
here and it has a separate set of
evolutionary pressures up here the north
we have normalcy people like me people
like you who says you know this is great
oh I want our bug fixes make it faster
small future changes and we let these
systems evolve as they will we don't
think about combining a coordinating we
let them separately evolved differently
the speciation the geographically
separated they have different
evolutionary pressures we allow this to
run now at a certain point these may
emerge and then we can reason about now
have these diverts genetically are they
different applications or are they
similar enough that perhaps we can merge
them though it as we can interbreed now
this is a this is an option that Google
doesn't have at this point and I don't
have and I'm very angry about that I
think that I should have a version of
the works perfectly flat version on my
phone but I don't so this is an example
of a biological function of something
that we can observe it's very successful
in promoting good healthy design
solutions I thought we could applied
software so again the example of biology
as a model appliance software now I
don't know if we go around long as
allopatric speciation that's kind of a
big term may we come up with something
frankly people do this anyway so for a
lot of software developers this is a rly
strategy that is already drunk use an
example of that fork you know and you
worry about things as they come if you
need to merge the labor
but if they're independent that's fine
too stable versions versus you know we
do this this is an example in this case
of perhaps confirming some practices or
reinforcing something to say well we're
going to do this on a get-go so I think
it's useful next topic is such who here
is nervous about the next slide you
slightly nervous there's very nervous
okay so this is interesting you know all
so this is this is the case I could use
this the step of language I would not
have done that in the state's arrested
for that kind of thing but it's
interesting that all complex life almost
all I mean the great big critic majority
are sexually reproducing it's very very
interesting because of course cloning is
an option so here we have cloning we
just talked about cloning so if you want
the best basketball team ever who here
doesn't know michel jarre just I mean
I'm from the states it's good it doesn't
never just just checking I want to be
like so focused on the United States
everyone is my country way basketball
player perhaps the greatest of all time
if you want to create the best
basketball team ever you clone Michael
Jordan Michael George children can't
play basketball they're terrible at
right so nature created the best
basketball player ever and if we were to
use sexual reproduction to take that
genetic code to create our basketball
team we would obliterate that perfect
design right so it makes more sense to
create a clone of Michael Jordan and
then that is our best part of our math
that is our dream team of dream teams
right so that's one cost of sexual
regression we take something that is
proven to be the best to be beautiful
and working and we shuffle that code up
and that individuals lost for all time
there's never going to be another
specific Michael Jordan or maybe other
good basketball players but that is one
individual who we will never see again
playing basketball at that level this
particular variant but if we were to
clone we would so there's a huge cost
and losing optimization when we talk
about sexual reproduction here's another
cost these ridiculous displays of
plumage for potential mates think of the
energy that is spent you know all by
different species
putting together display is to impress
maids to reproduce that is expensive it
is time consuming it costs money dance
lessons obviously all sorts of things
that we spend and invest in so that we
can reproduce it's costly and then
there's of course this terrible cost for
some and we'll just call it flees for
lack of a better term believe me there
are some slides here that would better
be not appropriate so this is another
this is there's a whole ecosystem of
predatory parasitic viral organisms that
take advantage of this particular
function of species so if you had all
these things up you say well why on
earth aren't you Chloe cloning should be
the go-to as we can get the best and it
doesn't cost as much well here's the
here's the problem problem scope cloning
is it destroys variation this is a
process of meiosis again I'm not a
scientist I took this I stole this and
shamelessly using it but basically we
have two genomes one from a mother one
from the father and to create peak the
sex sells gametes we have this process
and some of these will end up with sperm
and eggs and when these combined they
will fertilize and that will become the
genome of the fuse and I'll become the
genome of the new individual but it's a
reshuffling it's a ram essentially the
random reshuffling so sex takes
something that has proven good or bad
and it changed it here's the advantage
of sexual reproduction it preserves
variation so here's an example of you
know 2 by 2 matrix of fruit flies one
has curly wings the other has slid eis
and here are the permutations of the
parents so you can see the different
permutations that are if you clone you
remove variation right if you clone in
this you don't get the big eyes if you
clone this and you don't get the
trolling wings you get the idea so one
particular individual can override an
entire population through through a
cloning process sexual reproduction
preserves that variation so why is that
useful well who knows what you know what
this particular design change is good
for maybe it's useful maybe it's bad but
having variation allows us to select if
we don't have a variation
select so how do we apply that to
software let's somewhat straightforward
we invest in heterogeneity we invest in
variation how many people actually will
would take a good solution a working
solution and deliberately dismantle it
in order to in order to introduce
variation I certainly wouldn't somebody
would it's counterintuitive there are
some people who do this by a share
Mahesh is key we've had numerous
discussions about that to keep this as a
philosophy of his a managerial and temp
and technical levels it's
counterintuitive it's very difficult but
if Nature has anything to tell us not
only is this useful it's essential most
of the clothing species are new but
almost all new and it's believed that
they're doomed to extinction if we don't
have variation in our technical
environment that technical environment
will eventually die away it may be
useful in a short term bit of a long
term it will perish so this is a
counterintuitive surprise that we get
from nature it's an interesting
application I think all right we talked
about sex than we have to talk about
data so death is very interesting so
specifically when you're going to be
talking about again I'm not a life
scientists just did you know I don't
know I can barely pronounce this word I
had actually consult somebody to how do
you pronounce is that Abbott OSIS so
this is program selling very interesting
mechanism death in this case is not from
from the outside it's not like something
goes and kills the cell there's a
program inside the cell that is very
specific to kill the cell programmed
cell death it's a deliberate death
mechanism that all of our cells have its
built-in if we didn't have it we would
not be having this conversation death is
an integral and necessary part of life
if we didn't have programmed cell death
we wouldn't have a whole slew of
functions with a simple anecdote would
be we'd have run away cell growth which
pushes cancer so you know we avoid
cancer by having cells died and
in this very moment all of ourselves our
portion of our bodies are dying and
being regenerated if this process didn't
exist life wouldn't exist the reason
exists is that there are things that
functionally cells can get in the way of
and cells can become seconds themselves
can become defective and when there is a
sickness and a defection of some type
and there's many many many variants of
how cell death is triggered but when it
is detected and triggered the cell
basically self-destructs how do we apply
that to software very easily you use
early just heard about early so Erlang
is programmed cell death early has a
very very clearly defined assertive non
defensive mechanism as you say if
something doesn't fit die so in this
case okay values of shape just think of
it as a shape it's a form of an
assertion and if we got a result from do
something and didn't conform to that
shape that wasn't okay that was bad boom
we die now our laying is designed much
like an organism with these individual
cells these are processes so the process
dies but the colonel this could be the
super system the organism still goes on
and we have other cells that are
perfectly happy and what that leads to
is a systems view to building software
so rather than having monolithic things
we have small things that are there
together so things can die freely and
come back again program cell death rhian
Stan Shih nation you could call it cell
replication now perhaps we know better
because we're designing effective
systems but it should be no surprise
perhaps that optimal operating systems
work like this all of them have Turtles
with separate process most of them most
of them throwing the ones that we use
general-purpose operating systems are
designed this way so it's interesting
that nature has built the same way so
this again informs and helps
understand perhaps think about you know
do we want to build a system where we
can't afford to lose anything the
answers clearly know if biology has
anything to say about it we have to
build a system that can survive the
death of a particular unit cell or
organism or an individual and if we're
not doing that ultimately we're not
building survivable citizens possibly
again it's not dawdlin but let's let's
look at how this sick something remember
the the fantastic display of success
through this through through the species
should we take a little bit of
inspiration from that it turns out
there's a whole area most of us in this
conference are interested in distributed
systems like this so let's take some
comfort in knowing that we're doing
things that resulted in us it's very
good okay this is my probably fate most
favorite example because it's very
simple and it's very cool to talk about
this is the coelacanth believed to be
extinct you know found fossils 350
million year old fossils and somebody
discovers a living or individual my
goodness this is not an extinct creature
but it looks like it probably should be
extinct I mean it is a fugly ugly sort
of dastardly looking old fish it is our
date and its legacy it's weeks PHP and
Perl you kind of get where I'm going out
here we tend to have moral judgment
about currency because we like new we
like young because we fresh nubile
reproductive specie and individuals we
take dance lessons and this is sort of
in forms are thinking about technology
it should be young it should be fresh it
should be hip I'm sure it certainly
should not be 300 million years old but
the fact is that the real hard reality
is that this thing actually exists and
somehow managed to program like survive
its original and early programming why
how simple there was no evolutionary
pressure to change if you in the system
that doesn't have evolutionary pressure
to change neither alone don't change it
call it a sila can't call it ugly call
it a living fossil celebrated
for as long Javits II don't go and
refactor don't make a change to a system
that doesn't have to be made cuz they
that doesn't happen in nature as an
interesting fact about amoeba amoeba the
genome of an amoeba is 220 times larger
than our owner genome write the number
of the number of genes 220 times larger
than a human so what can we infer from
that well there's a lot of crap in an
amigo the meat was don't care they're
happy they you know run around as you
know organisms and do their thing I
don't know I'm not a life scientist I
don't know what I mean I know I'm not
supposed to have one in my stomach
that's that much I know so I used to
think you know you know talking about
sort of the classic interview question
you know what is the problem software
today I literally said I answered this
is one of my answers I said promise
offer today is is people are afraid to
refactor and I believed that then
studying this stuff has changed my point
of view I don't believe refactoring has
any practical application if there's
evolutionary change to cause something
to to evolve fine but to go into
something because you think it's ugly
and you think it needs to be modernized
for no other reason is dumb just dumped
in a coelacanth says it's tough he says
you're being done look at me so we can
say anything our design meetings when
somebody says you know let's go refactor
this thing because this is fugly sila
can't that's a discussion you know this
thing is so successful you're going to
argue with this guy I wouldn't argue
with him all right we could go on and on
and on this is literally an endless
supply of amazing inspirational examples
mitochondria so here we have this this
absorption of a cell and another cell
and we'll also we have this this engine
for complex life and it drives you know
a huge array of functionality and
features in complex life right so this
is symbiosis that can result in
significant leap sleeves like pipelining
Right you have more good functional
decompositional design where you have
thing
are very separate and focused and you
can combine them if we went back to the
Z scheme of photosynthesis there were
two parts are the n shaved two mountains
both of those parts can operate
independently of one another perfectly
happy and fine and that in fact they do
so the theory of that is that an
organism adopted both as features and it
was existed in the same organism in
different contexts and I'm mutation
resulted in both of those systems coming
on at the same time and they naturally
combined and that organism was
successful and there we have
photosynthesis at least the first part
with the live phase so we can look to in
large monotonic complex things are very
difficult to bolt on small things that
have well-defined interfaces are easier
to sew mitochondria might be an example
for that we talked about the amoeba junk
DNA don't refactor adaptive immune
system so this is an area that is
extraordinarily complex and interesting
and I don't think it's it's necessarily
automatically applied or easily applied
but you know what does an adaptive
immune system have to say about unit
testing right finding defects and
software right that's a that's a bill
time compile time test monitoring but
what about production monitoring what is
an adaptive immune system how does that
work things are tagged you know with
with not a life scientist very
complicated stuff I don't know how it
works they get a cold it goes away it's
fantastic so understanding that i can
certainly inform a whole array of
interesting discussions about unit
testing quality testing ferreting out
and fixing bugs etc nervous system
message passing i mean if there's no
shared memory in our state right
everything is distributed there is no
ram here it's all you know there's best
passing you the molecular leader
electronically through tissue so you
know understanding how that works
understanding how my you know brain here
is processing and causing you know stuff
to go this is a very very complex in
sophisticated system we be envious of
any being able to architects
yeah so can we learn more about from
them so you're some lessons that I think
are safe to say based on what I've seen
so this is very high level without
selection you cannot make progress you
have to be able to choose as Paul
dollars quote right the genius the
process of invention consists of
generating options and then choosing you
cannot choose you cannot make progress
without this process of selection is no
forward progress is all stasis
ethological not make sure the stock
should not be controversial without
variation you cannot have selection
right you don't have a and B if you
can't select something if you don't have
a and B so there should be in everyone's
mind right now this notion of the valley
of st and variation for the sake of
variation now for the sake of your own
notion of utility or vision or genius
this is what nature tells us so e4 of
invest in verse etc finally the large
changed is generally bad this is
something if I can sleeve this with
everybody this is this is so true large
changes bad let me just use a quick as a
time to use i took this happen if they
got have time it's a really really good
example of this particular point by HHA
fisher today their agent life scientist
i'm just going to go back to that every
time anyway the analogy is this the
examples that you know microscope right
the microscope is in focus generally it
could be better but it's in focus the
microsoft the microscope illustrates
working software working software is
generally in focus pretty much it's not
perfect it could be improved but it's
pretty much info because now this is
what this is what he says he says any
large change will almost certainly make
any large change in a focal length they
adjusted the focus of that microscope
will worsen the focus will make it less
clear any large change right so it's
pretty much a focus and you crank it up
this way gonna be out of focus crank it
down this way it's going to be out of
focus you have nearly one hundred
percent chance of messing it up but a
very very very small just as small as
possible change
you can make has a roughly one-half
chance of improving so you go from
virtually impossible to 5050 5050 isn't
good for a lot of managers but it's
almost infinitely better than impossible
roughly so it's the choice that you
should make and indeed the classic
Darwin Darwin a model of extraordinarily
small change incremental is a dominant
view is the view that was the most
evidence the most is generally supported
and is generally accepted you are not
seeing arguments anymore about radical
improvements to nature so can we simply
can we just agree on that please the art
chain is bad if we just say yes and I
just know it's going to take some time
try try try small change see just think
think of is just as an experiment see
what happens okay so let's just review
here what is the point really all this
stuff is kind of a bit of a muddle a
large grandiose vision of applying
biological functions the software so
what is this we go from this thing which
is our protector of you you and mal
which nobody should ever use for think
about but we didn't right we should go
from that to thinking about software
this way we should use words like
ecosystem we should use words like
organism and species and individuals a
population speciation I think these are
very new terms that we can incorporate
and start to think about rotting log I
love this one rotting logs are terrible
but in this ecosystem a rotting log has
a huge value so we lose moral judgment
and we just look at things very you know
openly and observe and select we just
sit back and allow things to manifest
and then our genius can be applied and
what we choose and what we reject that's
the human function so to anticipate your
questions what should we read of course
these are some books that I think a very
very good of course the list is endless
practically speaking
but these are some books that I've read
that i found particularly well written
for non-scientists for popular
scientists science works and they're
very very well but brilliant people
obviously just a small example of things
that I personally have found to be good
with that we have time for questions
railings disagreements yeah you are
alone in the surf way of thinking but
maybe because you live in a context
where the software developed enough in
America and you have time to declare
that yeah and to work on it and develop
this idea this person the other thing I
think there is somebody who tried to put
biology in software but it is different
this is a few take it big as me being so
bad then Evanescence yes yes i want to
say what's it somebody say that is the
data hard shape and they try to make it
simple to carry cap okay so what do you
feel so yeah there's there's a bunch of
area so talk to us on computer earlier
about genetic algorithms and the idea
that we can apply a natural selective
algorithm to say sorting or natural
selection to sorting office it has been
shown to be actually work to me this is
this is this is completely different
from what i'm talking about the work
that our work is our work it's not we're
not trying to replicate the last three
and a half billion years of evolution in
a computer that's absurd we have the
most sophisticated result of this
process and we are leading the way so if
we deter
quicksort is a good algorithm that it's
a good algorithm that's that's the
universe doing that that's not you know
we should give ourselves credit for you
know for being a result of this
evolutionary function so I'm not talking
about playing sort of superficial
patterns of natural selection to solve
wrong I'm talking about us adopting
methodologies and patterns in particular
the one that I have a particular passion
for is this design problem because i
think it's just absolutely obvious the
more and more i look at this and the
more i use it that design is completely
retinas not necessary in fact it's
harmful so and that's a radical idea i
think but yet you know the evidence
would suggest is absolutely the fact is
it possible not design as an act but
more the short cutting of the decision
about the selection I'd like to use the
design because it's antagonistic I
recognize that there is a design process
but I liked it I liked to poke a little
bit there this is some value and being a
little bit radical of course there is
design work I'd rather to say there is
no desire to see what happens I think
you know if you really are discipline
and kicking design out of a process it's
remarkable to see what emerges from it
naturally and you can always go back and
say you know that was my idea whatever
yeah mation actually I'd actually played
it that's a meta-level you your design
is part of the evolution so you suck it
design well you don't but the person is
going to design itself so as you to get
fired so yeah I think this is I think
this is a fair point but I would go back
to Paul Valerie's which is you know the
genius isn't what you keep and what you
select so it's not to say that this is a
random functions far from Ren natural
selection has nothing to do the
randomness the variation in the options
have a randomness but the selection is
very deliberate it's very correlated
with with survival requirements so
somebody goes 50 or 20 years of
experience is going to have a better
idea of what choose option alized
frankly a better idea of laying out
options so the process is twofold where
were generating combinations and then
also selecting this of you as more
experience and insight will be better at
that so but I don't think that's a
design process I think that should be in
the realm natural select
and she should call something over the
design I think design for often than not
as bad yeah the nature picture was
really beautiful the late thing yeah I
remember and then on the fourth but if
you're making any kind of enterprise
let's say tell tell all right you want
to do a sip rosenbaum and you're just if
you do the biology thing you're always
hitting the wall always working around
stuff and then you end up in a huge mess
so building a bridge so who would build
a bridge here without a blueprint of
some type nobody you would have all
right always one person I'd like artists
radically yes throw the rope over yeah
let's throw the rope right and left it
evolved but of course if you let's say
you're affirmed the bill if you let you
have to actually deliver it with you
know trucks and stuff of course you use
design but this isn't design in the
sense of a soft look we're creating
completely new things so what I like the
way I like to think of this is that is
the configuration of an existing piece
of software so the flying back to
software right building a bridge is not
creating a new piece of software it's
taking engine X and configuring it it's
taking a blueprint of a type of solution
and tweaking it here and there but we
know we're going to have driving things
over to some people there's different
you know fundamental mechanisms of
supporting weight across the span etc
but we've been doing this for tens of
thousands of thousands of years building
bridges so we know how to do that
there's a particular process for that so
I'm not saying we burn all of our
blueprints this is really particularly
to define the fatigue lay applied to
software because software is so or truly
organic we're creating new life forms
now it's not a bridge it's something
never conceived of in the history of the
universe and we're all on the process of
that so if you're doing a bridge that is
like that is like a reproductive
organism it is a particular code and
then you have variations of that but we
are building aliens assess offer
programs
I was like the coverage
yeah and I'll just go back this isn't
dogma so general point was that people
do this by and large people apply
common-sense a good soft developers they
have actually find a way to get the
stuff down so these are more things to
inspire new ideas and confirm existing
ideas and maybe solidify some thinking
so it's not to overturn maybe we're term
some regimes but your startups and
efficient programming process is
generally follow you know things that
work tend to be similar sofas oh yeah
what is this when we come out to the
bridge analogy and you're saying in that
case we typically rely on blueprints but
I saw the say bridge was a new thing
because you say so where the writing
january's never been written before so
I'm emerging a situation where you've
got a nice across a ravine they've got
tanks and trucks and all the rest it and
I just wondering because I'm still
curious about what you're saying about
no design design is bad I'm wondering if
you could illustrate what you mean by
design in that in that contest cuz I
can't imagine you mean the thousand
people he's trying to make their own way
here's an example so stay here cheers up
here so Joan you know we drew our
building of a unique type of bridge or
something that's innovative and you need
to fears I think the problem that I see
the design process is and this is just a
sort of practical application of you
know you're in a room you've got a bunch
of people and they're all have their
vision and they all have plumbed on and
all of a sudden you've got Frankenstein
and you've got if you're going to use
the military as an example right that's
a really good example for my point
because the military generally creates
these things Chris things are absurd
they cost a lot of money and they don't
work they don't do anything well I try
to do everything well you've got a
single
fighter for the for the Navy you know
trillions upon trillions of dollars
invested in this thing and then it gets
decommission I don't know what the
actual story I'm making this up it
probably he probably happens oh it's on
so yeah you got these are examples of
where you have design heavy processes
resulted nothing good but if you had
something that evolved and was selected
through actual pressure to change you
can have very laser-focused solutions
and the army does as well that's not
really the analogy I was trying to focus
on but rather as a company or whatever
there is a specific thing that you have
to achieve need to make a market window
he needs cross this domain you've got a
bunch of people educate you've got a
particular thing you have to achieve now
I'm just any image like in heaven my
mind we say no design is that we just
tell everybody right somehow get
everything across this room that's what
we have 20 she know and I can't see that
happening as a so bunch of individuals
so I'm out of time 5 minutes ago to let
me see what if I can do this as fast as
possible nobody's going to say let's
flail randomly nobody's none of us are
going to do that we're going to
deliberately come up with intelligent
options but to say there's one options
that we're going to take is silly what
we should do is work we should labour at
creating options for ourselves and all
the smart people get in a room and they
say you know here's an option or here's
a crazy thing or now we're generating
options and they don't have to be
brilliant they don't have to be the
genius we can all sort of modestly and
humbly put forth stupid ideas and we
have a smattering of stupid ideas now
the same sort people the room say okay I
like this about this this is a good
option this is a good option this is
natural selection and this is a function
of a human this isn't deviating from
nature we are nature this is how we
evolve so we're simply taking the
mechanisms that enable this conversation
to happen right now mechanically right
all the stuff that's going on or apply
that to our work are the extension
another level of abstraction of the
things that human beings do again just
nature biology the universe there's no
God force here putting forth the great
revolutionary big right through okay I'm
sorry a lot of time so i got i think
with a break here so i'm looking to talk
up here thank you very much
