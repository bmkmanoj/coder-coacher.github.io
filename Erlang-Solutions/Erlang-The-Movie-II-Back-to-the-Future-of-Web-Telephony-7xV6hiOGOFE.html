picture from Salvador Dali basically i
think is a toss-up but sometimes leaves
all right this color phone become looks
like telephone but not quite what
embarrassed it is the Alliance video
library and video is basically an online
aircraft that's left knee and it allows
you to very quickly build voice SMS
conference call all the standard sort
slapping things and so it's a pretty
straightforward api-based language and
is based around an XML small XML
language called terminal which just
consists of the usual xml l and it is a
pretty small language it's only really
got that six million birds some second
over some down so the saber will is a
robot call it say something the boys
playing will play an mp3 file gando is a
is an ideal collection so it's waiting
proof of end-user you get the calling
for transcription and you can send text
messages and then dial self-paced 3 now
you can either phone out phone numbers
you can phone to software clients you
can creates tension and also you can
dine at conferences so the language
itself is pretty small in this very well
designed and the idea is you simply
build web services to speak this that
then implement its left me I'm going to
run through the event cycle for
initiating around cause there's
different cycles for you on a nap
they're basically opposite the brown was
a first of all makes a request to the
server I asked you to give what's called
a capability which is a crafty site
token but in the case the client has
basically has the authority from you to
make a transaction 30 which will incur a
charge because it's about consistency it
tows the browser back and it's typically
a tiny site lying so they recommend you
trying to have maybe like five seconds
or some things we start throwing up
against a client men I can initiate the
call client then says I am this client
and I have this capability or twilio and
Trillium comes back to you with a HTTP
POST or GERD and you get you can pass a
total around that side for youth event
check-ins genuine and then you lesbian
twin all set all right and a call that
happens and it's a multi-stage that they
have Spain machine Aldo which is doing
stuff and so they will send you messages
as the state of the chord changes so if
you've asked for recording they will
send you back up and a student posting
record before his URL or also they do a
voice to text transcription service as
well below the intermediate things but
they send you stuff back and forward we
have to film okay so that's kind of the
kind of cycle one and there are
somethings about assistive pain in the
arse basically the the stuff they posts
use is quite the events they post you're
quite rich we basically get big chunky
chunks and this sort of stuff of the key
value pairs that just vomit into your
browser
understand and then of course you blow
it up then invited and also it's big
message workers so the first thing we
did with with trying to make it work
like was writer write a parcel it tastes
oh yeah they've also involved in the
whole all I ERP is a bit of pain so
it'll help your user and as they the
computer so somebody phones on your
website wants to do something you then
respond to them but it's you know a
voice they press 1 for X into the wine
and you get a response back and all
that's when negotiating Spain cheese is
the pain so we want to make that symptom
as well so the first thing we did was
really was right a parcel that just
turns all rat great blog posts or gets
into a struggling record so we have a
record that displays the call and as a
whole series of sub records that
indicate estates when you pass rushing
and then so this caused field in the
representative call us a dreadful it
just makes it really easy to then right
that's imagine so it makes issues wrong
going to plan through 40 or 50 sets of
key value pairs because you don't
usually want operator or more Australia
Ville and what we also going to take the
eternal which the X and understood like
this and turn it into simpler language
so all the attributes XML can have you
just turned to records and up and then
you can start operating on nest in this
direction so that's pretty
straightforward and what we have a
number design goals / twilio XML through
what I want to do is make trim all be a
runtime executable line
validation see right snippets of
expected in our land n mullins many
programs so he wants to be when your
dynamic but also you want to be more to
the validator so you want what you want
to check this for the work at compile
time and then make sure and then
assemble a call that you want my mom a
bit on fire and also if in pokemon x 0
or run and it has to be really really
simple to use debugging telephony
systems pain because you you have to
observe in the counter doing it if we
connect a reversal because they need the
totally immersive torture server and the
other things anyone is ever that credit
column know is very very easy to create
I the arteries that navigators we want
to go and complete or unusable and all
that's what's up see when you compile
into an artery that human beings would
have come to you want to make sure that
it's going to work and you want to do
that don't do that compile the time but
you cannot compile the language to an
IVR it's useless for human being will
eliminate that that section of that and
we'll see later I'll often build a call
center i'll show you why it's always
strong constraints on on on the
simplicity what one of the problems the
way is the risk that the first round to
the other language Ryan may was just
like all the other
clients and 20 has built the presumption
that you will send the state machine in
URLs so you'll have some endpoints with
state Wednesday Tuesday too many URLs
underneath it and when you do something
you'll send that to 20 oh the ex URL to
talk to thrust a machine the problem is
it's really you can either generate that
dynamically but it can really make all
interaction metal you not to step
through the laws and kind of workout
wasn't talking to was it stay one before
isn't state in there and it's real real
pain in the ass do so I'll eliminate
that and we basically cover by having
the wrong time state machine items
attilio to talk the same URL real time
and I will know what state I'm supposed
to be in and I will know what I response
emitting from twilio about telling it to
tell me I want to tell twilio to go
somewhere which I will represent my
space just like speaking normal so the
first part will essas simply set of
records that deal with the twilio xml
and then when work including other
things we simply have a body feels %
takes over to the airport so that's
designed by twilio the structure of
actually important term also this design
much video to talk to them and to get a
one time we need to be able to have
additional extended records that
and also act as a flow control in this
language so the first thing we do is is
the gander bottom to the eye dr extend
that to have a couple of things i give
it a vaulting command so we can say once
you've collected this stuff and execute
so i can say if you you know I'll ste
used to press 123 once they press
through a press 1 X 2 days of the press
to let's do that so I then can extend
that to that talks back to line and i
also have an auto menu option which
means it will read them sponsors and
then generate a menu that correctly
describes them so if your sponsors are
press 11 12 and 13 it will generate a
venue that has pressed 11 for the name
of response as 211 and it won't compile
if you have 11 12 and 113 it won't
compile that because you know where user
to enter that mckean part so that
guarantees that your idea i was saying
and if you use that'll generate a menu
that will describe every item on the
menu and knocking out and we put a
couple of man's in here we've got a
response and a default now and that
those bird just contains with the
Earth's like and then push into my
gutter ball he like a bush in what to do
when i say press one for something
accomplishing what I wanted to do so
these these like speedrunning I have
another replica function which basis
says call module the call this function
is module with a standard signature and
that allows and the functioning calls
some valid extended to promote so that
allows me to go the chain loader that
will then load up you knew actions
dynamically so I can assemble I call
banality on the fly and I finally I have
a popular book but it will go to baggage
yes and these announcers allow them to
both control limiting inside line my
expansion so this is a pretty
straightforward small of a boring IDL
system which I that example so I've
generate an envelope with overview
spawns and then I assembly into an eye
dr s what i'm saying is i want an IVR
system what I'm going to do so generate
an auto menu which will say autumn enemy
will be generated from the respondents
base older and they press one full bird
both being the title of that exponent
having said that and then play its own
body which is the first to bourbon a
pleasant run file and then when you
press one it will actually if you press
one it'll give this policy if you don't
press one it will repeat it will not be
repeated well just so they're cool and
then you just profile at the bottom and
that will generate a able to find which
can execute on language I have three
separate compilation offers like by the
component
I can compare to a ski like an planetary
to another sounds bizarre but there's a
reason why I want to do that I'll show
you one later later on it when i get is
basically a text file that describes a
human-readable fashion what's going to
happen when you found the website so
you're learning to throw not Nonis
debugger if it's guaranteed to work and
you can then work through that little
finger Aidan savor it will play any file
it will then save press one of the burgh
wait you do that if you press that it
will then execute that and hang up if it
doesn't it'll never be going I just
intend to be big to the idea is that the
end user can then do this compiler most
a time ago I understand the persistent
without undergoing attach to Buster this
is the this is a staging
representational bit essentially what it
doesn't stain machine it just goes it
continued going to hit it continues su
de lyon place online where it's expected
to ways or exit and it just just leads
to that and its end video turn them out
to twilio it all kind of happens there's
one other thing you can do with the
wrong time as well you can also or a
number of events like I proceeded
building other seeds transcription falls
over and you can also attach those
events if you want to do something
processing that with the logging
typically attach a more intimate
time for state law all these actions and
customer so i'll just do is undo some
quick simple stuff as this is patient
company and unable tenderfoes up so we
kind of don't look like those
spreadsheets so i love you now just all
small call center that's kind of thing
you can do
so
this yesterday as I possibly do that I
used to posed to have but
ok
so kind of you know kind of pretty much
any worse um one way to boma trying to
build up inbound calls being up to
target user them's been built lefty
systems it is precious but I know
technicalities well know that you don't
in this development environment you
everything happens in the spreadsheet so
you'll lay out your debugger your
graphics your business there your
database I've got a punchable back huge
provisions of website we cluster or
generates control to that so everything
it's exactly same foot pump yourself so
you are very limited capability to
interact the system so to build the
inbound stuff be using these skill to do
stuff like I basically wrap all those
are
Oh
okay here's a couple things so I've got
there's a function menu say which takes
text and then there's another city so i
really i really dislike the ball but the
cup finals are weaklings hospices games
into equities and i was supposed to be a
heart span when I was at school in
seventies and George best played but
honey was past his best and play for
heads and 70s me to sing George the best
super scholars who wears a bra so
appropriate to have websites singing our
table highness boss stuff even
essentially you see that you see the
issue that the user is building it these
functions here that we're putting in a
simple wrap around those records and the
end user can then build a a telephone
menu where they can understand what the
websites going to do simply by reading
it reading state machine that freedom
understand what was going to happen the
earliest is she going to make it really
simple and we we will come to the
undercovers here this is the decision of
here
this is from the this is this is recipes
to do things inside 20 other lights if
you download in and set up it will
randomly when you ring it begins if you
install it from github going to trail
getting application fees minute eh LOL
file it will then when you find the non
of it and then we'll pick one of egress
be plan and what you can do is I say
just simply get the recipes to do stuff
is simply to do mr. freckles correctly
what one of the things that makes it
real pleasure to the debugger you know
American English is very a youth mystics
and tend to soften things worse in
Scotland we're a very common mistake so
we tend to swell on and so what you do
then is is set up loads of texts that
robot calls the test which swear at you
and then change the voice that they
spare you the pledge female accent in
sort of only multi-sport which is when
you're coding late at night bacteria so
if you want to be insulted in a variety
of strange languages this we're doing
for you and then under recipes and do
things like you know play some files
halls this will redirect phone call
somebody else's number conference Paul's
answering machine your pet ones my VR
say some nice things to you as well and
I'm just in Sony we praise your words
hose up and then on the bottom start
test that calling and the idea is madden
but one not all of this most business
into the early enough in the spreadsheet
but the next phase is then build a set
of functions which they make amends
expand their conference
standard standard standard and then
start sending more competitors to
multiply but they're all quest reporters
interface are just a central and if you
look at how we actually do under the
covers so that phone number the function
phone menu number here is just a bit of
our type check because in stretching
Shelton the costing was very on the
function call and then that's my trouble
business with the line so it really is a
very very slim layer on top of a long
time and I've got some hot the official
acts up to 180 spreadsheet maple appear
so the system is actually very simple
differences but these were they were
managed to slip some very very
nourishing if you want to go with it
twilio stop very high priest or a
proclamation the language someone fish
enlivened as well as they stop saving up
for the balance for Levin it which is
pretty good stuff and now with extended
reminisce shouldn't
questions
so the question is how does it cost to
use it okay so all rights we connected
speech and I'm prize protect on the
screen and it's give me prices food so
that's it it's kind of yeah it's pretty
cheap but you can defend what you want
to do you can either deploy it to
customers but they have a trivial
counter making top up on your
application using arrow County you can
delegate loans for it to delegate the
cost to the customer or you can resell
that so one of the things that rhythm be
doing is buying calls at 1772 times to
customers and that means you you get
together increasing revenue streams
applications but it's not like numbers
ticketing international conference
so now we get a bit odd regard to how
does the conference call ATT type of
quality converse to skype or our
services anything this voice at right
there in tonight is going to the same
voltage to subscribe to something and
the good thing that we get you well so i
shall show you a favor call center in it
we visit frequently one just in
spreadsheets unfortunately i'm as that
both of us got all log system which how
to the report in which you can't get a
sky
is it using a browser plugin let's live
or easy yeah it uses the 2000 truly a
JavaScript client just fine
so it's not an enormous become kept iron
basically I I pass up capability which
is in this in this just when i load the
stock client I asked the backend for a
capable to cope and I pass it out and
all they have to do is make I get a
trillion device javascript class which I
just I just include on page and I said
think the number of set up the way down
an acceptable and i canna and i haven't
of course yeah i set up set parameters
here and when I'm ready I'll just
connect which we have a vitamin I'm
ready to go and I'm busy I totally
thought and then I have another call
back so i will call coming in which I
can accept I've got a connect thing
which i used to make this offering show
that i'm on call and say this connects
wife I just got some jobs and hopes but
the actual medium of them actually post
much
in an hour one we're going to unfold in
the specified generate code generator
youth web page and then push the person
who answers the call browser to open up
I one question the lizard to botany Boyz
II to public school media video excited
for
so thank you government for your soul is
