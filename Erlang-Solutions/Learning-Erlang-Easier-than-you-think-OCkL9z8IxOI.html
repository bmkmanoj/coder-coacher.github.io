solutions monthly webinar
my name is Maude amil-e-shaitan I'm the
solutions director here at erlang
solutions today's webinar represents a
continuation of a series of webinars we
are organizing across topics of interest
in the world of airline and dealing with
solutions based on the airline
programming language
our topic today will be dealing with
learning Erlang and the fact that
achieving this might be easier than you
think
over the years experience has shown our
language is a language that is easy to
learn pick up and start using this fact
has indeed been one of the major causes
of the explosive expansion of Erlanger
cross industries and sectors where it
can make a significant contribution for
example financial services betting and
gambling online telecommunications
energy and many other sectors in terms
of learning Erlang perhaps the biggest
challenge in that process lies in
changing the way we think now as with
any live event please excuse any
technical issues we may encounter today
to start by telling you a bit about
erlang solutions we are a products in
services orientated company completely
devoted to the airline programming
language since our founding in 1999 we
have worked with organizations and
individuals using Erlang helping evolve
the language and supporting people and
businesses using it today we have about
80 people across our offices in London
Stockholm Krakow and Budapest and
working on projects across the globe we
are very keen on creating value and
competitive advantage for our customers
across industries and through the unique
features and characteristics of our
language a language we are ambitious in
development of allowing based products
and we work to create lasting
partnerships with our customers now I'm
pleased to say that today we have two
speakers joining us and who we have
carefully selected as best invited to
tell you about Erlang and the optimal
ways of learning the language thus the
world Francesco Cesare needi erlang
solutions founder and technical officer
will start us off Francesco has spent
years working with Erlang and passing on
knowledge of Erlang to others across
sectors in dealing with continuously
evolving use cases
I'm also very privileged to say that our
second speaker who needs little
introduction is
Robert birding one of the co-authors of
the Erlang language Robert started
hurling itself all those years ago and
today devotes himself to helping others
learn along and benefit from the
language please allow me to finish by
saying you are welcome to post questions
throughout the duration of the webinar
by using the chat facility our speakers
Francesco and Robert will answer as many
questions as time allows at the end of
the webinar if any questions do go
unanswered you are welcome to raise them
by email using the following the dress
webinar at Erlang - solutions.com debts
webinar at Erlang - solutions comm if
you are interested in learning more
about Erlang goal we should establish
whether the language might be a solution
for the challenges your own business may
be facing please feel free to contact me
directly my email address will be
displayed in one of the final slides of
the presentation we will share with you
today the same goes for any other
questions you may have
feel free to contact us I would now like
to hand over to Francesco Cesare Niko
would be glad to start us off hi Jerry I
think we should just start robbing I
should start introducing ourselves I'm
for Jessica serene the founder technical
director here telling solutions and
started my career at the computer
science lab with Robert and other
airline competitors back in 1995 and you
know it was your at Eric's and at Eric's
training consulting arm what I taught my
first ionic course in Research Triangle
Park is in 1997 I still remember it
clearly and loved it and you never look
back you've been giving training courses
ever since and on top of giving your
training courses three or four
corporates I've also been teaching at
two universities I've taught for ten
years at the University of Gothenburg
we've had over 700 students and many of
them who've ended up working for any
solutions and well glad to say Rob has
taken over there and more recently I'm
teaching at industrial master's program
at Oxford University here in the UK
Robert yeah I'm from adverting so yes
I'm one of the original people from the
computer science lab and we started
working with a tiny book sometime around
the late eighties Daisy I was one of the
original team that working there I
worked continually without long and
other things as well for the computer
science lab through the 90s a group of
us left to form blue tail which is one
of the first countries to use a long in
products or fillers campus outside
Ericsson to do that
I've worked a bit for Swedish military
procurement and for the last three years
I've been working for our own solutions
now mainly with training but I could say
one thing I started training giving
courses at a line even before francesco
so sometime around 91 we in the lab
started giving courses in our line for
ericsson what was your first university
course you thought 92 or 93 I can't
remember that was the one whose leader
was on that was the one that was the one
of the yes we gave some courses dealing
with beyond addictive who was our boss
there at kth yeah that was 1992 yes
that's right at 900 yeah
when we knew young courses internally
before that as well - which were quite
fun because you actually ring telephones
and then during the course so there's
nothing gave a quick introduction about
any solutions but I think our focus is
very much less scalable for tolerant
systems and you were working from embed
it to cloud and you know supercomputers
and we're only comfort of this kind
completely focused on airline and online
community so no trouble giving courses
you've got events worldwide but one of
the real catalysts in the company Asia
love the rnd which which we do so you
know we're going to start off by
speaking a little bit about you know the
problem the Robert and his team were
facing at the computer science lab and
you know what probably they were trying
to solve and you know what the solution
to the problem was yeah because that
very much affects why Alan looks like it
does it's a very pragmatic very
pragmatic language so the basic problem
we had from Ericsson is that they had
as well I still have a telephone switch
called a XE which was a very good
product
Erikson's so what of it made a ton of
money on on it it was a very successful
product but it was quite costly and
difficult to maintain so one of the
things we got that from the lab was how
can we simplify
developing and maintaining these types
of applications that was a type of the
thing we're trying to attack in the in
the lab okay that weren't quite as bad
as that but nevermind yes they were
quite complex there's quite a big
application to do and how can we
simplify that and work with that and
okay what what type of applications are
these okay what is a telecoms
application and they have a number of
them what's the problem domain were
working they have a number of properties
these type of applications so for
example they are they have to be
massively concurrent if we're talking
about a telecom switch here we might
have hundreds of thousands of
subscribers may have tens of thousands
of calls going on at the same time all
these things must run independently they
have to be fault tolerant
they're not they're just not allowed to
fail to go down things like this you
need RIT so you need redundancy in the
system for example you cannot allow
things to fail you need distribution you
cannot build a fault-tolerant system
with on one computer that computer can
go down in the system all that out so
you need at least two computers some
people say at least three to make it
properly but you need at least two
computers either but they're done this
in the system so you need support for
distribution in the system at all times
you need fault tolerance you have to
accept the fact that in this complex
system like this things are going to go
wrong that's just there's no way around
it you always get things go wrong there
might be software is it might be
hardware
I think like this the classic telecoms
case is that someone digs up the
telephone lines and you get a dirge of
spurious messages coming in and there
might crash the system and the system
just bust just must not be a go down you
have to be able to detect errors you
have to be isolated errors and you have
to be able to clean up after errors
occur these these are typical types of
things going out for well there was a
more specific attack telecoms type
things you're talking to hardware and
stuff like this but otherwise here the
concept of time in the system you need
to be able to upgrade the system do all
forms upgrade in the system while the
system is right you cannot you cannot
take the system down say to do code
updates any support for incorrect rates
exists and there are many of these
features now the what what I find the
interesting thing is that these things
are not airline specific or non telecom
specific rather they they are typical of
many different types of applications you
will find today and rather I think many
applications they have these basic
requirements although sometimes they're
just not explicitly stated it's assumed
that this is just known present if you
have a lot of systems they will ask they
will say you asked yes you want to be
able to do things a lot of things in
government of course then they'll say of
course they do of course they will do
that but although they might have
explicitly specified so there are many
of these features so these these the
problem domain is very broad and very
interesting so Francesca you were yeah I
mean the problem domain was interesting
but also think I'd like just add to what
you've said at the same time there was a
lot happening in you know there was a
lot happening you had the whole
deregulation of the telecom markets and
at the same time you're going from kind
of vertical network single service
network to multi server
network so you know when you were
working in a voice was voice video your
cable TV just ran on cable TV networks
and Internet
it just ran on internet you know and
what we're also seeing was the whole
migration from you know this vertical
networks - you know services which would
share the same background and you know
thinking of it you know what what we've
described is not just telethon you know
but the requirements are the same you
pick up a phone you expect to hear a
tutu on the other end you check on
Facebook today you expect the chat just
to work out of the box you know you
click buy on Amazon if the last thing
you want is a 500 error yeah and so
you're the problem domain is not just
specific to telephones it's it's it's
used in it's your this types of systems
who are developing today which have
become yeah
which have become the web scale of this
engine now earning itself you know
verticals where Erina can be used here
it's not just help them you'll find
airline running in cars will find it
robbing run running robots just other
day there was a YouTube video of a drone
in being our airline where when the
Berlin was flying actually did a
software upgrade Airlines powering dip
the back end of some of the largest
massively multi-user online game love
the free free to play mobile games
mobile backends a lot of capital betting
and gambling sites are using it that's
the review and logic it's made its
entrance into healthcare in NHS spine in
the UK is based on react in Erlang at no
SQL database as a storage of all medical
records in Denmark you're seeing more
and more companies using it for online
ads actually it's easier to find
companies not using a hair like
permanence
you from your real-time bidding you're
serving the ads new media online
newspapers you're a great example is the
Huffington Post
so the Boston Globe's back-end is all
based on the airline online payments in
a clarinha you know we'll handle is
handling billions of euros and payments
every year and they're very crocks made
in about 30 percent of all online things
in Scandinavia go for an activity system
you know we could continue instant
messaging logistics acceptor etcetera
etcetera so you know there are lots and
lots of areas where all of the features
of telecom orbit has described fit in
okay so where do we come from this
studying looking at the problem domain
I'm trying to work out how we're going
to solve the problem we had or Ericsson
had one of the things to realize is that
the airline development has always been
extremely pragmatic our goal was to
solve the problem
our goal was not to choose a certain way
of doing it how again it's going to be
how we're going to do it and what we
arrive at the basic principles that a
language or a system would need to solve
this type you need like way concurrency
massive concurrent really has to be
asynchronous communication has to be a
massively scalable as well which means
you can't have shared a driver system
just a small scale you need a mutability
in this system just to keep track of
what's going on also you need fault
isolation need to be able to localize
contain faults and also you need the
primitives for doing what self-healing
to make the system get to keep keep
going and you keep handle when things go
wrong as they were always go we need to
support for continuous Emily
evolutionary system in this case dynamic
code upgrades and there are other things
as well too so it has a mother principle
we wanted a simple high-level language
to do this simple for many reasons one
is easier to to implement it's an easier
to learn if it's a language is simple
the problem with a simple language is to
get it right you want it simple in the
very few small number of basic
principles that you can build use
building more system you get these right
you'll get a language which can it's
very powerful
but it's still small it's easy to
comprehend it to you so this sense small
is very good
we also found which is in conjunction
with this that you should provide tools
for building the system not really made
solutions we found this out the hard way
often where we invited make solutions
for various problems one of them wrong
we've misinterpreted the problem with
things like this but often they become
too too too limited so tool becomes
either very specific in dealing with
that use or it gets very expose try and
contain everything do everything in the
system and becomes practical usable so
we wanted to keep things as simple
always so I mean it was a simple I mean
the result was a simple language I mean
if you think of it at the end of of the
three-day course the very first frida
courses were giving at Ericsson the
developers who on day one came in
without knowing any airline left having
programmed the softs which they actually
had phones yeah hardware they were
provided the hardware headphones which
allowed them to kneel upon each other
it was a great reaction a great
satisfaction which came out of it and
yeah little at the end of a three day
course you know most of the language and
the philosophy behind it it was built
here to be compact and to be taught in a
very very short time frame and for most
contrast is only one way here you can
solve a problem it's dynamically typed
that allows you to lots of flexibility
when you're doing software upgrade
during runtime so make sure your systems
never go down there are no user-defined
data types so once again adds to the
simplicity you've got a lot of your
built-in primitives for both concurrency
and error handling and I think you know
that's really where your some of the
spray
come in in airline with no shirt the
generalship memory approach and mid
message pricing approach and also you're
very you know one of the few languages
will only language I'm aware of which
has built-in primitives for distribution
so by doing it right you've got a
program running on a single machine you
can easily distribute across the cluster
machines with no or very very little
effort and what we usually say is you
can emulate the logic of airline by
building language isn't copying it but
at the same time it's not running on a
virtual machine it is very very hard to
emulate the semantics and you hear the
question we always ask this is why use
external libraries you've got no control
over when you can set use constructs
which are built in the language itself
so if you're teaching people or people
learning Allen where do they struggle
what are the major problems people have
when learning out and I'd say the two
main groups so sympathic Allen the
simple sequential language it says it's
a simple functional language there's
nothing really strange about for such
and the problems people have been
learning that part of the language is
what you typically get when you're
looking at functional languages if you
if your new tooth there are concepts of
things like you have immutable data in
the system you have immutable variables
you generally don't have looping
constructs but you have to use recursion
there's pattern matching which is a very
powerful tool but is a completely
different way of thinking things and
these are the typical standard and
standard things you'll get learning any
functional language the second group or
the second group of problems people have
is thinking concurrently seeing when
seeing in currency built into the
language that that is our way of
structuring assistant we don't think in
objects of thinking classes we think
processes the concurrency of the system
how they work how they interact with
each other so we don't have classes we
don't have objects with state we turn at
because we have a mutable data but we
use concurrency
assessors message-passing we don't have
any shared memory and these are things
which are new to many people but a
DiFrancesco mentioned it I can say from
personal experience after three days
people most people actually get it you
think they can do it and they can write
real code in the system and so yeah I
mean just to add here I mean why do
people struggle I mean recursion is not
something your typical to airline
recursion is one of the foundations of
computer science and everyone should
understand recursion immutable you know
data and variables you know prepare an
example here the next slide it's
actually the way we got taught to deal
with maths when we were you're studying
algebra in school you know when we're in
school they didn't teach you to write a
is equal to a plus one that doesn't make
sense and in fact you know everything
has taken a different approach they've
taken the approach of how we used to be
taught in school and it's you know B is
equal to a plus one where you know once
a is bound you cannot change its value
and your homes instead of calling a
variable we actually pull them
Singleton's
and you're doing it this way and I have
in single assignment of variables the
programmers are forced to write short
concise functions and you're by default
you'll get a smaller number of errors in
your code and it enforces a style which
makes the code easier to understand and
maintain and it's just a question of you
know of unlearning your some of the bad
habits people have not gotten in other
night using other languages and going
back to a more natural normal way of
thinking and reasoning yeah and when you
be looking if you don't look at will not
just telling but I thought many other
languages many other systems you'll find
the data structures that are inherently
recursive so for example you have the
list the data structure so it consisted
well it kisses to a list consists of
something which is an element and more
things which are another list or it
might consist of the empty list which is
the thing that
bottom here so the definition of a list
itself is recursive so therefore it's
quite natural that any functions working
on lists are also recursive because they
reflect the data structure they're
working on the same thing if you're
working with trees tree structures they
are also recursive in that the sub nodes
of the tree will also be trees so having
a date having a functions be cursive
functions work on trees fits very nicely
into the actual of the data structure
looking at and yeah so we have to have a
very simple code example here
this is actually from one of the
exercises the course so we're writing a
very small small little database as a
list of tuples of key value tuples so
that the function store here takes a key
and a new value and puts it into into
the list seeing all data is immutable we
can't make a new list we can modify data
I mean we have two recursive agents in
this case we're also using pattern
matching
so the first first bit of the function
here the first Clause is called now like
that just checks is the key they want
what Kiba wanted but a new value in
except the first element of the list if
it is we replace it with a key and the
new value and just return that and rest
of the list if it's not the first term
then we end up in the second clause
second part of the function here we and
we just say well we call ourselves
recursively to see if it's in the rest
of the list and we build a new list with
the element are interested in and what
we get back from and in the third Clause
the last case here we when we hit the
end of the list that means we haven't
found it so we added such newly as we
just returned and you can see when
stepping that example and stepping down
here when I'm working there for me and I
want to now become ESL so what add
Robert the key mean and then ESL on the
system and there's the first call with
lime that I am NOT Jo so I'm going to
return Jo
should be a tra which is a part of
Erickson we call myself recalled as
ultra cursor which receive them in the
rest of the list then we find yes I am
I'm in the first element of the lists
our place that element with one which
Robert ESO and we just returned the last
rest of the list which is my caddy Eric
we build a new list so we have stepped
down the list recursively because that
fits the list and we've replaced in
element and built a new list coming back
up again this is just the tip the
typical pattern here and here we see
we're actually well not just using
recursion we're actually using pattern
matching as well we use pattern matching
to select the clause which clause we
want to do pattern matching is a very
powerful tool in that it allows us not
it allows us to write down what we want
the data to drop the Loom light and not
worry about how we're going to test if
it's scheduled in views is both will be
building structures and we are and we'll
make sure you try to test against so we
don't say we don't drag down how are we
going to test what a structure looks
like we just write down in this case
what we want the structure look like let
the system do that for us that's a very
powerful tool that often makes for very
precise code again this is not something
out and specific but most function
languages have because it is it realized
but we have Alan's actually extended
pattern matching not just to remove
useful data structures we can do for
example do pattern matching on binaries
on binary data so the first part here
this four thirds of all lines is
actually a parent data type or the
binary which is just a sequence of bytes
of bits and this pattern describes an IP
packet structure of an IP packet in one
go so it's a four bit version for mid
header length it's a bit service type
it's 16-bit total length 16 bit ID etc
etc etc there's the source IP which is
32 bits and the destination IP which is
that
to visit separately written Datagram
which is the rest of the binary and this
structure can both be used to pull apart
and eiope back into its parts we can
also use in Reverse and use the
structure to build an IP packet so we're
not interested here in saying how we
pull something apart we're interested
for building it Windsor say what does it
look like with the system do the
examples down below just three examples
from a problem I've been looking at a
bit this just this is just an interface
talk to a local exchange so on an
insider the hotel we could send
information buying information and these
just map extremely well on to occupy
memories and again I can use pattern
matching to build to test it which
message it is or to build a message
they're very it's a very powerful tool
it's often it's new to many people it's
not something with many people used to
but after a while most most people's as
I guess get into it I think the keys are
getting it on I think the key to
actually getting it is practice and your
own exercises and oh yeah yeah yeah you
can't you just this is one thing seeing
another thing attributed we do have a
lot of exercises in that courses to do
that I mean it's typically your sit
there you you explain it everyone nods
everyone understands it but the first
time you're someone has to write your
own recursive function it takes it takes
a slight adjustment to seeing okay which
of these recursive patterns should I use
and how do I break up my program into
regression into into this particular
pattern once you've done it it just
starts coming naturally yeah yeah yes or
yes people to complete rajaraja's the
sequence of if nested if/then/else is
but after a while and when you see the
pattern that change yourself simply -
yep
and so
you know people tend to struggle with is
is concurrency and once again you know
the reason the struggle understanding
concurrency is not because it's hard but
it's just because they've trained to
think in a different way you're possibly
an imperative approach all pack approach
or maybe even an object oriented
approach but if you stop don't think it
will just look at this picture and the
call Joe Armstrong the world is
concurrent and we're talking about the
world around us here things in the world
don't share data and you know things
communicate with messages and things
fail so you know how do you model a
language around these tenants around
these rules and that's yeah that's what
it feels that they've done without just
you try to picture a system handling TV
voting for smsed or quite a few of those
ritalin darling around every SMS coming
in every TV book coming in is handled in
its own process and in its own
standalone process and the process will
live for as long as that SMS is being
handled when the votes demand SMS has
been chorus and the vote has been
counted and we've sent back in
acknowledgment to their user that
process terminates the same good applied
bits of messaging you know every message
you send every message you receive every
status update you have every login and
logout requests are also standalone
processes and these processes live for
as long as you're handling that
particular request if that means that
here some buggy code will cause the
process to crash you're the only thing
which will be affected is that
particular message which which you're
dealing inherently and not all of the
other messages which will be handled in
parallel so that's usually the way you
have to think and reason which is a very
very natural way I mean if you just
think of us as human being we're all
interact or will interact with each
other if you message passing I mean I
mention we'll say something and you'll
receive that message you and I don't
share memory and occasionally we get hit
by
but even if we get hit by bus everyone
else around us keeps on running it this
year so it's a it's a very natural way
of thinking and they've just applied it
to the actor model to concurrency in
there and you know getting used to
thinking that way is fairly
straightforward once again all it needs
is is practice so yeah so I just want to
make one comment to DiFrancesco it is
also a very nice way of welding Trent
Francesco mentioned error-handling
because because then you can let
processes die when something goes wrong
and know that they will not affect other
things going on in our case of bridge
news telephony serve something goes
wrong with the call and the process is
managing that court would crash but
everything else will just keep on
working with you do a recovery it's much
easier to things like logging because
you localized and you localized
information of state to one process and
don't have to worry about everything
else at the same time so it's a very
nice model but in many ones sometimes
it's just different from how people used
to thinking again I think most people
understand it after a while I mean what
you're doing is you're avoiding all the
incidental difficulties the difficulties
which are there because you've picked
the wrong the wrong tool for the job and
instead you know it allows you to focus
on the things we act which actually are
hard and if you look at a case of SMS or
instant messaging what is hard is not
dealing with the messages in parallel or
coming in what's really hard there is
the distribution of the state
distribution of the data your prospect
lis across data centers we have to
provide full for all works and so
avoiding in this you know getting rid of
old incident in difficulties you just
focus on the real tough parts of the
problem which you know hard in any
language you pick so you know where when
we're here you learn airline well first
of all if you're lucky enough to attend
a university which teaches it you know
then you go for it there are
universities all along at same
first University request APH in 1992
oops non-university picked it up in 1994
I was actually in the past when the
first port hanging over there the IT
university doing it for over a decade
Oxford here in the UK picked it up in
2011 the other UK universities include
area work and the University of Kent and
Middlesex University here in London the
practice will start teaching it next
fall as well if you look at the u.s. Cal
Tech's been teaching it for a while
Kansas University is going to include it
and teach you the long side Haskell it's
been taught in Israel and green
universities I'd say in the Philippines
and in Spain France everywhere you know
it's everywhere but I'd like to specify
they're actually not teaching airline as
a language what you're actually doing is
using aromatic you have to tea as a tool
to teach certain aspects of computer
science and these aspects of computer
science could include here currency it
include tourism distribution and
recently even multiple program so what
they do is the teacher theory and then
the students get to use airline for
their exercises to apply that theory
turkey thought yeah if you're not well
they're always books there are quite a
few other books down the numbers been
slowly growing the one in the middle of
the light white bluish green one that's
the original book well we wrote one in
93 and our language concurrent
programming in a language doctors
throughout the language and also which
is still interesting I think we're
actually viewing examples where you
electric interface to control hardware
was quite funny because we allowed to
repent the book but the system and so
forth still proprietary but yeah it was
actually one of those in 1994 so yeah
yeah now they can get the new one which
is proprietary very soon yeah did you
get the blue one or the red one the blue
ones the second edition which contain
after I was in the lab when
the deadline for the red one and
received the first copies only to
realize and completely forgotten to do
the chapter and distribution which was
yeah I mean if return and decide which
ones I remember that yes that was didn't
have you have an object orientation in
Ireland by any chance there's a chapter
on it but I wouldn't I wouldn't know and
I'm gonna I'm not a true believer object
orientation and I don't know anything
else for that matter but there are quite
a few books in there more coming you
know the time I think there's tons of
yeah tons of books I mean they've been
your translated to your Korean Russian
and Chinese Japanese their books in
Spanish and we translated to French yeah
and they're also you know a lot of
specialist books and when it became you
know at you know back in 2006 no George
from came up with his new book in a
program there it was the first time in
book in over a decade and talking about
a year or two later became public that
the Simon Thompson and I were writing a
book variety yeah and someone went in a
question have you already have a great
for my community second book and that's
when I actually went out and said we
don't need to go to active the books
read full of books because of different
people take different approaches when
writing in and teaching outlining and
that's what yes if you want to Pancho's
book Joe would cover very much in detail
it's a reflection of his character lots
of enthusiasm and he will go in and tell
me why you should be using Ireland if
you want a in-depth view of airline well
then it's the Riley book you probably
want if you're learning from area from
very good it's a great book it's
available online free of charge and also
it covers airline and reports of OTP and
you know just you have next year or your
books on testing with online and pull
through in the book on the standings get
ability to very OTP there's a book on
the air and VM internals and yeah and
this is just some of the books I'm aware
of which still have to come out in
probably even more but you're for those
of you interested in
in the discount of both D on the Orion
website you'll get 40% of printed books
and 50% of the digital ones which are
listed above all all all of the books
are all provided variety we also you
know another place where you can earn
our line is the user groups all over the
world along and what they've started
running is something called the tube for
airline the currently has they're
currently being run in New York in
Seattle and those who start in San
Francisco and if you do go any further
now music with proscribe you really want
to recommend the two different airline
is based on a set of exercises which
will publish variety they're freely
available online or provided PDF if you
want and what you do is people prepare
their exercises and then they come in
and you spend two hours to get a good
experts and we all of the exercises you
get feedback and and in some cases a bit
of pair programming here and you'll help
each other coming up to speed with our
line and you've different very very
successful New York and directly in
inter second round right now I actually
believe you're for those who you are in
New York they're meeting this evening
down at the lab for some very extreme
and another way to learn Ireland is
using e-learning you know in earning
year it was a project with your
executions worked we have together with
the University of Kent and it you know
through a grant from the department
private industry knowledge transfer
partnership and it contains about eight
hours of video it contains interactive
exercises you can upload your exercises
and you get tests tests or anandam
somatic announcer also you get automated
feedback it's integrated with Safari for
variety work forums and you know if
you're interested in there using webinar
50 you'll get a 50% discount and this
discount code is valid until the 31st of
December of this year
and obviously do you can also go in and
get you know and you can also do in and
attend one of the training courses one
of the many training courses we provide
Robert you want to talk a bit more about
them yeah well yes
the five-day courses that said they are
in my example course that they're -
that's it it's a five-day course about
having but the Erlang language were
using the ailing language and what's
part of it and I can just mention all
the course that these costs are very
there lot of exercises and practical
look so there are combination of
presentations of lectures you might say
and there are there is exercises from
time to exercise in between to practice
on it which you mention which you'll
find your waste do need so the Alan
examples basically all their own
language five-day course usually at the
time of a bit of other stuff as well
ODP that's about what's called the of
OTP do can tell it on platform that is a
set of library the OTP is a set of
libraries and sense of design patents
and support for these design patterns
for building robust fault-tolerant
systems so a line provides the basic
tools for OTP is a big set of libraries
for doing this it's called over and
Telecom platform where there's
absolutely nothing about telecoms
in it as such there's nothing telecom
specific about it as such I think the
most telecom specific is got an ASN dot
one basel and is is one is using the
telecom specifications of interfaces
that's about place to get telecoms board
but it's a way of building support and
amenities and patterns for building
fault-tolerant systems I will say most
series our applications today use OTP
may be one exclusively most password I
want to test well that's that's as cause
for doing for doing testing in our so
our companies mugs over Ericsson
they use our line as their test
environment so for testing for testing
their hardware if in other other
languages they use in our testing
environments built it out
this is a course which helps you that we
have a number of three-day courses which
are sort of trimmed down versions of the
five-day course and so there's
Aliexpress no TP Express who've taken
out that we move we go through the most
important parts of our line for
different DevOps
that's of course the developer operators
of the system and it's not so much ray
Lancers programmers are such refer
people managing a link system so we
start talking about work out how to
install and build a long runtime
environments how you start the system
how you monitor the system what's going
on what's happening inside the system
how much memories music CPU message
queues how it works with the file system
how you can patch your lease handling
out how how can we actually do code
upgrade while systems looking at
distributed systems looking at the
system itself to try and see what's
going on inside it how is their own
system behaving behaving so I think it
should we have login and tracing
facilities or all these types of things
you want the operator when you're
managing our own systems it says
non-directive our line programmers
although even our own programmers can
find this interesting to do we can also
specially tailor costs for specific
needs a common one when I given a number
of times is we're going to take the OT
the three-day OTP Express and the fiber
OTP Express course and put you together
saying five records we want to get
through both it's a bit packed but it's
perfectly feasible to do and it gives
you a very good feel for doing both the
a line and the eighteenth insiders are
building more practice
so we also around eligibles but we also
have a course on XMPP and their line so
yeah mum - I am which we give on demand
as well and for those of you yeah
they're they're more Ellen is a
messaging webinar around products we we
don't give them ourselves but we we also
provide courses in and react for example
which area checkers like yeah yeah so he
has been video verticals we are starting
with a very aggressive schedule courses
right now your next year we're planning
on have a scheduled courses so for for
individuals in Stockholm London Proctor
in Budapest in proper Budapest to be in
Polish perspective in Hungarian we're
aiming for
Berlin New York and Chicago in
conjunction with our factory guys will
be giving their San Francisco as well in
San Francisco their schedule courses now
in the end of November for remember
correctly and also in conjunction with
era factory lights will be proved
they're a factory conference next March
so between the fur to the 5th of March
will be doing porter training and it
will be armed forces OTP forces and will
also be providing courses on using
airline EO and sip and the 6th and the
7th of March we have the conference
itself here we expect there will be 8
tracks still in problem in excess of 50
speakers and everyone who's anyone in
there and community will be there we'll
be talking about you know basic and
advanced subjects to be case studies
certain event not to be missed
and yet while learning well there are a
lot of companies have to recruiting a
lot of companies looking for airline
developers and you know doing a lot of
really really interesting products so
it's the done does that don't seem to be
enough airline programs to go around
these days
and I think that's one of the things
which is slowing yak out the language
adoption and one of the things we're
working on here at our solutions to
resolve yeah I can just say that those
companies they're they're the ones we
know about
we also know there are a lot of other
companies using yelling you just don't
say anything so find out through
roundabout ways of discomfort which
excuse me outlining cycles these are
just some of the companies we know
business it's some of them yet yeah keep
going
yep go ahead I'm just going to mention
that the whatsapp ones fun is
interesting because it's a very good
example that the concurrency that's
possible inside our line they came out
about a year and a half ago with a blog
saying that they were running on one
airline system or one on one computer
they were growing two million concurrent
TCP connections who will be managed by
RA now that was most likely being done
by at least one airline process per TCP
connection which is the standard way of
doing it so just to show that
large-scale concurrency massive
concurrency is possible at our like even
in products not just as sort of an
academic exercises but what's up have a
an active user base which is largely on
Twitter so I think I'm a sustainability
yeah a lot of the other ones as well - I
mean it was um did you have dealing with
it yeah they're all they're all there
they're all there yes they later the
front end they do the front ends for
amongst other things the call of duty
servers yeah they have last call I heard
about the year ago at 16 million users
so it feeds in there is concurrent
there's a lot of concurrency going on
there and a lot of foreign systems take
questions I can keep on going as long as
possible so can I
all right well Ron first of all thank
you from Jessica thank you Robert and
I'm sure that everyone who's attended
the webinar will join me in thanking you
for a very inspiring talk on Erlang
now throughout the webinar we've been
receiving questions and whilst the
number of questions received is bigger
than what we can answer in the available
time I've picked a couple that I think
would be interesting to start with first
of all a really interesting question
coming from Germany Francesco and
Roberts if you were sort of learning a
line from scratch today you know how
would you start would you start with
books would you start with courses would
you you know attend the conference how
would you begin from scratch in your
attempt to learn a line
I think it completely depends on what
your objectives are if if you're
hobbyist and you want to learn as a
hobby project maybe your start looking
at you're looking at some of the books
attend one of the events and watching
all the videos online you have to learn
how Ireland's being used so that through
the books you'll get the theoretical
side with and your by attending
conferences you'll actually see how your
the fear is being converted into
practice elearning is an excellent way
of doing it as well
ie learning is usually used also by
companies who have geographical
limitations or time limitation so you
know the delegates are able to learn and
in their own time in a location which is
convenient for them you only need to do
is ever you'll be online and have an
internet connection
if someone between books and real
earnings are learning by example the
videocast Simon Thompson I did they're
available on Orion accom there are about
two hours of videos where we cover the
basics of the language so it's you know
basically it's the basics it's a simple
parts of a language but we will explain
that imagine you will explain recursion
we will explain single assignment Aveiro
stall with these examples which go hand
in hand with the book so it's just a way
of listening to it differently and then
thirdly you know it's you know if you
you're a company you need to get up to
speed quickly or if if you're really
interested in airline and you want to
learn it as as quickly as possible and
avoid a lot of the beginning mistakes or
the most kind of time effective way
properly is by attending one of the
schedule courses themselves so you know
there is no answer to this question none
and other than you just completely
depends on what your objectives are
exactly well yeah it is it is a bit of
an open-ended question I guess very
dependent on on the person learning
another quite practical question is are
there any horses airline course
of any type planned in the coming months
in Spain and North America specifically
so there is a course planned in San
Francisco in in the next two to three
weeks and that's you can let us see that
on our website from airline - solutions
website we had a sold-out course about a
month ago in New York I think we had
more people registered and what we could
handle I think Robert took care of that
one and we're about to publish a
schedule for North America in the next
in the next couple of weeks but you know
let us know where you're based and with
your best but we're aiming at no
scheduling courses in Chicago New York
and San Francisco next year and the ones
we know for sure will be happening refer
to the fifth of March in San Francisco
it's an airline course and alongside
Eternity equals yeah I just say one
thing is well to which you should
mention before we talk about courses you
can always book an airline course if
your company has number of people they
want a specific specific course you can
book a course from us not just the
scheduled ones so there's always that
possibility to do that as well thank you
for that we have an interesting question
from Germany one of our audience is
basically interested in knowing from the
perspective of a C C++ developer what's
the learning curve to sort of
effectively translate well and and
become productive so Erickson had some
really good did a study on this and I'm
really frustrated they never went in and
officially published toast results it's
no trade secret but what they found is
that you know someone coming straight
out of university who has worked with a
lot of different languages while
studying in university will be pretty
productive after about one month so that
means you know attending the airlin
course and the OTP course and then using
airline and OTP before and after so
about after one man will be productive
someone who's worked with a particular
technology this
could be C C++ in Erickson case it was
flex which was America's proprietary
language and they're usually productive
in three months and that's usually has
to do with early in and we have changing
the way you think and reason and once
again you know this is after attending
two courses obviously a Productivity is
measured in different ways so what his
people would bring to the game is a lot
of other experiences as well and not
just programming pure program experience
but you know to get up and running you
know it's it's it's easy after three
days you know anyone should be able to
start coding but good really you reach
you become much more productive after
yeah after having well practice for a
few months and that's the case I guess
not only for airline but here for any
programming language
yeah yeah thank you Chris let's go one
other question is and quite on the
pragmatic side what are the most used
tools in detecting an airline
application bottleneck and the Harvard
application tuning Robin Elizabeth well
the question gonna be yeah there are a
number of tools being used in this in
the system for looking at the system
there are they come with the island at
now and release another profiling tools
which you can use to look at the system
there are a number of external tool
tools which allow you do also to view in
the system trying to try and see where
bottlenecks occur so there are there are
there are tools for doing that yeah
that's a bit about the best I can say
they say at the moment there are tools
met the methods of doing it the arming
of course I said the online system
itself is very open in that it allows
you to allows you as the program or the
application designer to make you make
your own tools to look at the system
while it's running
so although all these two example tools
I've made you can quite easily work
could have written yourself in the sense
that the
nothing special about the a long system
allows you to look at the system itself
so if we say thank you Robert now
there's an interesting question sort of
looking at you know the current state of
Erlanger one of our audience is asking
where is a line at the moment in terms
of scaling out of the box on multi-core
architecture
it doesn't straight by itself okay how
far has the language got in terms of you
know how many cores it can scale - I
think that's what the question is
alluding to yeah I can scale to about
straight out of the box you know it's
it's 8 to 16 cores in some cases 42 or
even 64 cores what we've discovered
right now is that the whole scalability
is a very much application dependent and
it's the problem has to do with
bottlenecks in the applications
themselves because if you've got one
process which all of the other processes
depend on with that process becomes your
bottleneck so your system is as fast
such as lowest point in effect and so
there are tools which are being
developed as part of the release project
to actually find these bottlenecks and
helps resolve them but you know I think
I've looked at Steel here is that when
dealing with program multiple you need a
new mindset and I think airline is a
good step in that direction but if it
drops of work still needs doing and yet
that work is happening right now as I
speak in terms of you a lot of the
research projects which which are
happening around it for several millions
in the you guys have been given with
airline and they're very big you know
some of the best universities are
actually working on this problem itself
so hopefully this time next year you
know to answer your question magnet will
probably be 32 to 64 cores but most
programs yet most programs out of the
box 8 to 16 cores without any problems
thank you Francesco there's another
question specifically asking what is the
recommended solution to interface legacy
services and servers are there existing
libraries or should we always sort of
build
from scratch there are a number of
existing libraries already for example
there's no new b/c library for talking
with databases there are a number of
online libraries for talking with
various SQL databases some exist there
are a lot of open source libraries
libraries interface on major protocol
stacks so yeah there's a lot that
there's a lot out there and when there
isn't you do it and I think you know the
bit syntax and the pattern matching
Robert was showing is it ideal solution
to that problem fantastic there's a bit
of a philosophical question in here as
well what do you both see as the future
of things to come for Erlanger well some
things I know they've got their their
working group maintaining and developing
our the OTP group in Ericsson they're
always working on improving scalability
and use of increase in proving the use
of multiple cores so originally when it
came one multi-core came out 10 years
ago where 8 years ago was about two
calls and in four calls age now 16 year
up to 30 or 60 cords and they're always
working on improving that to that book
the language itself if it develops
slowly so there are new features coming
the new features coming next year which
people will be waiting for so it does
develop slowly I think was it excited is
when things come out they're very well
tested so you know they work I think
this very people there's so much air
linguistic filled out - people are very
very careful in ensuring that new
versions of ironing won't bring great
old systems out of production so you
know there's a lot of conservatism there
but at the same time I think you know
new features which are needed and
acquired are slowly being at it I think
the biggest change I see in the future
is how our inheritance distribution we
can deal with distribution
right now and you can just drop up 200
nodes after which you need to resort to
block sharding or something is close to
shorty HISP as as as you can think of
and at the same time you know and you
need to apply different concepts and
mindsets to it part of its being done
its release projects for Less they are
like other ideas which are being played
around with is applied software if I
network with principles planning itself
I can just add one comment to that about
the oiling systems itself the standard
system which basically everyone uses is
developed by by Ericsson and they of
course want to sick they will they of
course want something which is good
enough for them views in their eternal
products which is being used in new
eternal products so the quality of the
online system itself is is very good in
its product quality systems to do these
type of things before so that gets back
to development is slove at the same time
when it comes out it's very well tested
it works
thank you Robert and thank you for
Jessica for that I think we have time
for a single question although there's
many more coming as we speak the one
question I'll probably sort of wrap up
with is what are the recommended tools
and you know what would you recommend
for development and debugging of Erlang
applications so again the question is a
what tools would you recommend for
development and debugging of lang up
legations and what is sort of in daily
use in practice in Erlang solutions
I mean from from the from the developer
to be I think here and in solutions it's
vim or Emacs apparent plugins for
Eclipse Ellijay and and most editors
most editors out there and you know the
approach we recommend is your
test-driven development and test driven
development and your potatoes
integration so basically self-propelled
infrastructure and do it properly when
you start developing it's not just about
sitting down and starting to build
yes in the end as from one of our
courses there are a number of testing
environments including the a-line
release which are used for testing what
other things and also testing hourly
applications as well there are a number
of support tools that come come with a
line to help you help do development as
well - that excellent well thank you
Robert Thank You Francesco again then
once again I'm sure everyone will join
me in thanking you for taking part in
this webinar and giving us an inspiring
talk and no lying now many thanks to all
of you who have joined us for the
webinar on the side of the audience

you a short survey to make sure we
capture your feedback of today's webinar
please also note that the recording of
the webinar and the presentation of a
share today will also be available for
you to collect on erlang solutions
