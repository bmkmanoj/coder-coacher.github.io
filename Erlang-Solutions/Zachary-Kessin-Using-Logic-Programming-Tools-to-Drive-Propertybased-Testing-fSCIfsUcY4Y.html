John John you couldn't hear me okay I'm
hoping you'll went to John Hughes this
talk yesterday if you didn't go watch it
on on YouTube when it comes out but he
talking about this with evaluation so
far let's just review uh first of all
who here is used quick check before okay
John I know you've used it before you
invented it if you hadn't I'd be worried
so it'll just give a quick review for
that in case John forget something so
basically idea is that instead of going
writing tests as you wouldnt unit as
we're going to generate them we're going
to express invariants through general
properties versus specific examples
we're going to run lots of tests and
we're going to find hopefully find all
the weird error conditions before our
customers do and then when we find the
weird error conditions we're going to
remove all the extraneous cruft so that
we only see the things actually causing
the error is not the random the other
random things that happen to happen so
that that's the 32nd introduction a
quick check I know anyway same time II
it was an actually 30 set what 25 second
introduction that you ah the fractals
have no purpose besides being pretty by
the way I just wanted to give you all
something to look at besides my it's my
equivalently cat picture yes but it's
got you know math so when we test the
system with state we want to model the
system and we're going to basically
create an event stream to run through
the system and then we just can validate
that what we think should that our model
reflects with really half of thing so we
need is a model model airplane or model
system not a model airplane but I
couldn't I don't know how to create a
picture of a model system so you all get
any you all get a p-51 Mustang alright
so we could create our model in Erlang
and sometimes that's a great thing way
to do it but sometimes it's awkward and
sometimes you should end up with this
case of your model ends up being just a
clone of your code
which is kind of pointless because then
basically you end up saying that your
code is you know you you end up with a
big tautology where you're testing
something you're saying okay this works
like itself and that's often not
particularly a useful way to do things
for the obvious reason that you know
you're not going to find bugs if you're
so we want to use an external model the
problem is writing an external model
sometimes is a pain in the neck so we're
going to say what we might wake this
easier arm and their various ways we
could do this we could use an existing
external program if you want to test if
you know your Vallot if you're creating
json or a mole or XML or whatever you
know you could use a program to validate
it in JavaScript or PHP or Python or
whatever um and you know you could say
okay this this input passed through this
JSON encoder should always form
validation and we're going to use this
Python program to test the dude is in
fact valid valid JSON on that's a great
solution that works but it only works in
the case of like JSON where Jason Valle
encoders and validators are fairly well
standard if you wanted to see is this
document a valid JSON you could go to
Jason org and you could find a piece of
you know software in any language you
can imagine and probably a few you
couldn't that will parse and tell you
whether a JSON is valid JavaScript and
Python would be good choices but what if
your system is not something as simple
as is this a valid JSON something rapsi
so you need to create a model arm and I
had this idea that we could use prologue
to to to to represent certain kinds of
models more effectively this won't work
for everything of course but for the
things that it will work with I first
heard about prologue when I was in
cotton university they had a course on
it that my roommate took I didn't well I
remember he took it and then I kind of
didn't think about prologue for 20 years
I kind of knew it existed sort of the
general way you know something exists
without thinking about it
man thought about it and then a couple
years ago I found I start you know a
book appeared how much marks this book
was written by some guy who I think is
sitting over there hi Brooke and
honestly if you haven't read this book
you should read it if one of the seven
languages in this book doesn't make you
go unless of course you already know
well seven I guess um doesn't make you
set up and go wow that's really cool
you're in the wrong line of work if you
can't find something cool in one of
these seven um seriously go do something
else but for me it was prologue there
was a sudoku solver I won't show you the
code for it but basically it's like 20
lines of code or something to solve a
Sudoku puzzle and it's you just looking
and going okay that's nice i see this
the all right he explains the textures
just a problem but where's the code
there's no code so that was kind of
inspiration i started looking into
prologue some more so what is prologue
prologue is programming with logic and
what do I mean and there are lots of
programs been around for long times lots
of different versions of prologue
there's swi-prolog there's good new Pro
log there's six to switch is commercial
there's eclipse there's excess be others
Yap which stands for yet another
prologue and their website looks like it
hasn't been updated since the 90s if you
want to run out of a 68 k they're good
and for this talk that one is a log
which was invented by Robert verdict and
basically runs in a process of the early
virtual machine it's not necessarily as
complete as swi or some of the others
but it has the advantage that for small
things at least you could run it arm
inside the beam just in a process of
interact with it or inside your own
process which creates a very low
impedance between your existing code and
prologue if you want to do something
really big with prologue I would suggest
you probably want to grab something swi
or 60s or something and set up a port
that's beyond the scope of this talk so
a little history of prologue was
invented in the early 70s it was it's
often used in AI
it was used show you go over there and I
what you guys use it to develop our line
and most famous most recently if you saw
jeopardy apparently the Watson computer
that one at jeopardy not exclusively but
apparently in part was developed in
Prolog so you know what is Watson that's
not actually relevant anything but it's
kind of cool all right so or a log
doesn't have a home page but this is the
github page Roberts rube oh and it has
some useful features it is an
approximately an iso prologue it's not I
don't think completely complete but it's
got most of the stuff in it it runs in
an erlang process and you can actually
tell it to talk to an end table so you
can put data in ettes and read it out
and do other useful things which
sometimes useful and of course it
understands our log or like data so so
let's look at some basic prologue
structure examples who here has written
prologue before oh okay that was not
what I expected all right you all could
go sleep for the next four slides this
is the problem but this time we talked
you know because you have to make a
guess and inevitably are gonna guess
wrong because if I'd skip the next two
slides let me put the answer that
question two hands Bruce and Joe's hand
would have got up and all right in
Roberts and nobody else so he only okay
so we have some a prologue program is
created with some facts with facts and
rules so simple we have some facts we
have a model with a key and a value that
doesn't really do any with it and then
you here we have a small small non
directed graph we have an edge from A to
B and an edge from B to C and these are
atoms just like in our line Erlang atoms
are a direct seal from prologue Adams
I've been informed Joe is that right so
you have some simple facts here there's
no computation here it's just you're
stating some facts that there is an edge
between a and B in between here and an
edge there alright so now we can state
the two things are connected and notice
again its capital letter like as a
variable as in Erlang a is connected to
BB is connected to see and you can say a
is connected to be if there's an edge
between a and B or there's an edge
between bna so these are actually direct
I didn't draw an arrow but these are
actually directed directed links but
we're treating them is undirected here
so you can say that you know we don't
care which way in this case we don't
care which way things go we're just
going to we're just going to connect
them up and will wipe the codes that
it's know either way so again here we
have some sort of a longer example what
we can just say we get to create a bunch
of facts we're going to create this rule
the a and B a and B are connected and
then you can ask the interpreter you
know is connected a 2 X and it'll just
tell you all the things that a is
connected to B and C and if its mortal
just you can just keep hitting semicolon
and they'll keep repeating them or if
you're using it internally
programmatically there's just a function
you call and it just spits out the next
one so you get the whole list although
be careful that ask for the whole list
because not in this case but it is
possible to generate an infinite list
and then you'll be there for a while
waiting for it and you realize you've
created an infinite list and hit control
C a bunch of times I've done that don't
do that oh you could also generate
infinite list there but you could still
he control you can Stoke what yes and
you could print it out too if you're not
careful in any case kill dash nine can
be your friend you can also create a
lazy listed prologue it's just in this
case I hadn't all right so then we can
also be weak but it also this is nice
unlike Erlang it goes both ways so
instead of in addition to saying is a
connection to X I can also say is X
connected to F and then I'll tell you
everything so it's completely
symmetrical which is kind of neat it
doesn't always pointed out it's not
always equally efficient to go both way
to do it either way but some
basically a tactically semantically it
works so the things we can define
something recursively we can say fitting
only here right there's a path from A to
B and again the path I highlighted here
in this purplish color is an output or
potentially use an output if you can
travel from do this from A to B via via
some internal variables and then here
basically you can say again we have two
clauses as inner line if the its valid
if it connects is a is connected to be
or where a is can see such that C is not
be and that you can travel then from C
to B and it just it'll just back it'll
it'll find any any and all valid paths
and it will you know search through it
might you know if there's 20 steps
between a and B it it might you know go
through back up and try and keep trying
again so you do have to be vaguely
careful because this could depending on
what you're doing this could have we you
know this can have weird runtime
performances but for most of the things
I'm working at the data sizes are pretty
small so it doesn't isn't really an
issue you know if you have 10,000 edges
in your node this might blow up but if
you have 20 you're probably ok but yet
so basically you can just FN again you
can you and this is all reversible so
you can also say you can also say or in
addition to be reversible you can also
say if you have a node a and a node B
and a path you can pass that in and it
will return true or false if the path is
a valid path from A to B so if you want
to validate if you have what you think
is a good is a valid or it might be a
valid path you can use this funk this
code to say is this path valid or if you
have two endpoints you can also say is
what what are the valid paths between
these and you can even do things like
say what are all the valid paths that
started a and where do they end up again
you may end up with a lot of data
so and you would run it like this you
know path a comma F path and it will
return a list that is the path from A to
F there is one or it'll return for a
failure if it can't find a path so far
we've been showing basically all static
data we've created a dictionary with
some facts and we just an asking
questions but you can also change the
facts in a prologue system using a
search assert a on a cert see which just
adds the beginning or end appropriately
and retract which will remove a fact
from the system and this is very useful
for stateful systems so what kinds of
problems can this office obviously is
not going to solve every possible
problem so if with the state use the
state model anything involves like an
algebra upsets graphs things like that
grammars you can do a lot of stuff with
context-free grammars and prologue that
I'm not gonna get into today but they're
interesting finite state machine I could
easily model this way so when I started
playing with all this stuff some months
ago I started with something I'd done
before which was a last value cash so I
wanted system where basically you could
to have a key value store and it would
just save whatever the last value you
stuck in them as a key so I wanted to
create a model in Prolog to do this and
I'm not of it and I will be the first a
bit I'm not a great prologue programmer
I'm still learning but part of the point
of this is with pro that I've discovered
that you don't have to be a great
prologue programmer to get some basic
stuff done and get get useful results
you know you don't have to be the you
know prologue kung fu master to do this
so I started with this this is the model
least they said add to model key value
where I retract an existing model that
any existing models that have that key
and then
cert the new key and value okay so then
how do we run our log in our in our test
so there are two ways you can render log
ones you can run it as a gen server or
you want in the process I'm running it
as a gen server here so basically do or
log start link it returns a pit then you
do or log consult which basically just
reads in the file which is the previous
slide and when you're done you do or log
haul to their fue some if you don't you
should do something useful in between
lines three and four here otherwise you
have a pretty boring program start stop
okay good we're done so here's what I
did so basically what we did was I just
created us using quick check a series of
gets and sets with asset value of key
number of keys and then the values were
all integers just for a simplicity sake
and again this code is sort of the hello
world of this exercise this was not
meant to be a real system so much is
just saying all right I know how to do
this inner line can I figure out how to
do it in Prolog to make sure that I'm
like vaguely on the right track so you
have two operations set and get so
here's set and again we just passed our
login key and value and then basically
do a log proof which is the Earl a p.i
call add to model key value and this is
just call that function and then we do
succeed true anything else false and
then the false will cause the test to
fail now add to model should always work
basically just asserting that this is
the new value for a given key is X if
for some reason that doesn't work we
want to fail the test right away now a
more interesting thing is we want to say
good what is the current value of a key
and this is the get operation so here we
basically use this funky tuple looking
thing here which is just an atom inside
curly braces so or I don't write a tuple
to say this is a very
well in Prolog this is basically just
prologue turned into an ass one line of
program prologue turned into an AST as
was the previous thing you could also
choose right out the prologue but this
is a little easier and saves you some
optimization so basically one of two
things is going to happen either we're
going to get back succeed y value again
the variables their matchup in which
case we return ok value or if this value
is not is not in the model we don't this
is not this this has not been added to
prologue yet you're going to get a not
I'll just return not found of course
that might be valid you might ask the
cash what is the current value of x and
it might not know I'm not showing all
the quickcheck code if you here because
that's sort of i just want show the
prologue i think we have any questions
please stick your hand up by the way so
more fractals so again the other thing
we can do is how much earlier is algebra
i become a big fan of using algebra and
part of a sort of thing out of
programming terms of algebra new graphs
trees crd tease these are rather
complicated but you can do them i'm not
going to show you how today but i
imagine you so we're going to look at is
a partially ordered set you've all seen
a partially ordered set before if you've
ever looked at a git commit history it's
a partially ordered set set arm they
show up all over the place a vector
clock is also a partially ordered set so
the question is what are the operations
you might want to do on a partially
ordered set so you might want to know is
there a path from from A to B this is
similar to what we did before I just
it's not it's just only goes in one
direction so here you can see I have
highlighted the path from here to there
or a path there of course if you look
between here and there there are many
possible paths you can go this way you
can go that way or this way or you get
the picture you can also say can you
travel again this is sort of the same
code we saw earlier vaguely modified so
that you can only go in Direction more
important interestingly you can say is
this a child dode so this note has no
children you know the leaf node of the
tree well if it was a tree pulled a leaf
it's a not a tree and it's just here you
just do this backslash plus which is an
odd operation and you say basically that
there's not an edge from a to anything
and that's you know definition of a
child you can say are these two nodes
siblings you can say basically if
there's a path from some node C to a and
from C to B but not a path between them
and their siblings fairly straight
fairly obvious ancestor independent and
descendant or again they're actually the
same function just reversed you could
you could make that one function if you
felt like it on one clause i made it i
kind of think you should make it to just
44 value of being explicit so that you
know you you call the one you actually
care about it does the same thing
internally it just to make your code
easier to read um okay how am i doing in
time right what copious amounts us what
no no that's fine i just this went
faster than I thought it would know what
yeah ok so how do we test with it all
right so I'm not gonna show you the test
code to that really written it sort of
attack you basically we're just gonna
create an initial state we're gonna
create events that'll just on any of the
nodes in the system that will might be a
vector clock and then then check on it
that it did the right thing so ok so now
basically qaq
because I I guess I'm not very good at
estimating talk time uh any questions
dead silence crickets so the cases I've
just been playing you know this is sort
of a still in the trial you know the
I've been playing with it mode um I
think if I were to try to do something
with partial Odets anything that was
algebraic would seem to work uh anything
involves a grammar I think would work
well I didn't show any that I don't have
any slides for that but you can also do
some cool things with grammars we
basically just do a context-free
grammars very nice syntax in Prolog it
will just spit it out so that's sort of
the obvious cases so the full list of
languages were Bruce tell me if I forget
one but Ruby io prologue Scala closure
erlang Haskell not in that I got the
order wrong I got the order wrong it
wasn't that's not the right what are
they're actually in exactly but uh he's
got a whole series uh they've got seven
more languages they reckon or seven
concurrency models of which there's a
talk coming up next in this room so just
stay put you'll hear it seven web
frameworks databases and I think I
forget so what yeah this is this has
been a pedo this has been an unpaid
promotion they're good books the real
idea here was that I'm just sort of
playing I get with ideas for how can I
you know how can i express the ideas of
my code in a more declarative way ah
then I might have done previously um so
it's not it's not a hugely hugely
developed concept it's sort of
experimental and I'm just me I'm playing
with so first
right yeah one problem that or one issue
that many many prologue implementations
have is there there in and of themselves
very powerful but they don't necessarily
integrate easily with other languages
there are versions that do Roberts
Rollag you know integrates very nicely
with era lying and I would I haven't
tried it but I would imagine you could
integrate it very nicely with LFE or
Felix her or any other airline languages
um because again it's just an erlang
process and stuff um but yeah
right poor logic yeah right I think I I
mean core logic is based on the can Ram
system I actually found an early
implementation of can Ram I created
github repo it was like buried in a repo
with like JavaScript and four other
versions i created a repo for it it's on
github you could call it all can Ram I
mean you find out in my user account I
do not guarantee it works it passes it
to the unit tests that it came with and
it passes dialyzer but I've not actually
used it for anything beyond that if any
would like to like play with it a semi
let me know i'd be curious but you know
the real place i see prologue a parole
officer like being valuable is it is the
five percent five percent of the pie
where you have ninety five percent of
your code for whatever your app is
written in Erlang or elixir and then the
five percent that has to do something
logic but you know rules based or logic
based or parsing based you write that in
Prolog so that you could then take
advantage of that power um I have a
think i would think Robert correct me on
Rose you wouldn't want to use huge data
sets with our log right I mean you know
if you if your database is less than 100
facts or so it probably works it will
work pretty well you know if you wanted
to do you know 100,000 facts or a
million facts in your database swi or
one of the other prologues would work in
theory it should be possible degree like
a port between SW I and our line and
they have C extensions and web
extensions that you could do other
interface you things with i do not know
that anybody has done the well they have
a that's what really they have a web
thing so you
you know talk to it via rest you should
be able to create a port for early to
talk to it but I don't know that anybody
I don't think anybody has done it yet so
right
yeah you use a net stable and I've
actually been also adding quick check
tests to Earl log over the last few
weeks so that they're starting to get in
there there I don't know 20 or 30 test
20 or 30 properties know that don't test
everything and I'm sort of slowly adding
them as i have time i try to add a
couple you know try to add one or two a
week or something so so that they will
be there and then hopefully if our log
gets more use cases we can improve the
performance of it to the point where you
could handle bigger data but you know my
experience with prologue is especially
for a lot of the stuff that even with
fairly small data you can do some cool
stuff there's a lot of applications that
I think with a hundred facts in Prolog
you could do very clever stuff and then
you know again handled the ninety-five
percent of the application using other
Erlang tools for you know you know build
your web api with web machine and or
cowboy and then user log to do some
piece of it that make sense Bruce
Plus logic programming in there were
woven together away and um I I didn't
think it was too hard i mean i think i
peppered robert with a bunch of
questions via instant messenger which he
was very kind to answer but once I got
the syntax down I found it was really
straightforward I found the sorry I
don't know where my mouse is
I found this book which actually have in
my bag very useful they'll see the
website learn prologue now org um not
nearly as exciting as learn you some
airline or not nearly as whimsical but
still very good these two resources this
is more of an advanced book that I'm
actually planning on ordering any minute
any day now we're very useful and I
think I think part of it is you just got
to get probably I would not start with
our logs start with s WI and get one of
these two books and just sort of work
through all the exercises and then don't
be afraid to go and I at the IRC
prologue channel and or on / I'll stack
overflow and ask questions Joe
yeah i mean the problem with some of the
constraint logic programming is
something I mean depending on what you I
another idea I had with our log again I
haven't really worked with it is you
could or with another prologue is you
could you know use it with rebar that's
part of your build process to do some
sort of static and analysis on your code
base you know get our line just spit out
and say an ast each other your line
compiler does that can do that right
there's some flag rather they'll spit
out the eighth what yeah I was pretty
sure it did I just did you know you can
look up what the flag is because I don't
honestly couldn't tell you and then you
know Express you know define look at
code styling or something although
honestly probably better off just using
wrangler for that right or you know the
other thing you could say is if you want
to know is you know if you want to say i
mean you could say in code I have no
clue I've not actually done this you
know this function should be a pure
function or in the Haskell sense and
then have part of your compile cycle be
for any function so marked analyze the
ast and figure out if it's impure break
the build I haven't done that then we
just do that let me know very cool but
there's a lot of places like that
parsing analyzing stuff like that that
would be very useful the other app I had
was my wife and I were working planning
an app to do a recipe sharing on
Facebook because if you read my wife's
facebook page it's like heard her
friends discussing what they're cooking
for dinner half the time and some
problem is we has ideally for a nap or
if you said I want to plan a dinner
party with for 20 people and I have you
know the two people to help and you know
this many I want to make these recipes
and I have this many you know four
burners in an oven or something it would
go through and tell you that oh yes you
could here's a schedule you could use to
get done or no that's impossible no you
can't cook a meal for 100 people on a
one burner
using nothing but a wooden spoon in a
small pot I'm sorry that's not possible
or if you did I'd be very impressed so
