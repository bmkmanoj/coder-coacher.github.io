actually gonna be my first talk ever so
let's see what this brings I'm Albert
I'm pretty new to elixir in fact I first
used it about a year ago for a class
project at university where we had to
write a video streaming server
everything went extremely well until it
came to deployment I just could not
figure out a simple smooth non
interactive way to build and deploy that
thing from a CI server in the end I just
gave up and rewrote the thing in
JavaScript in an afternoon and decided
to dedicate the next year of my life and
my bachelor's thesis to try to figure
out how to deploy elixir so here's sort
of what we're gonna cover in the next 40
minutes first we're gonna look at the
basic mechanism whereby the beam swaps
your modules it's actually really simple
and we're gonna inspect OTP releases
next we're gonna look at sort of the
core of the upgrade process the upgrade
instructions that you find in your
relabel then we're gonna look at ways to
ship your release from wherever you
built it to your servers and start it
there now oh sorry then we're going to
talk about some of the things that can
go wrong and how you might deal with
that and lastly we're gonna look at ways
to automate the whole process and see
what's out there so let's start now
before we actually get hot swapping I'm
gonna just say that if you can avoid
doing hot swaps in production then
please do that there's really just a lot
of added complexity that if you can of
what you should do so unless you're
absolutely certain that you really need
hot upgrades
please just pack your lease or just
start a server like this so sort of
valid reasons to use hot upgrades would
be if you have a lot of long lived
connections that you cannot easily drain
or that if you would just cut them out
they would cause like a reconnect storm
and bring them down your machine when
some more or if you've got a lot of in
memory state like for example if you're
building a game server so if you can't
do rolling restarts please do but then
again we're here for the hot swap so
let's look at the mechanics so basically
hot swapping is done on a module level
what does the means of the beam can keep
up to two versions of one module loaded
in memory at once say we've got this
module loaded and from it we have
spawned a plain old process no chance or
anything just something that runs a
tail-recursive function now you so you
change something in your file save it
compile it load it what's gonna happen
is the file that you just changed it's
gonna be loaded and it's gonna be marked
as current whereas the old version
that's been running previously is now
marked as old note that your process is
still running the old version of the
module and just to keep things things
interesting let's also say our process
gets some internal state and that we've
changed the representation of that state
in our upgrade so what we want is a way
to transform that state so that our new
code can just deal with the new state
and the way you do this is you ship as
part of your new release and upgrade or
a state transformation function it'll
receive the old state transform it
somehow and then just continue the tail
recursive loop
just in the new module this time so to
actually switch over execution what you
need to do is to make a what's it's
called a fully qualified call
so that's your module name dot function
name and in this case we do that by
sending our process a message that could
be anything we'd have to implement that
so now our process calls a this fully
qualified call and it calls the state
upgrade function in a fully qualified
way so at this point execution switches
over to the new module because fully
qualified calls always go to the latest
loaded version of a module that's sort
of really the key here if you do a fully
qualified call you switch over to the
latest loaded version if you're already
delays loaded version it's just gonna be
like a local function call now your
state transformations function is gonna
receive the state because we would have
to pass it with that function call it's
going to upgrade it and just continue
the loop now this time it can just do a
regular local function call and it'll
automatically resume in the new version
of the module all right what's gonna
happen to the old modulus that as soon
as there are no more processes running
the old module it's gonna get purged now
what happens is if you still have
processes running on the old module of
the code on the old version of the
module and you're gonna load a third
version then the oldest version is just
gonna get to forcibly killed so you see
the mechanics of the code swap are
actually really simple when you look at
them in detail now
I just talked about this a little bit
but you really had to have the foresight
to implement all of this fully qualified
call and handling the upgrade message at
the time when you wrote the first
version of the module so that's not
really something you should use in
production at all luckily there's always
Oh T P to relieve us from having to
think about this and what you usually do
is not build your own kind of gen server
using like a tail recursive loop but
rather just use a transceiver and
implement the code change call back in
your modules so a function is pretty
simple it basically transforms your
state and returns it now note that
whereas previously we had to just sort
of resume the loop by calling our loop
function this time we just returned a
state so this function receives the old
version that's just the string of the
release version that we're upgrading
from usually you don't have to care
about that if you happen to do it
compare and match against it also if it
happens to be a downgrade that old
version is gonna be an atom it's gonna
be tuple with the atom down as its first
element but then again I think you don't
shouldn't really care about downgrades
and if you notice something wrong with
your upgrade you just cut a new release
and roll forward so next argument is the
old state of your chain server that
you're gonna have to transform it's
pretty straight forward that extra
argument then really care about it's
usually an empty list you can't pass in
some extra stuff if you happen to need
that so then transform your state and
return it alternatively if you raise an
error or if you return error the
upgrades gonna fail and usually what
that means is that your node will so
that your emulator is gonna reboot using
the old version of all your applications
and obviously lose all its state now
this obviously was a sort of happy
little example and it's not gonna be
what you
see in the real world in a real world
your systems are gonna look more like
this and what you would really want on a
production machine is a controlled way
of orchestrating changes and you want to
go for Oh TP releases now at this point
when I started trying to figure out how
everything about OTP releases fits
together I looked at the Erlang
documentation I read that section on
releases of the learners number one for
a great good book and there's really
just a lot of manual steps that you'd
have to do and I find that scary copying
things around renaming things attaching
various shells to run various commands
that I found that a little scary to be
honest but if you think about it it's
maybe somewhat understandable I mean I
like evolved since like I know what 1985
or something so Ericsson probably
designed that process for themselves for
hugely complex telco systems and they've
got a lot of people who can spend all
day copying files around and renaming
things and running commands manually I
certainly felt a little lost and scared
now I don't want to scare you by not
showing you step-by-step how to generate
and apply a release using only the
tooling that Erlang gives you because
that's really a little involved but
think about it this way I mean we do
database migrations all the time and
don't bat an eye so why can't we just do
the same with our processes state if
we've got a little more tooling support
so what I'm gonna show you though are
the most important concepts around OTP
releases the various files that you will
find in a release and their purpose is a
little bit about the SAS application
which is sort of the which brings it a
sort of lowest level module
that most of the tools are using to
construct and apply releases so now
these releases are a religious boxes
full of goodness they pretty much give
you everything you need to run and
install and upgrade your application
anywhere in your really at least let's
open one up and see for ourselves so
grab a tarball extract it somewhere and
at the top level you will see the
following folders there's spin er TS lip
and releases now bin there's a
convenient strip in there which has just
the name of your release so it's like in
my release and you can use that to
easily start your release you do pin my
release for ground for example er TS
that's basically the Erlang runtime
system the emulator nothing too
interesting to see here but you do want
to make sure it is there you can belt
releases without including the FPS but
if you do want to use hard upgrades you
do want to make sure it's part of your
release lip that's where the actual sort
of meet of your application lives all
your compiled source code in the form of
beam files they are in various versions
subdirectories inside that lip now
there's that releases directory and this
is where it gets interesting now I
wonder why is the release directory I
mean we're looking at a release Meister
another releases directory inside now
when you use hot code loading you want
to avoid falling into the trap of
thinking of this release package is sort
of an immutable container that you would
just transfer to your server extract
unpack start stop and destroy each time
you do an upgrade it's not like that
think of it more like a house
that you would place somewhere once and
then over the course of the lifetime of
your system various files and folders
are gonna come and go like canons so
what's inside that release directory
metadata basically let's look inside
there is the dodger L file that's a
release resource file basically nothing
too interesting it just has your release
name your release version and all the
applications and the respective versions
that are part of your release the
all-caps
releases file keeps track of which
releases are installed on your target
system on this note it's same thing
basically so right now we're looking at
sort of an initial release package just
obviously when it gonna be that same
metadata about that release inside that
releases file but remember this is gonna
be extracted somewhere and then it's
gonna stay there forever and when you
install a new release the release
handler is going to modify that releases
file and tell you what's installed and
which one of this is current so then
there's that other 0:01 directory that's
the example of where and I'm using it
for this inside is a bunch of stuff like
the VM darks file and the assist config
basically just stuff to tell your VM how
to start itself and how to start your
release that's it for the initial
version if your release now it's time to
look at a second version which was built
as an upgrade release let's look at it
see what's changed so there's a real up
file that's short for release upgrade
instructions file and besides the
version number that's really the only
change in structure between and what I
call fuller initial release and an
upgrade release there is really no
notion of a upgrade only or delta
release there's only releases and
releases that know how to
upgrade from a given previous version of
themselves keep that in mind
confused me we'll look at the contents
of this relic file in just a moment
first I want to tell you about two
important modules that all of the other
tools depend on are called sis tools and
release Handler they're part of the sass
well that's SASL stands for I think
system architecture support libraries
application part of the OTP distribution
and you do have to list this sass law
app as a dependency if you do want to
cut upgrades because the release Handler
that's departed that is that you're
going to be calling when you unpack
install or remove releases on your
production system so the assess lab
needs to be part of your of your release
sis tools that's the sort of offline
release assembly module it does stuff
like write the boot scripts generate
develop file and zips up your tarballs
so let's now look at the heart of the
upgrade process the app ups and roll ups
now these are the actual instructions
that orchestrate changes to your running
system in a controlled way which is
exactly what we want now we've seen that
if you have a release and if you want
this release to be able to upgrade from
a previous version it needs to include a
relic file I certainly was confused
about the purpose of a pups versus
relapsed and how exactly they relate to
each other basically for every
application that's part of your release
so if you have an umbrella that's all
the applications you are yourself plus
all of the applications you pull in as
dependencies and if you just write one
app that's your app and your
dependencies so it's always a lot of
apps there
for each part of your app for each app
that's part of your release you do need
to have an app up file if you happen to
want to upgrade that app now these app
up files live in the Lib directories
next to their respective beam files of
that application but they are not part
of the release package directly because
when you assemble a release this tool is
going to compile and combine your all of
your app files into one single relabel
and only this single relic file is then
going to be distributed with your
release so that's something to keep in
mind let's look at an app file here it's
basically in our link term it's a triple
so first element that's the version
you're gonna upgrade to it's basically
your goal for this upgrade now these are
the versions of the respective
applications so you have to
differentiate between the versions of
each of your applications and there's
another version identifier for the
release which can be completely
different now
this app file tells us basically the
instructions to either upgrade from 0 0
1 that's the next two lines here or
alternatively if something fails or if
you just want to downgrade to down grow
it back to 0 0 once you read that first
user 1 as up from 0 0 1 and the next one
you read that as down to 0 0 1 and these
are basically lists of lists so you
first you can have multiple instructions
obviously this is just a very simple
functional change but yes also since our
list of lists you can actually have one
app up file that defines the process how
to upgrade from any number of previous
versions and you can put all that into
one app up file by just specifying
multiple down to and up from versions in
here you can apparently also use regular
expressions
as version number Sharron and you match
against a range of versions if you so
desire now here is that a pop file
compiled to a relevant I remember again
usually there are going to be multiple
app files compiled to single app file
but you can also obviously upgrade just
one application so it's got the same
structure pretty much on top there's
your target version now this time we're
looking at a release version which is
separate from the application versions
again it's got the same structure its
lists of lists of Lists so you get the
app from version Anthony down to version
instructions there you also see that
point of no return
what is that it basically just means if
anything goes wrong during the upgrade
process past that point of no return the
VM is gonna reboot using the old version
of your applications but you really
can't do many interesting things before
that point of no return so don't worry
about that another a few fun instruction
that you that you might find there apply
basically lets you run any function that
you wish as part of your upgrade process
you just specify the MFA identifier you
can use that for example if you wanna do
an a hole upgrade that changes the child
specs of your supervisors or one of your
supervisors and what happens is that if
you change the child specs that's only
gonna apply to newly spawned children of
those and it's not gonna affect the
existing children which is usually what
you want but if in case you want to mess
around with your supervision trees you
can use a function and apply it during
the upgrade restart new emulator don't
get your hopes up this is not hot
upgrade it's just basically means that
you can upgrade the ER link vm as part
of a release and what happens is that
the it's gonna start the new version of
the vm gonna shut down your old version
gonna start the new version of the vm
using the old version of your
applications
and then it's gonna continue with the
upgrade process ins gonna upgrade your
applications it's really a two-step
process sync notes that's interesting if
you've got a distributed Erlang setup
our elixir setup is the same thing
really when we're down here if you've
got distributed setup you can have your
notes apply the upgrades at the same
time and the mechanism whereby this
happens is that you have to start the
upgrade process on each of your node and
they when they get to this sing notes
instructions they're gonna wait for all
of the other notes in your cluster to
get there as well before continuing all
right so we've seen how modules get hot
swapped with looked inside a release
package inspect the develop file seen
some instructions that were generated
from vedepo files now we know our why
our epic files are not part of the
release package basically we got this
thing ready for deployment sitting
around wherever we built it now let's
look at some ways to get this thing on
to your servers the most common way
probably is to use something like SSH
copy the tar file over and pack it start
it and then if you get the tarsal extra
high-tech is that just never can
remember them later you can transfer
upgrades the same way just this time
you're gonna attach a shell to your note
and run the release Handler unpack
release install release or if you're
very lucky your tool that you used to
generate the release has equipped your
release with a convenient script you
just can go in and say been my release
upgrade now that's fine and it's great
you can script this to crazy Heights
deploy to multiple notes what have you
what I'm saying is that
if you have this sort of setup working
for you and if you're happy with it then
just roll with it there's really nothing
wrong with using SSH this way now some
of us aren't that lucky if you happen to
have messed around with releases you
might have seen this error this is what
happens when you build a release on your
for example Mac OS machine and then
transfer it to a Linux box and try to
start it there it just gives you this
syntax error apparently so
you really do want to build your leases
on a machine that is as close to your
production boxes as possible in terms of
CPU architecture it has to be the same
so you can't do cross compilation in
terms of OS it really also should be
almost the same for example this is
sorta UNIX and a real UNIX and that
doesn't even work so I wouldn't bother
I like containers to do that basically
if you're not familiar with that they're
like a like a VM just a little more like
way to start in a few milliseconds
they're super portable and the tooling
is great around containers with docker
so when you one thing you can do is on
the machine where you built a release is
start a container that's similar to your
products or doesn't even have to be that
similar to your products actually since
you're using containers so you start a
container which you'll release inside
and then configure your container so
that it starts to release in the
foreground
when this container is run for the next
time that's basically how containers
work and then you just seal that
container off basically ship it to your
browser now the tooling is really great
aground containers there's a lot of
tools to smoothly deploy containers
anywhere and it's it's gonna work well
again this is something you can totally
use maybe even should use except that
you're not gonna be able to enjoy hot
upgrades this way again if you can do
without sure go for that it's great but
what we really want is a way not to ship
those self-contained
containers but rather these shipping
releases without the containers but we
still kind of want to be able to smooth
them out these OS disparities here so
one thing you can do is build your
release inside a container and then pull
that out of the container and ship it
then to prod and start it there now you
could start it inside a container and
produce well or just a new host
depending on what you want now I really
like containers I use them everywhere
even though it's not strictly necessary
now I have left out one detail before in
order to build hot upgrade packages like
releases that know how to upgrade from a
previous version of themselves
you really need to have the previous
version that you're building the upgrade
from local to where you're building the
release so basically you want to have
some kind of way of fetching old release
packages to your build server or build
machine whichever you use now I guess
you could just ssh into prod and and
sort of steal the release from there but
that's not really something I'd
recommend you do better if you're at it
just get some place to store releases
and then you can configure your build to
pull from there build the upgrade and
push back into that store and from which
then you can deploy to wherever you wish
so there you have it pick whichever
deployment options feels right to you
now I want to talk about some of the
things that can go wrong and what you
should keep in mind when you do well
when you handle hot code and let's start
with messages now messages in mailboxes
they may sit there for a very long time
and therefore be really old so you do
want to make sure that your new code
that you're shipping is still able to
handle and understand
the old messages that maybe lying around
in your mailboxes also make sure that if
you happen to be running the recursive
loops that you do fully-qualified cults
once in a while so that you give your
modules the chance to sort of jump to
that new versions of the modules that
you're going to be pushing also make
sure you're receive clauses have
timeouts because the release handling so
that is when you apply to release has a
default timeout of I think five seconds
which you can of course override then
just think about that now next thing is
a biggie anonymous functions really are
the worst you don't even have to be
looking at them or executing them to
totally break things for example if I
send you an anonymous function and put
into your mailbox and you don't even
look at it and then my module gets
purged your process is gonna explode
so that's logical so try to really
refrain from sending anonymous functions
around if you do want to implement some
kind of callback style interface on your
servers just take an MFA instead that's
much more robust than sending funds
around next thing mix tasks right now
you cannot run mix tasks on releases yet
now this is probably gonna change in the
soonish future because mix is gonna sort
of become aware of releases and also in
development you're probably gonna run
releases or something like that I
haven't really looked into it too much
but just be aware of that and if you
really do need to expose some one-off
calls on your production box it's
probably just best to wrap that in a
shell stripped and spawn and lautering
shell that calls your functions related
to the missing mixed tasks you do want
to make sure that you can run your
migrations without mix
I'm proud what I like to do is just have
them run automatically and start up it's
easy now configuration sadly is a bit of
a mess right now you have so many
different ways of pushing or making
available a configuration to your
dependencies and many different
dependencies just have many different
ways of consuming that configuration you
just kind of do have to get familiar
with more than one way of providing
configuration to your releases now the
next version of distillery which is the
tool that you're gonna want to use when
you cut releases of elixir projects it's
gonna ship with a feature called what is
it
configuration providers that will
hopefully make things easier in this
regard so definitely look out for that
luckily these days we don't have to
write our handwrite our app ups anymore
rather tools like distillery they give
you a very clever app up generator that
compares your beam files that's also why
you need the previous version of your
release when you're building an upgrade
and that's great
usually works pretty well saves you a
lot of time kiss-up ups are really not
that special they're usually quite
boring to write by hand so if you've got
a very complicated upgrade situation
like if you've got many dependencies
between your modules and process and
notes and what-have-you
then it might produce a pups that may
look correct but fail to sort of upgrade
your system properly and that's bad you
definitely do want to test your upgrades
always if you have the time so what do
you have to do then is go in and
manually edit the generated a pups
usually it's just a case of reordering a
structures so nothing too terrible again
but imagine if these a pups are being
generated on a remote machine like a CI
server
there's really no easy way to mess
around during release generation with
you're a pop phallus so it's really hard
to do you used to be really hard to do
because distillery too is also gonna
ship with a way to define app up
transforms now let's place like it's
just a a call back module that's gonna
receive the generated app up
instructions and it's given a chance to
do whatever it wishes to these
instructions before returning them and
then they will be written in your app up
now this is a fairly low-level primitive
for sort of fixing your app ups and I'm
I'm just excited what the community is
gonna come up with to make this easier
for example one idea would be to use
module attributes to guide that app up
generation process where can for example
define the load order of your modules
versions lastly you do want to make sure
that your versions of your applications
always change between releases now or
else you you cannot upgrade what I like
to use instead of these human readable
version strings if you just happen to
sort of build and and run your own
product is to get commit hash that's
guaranteed to be unique you don't have
to think about incrementing it by hand
each time but you do want to make sure
that these version numbers are sortable
in a way that a newer version of your
module or your app has a greater version
number this took me a while to figure
out just a simple way took me a while to
figure out because my hope my upgrades
were randomly failing simple way to fix
is just repent the UNIX timestamp of the
commit for example so your version
numbers gonna end up looking like this
which I find really beautiful now that's
the snippet I used to generate it
it's gives you just the commit times
time and the hash of the last commit
that changed something in a given
directory so you can use this
or umbrella apps where you want only to
increase the version number of an app if
you actually changed something in an app
think of it like when you get a github
repo store you see on the right side
there a diversity sort of last commit
hash to change something inside a
directory now that's a lot of
boilerplate I wish we could automate and
thanks to all of you and the community
the situation around releases has gotten
so much better
and today we're we're lucky to have some
very well built solutions that you can
really pretty much drop into your
project and configure and then you're
usually ready to deploy your stuff now
if you want the absolute smoothest
deployment experience and I'm not
affiliated with them any in any way
check out giggle lexer they're a
platform as-a-service
specifically designed for elixir apps
surround by next Googler it's got the
ease of Heroku but respects your
in-memory state and supports hot
upgrades and it comes with a CLI tool to
push configuration it's got a remote
shell and it's got really great
documentation so definitely check that
out if you're interested in that now on
the other hand if you do want to run on
your own infrastructure I'd suggest
using distillery as certainly low-level
primitive two assembler release and then
combine that with either bootleg or a
deliverer to sort of handle all the
auxillary stuff like Auto versioning
your stuff getting the correct previous
releases downloaded to your build box
compiling them maybe even on a separate
build host and deploying to all your
servers now bootleg is the Younger
project of these two it's written in
elixir delivers sort of the first
project that got this really right both
are very solid choices I suggest you
pick one of them on top of distillery so
it's part of my bachelor thesis that I
started last year I set out to develop
yet another release tool called it beam
up now don't get your hopes up
it's really not something that you can
productively use right now it's sort of
research project if you will that's
definitely not production ready there is
no documentation it doesn't even work
with mix you'd have to compile your
Elektra project with rebar three two for
this to work right now
yet I want to take a moment to just show
you what I have in mind and what I'm
working on right now so it's based on
dr. the architecture is really similar
to what I showed you before you've got a
central release door and let's let's
just get started it's really easy it's
supposed to be easy that's sort of to go
let you newcomers to lecture like myself
can just use something to get something
out of the door and just have like this
lucky moment so you do run this curl
pipe shell thing on each box to get the
beam up CLI tool gives you that on every
machine then you go to your box where
you want to run your store say beam up
store you know what this does is it's
gonna spin up an HTTP server which is
gonna accept and store your releases
next you can go to your either your
laptop or your CI server now another
thing this this tool is really designed
to be completely hands up in operations
to you should be able to run this on on
any CI server and don't have to worry
about configuration or scripting or any
parameters so you go to your project
folder you point the beam up tool
actually stored it if just deployed just
do that with an OS environment variable
because they're super easy to setup Mon
CI servers usually you can do project
directives a beam up built and that's it
there's no arguments no up from version
no nothing that you'd have to do or
what's gonna happen is the beam tool is
gonna pull down the docker container
that includes Erlang for your system
architecture in the correct version and
it's going to start that container it's
going to go inside the container it's
gonna pull the correct version of elixir
for your project it's gonna catch that
on your host
and it's gonna try to figure out what
built tool you used for your project and
it's gonna compile your project before
it's compiling it's gonna look at the
sort of get versions and rewrite them
and it also makes sure that you have
included DSS lab
so then composite your project it also
pulls from the store by HTTP all of the
previous releases for that project and
unpack them in the correct locations and
sort of coaxes the tools to build
upgrade releases from them and it
concatenates all of the upgrade releases
it just built into one single write up
file package that into a fresh new
upgrade release and pushes that back up
to the server and it also exits cleanly
so it doesn't leave like an underscore
build directory floating around on your
project so let's now look at how you
start up in node go to your node point
it at the release store again and you
also want to say the name of the release
that you're gonna want to run because
when you've got an umbrella project you
what usually usually do is if you want
to select this host runs this in this
app and that other house trends that
other app you cut multiple releases from
your umbrella project and each have a
different name so you tell the node
which release name you're gonna want to
run and point it to the store and that's
basically all you have to do it's gonna
do the same darker magic and a pull the
release unpack and install it it's also
going to subscribe to the store so when
you use to be much to look build and
push another version into the store all
your notes are gonna get notified and
then they can just pull that release and
apply it while running so there you have
it again it's not something you can or
should use in production right now or
even look at it the codes horrible it's
really just more of a playground for me
to try out ideas it'll probably be read
this summer I just wanted to share with
you some of the ideas how elixir
deployment could work again I want to
point you to giggle ixr or distillery in
combination with bootleg and a deliverer
I think these projects are amazing they
do a lot which feels right to me
community is great so that's it I hope
my talks given you some ideas maybe
cleared up some confusion around two
releases and maybe even made you excited
to try shipping your coat while it's hot
thank you
you
