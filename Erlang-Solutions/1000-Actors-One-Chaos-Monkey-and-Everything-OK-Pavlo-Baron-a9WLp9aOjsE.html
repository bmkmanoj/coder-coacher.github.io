local German working for consulting
company as the data technologies spoke
to eccentric and we are well socializing
towards feast I'm specializing in
highland leading-edge technologies
publishing them with customers going and
just risking my own asses
to prove that something is actually
working on setting about optimizing the
infrastructure code for them to the
proconsul hello so my background is i
started in that can 2005 trying to find
a solution to paralyze a interest
calculator written in c on civil
suffered a be used for that so it
couldn't utilize several course the
machines are you looking for means for
tools after this or stomach on your leg
pretty face and pull back the click from
then on well making it a little better
just decided to write a book actually
put a half years to write another group
which are loving you have just one guy
is in this room because you listened
colony temperatures asked questions at
the end of the presentation the first
person to ask
it's actually probably not that funny
spread this is awesome but well I do my
best describe things like comment and I
will go for some niggas get well and
also described managing your
actually the problem with this focuses
officially is jungle but it's it's
eighty percent products oh well it shout
and see so it doesn't really matter John
as well as far as so you should just
consider women nobody just want to have
it because of German clever just give it
to ok so well what is this talk God
might have a look for ways how to
introduce customers well developed
basically and architects rather than it
resistant to the process of earnings is
lame and how the young works and what
are the advantages what are differences
between this one and the world of Java
and whatever so I was always seeking for
new ways to describe this and so I mean
very basic thing about running is
telling we have any impact or model
which is awesome we have an active
you can crash actors and you can bring
them back well then we'll do people that
back so this is the point here is this
presentation we describe this what is
the best way to describe something which
has act as a coordinator
that is what's with the movie right so
let's get this sequence
so how much is Gemma
it's a consequence of a come
on the second Matrix so the two skiers
have meals which is the anti-hero well
when you think of the machine the
property of patience with this is how we
can consider this
and it has one big it's called meal and
this problem has 25 meal
any ghosts so inches with its
reproducing himself Neil crashes kills
some agents
they keep coming back coming back
this is something that really fits well
for the company on course to the concept
of actually how the OTP abstract work on
the
so
just what you and I we just go home the
problem is that it would make sense if I
will stand around 45 minutes setting
anything I don't have that much to say
to because we want to explain this top
of that so yes so far they do we have we
sure have curling experts for experts
here you have people like for absolute
beginners are just wishing to find out
who you listen we have here listen so
bad because this is this conference or a
busy intersection for people to learn
about funny when you wanted me to do
real hardcore unacceptable to use it
accurate in San Francisco they will find
real hacker or speaking about things
like the preparation of several years
from standing anyway so what is the
actor model in terms of running
think of all important processes don't
think of small units of work which are
able to run parallel the commercial
region estate well you can make them
sheriff state today basically are not
sharing in the state they can interact
only by passing a synchronous messages
to each other so Carrie actor
Nelson from this mail was just a queue
where they stay up messages and punitive
to work your way through his messages
where you can do it selectively however
you like this is the way commerce so the
very same thing about develop the app or
the
system at all is that this actor model
is being
so the best way the Connecticut corner
is cut the whole application of the very
small pieces that are all paralyzed
while you believe various going to
several decisions that put work against
up anyway all this small units must be
small enough machine to small enough so
they cannot influence the stability of
the whole thing because the second part
of the business of the holiday p.m. is
that you can crush any process and well
actually you can you want aggression
across every process which has a hundred
some data wherever because the concept
is called leathercraft and the HKS when
we have massive parallel system water
system which is big enough can we
predict every possible error situation
so what you do is there you will have
like contracts in has your API call
switched on like that wages will ensure
that very very hard things will be
caught but all the rest can crash it
will crash processes and even
implemented in the way robotically helps
you we will get this product process is
coming back again automatically of
course there is still a possibility to
have process crashing because of the
same and this is good out of it it's the
state state is losing its learning
itself Museum well let's call it in
functional programming languages from a
community cultural programming and
programming languages is from hospital
but still it's functional enough to list
that you don't really have objects so
when we wanted well encapsulate
something it will be helped it will have
to be typically a parameter to her
either to your function call then you
will you cannot even modify this one
because there is
so you will create new state you will
just throw it off as the result of the
function county would you get the things
like these this abstractions is that
this state can be sterilized can be
attached to the next all functions like
message handler or something so you get
the previous day when your wrist roses
crashes the state that external might
state will be reapplied and you didn't
lose anything still there is still a
possibility that actually the state is
the reason why the force is crying so
when you reapply the same state process
to the pressure vanity and then again
that's why you can either define the OT
this is the second part I will displayed
you can define from making strategies
and bring them up how often they aren't
allowed to crash and how often they will
be brought up for the whole thing
impression about itself so in watching
movie well let's just from the same
sequence at all
p
and even one even better half have a
father like jobs here in but is
everybody see
so we have anxious with firing up a
couple of notes of yourself pasquali
little thing of course Agent Smith is in
so well it's not absolutely same to sync
with with the movie because of the
monuments like in a second exactly stuff
like that I think it's just showing so
what you see here for those who got no
this concert this is a bit this is a
processing in 10 ATM with one colonel
roses are operating system pasta to you
have up to 22 that Upton 22 the 27 posts
the small movements of work that kurani
Karim well theoretically as soon as they
don't consume memory you're fine when
they start consuming memory looks like
350 minutes or something it's much so
this is a bit and what you see here is
that me or not how about I've
implemented this is that New York I mean
you are surrounded by a bunch of agents
with it doesn't see
all environments at some point he sees
several Smith he kills them and still
thinks he reduces their number what
actually happens behind the scene is
kinda seems that it just keep coming
back but we need this let's just be
processed people of matting then there
is no real emerging company event
visiting the element will get it for
free what this is a configuration of
operations okay so well the sequence
will run one another one there is a
couple of that was here the whole night
races Wallace had the cloak of several
acres there is this agent Jackson that
you have seen the gears for probably
three seconds or something there is this
woman which is our second there as long
as supplies selected running itself so
what is for to be more multi-piece
what's the secret sauce when you want to
implemented professional real
professional
this gives you have a real basic
abstractions that the meat is not our
best well well the best utilizing the
concepts of what he thought of what the
darling p.m. please the abstractions are
the first abstraction free to talk about
is the application so you can package
your application running application in
the way when you can visualize things
like wats work for example where the
possum was speaking about this non zero
zero balancing stuff like that so when
you have a an ATM switch that are
standing around somewhere you don't want
to send the guide to operate the images
package and application in a way where
you can just send values that will get
upgraded dr. Fox walking there are they
be honest that you can have up to two
different variants same module same
piece of code running at the same time
there are rules when they will be
eliminated and new version is I'm sorry
rabbit if you see Jess already
it's just there for a number six okay
anyway necrovalley the application
something I will show you to go to this
step through it so the application is
just a one of your modules on up great
stuff and all that reckon you can see
you as a
so that's very important thing is that
this processes are the sea in the early
PM the hip they have seven same rights
so there is well not with madeline there
is it's a given that what process is one
important than the other be honest so
what you can do is you can leave this
processes together you can link them the
way where I've both of them know of each
other's existence so one month and
practice only other sneaks into this
process will crafted it together so you
can imagine infrastructure simply deal
on top of this t-shirt what you also do
is you can work at work forces well what
in the process game when it was a
process P that means the process because
doesn't happen right here that it gets
one it over eight so when there is no
crash well relation run or we will cut
between them but the very immersive did
you can trap exits the process so you
can make one process a little bit higher
priority what it does so it will get
automatically from the other will get
messages it smelled of strong to its
mailbox who access that processes are
dying some so it can actively react with
it in the silence also across the state
is crapping Nexus and sees okay process
P has practically decide let's bring it
back with something so happen
they're up to okay so is that and what
party gives you is it takes one level
high user distractions for this you
didn't have to supervise a little work
whatever they are the supervising
process typically doesn't do any work it
doesn't do computation wherever it's
only job is just to observe when
something crashed it has a declarative
configuration where you can say what is
the strategy when things crash so this
you provide spies the campus i'll okay i
will bring them one after the other i
will bring them all together
one of them credit I will bring them off
again what I will crush myself will see
some trash holes well our reach so in
this case of the whole hierarchy will
crash okay so
both are our kids on the others on the
other hand there is an abstraction of
the worker the work that is well
actually something that typically
doesn't suit wise people are still
prepping eggs into a market because
happens is you need to do this for
example many people gone for TB code in
your application but still the work that
just does work it reacts on messages or
whatever it does whereas there are
several different workout kite's neo TV
ecosystem so the supervisor can have
children if you only have children the
children are either borders for
supervisors themselves so you can have a
whole tree whole hierarchy of these
actors interacting with each other in
wait where supervisors can make all
decisions when a subtree of this crashes
I will bring it up completely back again
so you can ensure the moment is gross
down pipe system using this means you
still have a lot
invest a lot of thoughts how do you
prevent assistive like that but the
earlier the f combine the voting for you
to be framework it gives you a lot of
mechanisms how to do it for 40 so
workers are typically well the easiest
one the easiest one to say so so there
is an abstraction of generic so this
other can get a synchronous in pain in
synchronous coals will actually there
are no synchronous code house available
natively in the darling deal so there
are simulated cancers just spinning
waste and exactly so the server service
task is get messages with the state well
create a new state 30 from here in the
nest that's basically then the next very
important work out well it's kind of
Hebron it's it's a hybrid it's a it's a
fitness a machine is generic finish
Danish so what it is it's actually a
state machine we just can step up one
step three others until you decide to
die or just to stop the whole thing so
you typically take this episode I say
and coordinate of processes them I have
same here in my case is the matrix or
you can also call it the director of
this sequence you just four days just
sends messages to prime times just for
today's the sequence itself so before I
die speaking about the code let's just
look at the phone
let's start with
ah
so this is what is built with reebok so
whatever you do these days Miami to do a
real complex occasions this one is just
a small one you thought that we look at
apple sauce for that so rebar is much
more important than the waning build
applications all taking applications the
way they are being built originally a
step like 50 pages describing how
important so region 7 in straight lines
which is that you real hard sometimes
not predictable
deal with it so anyway this is this is
the application descriptor this
application is to pass some time what is
really what he is the environment
setting and this is the screen name or
for those of you who are not familiar
with the super soap running this curly
braces are well defined bubbles
everything that is that it started with
a small net is nathan and so what you
can do in early in the culling bianca up
to one of the wealth to different sorts
of actors when you have because in my
face thousands of Smith's you don't want
to call them like spirit once with 263
doesn't matter at all you just will have
a bit because ADA agents are being
handled completely differently you know
there are like a prohibition is played
this what Ellen vm gives me with garbage
connection of healing garbage connection
a process so you can actually have up to
two to the 27 of use in Holland young so
every single office has its own they are
not changing they are
messages so the garbage collection is
basically done breaking a process there
are there is a couple of exceptions to
this first of all the VA them the 800
memory is completely outside of this so
a textbook gets really how much connect
they just get reused as its symbol it's
just as simple it's not even a Marine
Corps screen it's simple to say
something that defies things and there
is also a memory of any sort of chap
memory foam we go by the risk we just
started with 64 bytes and finally some
pretty cool
as you have native mechanism of the
automation binaries is everybody you're
familiar with the term pathology results
reg exits
but this is a real cool thing because
what happened to me out there started
doing garlic is in every single language
I'm looking for pollination and I'm
desperate missing it oh right why not
why not really it should be simple so
I'm solid studying Haskell not hoping
even that will come back into mainstream
but it says it's pretty cool so anyway
exactly so you you can even call them
match binaries please please because
there is a difference by design it's a
bit long so anyway bigger primaries are
get preferences so you have a reference
column and processes are just keeping
references to do by the recent video
takes a hour they also keep references
to sub- and stuff a better food it's
only about this yet but in stock but
anyway big binaries will just get
referenced when when they don't change
you don't need to move around big
portions of data between processes for
one male cops to the other so it's just
the reference go in there and sometimes
there are situations where where my
processes don't release references
well you need to take care of things
like that crosses home plate right
through the world with in class when we
look in glasses you need to be realistic
ok Hector power so the screenplay is
actually just a sequence of bubbles
describing one step so i am using time
coordination here because I mean they
are all running a parent to child
exchanging messages killing each other
after that so i doona coordinate and the
whole screenplay down down down until
the next the last one with the smooth
move it stupid turns here with a five
to do what is accused this is the jetta
acceptance it's called matrix at the
center and well completely magenta the
cell
will have different going from A to B to
C in songs and what so you have
different states here by salt click
whatever so in my case is just seven
every single stab is more step and I
take just one puppet from the screenplay
we're using the screen their list one
after the other until it's empty cuz
that's it that is month and it keeps
sending messages to be after that you
find in the first embodiment of the
topic stepped on the missus section of
the coordination the rest of 17 in the
well in the actors themselves
ok so the next thing is let's look at
the main new supervisor well the main
supervisors joke Ian sits on top of the
hierarchy and if you find several
children who have and this is this are
all the actors so it finds a couple of
all children microcosm device the
supervisors like a case of
school with responsible for its own
children it's all flows and this is
basically how do you find the hole well
yeah
Smith supervisors pretty important
nothing happens happens there except for
it just provides a volatile api
functions with knowing things and to
find the current agents and it has only
one child as the pockets all smooth
closer and you just almost it he just
comes up it keeps I'd keeps coming back
and this is to the other gear for the OT
just gives you that you don't take care
of this again but also people who didn't
touch it yet most of you did but still
the process dies houses comes back the
process gets state we apply can go on
let's look at new yourself what he also
has different roles here has different
tasks here it has to think it has well
it gets asynchronous messages all the
time and it does something with that
like beating Smith's giving them more
difficult finity of the whole
coordination you can make it easily and
we'll get out of the differences but he
said in the talk about just to read the
code it's couple well things I have to
implement you like deciding based on
which weapon neo is using and how many
Smiths are around defining the ratio of
those two kill stuff so it's just
yeah meeting is just a five-coordinate
thing okay so what we reserve on that
first of all going is awesome yeah you
have known folks around I'm just getting
a musing on myself anyway well it is
also for assistance when you gather or
you want to have a message part of the
missile which is very interesting thing
also connected from the early in the am
excluding context you have a scheduler
or basically one scheduler home set up
on schedule be running amok for just
cutting itself uniÃ£o kind of simulates
an operating system it wouldn't really
but it does but it couldn't really rely
and cuddle and stuff like that so it
simulates a small operating system
that's why it's called processes okay so
it's this simulation mr.
the United States so we have a schedule
of which is responsible for rounding but
everything that has to happen we can
just draw from this key and this fuel be
just empty one after the other so we all
will pick up the process will didn't
work then the next one next one I always
basically raising hell this is even also
the digitization of people and depend on
your criticism so compared to know for
example is it also has entirely then
prove of course but it's about the same
promotes I will so the next thing is
that a process gets a number of
reductions since buy a coat and time
relative thing by proper instructions in
denton time relevant thing so it will
include will be off schedule when the
reduction size zero so just calm down
okay the next one is on so this is how
it ensures this part of the lizard
tournament of course you can pump
productions you shouldn't do this but
again in cases where you just can't
predict where I just don't want it to be
off-schedule by the scheduler in some
cases
complex computation or even
synchronization is something that almost
nobody does this but I dated every
single code base pretty busy anyway um
so what do we learn is not only the girl
is also in case you have possibility to
quickly stop we wanted a mathematical
system they think of 22 the 27 parallel
processors being able to handle it gives
you this is this for free but it feels
like getting this for free with you when
your program you still have to take care
of a lot of things you would take
everything care of berries because
feminism leads at some point to
synchronization we do too much results
whatever it ensures through its
abstractions that the concurrency
doesn't hurt that much nothing is
four-time shamanism because I suppose
it's a reduction based on schedule since
what I'm sheriff we wouldn't take her
leg for my heavy applications
area something you probably notice to
see about that when we get there is that
when you when you when you do this
integration propelling and see you will
run into the sequel and where this C
code takes forever or completely blows
of the scheduler that s actually manage
the process running into the Seco so
well if people are their excellent as
far as i know are well at least
collaborating and investigating how they
can teach the seco even into operating
with the scheduler as well but from my
point apiece yes experimental but maybe
maybe a successor somebody so anyway so
the concurrency doesn't hurt that much
think of things like single assignment
so you cannot override thing in
or even accidentally so you always have
to create a new state thing from the
previous thing you will not override it
the society peg fees for freedom and
asynchronous message passing the only
guarantee gives you that between two
processes but process a sense a
prostitute process P messages could be
the same order between them two is the
only guarantee you have a builder
legalities because there are not death
but for many situations where you have
millions of connections from clients for
example chat rooms and stuff like that
whether you interact with each other in
the same goes with this is the best
place to be a perfect fit for that
education is based on
about this because my saying is that you
can also use your shoes you know that
the bubbles of one but you probably
shouldn't do this but anyway people
experimenting with the sinister pre-war
way and um yeah so this is basically
thank you very much
before they went questions I need to get
rid of this one so once again who is
everything that talked about much more
spite of the truth so again is speaking
German ok the question is
what same which was agent Jackson you
love speaking German man ro s one agent
Jackson wasn't implemented in Java who
said nice okay get open congratulations
so let's get some questions I think
any questions
this is the best form of a problem
before they knew it well and you need to
have very specific this game probably
relative benefit from of the animals
it's also not everybody's day because
people are well used to think
procedurally step hop step and suddenly
you realize a lot of terrible things
how the coordination of the Boston right
now I'm back to the question we need to
have two spaces when you really have you
wouldn't do something like that you can
do this over 10 GS well community it's
not the point whether it's about massive
problems but in stop when you cannot
predict how many actors will run around
how many it is how they will interact
with each other lumu you will create a
model you first need a model and this is
what OTP gives you when you define
children and configuration command this
declaration of you know what should what
you guys doing what that and whatever
you have a small then you can decide
okay it needs to be active things
because I have different roles i have
different priorities that have different
happiness of man and i have a lot of
messages flying around between them but
behold this is not that easy it's really
not easy I have to this because my leg
was actually my very first touch of
acrimony microscope
oh my god I mean voting is a pretty
simple languages language you start with
it like well after two weeks you can
write code right the real complexity
comes to be with you vm itself and
coming to what we have offers and this
takes years probably centuries to
properly understand it properly please
it is kind of nice and efficient bad
no texts
no request for him you'll be run on the
scheduler because he gets number of
adoptions which means you get the latest
also also get wrong situation that's
important I group yet some research
doneita see I think I can bump up my
reduction says he'll and still the
patient I'm your captain promoter like
out of the box I'm just kidding pretty
good you can do this but it's kind of
silly deprecated of them all for nothing
wrong in it and then yo yo we were kind
of cotton munchkin rubber on the bottom
no now well notice fix the one by one
single thread
this is this a section in comparable
with Hollywood would have a well early
application with a lot of Newton balls
and those nipples will decide how well
you can share on the work and this is
comparable North has its own use cases
actually because what what it does well
is completely eliminates and currency
from you but you cannot scale this in a
way you can scale this of you are linked
via this is the comparison doesn't work
is another yeah I think a great example
for the filling these places as you can
see it as a supervisor tree and under
that there's a bunch of processes and
you if you imagine a web server running
this by mojo registering there's
thousands of calls coming in each
recipient and it's like one business
must completed their their clients and
it's always singing and validating
through this what actually happens
inside it the only it was the surprise
at the top it was definitely running all
the concurrent parts that are behaving
and is one of them the just excites
invalid office and that process that
that's in effect individual all dies and
another one comes up for this place and
the result of that is you spend this
time we're about huge phases of
production things you didn't think of
every time a new browser movie comes out
comes up new quirks and new problems and
the recent war your castle
and then your code is running fine and
you can sit there and say show me the
things that are crashing more often and
you can look at that a little bit in
real time and you can decide what to do
that and most other languages all it's a
tour of human things down you forgot
this each case and your titles as
implications down and the middle level
setting is their supervisor tree is
fresh in compression compression it gets
restarted higher up well the tongue real
time is a kind of software of life yeah
panics have a flow of these things
because the users will be well anyway
notice as for example well is it's good
for when
processes or connections or wherever
when you just push against this is also
for them whenever you have to do these
connections and want to keep them or two
happy state of sunrises something that
would probably go down again but the
decision is very difficult I mean it's
most of the time is kind of well belly
driven like I like working outside so
anyway those of you who don't do it
early but want to try it I will suggest
we can learn language advanced knowledge
with the OTP from the beginning because
without you to be you'll probably well I
don't know for most of the programme's
this is the best sense of stretches with
you can't even write
without the abstraction still crosses as
passing messages to stuff like that but
but you have much more best practices to
follow that to keep in mind the OT it
just gives you forever account whatever
you do you're far enough with this
program you will I promise you will find
a way because it doesn't offer what me
then you can decide if you want to do to
provide along the area it's all called
behaviors that by the way engagement so
well you can even even met own behaviors
and extend the system movie but at some
point you will just say that come on set
let's do it the classic way leave a
