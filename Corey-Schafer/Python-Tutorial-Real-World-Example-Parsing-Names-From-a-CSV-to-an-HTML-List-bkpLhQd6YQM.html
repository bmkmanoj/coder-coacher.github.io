this video we're going to be taking a
look at a real world problem that I ran
into and we'll walk through how to write
a Python script to solve this so I've
done videos like this before and
everyone seem to find them useful now
the difference between these videos and
my normal videos is that I'm not going
to go into as much step-by-step detail
of every little step I'm just going to
walk through how I came up with a
solution and you can follow along so
here's what I want to write a script to
do so some of you may not know this but
for anyone who contributes to this
channel through patreon I list everyone
on my websites contributors page as a
small way of saying thanks well the
problem that I'm running into and it's a
great problem to have is that the
contributors are getting up into the
numbers where it's hard to keep track of
who i've added to the site and who i
haven't so i want to automate this
process with python so that i don't ever
miss anyone
and luckily patreon provides a
downloadable csv file of all the
contributors which will make it easy to
automate this process so if you don't
know what csv files are it stands for
comma separated values and basically CSV
files allow us to put data into a plain
text file and use some type of delimiter
which is usually a comma to separate the
different fields so in this video we'll
be learning how to use the CSV module to
parse the CSV file count the
contributors and then put their names
into an HTML unordered list that I can
drop in to my website so let's go ahead
and get started now first of all I don't
want to expose anyone's information here
so the CSV file I'm going to be using
for this video takes out all of
everyone's personal information and it
just has fake names instead of the real
names but other than the names being
fake this is almost identical to the
file that I downloaded from patreon so
I'm going to open up this file it's
called patron CSV and when I first
opened up this file there are a couple
of things that pop out to me when I
first see this so first of all our first
row is our headers and so we can see
that it says that the information in
this file is going to be first name last
name email pledge lifetime status
country and start now I really don't
know what all those fields mean but
basically I'm only concerned with the
first name and last name so that's okay
also I noticed that there are a couple
of lines here
after the header that aren't actual data
it's just a line explaining the people
below this line are the ones who've said
that they don't mind being listed on the
website as a contributor and then it
looks like the actual people start on
line five here now on patreon you can
also opt out of rewards so there's
likely a line in the CSV file that is a
cut off for people who said that they
only want to contribute but don't want
to be listed on the website and actually
if we look down here at line 35 we can
see that cutoff point where it says that
the people listed below this point do
not want the reward and don't want to be
listed on the website okay so now we
have a basic idea of the data that we
want to capture so now let's go ahead
and start coding this so in the same
directory I have a blank file here
called parse CSV pi and I'm going to
open that up now first thing I'm going
to do is import the CSV module and you
may have looked at that CSV file and
thought that hey that doesn't look
difficult to parse so why not just use
the split method on each line of the
file to get that information and it's
true that you could do that but the CSV
module just makes parsing these files so
much easier so for example if someone
put a comma or something in their name
for some reason then we wouldn't want to
split on that and also the CSV module
will handle new lines and everything
like that
and it just takes all the guesswork out
of working with things like this so
we're going to use the CSV module okay
now I know that my end goal is to output
an HTML unordered list so I'm going to
create an HTML output variable and set
this to an empty string for now and
we'll populate that as we go and I also
know that I want to capture all the
names of everyone that I want to add to
that output so I'm going to create an
empty list of the names okay so now
let's open up our CSV file just like we
would open up any other file so we're
going to use a context manager here and
we're going to say with open and this is
called a patron CSV and we want to read
this file so we're going to pass in and
are there and we'll just call this data
file now I'm going to show you two
different ways to parse the CSV file
first I'll show you the most common and
then I'll show you my preferred method
so
the first way we'll do this is with a
CSV reader so I will say CSV data equals
CS v dot reader and now we're going to
pass in that data file and actually let
me make this text a little bit bigger
here just so everyone can see as we're
going along I think that's better so
that reader method should have parsed
the CSV file and put the data into our
CSV data variable so let's print out
what we have so far to make sure that it
looks right so I'm going to come down a
couple lines here and just print out CSV
data and run that ok so right now we
just get this CSV reader object now you
may have been expecting all of our CSV
data now the data is there but this
object is an iterable and behaves like a
generator and what that means is that we
have to loop over it to get each line so
you can either do that line by line or
you can just convert it to a list and
get all that data at once so if we
converted this to a list and printed it
out then we can see that it prints out a
lot of information here in list form now
it's not the easiest to read but it
looks like our data so it's a good start
so now let's actually print it out line
by line so we can see this a little bit
better so to do this we can say for line
in CSV data and now we're just going to
print out each line and run that and
when we run that we can see that it is a
lot easier to read so if we scroll up to
the top and look at the first two lines
we can see that the first line has the
headers and we really don't need those
other than to know which index each
field is located so the first name is
that index 0 and the last name is that
index 1 and it looks like the second
line is the line telling us that these
names we want to put on the website and
then the third line is the first person
with the name John Doe so we really
don't need these first two lines here we
just want to get the names of the people
so if anyone has seen my video on
generators we can actually step over
values and then iterable by calling next
so let's call next on our CSV data twice
before
printing out this loop so we'll just say
next CSV data then we will copy that and
paste it in again now we don't need to
capture the output from these and any
variables we just want to throw them
away so now if we run this and scroll
back up to the top then we can see that
now our first line is the first person
of John Doe okay so great now let's
remove our print statement well actually
before we do that it's not obvious why
we're running next twice on the CSV data
here so it's important to comment non
obvious stuff like this while we're
going along not only for other people
but for yourself also so you can come
back to this code and a few weeks and
have no idea why we ran these two lines
here so let's just go ahead and make a
comment that says we don't want headers
or first line of bed data
okay so within our loop here we're
looping over every person in the CSV
file now remember that the first name is
index 0 and the last name is index 1 so
let's go ahead and add each name to our
list of names that we created at the top
now to do this we'll say names dot
append now we want to append the a
string of the first name space last name
and to do this I'm just going to use an
F string and then these braces for a
placeholder and we'll say line and then
index of 0 for the first name then a
space then another bracket for the
placeholder and then index of 1 for the
last name now like I've said if you've
never seen a string with an F in the
front like this this is called an F
string and they're new to Python 3.6 so
if you're not using 3.6 or later then
this isn't going to work for you you'll
have to use a regular string format now
I'm really liking these F strings so far
and basically it's a much simpler way of
doing string formatting so if you'd like
to see more about them then you can
watch my video on strings where I go
more in depth into all the different
ways to format strings but basically all
we're saying here is that we want a
string with the value at index 0 of the
line which is the first name and then a
space and then the value at index 1 of
the line
which is the last name okay now what
we've appended those let's print out all
the names that were appended to that
list since that's a global variable we
can print that outside of our context
manager all the way down here at the
bottom so we're going to go down to the
bottom and we'll say for name and names
and then we'll just print out the name
okay so this is looking good it looks
like we have the first names and the
last names now if we scroll through our
names here then we can see that one kind
of sticks out and this is that no reward
value so if you remember there are names
in this list who opted out and didn't
want to be included so every name after
this no reward value here shouldn't be
added to our list well if we look back
at our original CSV file here we can see
that this no reward line has a comma
after no reward so this should get
parsed as a first name so let's add in a
check for a first name of no reward and
then we'll break out of our loop as soon
as we see that value so within our loop
here we will say if the index 0 which
should be the first name is equal to no
reward then we are just going to break
out of that loop now before I run this
we should note that the name before no
reward over here in our file is Maggie
Jefferson so when we rerun this this
will hopefully be the last name in our
list of names so go ahead and rerun this
and when we rerun that we can see that
this fake name down here of Maggie
Jefferson is the last name and list so
that works ok so now that we've tested
to make sure that our names are right we
can go ahead and just remove that list
where we're printing or that loop where
we're printing out all the names now
we're pretty close to being done here so
the hard part is over now we just need
to get these names into an HTML
unordered list so that I can drop them
into the site so first on the site I'd
like to list how many supporters there
are so we'll first add that to our HTML
output with paragraph tags and to count
how many there are we can just use the
length of
our names list so I'm going to say HTML
output plus equals because we want to
append to this then I'm just going to
use another format string here to put in
these values okay so like I said I used
another X string here and we're using
these HTML paragraph tags here that
we're adding in now the only Python data
that I'm adding in is the length of the
names of that names list so when this
gets printed out it should substitute
the actual number there so just to make
sure let's go ahead and print out this
HTML output so print HTML output and
I'll run that okay so apparently there
are 30 people in that names list so now
let's create our HTML unordered list
with each name so we'll add an unordered
list to our HTML output and I'll do this
above where we're printing that output
so I'll say HTML output plus equals and
then an unordered list in Python now I'm
going to put a new line there first an
unordered list is this UL tag now that
new line that I added in will just make
it a lot easier to read when we actually
print this out so now let's loop through
all of our names and add each one to an
HTML list item so if you aren't familiar
with HTML then don't worry about it too
much it's more about the process of just
automating this process that we're after
here so right here we'll say for name
and names and now we want to add each
one to that HTML output so we'll say
HTML put plus equals ok and this is
another epstein here so first we're
putting in a new line with a backslash
in and then we're putting in a tab with
the backslash T and then the list item
is this Li tag here and then we're
putting the name this is the Python
variable that we're using it's going to
sub
to this out and then an HTML these
forward slashes close out an HTML
element so we're closing out that list
item okay and now after we have all
those list items they're outside our
loop we're going to have to close off
the entire list altogether so we'll say
HTML output plus equals and we'll close
off that list item with a ford slash ul
and let's not forget to put in a new
line there at the beginning just to
clean up how this prints out okay so now
let's print this out and see what
everything looks like so I will raise
our output here okay so this is looking
good so at this point I think that this
is the exact output that we wanted so at
this point we could be done but I wanted
to show you one more thing I told you
that I'd show you one more way to parse
the CSV file that I prefer more than
using the reader method and what I
prefer is to use the dictionary reader
and we can use this by saying dick
reader now the difference between the
reader and the dictionary reader is that
the dictionary reader turns each line
into a dictionary instead of a list and
the dictionary has each field as a key
and then the data as the values so let
me just loop through and print out these
values so you can see what this looks
like so first let me just comment out
these lines where we're doing all of our
looping and everything and I'm also
going to comment out the HTML output for
now and we're going to see what the
output of this dictionary reader looks
like and to do this we'll say for item
in CSV data and then we will just print
out each item so let's run that okay now
at first glance this looks a little
messy especially since my text is so
large here but each of these lines is an
ordered dictionary so the first line
with the field names is no longer here
now those are being used as keys for the
dictionaries so the first throwaway
value is still here as far as this being
the description of the Reward line so
this first ordered dictionary here is
our first line and if we look at our
second item now this is our first
person because we can see this is that
John Doe person so now instead of
accessing index 0 for the first name and
index 1 for the last name now we can
access those directly through the first
name and last name keys and I think that
is a lot more readable for anyone
looking at your code so now to get this
working again we're going to get rid of
this loop where we just printed
everything out and now will uncomment
out all of the logic here ok and now
that the headers are no longer included
in the output we only want to skip over
that one first value and let's see and
we can fix our comment here and just say
we don't want first line of bad data and
now instead of using index where we
access the items we can now use the keys
of first name and last name so now we're
going to say if the first name is equal
to no reward and then we want to append
the first name and append the last name
ok and now let's go down here and
uncomment out this HTML output and see
if this works so now I'll go ahead and
rerun this and if we scroll up we have
Maggie Jefferson here at the bottom and
if we scroll up we can see that there's
still 30 contributors and John Doe is
our first one so that seems to be
correct ok so it looks like our results
are good so it took a little while to
write this script but now it's going to
save a lot of ton of time by automating
this in the future and will also prevent
me from making any mistakes so one
reason that I'd like to show you all
these quick scripts that can automate a
repetitive task is just to show how you
can save a lot of time by writing a very
simple script I mean this script here is
only 26 lines and it's going to save us
a lot of time and I also want to show
that you don't need to overthink these
one-off scripts too much so I could
probably come into the script and add
error checking and also some kind of
object-oriented approach to this but for
what I want to use the script for I
really don't need it to be overly
complicated so if you have some problems
that you think that you can automate
then just give it a shot and don't think
too much about how perform
or clean everything is it's just a great
way to learn is just by doing and
experimenting now if any of you are
interested in a more detailed look at
parsing CSV files and writing CSV files
then I am putting together a video
specifically on reading and writing CSV
files that I'm going to record very soon
so be on the lookout for that okay so I
think that is going to do it for this
