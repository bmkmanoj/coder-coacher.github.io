going to be the next part in working
with the ArcGIS
API for JavaScript when we finish with
the first part we had a basic map over
here that just has a very simple gray
background and it doesn't have any
functionality if we look over here at
the script that we used we just have a
great ice map with a zoom set to five
and we put in a sample location here
just a an easy walk through that we took
through from from their examples but now
when a lot of people get to this point
they don't really know where to go from
here they want to add some functionality
to the map but they you know don't
really know how to do that but you maybe
want to have a navigation bar up here
you want to have some different buttons
that do different things maybe you want
to have some buttons in here that switch
between base maps within your map so
that you don't have to do it within the
code so you know you could go in and
start adding in you know some buttons
and some functionality but it might look
bad and it might not work the way that
you expect to work so what I would
recommend is starting with a with a
template with a starting template the
most popular starting template that
people use is a framework called
bootstrap and getting the bootstrap
framework to work with the maps is a
little difficult but luckily ESRI has
already done that for us if we go over
here to google and type in ArcGIS
bootstrap then the top link here is a
link to one of their github repositories
called bootstrap map j/s really quick
I'm just going to go over here to s Rees
page on github and you can see that they
have a lot of code that they put out
here so if you work with RGS a lot I
highly recommend that you bookmark this
page it's you know something useful to
check out from downtime and it's not
only JavaScript you can see here they
have
some Java some ActionScript some c-sharp
and some Python a bunch of different
things so it's extremely useful but if
we go back over here to this bootstrap
map j/s they have a sample here that we
can take a look at and you can see they
have two samples one is dojo plus jQuery
and another one is pure dojo I prefer to
have jQuery I think it's easy to work
with and you know it's fairly popular
with the with JavaScript so if we click
on here
then we can see we have our top
navigation bar and we have a basic map
so this top navigation bar is already
responsive right out of the box and what
I mean by responsive is that it looks
good on mostly all screen sizes so say
that someone was browsing your map on
their mobile phone then there's a lot of
text up here on this navigation bar and
you see if we get down to a small screen
size that when this text text can't fit
anymore it pops into a hamburger menu
that just slides down and you know it's
really smooth and all that's built into
where we don't have to code all this
stuff ourselves from scratch so that's
really nice let's see they also have a
grid layout here where if you wanted to
have a sidebar on the right with your
map on the Left that's already set up
you can do a sinner map with a sidebar
on the left and a sidebar on the right
and last one you can do a sidebar on the
left with a map on the right this is
pretty neat this web map example that
they have here loads in a map from
ArcGIS online and it already has
functionality built in where you can
click on the map and you know look
through different features here they
also have a legend that can be maximized
and minimized over here yeah so a lot of
good examples right out of the box if
you look at the main page here they also
have this QuickStart mat j/s and
this is another set of templates and I'm
going to show you the difference between
between the two downloads so let me go
ahead and close this page and let's go
ahead and just jump into and download
both of these repositories and put them
on to our local server so that we can
start playing around with them if you
are familiar with git and github then
you can go ahead and clone these
repositories onto your desktop but if
you're not familiar or if you just want
to download a zip file then you can go
ahead and download zip download the zip
file here too and it's you know it's the
same thing so let's go ahead and
download both of these and I will
extract both of these files and I'm
going to go ahead and drag these over to
my local web server if you watched part
one then you should already know how to
have your web server set up so that we
can view our view our websites locally
let me I'm going to go ahead and call
this QuickStart map I'm going to call it
I already have a part one so I'm going
to call this part 2a and I'm going to
call this bootstrap map parts to B and
now I'm going to go ahead and drag these
over to my local web server okay and
let's see what these look like okay so
this is part one you can see up here in
the address bar I have localhost 888 and
it's in a folder called
RTS JavaScript and in a folder called
part 1 so I'm going to navigate over to
part 2a and this is the QuickStart map
j/s repository and if I go to 2 B then
we should see ok now we can see the
directory listing for the second
repository that we downloaded and now if
you click here on demo then you can see
it takes us back to the demo that we saw
or online at through this link here and
their repositories repository but now
it's running on our local web server so
you can see up here it's running on
localhost so let's go back over here to
let's go to the part to a folder and
this was the QuickStart map repository
through through ESRI now what this is is
this is just a lot of samples too that
you can keep referring back to if you
need to look at specific code or if you
want to start with one of these samples
and you can do that too it's a it's a
way to get you you know just to dive
right into it and have some specific
functionality right out of the box so
for example say that you want to switch
through base maps so let's just click on
the first base max base Maps example
here and you can see this looks a lot
like the map that we finished with in
part one with the gray base map but now
we have some functionality up here in
this base maps menu that lets us toggle
through different base maps if we go
back we can do they have a base Maps
widget where they replace the text-based
maps with these images so that you can
get a preview of what it will look like
they have I'm not going to go through
every single one of these you can
download it and look through them all
yourselves but they have a lot of cool
example here examples here they have the
geocoding they have it to where you can
load a geo JSON file using their
terraformer repository another
repository that they have up on github
so a lot of nice functionality that you
can use right off the bat down here they
have an html5 geolocation sample so if
your browser has geolocation turned on
and we can click up here on the
geolocation button and it should yep
soom to our location so these are a lot
of nice templates to get you started
using any specific functionality and you
can you can
dive in here if we look at sublime text
you can go in and look at all this code
you can look at all the examples that
they have and see exactly how they do so
for example you know the geo search they
have all the code here that you can look
through the starting templates that I
like to start out with is if we go to
art to be this is the one that we
downloaded that has the demo that was
the same online but instead of going to
this demo folder go down here to this
templates folder and within the
templates folder you have four different
templates here to get you started if we
click on full map template then we can
see we have a navigation bar up here at
the top we have a way to switch through
base maps and we have two links here
that are just dead links right now but
just to get you started let's go back
and look at some of the others we have a
geosearch template here which is almost
exactly the same as the full map
template it's instead but instead of
having a base Maps drop-down it has a
geo search button here that yes you can
search for certain things in the area
and it also has some default click
functionality here to look at some extra
metadata and we have two more the
starter template the starter templates
very similar to the full map template
also except you'll notice that the map
doesn't take up the entire bottom of the
screen here it has a map title and a
description that you can add in here
which is nice if you're making an online
map and you want to you know put in some
text to describe what your application
is about then this would be how you do
it and any of these samples let me pull
this up in sublime text if we go down to
part 2b and templates and starter
template any of these samples you can
just open
up the code and and just start going
through it and making modifications so
say instead of project name I wanted
this to be awesome map and then for
instead of bootstrap starting to but we
could do my awesome map template and if
we save that and reload it over here on
our local server you can see that the
title up here change to awesome map and
also our headlines change here so these
can templates you can just jump right
into and start making some changes
quickly
there's one last template that they give
you here if I go out into the directory
and go into this web map template this
is just the example that they have where
you can load in a map from ArcGIS online
so there and like the other examples
there's code that you can dig into in
here in sublime text and and you can see
exactly how they're doing that the
template that I usually start off with
is the full map template so let me go
ahead and open this up again and let me
go ahead and open it over here in
sublime text and I'll close down this
other one okay now if we wanted to use
one of these starting templates then we
probably want to make a new separate
project and then only bring in the code
that we're going to use because there's
a lot of extra code and we don't want
all the templates in our own starting
project so let's go ahead and walk
through that really quickly if I go over
here to finder within my local web
server let's go ahead and make a new
folder called we'll just call this
starter map and I'm going to open this
up in a new tab
okay so if I wanted to use one of these
starter templates let me go ahead and
open them up over here we're going to
need this source folder so let's copy
and paste this over what that source
folder is is it has the bootstrap CSS
and the bootstrap JavaScript and let's
go down here into the templates folder
and so say for example I wanted to use
the full map template let's open up the
full map template and we can copy over
the CSS and the HTML
okay and now we close these down and
pull it up in sublime here but now
you'll notice if I open up a new tab
here with this new starter map it does
not work and it doesn't work because
from where we move stuff around we
change the relative paths for a few of
the things so let's go down to our
starter map and let's open up the
index.html file and now there's a few
paths that are now different like for
example it's not in the our index file
isn't in the templates folder anymore so
we don't need to go up a few directories
here for this CSS style sheet we can
just it's just going to be in source and
CSS okay and let's see if there's
another one here
okay so here's another relative path
that is no longer up a few directories
anymore
so if we save that and then reload our
map over here let's see if that works
okay so now we have the map pulling up
let's test the functionality and make
sure that we can change these base maps
okay so that's working well now the only
thing left to do if I was to start with
this template then like we did
our first tutorial we want to separate
out our main CSS and our main JavaScript
into external files but this tutorial is
going on kind of long so I'm not going
to walk through that I showed you how to
do that in part 1 so if you want to know
how to move your move this javascript
file and this starting CSS file here
into an external CSS and JavaScript
files then you can just watch part one
and check that out so hopefully all this
was clear if you guys have any questions
don't hesitate to ask
and hopefully this was useful for you
guys and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
