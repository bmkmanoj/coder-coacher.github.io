going to be part one in a series of
working with the ArcGIS API for
JavaScript and this tutorial we're going
to create our first web map it's going
to be very basic but we're going to hook
up their API with our HTML files we're
going to set up an external javascript
file an external CSS file so with that
let's go ahead and get started
I'm already over here at the developers
dot ArcGIS comm website it is a website
where if you're going to be working with
this API lot and you should definitely
bookmark it it has tutorials the API
references some samples a lot of good
stuff so let's go ahead and go over to
tutorials and we will click on the link
here that says build your first web
application ok so they say right here
before you begin that you need to set up
a development environment so you need to
set up a web server and have a text
editor or an IDE to write your code in
I'm not going to walk through how to set
up a web server if you need to do that
then you can click on this link here and
they have a lot of good recommendations
as far as the text editor goes I'm in
I'm doing the coding over here in
sublime text I highly recommend it it's
very popular it has a ton of features
and I have a video on setting up a
development environment Devourer
environment and sublime text if you
would like to take a look at that I'll
put the link in the description so let's
go ahead and get started with our map
here ok so right now if I go over to my
tab here on localhost I have a very
basic website running that says this is
a demo page and this is the HTML for
that web page so you can see here this
is a demo so pretty much starting from
scratch and we're going to use their
walkthrough here to get our web map up
and running so the first thing is they
say to take this HTML
and we'll go ahead and paste that in
ours save it
okay and now we need to reference their
API and reference their API we just take
this code here and we paste this into
the head our HTML file and what we just
paste it in there was this is a link to
their stylesheet and so that will style
their map and their map container and
things like that and this is their
actual JavaScript file that's going to
give us access to to their home a P I so
if we keep scrolling down here they also
have some other styles that you can add
in but we're going to skip that right
now so loading modules here so on you'll
see this a lot on their samples that
they just put these script tags directly
into the HTML and that's fine with the
samples because they're all small
documents but if you're going to be
making if you're going to be making
large applications then it gets too hard
to manage all of your HTML and all of
your JavaScript in one file so instead
of doing what they do here and putting a
script tag let's go ahead and make a
body of our HTML and put that script tag
in there so instead of putting the
script tag in here like they do we are
going to take that out and we are going
to link to our external javascript file
right here and it's in the same folder
as our HTML file so all we need to do is
source equals script j/s
and now in script KS which I have
opening this tab right here now we can
add in any of the JavaScript code that
that that they provide for us so we're
actually let's not add this in right now
because they give a more complete
version down here at the bottom okay
let's take this in here and the code
that we just added in requires the
modules that we're going to need for our
application so this is the path to the
module the ESRI map and this dojo Dom
ready pretty much just make sure that
the website is ready to go before we
load up our code so that we're not
referencing anything that doesn't exist
yet and then this map here that we pass
in to the function that's just an alias
for this ESRI map here so we can
actually call this whatever we want but
you know just keep it something that
you're going to know what it is so map I
think is fine so let's go ahead and move
down here to step five create the map so
let's take this global variable format
and paste that in there and then they
give some code for the actual map itself
copy and we'll paste that right in here
where they put their comment and clean
up that indentation okay
let's scroll down and the last thing
that we need to do before this will show
up on our webpage is to drop this div
into our HTML with the ID of map div and
in our JavaScript you can see here this
doesn't have to be named map div in your
HTML it's that's just the name that we
assigned to it in our JavaScript so we
can change that to whatever we want I'm
going to go ahead and stick with map div
so go back over to our HTML file here
and then within our body above the
script tag put that div ID with the ID
of map div and go ahead and save that
and let's reload up our web page and see
if we see anything okay so we have our
first map working now so but you can see
that it doesn't take up the entire web
page that's because we haven't added any
style or anything to it yet it's just
extremely basic so let's go ahead and go
back to their tutorial and you can see
the bottom link here is style to page
and just like I said before with their
JavaScript they will also usually drop
in these inline styles into the HTML
file but just like with the JavaScript
we want to make that CSS file an
external file so that we can manage all
that stuff separate from the HTML we
don't want to mix and match our HTML and
JavaScript and CSS we want all those to
be separate so that it's easy to
maintain so instead of we don't need
this style tag here all we need to do is
in the head of our document at the very
bottom underneath their script and style
sheet we can put in our own style sheet
so link with the rel stylesheet and the
href is just the style CSS file
and save that okay so now we can copy
their styles here without the style tags
and paste that directly into our style
CSS file and save that and as you can
see all that does is gives 0 padding:0
margin:0 our HTML body and the map div
and okay now that's now we have a
full-screen map in our web browser and
you know zoom in and if we go back you
can already start messing with this if
you want if we go back to our JavaScript
file you know this new map right here
had a few options that had already added
in so for base maps you can change this
they have a few different base maps you
can use but if we change that to gray
and then reload our map over here now we
have the gray base map you can change
the starting zoom point to five you can
change your center location to you know
a different latitude and longitude and
just kind of experiment with it and and
see what it does so that's where we're
going to end it for part one in the next
video we will add some more styles to
this map we'll add in a top menu bar
here with some buttons so that we can
add in some functionality put in some
more modules so that we can do some more
cool stuff with the map so definitely
check that out and hopefully this was
useful for you guys and thanks for
