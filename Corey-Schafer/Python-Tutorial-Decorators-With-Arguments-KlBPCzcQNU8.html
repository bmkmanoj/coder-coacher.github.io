this is going to be a pretty quick video
and in this video we're going to be
going over how we create decorators that
accept arguments now several people had
requested this after I put out my
decorators tutorial video and in that
video I go over decorators in depth but
one scenario that I didn't go over was
creating a decorator that takes
arguments now this is something that
you'll see from time to time so for
example if I look at the hello world
application for a flask website now if
you've never used flask then it's not a
big deal I just pulled down their hello
world application so that we could see
an example of a decorator that takes
arguments now we can see here that their
routes are defined using these acts
route decorators and the string gets
passed in is the URL path and there's an
example here with the about page as well
this argument is the URL path to that
decorator so this is something that
you'll see from time to time and it's
useful to know how to do this so let's
go ahead and see how it's done now I
have a very simple decorator example
pulled up here which is very similar to
the one from the decorator tutorial
video that I've done before now just a
quick recap of what's going on here now
what we have is this display info
function that takes two arguments name
and age and it's being decorated with
this decorator function and up here with
this decorator function we can see that
it takes an argument that is the
original function and then nested within
our decorator function we have this
wrapper function and that just takes any
number of arguments or keyword arguments
now within our wrapper function we are
executing some code before our original
function executes so in this case we're
just printing out a line that said
executed before original function and
then we are executing our original
function and saving it to this result
variable and then after that we're
executing some code after our original
function and in this case it's just
another line that says executed after
the original function and then within
the wrapper we are returning the result
of that execution and then lastly here
outside of our wrapper function now we
are returning
that wrapper function of waiting to be
executed so if any of that was overly
confusing then you might want to go back
and watch that decorator tutorial just
to get a refresher of what's going on
okay so let's go ahead and run this code
as it is now so we can see down here we
ran display info twice with two
different names and two different ages
now every time we ran display info our
decorators also added the functionality
of printing out a line before and a line
after that wrapped function now this is
something that we've seen before in the
last video so now let's go ahead and get
our decorator function to accept
arguments so for this example let's say
that I wanted a customizable prefix to
all of these print statements within the
wrapper now this would be a good
candidate for an argument to the
decorator the argument that we pass in
will be that prefix now in order to do
this we're just going to add another
outer layer to our decorator so I'm
going to call this a function a prefix
decorator and now I'm going to have this
take an argument and I'm going to call
that argument prefix and then I'm going
to nest one more level deep and put that
decorator function inside that prefix
decorator now just a warning this is
going to get even harder to keep track
of everything and now that this is
nested another level let's go ahead and
see what this looks like so now
everything that's nested within here has
access to this prefix argument here so
let's just add this prefix to the
beginning of both of our print
statements like we wanted so I'm going
to go ahead and put that prefix in there
and just put a comma there and it will
add the space in automatically and now
lastly since this is nested one more
level now we have to do another return
so this time we're going to return our
decorator function uh neck's acute 'add
so I know that this multiple nest of
functions can get really confusing
really fast but all we've done here is
add one more layer to our existing
decorator that accepts whatever
arguments we want and then use those
arguments somewhere within our decorator
so now when we get
radar functions we use the outside
function here that takes the argument so
I'm going to replace this decorator down
here with prefix decorator so now we can
pass in our argument to this decorator
so in this case it's the prefix that we
want added before our print statements
here so I'll just start off by saying
testing with a colon there so now if I
run that then you can see that now we
have that testing prefix before our
print statements in our wrapper function
and you can change this any time that
you want so now if I want that to say
log instead and then I'll rerun that
then you can see that now log is that
prefix ok so I think that about does it
for this video now this probably isn't
something that very many people will
ever need to do but when you do need it
it's nice to know and especially when
you see it in code like you know in the
flask examples and other frameworks then
it'll be something nice to know at least
how it works so hopefully after this
video it makes sense for how you go
about doing something like that but if
anyone does have any questions about
what we covered in the video then feel
free to ask in the comment section below
and I'll do my best to answer those now
if you enjoy these tutorials and would
like to support them there are several
ways you can do that the easiest way is
to simply like the video and give it a
thumbs up and also it's a huge help to
share these videos with anyone who you
think would find them useful and if you
