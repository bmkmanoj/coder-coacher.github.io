be another programming terms video and
in this video we're gonna take a look at
dry and dry is something that stands for
don't repeat yourself now this is
something that you are probably going to
hear a lot if you're just getting
started out in programming or maybe you
just got a job in an in computer science
you know maybe your boss comes up and
says hey our codebase is a mess and the
first thing I want you to do is to make
this code dry so if he tells you that
what that means is don't repeat yourself
and if we take a look at Wikipedia what
they have on there is it says a
principle of software development aimed
at reducing repetition of information of
all kinds ok so what exactly do they
mean about this I have this little
sample project here this is in Python
but this DRI concept that spans all
languages so you know don't get tied
into just what the language is doing so
anyways here we have some code that has
a home page and about page and a contact
page and if I print this out you can see
that it prints out this HTML here it
prints out a header and it prints out
this paragraph here that says welcome to
our home page then it prints out a
footer with these footer links but if
you look here we have all of this header
information in the home page all of it
in the about page all of it in the
contact page so this is being repeated
over and over and over and that's what
people mean whenever they say they want
you to make the code dry they don't want
that code to be repeated like that
because it makes it hard to maintain it
but so say that your boss came up and he
said hey I don't want this to or I want
to add a link into the header so you'd
have to come in here and you would have
to manually add a link into every one of
these header sections which it would be
a lot nicer if that was all in one place
so what would it look like if we tried
to make this code dry so first of all
let's you may see here that we want to
print out
so we have headers being printed out and
footers so maybe we should just pull
these out into their own sections here
so I can do a function to print out a
header and I'll just pass that for now
and then I'll do a footer here and then
I'm just going to go ahead and copy
these sections in and place them within
these functions so now I have this in
one central location and then we'll go
through and we'll replace all of the
repeated code with this one function so
these are all the headers here and then
I'll go through and do all the footers
so now that I've replaced all this code
if we go in here you can see that this
is all cleaned up nice and neat now to
where it's a lot easier to read than it
was before we can see that this is the
header and then we want to print out
this home page paragraph this is the
header to this page and we want to print
out this about page paragraph it's so
much easier to read and not only that
but if we want to make a change we only
have to make that change in one spot now
actually we could even make this more
dry because you can see that we're for
that we are repeating these menus here
so if we wanted to we can even come out
here and do you know a nav menu function
that printed out these as well then I
could go through here and change these
nav menus out with this simple function
here and now all that is located in one
place now it is possible to get carried
away with this at you know in just in
this example you can see that we
probably got a lot bigger benefit for
doing our headers and our footers than
we did for just doing this little nav
menu which is only repeated one time so
if something's only you've repeated once
or twice here and there then the benefit
then the benefit may not be that large
but whenever you have something that is
just file after file being repeated then
it's usually nice to put that in one
central location so that you don't
repeat
yourself and that you can maintain that
code in one place now just to show that
that worked let me go ahead and run this
code here and you can see that
everything pulled out into these
functions it still works as planned I'm
printing out the home page down here and
we still get our header and our
paragraph and our footer section there
as well now let me show you a more
practical example of where you might see
something like this so I have this file
here called calc py it's a Python file
that just has really simple functions
add subtract multiply and divide
now what if I was to write unit tests
for this so here's a test underscore cow
pie if you don't know what unit testing
is don't worry about it we're just
focusing on the DRI principle right now
but anyways say that we wanted to test
this code and we want to test the
addition the subtraction multiplication
and divide now you can see when we're
testing this code at every test we're
doing num1 equals 10 num2 equals 5 and
then you know we're testing to make sure
that those numbers add and subtract
accordingly but you can see that every
test we have to put in what these
numbers are equal to so the Python unit
testing actually tries to take care of
this for you they have a method called
setup that runs before every test so if
you're doing something like this where
you have the same values that you're
setting up for every test then you know
just put it into a setup function and it
makes your code more dry and then you
don't even have to put that function
there it's part of the framework so I
can just take those out and I'll go
through here and remove these and now
that those are removed you can see that
the code is a lot more clean it's a lot
easier to see what's going on and if I
want to change some of these values you
know two different values now I can do
it in one spot now in order to get this
to work right for Python technically I'd
have to come in here and add self dot
num1 to all of these and then go through
and change these in every location where
there's num1 but you know that's not the
what I was trying to get across
just trying to get across that it's easy
to pull out this information and put it
in one central location so that one it's
not repeated and two it's a lot easier
to maintain now real quick I went
through and went ahead and change these
values and you can see after I change
them and I run this code you can see
that it ran all four tests with no
problems
so this setup method is working
correctly with setting up these values
before each individual test so that is a
quick overview of what it means for your
code to be dry so now if you hear
somebody saying it or if maybe your boss
comes up and asks you to to make the
code base more dry and then you
understand what they mean instead of
just the definition that's here on
Wikipedia maybe now you'll have a better
idea of what it actually means to put
those values into central locations and
and to not repeat yourself so hopefully
