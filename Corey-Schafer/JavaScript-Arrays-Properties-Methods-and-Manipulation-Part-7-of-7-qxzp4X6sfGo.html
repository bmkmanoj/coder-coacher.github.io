every element in your array through a
given function and then it returns
whatever that returned value is it adds
it to a return array so for example let
me just go ahead and show you what if we
had an array of numbers here and let's
pretend that this array of numbers that
we were getting in was was some money
and we wanted to add tax to every one of
these elements so I wrote a function
here and called this add tax then I can
pass in the element then I can return
let's see I can return a dollar sign and
then we can add this element x let's say
that we want a 6% tax so let's do one
point zero six and then we'll just do a
fixed here on the end of two so that it
keeps that to two decimal places and
then let's uncomment out this mapped
variable here and let's set this equal
to array 18 math and we want to map this
array to this add tax function and save
that and output this to the HTML and now
you can see that the original right here
all we had was an array of integers 10
20 30 40 50 and now this map version is
every one of these elements run through
this add tax function which puts the
dollar sign on and returns the tax value
of all of the integers that we had so 10
60 21 2013 one eighty forty two forty
and fifty three dollars so yeah that's
that's pretty cool just to show you
another example here if we have an array
of names
then I could do a function called
to upper and then pass in the element
and I could just return the element got
to upper case and I can comment out this
varmint and then set this equal to array
18 dot Matt and map this to the two
upper function save that and let's
output this to the HTML and save it and
now you can see whenever I echo out this
map variable it is this entire array but
all of these are now have to uppercase
applied to them so you know writing
something like this as is a lot more
readable and a lot cleaner than doing a
bunch of for loops and running through
your array and and doing things to every
element that way plus you don't have to
worry about these out-of-bounds
exceptions and things like that you know
if I go in here and start adding stuff
to the end then you know it will just
take care of that automatically so yeah
the map function is very useful if you
have a lot of data that you have coming
in through an array and you want to do
and you want to do the same thing to
every element in that array then the map
function is definitely something that
you want to check out so that is the map
method so I thought we could take a
really quick look at how to chain some
of these methods together you know
there's a lot of useful methods that
we've gone over but you know sometimes
they don't meet all your needs so you
can actually chain some of these
together and do some pretty neat stuff
so in this example we have an array of
10 20 30 40 50 and we have that same add
tax method that we had before but
instead of returning a string now we are
returning or to make sure that this is a
number here we're returning a number
that is the number times the 6% sales
tax and then so let's go ahead and look
at this I'm going to call this result 19
and let me copy that and I'll put it
through the screen so if I do what we
did before taking a look at the map
method if I do a ray Knight team math
and then map that to the add tax
function and then printed that out you
can see that this is ten point six
twenty-one everything that we expect
it's all the numbers but now say that
each of these were individual items in a
shopping cart or something like that and
now not only did we want to add the tax
but we wanted to total all those
together well I could do a function
called sum total and I could just do the
previous value the current value and
this will be used with the reduced
function and I can return previous plus
current and then down here I can just do
dot reduce and just chain this onto the
end of our I'll write the result that we
already have and do reduce sum total
save that and you can see we have 159 so
all these added up together is 150 and
Plus that 6% sales tax that we put on
there is 159 result another common
example you might see if if you want to
reverse a string in JavaScript you can
do let me just do a string here and I'll
do let me uncomment out this output here
so if I say please reverse me then this
string we can split this now splits not
a method we looked at because that is a
string that's a method for string not
the array but we can split this and what
this does is it turns this string into
an array that we can work with now so
now we have this array of characters
down here call
please reverse me and now we can just do
what we did before with our raise we can
call not reverse on this and save that
and now we have the reversed version of
that array and then we can just call the
join method that we looked at and join
that back together and now we have that
this initial string here we split that
then we reversed it then we joined it
back together which gives us the
original string reversed so you know
things like that are pretty neat so yeah
I know this video was has been getting
kind of long but hopefully it was useful
useful for you guys and you know you
learned some neat stuff about JavaScript
arrays and how to manipulate them you
know if you have any further questions
feel free to ask in the comments be sure

tutorials and thank you guys for
