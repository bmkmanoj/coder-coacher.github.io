make a quick video about an app that
I've been using a lot lately whenever
I'm at work I work a lot on a Windows
machine and then whenever I get home
I'll work on my Mac and there's actually
a couple of features from Windows I find
myself missing whenever I'm programming
on the Mac mostly it's the windows
snapping feature and that's where this
application comes in it's called hyper
dock that I found on the on the App
Store you can once you download it you
can come in here and change some
settings around and tweak it to how you
like it but let me go ahead and show you
what it does here so normally if I've
got a couple windows open here and I've
got some code over here and a test
website over here now I like to have my
code and my website taken up equal sides
of screen just fifty-fifty and normally
you'd have to come in here and manually
adjust these every time that you want to
do that but with the hyper dock it
brings that window snapping
functionality from Windows to where I
can just take this window and drag it
all the way over to the right and then
it snaps and then I can take this and
drag it all the way over to the left and
then it snaps into place
so that's really nice if I take it up to
the top it will maximize it and there's
also keyboard shortcuts for this too so
if you hit the command key and the left
arrow then it goes to the left and then
command key right arrow takes it out to
where it was normally and then if I do
right again then it goes you can see
right side of the screen so it's a
really quick way to move windows around
on your screen
and you can do really quick layouts with
this say I want to say I wanted the you
can also go to the corners so if I
wanted this website
you take up the top half of the screen I
could go up here to this top corner and
then stretch this over and then if I
wanted my javascript file to be at the
bottom right I could put that down here
and if I wanted the HTML file I could
put that down in the bottom left and
then I can see everything and I could go
ahead and make changes to the website
and see them in real time so you can
pretty much lay that out any way that
you want to do it and it's just really
nice to be able to do that quickly
instead of constantly manually dragging
those around and like I said I usually
just go with the 50/50 but this that's
not the only functionality that this app
has it also has the ability to let me go
ahead and drag these over here you'll
see I also have some windows open up in
the background here and those are in
Google Chrome if on my dock whenever you
scroll over the icon and the dock it
actually gives you a preview of all the
windows that are open so instead of
moving windows around to see what's in
the back I can just scroll over these
and it'll show me a little preview of
each one so if I want to go to this one
here I can just click on that and it
brings it to the front you can also
close windows down from this little
screen here so if I scroll over this
Google tab here and then just click this
X then it closes it down and then you
can also add windows by clicking this
little plus button so that's a whole lot
better than then you know moving windows
around on your desktop trying to find
trying to find where everything is
another nice feature I like is whenever
you scroll over your calendar it will
show your events that are coming up yeah
whenever you scroll through your
calendar it will show your events that
are coming up and also if you scroll
over your music applications like iTunes
or Spotify then instead of maximizing
these to play music you can just scroll
over top of them and come up here and
hit play and you know you can switch
through these and you can also do that
with iTunes so I can play a song then I
can switch the next one all from here so
it's really nice that it you know
everything that I like more about
windows this app brings it all over to
the Mac and I think the application was
around ten dollars but I get a ton of
use out of it and I like it a whole lot
so I just wanted to share it with you
guys so yeah check it out and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
