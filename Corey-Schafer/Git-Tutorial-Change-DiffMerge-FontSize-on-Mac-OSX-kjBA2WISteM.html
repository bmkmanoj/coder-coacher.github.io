going to be a super quick video I just
made a video on how to use a git diff
tool and the get diff tool that I used
was called diff merge and I wanted to
show you a problem that I ran into
whenever I was recording that video if I
do a if I open up if merge by using the
git diff tool that I showed in the
previous video by default you can see
when this opens up this text is
extremely small I think this is like
10-point font or something like that and
on the latest version of Mac if you go
in here and you try to change this font
so I'll go over here to window font and
choose a different font and you can see
here that the program crashes and it
won't allow you to do it no matter no
matter how many times you do this it's
going to crash so whenever I was looking
for a solution to that problem I
couldn't really find too many good
answers online and I finally found one
but it was kind of hidden in some forums
so I figured I'd make a quick video
about it so to change this problem you
can't change the font using the window
you have to use this kind of work around
here but if you use this command here
and open up the if merge preferences so
just paste this into your terminal and
hit enter and you'll see that'll pop
open in TextEdit and then these lines
right here will change the font you need
this file in brackets and then font
equals and then this 22 is the font size
I'm not sure what this 76 is but I saw
it there in the in the workaround so I
just included it in so I just put this
here under license and paste that in and
save it and exit out of that and so now
if I go back up here and run the gift
get diff tool again now you can see that
the font is a 22 size font so you guys
can change that font size to whatever is
it you want so yep hopefully this quick
tip was useful
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
