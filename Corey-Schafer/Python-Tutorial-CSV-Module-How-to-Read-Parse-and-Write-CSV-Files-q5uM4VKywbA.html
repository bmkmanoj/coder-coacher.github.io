this video we're going to be looking at
how to read parse and write CSV files
now if you don't know what CSV files are
it stands for comma separated values
basically CSV files allow us to put into
a plain text file some data and use some
type of delimiter usually a comma to
separate the different fields now I have
a sample CSV file here that we can work
with and if we look at this then we can
see how these are usually structured so
this can kind of look like a mess but
it's not really meant to be read
directly this is just how the data is
stored and then we can use our programs
to parse out the information that we
want but we can see that the top line
here has our fields
now our fields in this file are first
name last name and email so that tells
us the information that we should expect
to see on every line so if I go to the
next line here then we can see that John
is the first name and then a comma
though is the last name and then a comma
and then this long email here is the
email so that's why these are called
comma separated values and what
separates two values is called a
delimiter so the comma is a common
delimiter but you can use just about
anything so sometimes you'll see files
with tab delimited values or dashes or
things like that but they're all called
CSV files so now let's see what it's
like to read parts and write to CSV
files so I have a file here called parse
CSV pie and within this file we're just
going to import CSV now you may have
looked at that data and wondered why
we're just not using it the strings
split method on each line of the file to
parse out the data and you could do that
but the CSV module just makes parsing
these files so much easier so for
example if someone puts a comma or
something in their name for some reason
then we wouldn't want to split on that
and also the CSV module will handle new
lines and all those things so it just
makes it a lot easier to parse out all
the information that we want without
writing something complicated from
scratch okay so to read the CSV file
we're just going to open this file just
like any other file so we'll use a
context manager here and we'll say with
open and the name of that file that I
was just looking at is now
CSV and it's in the same directory as
the file that I'm currently writing and
we want to read this file so we'll put
an R there as the second value and now
what we want to call this so we'll say
CSV file so to read this file we can say
CSV reader and that can be any variable
name that you like but that's what I
like and then we can say CSV and then
use this reader method and then pass
that CSV file in to that reader method
now in the background that reader method
is using something called a dialect that
has some preset parameters for what it
expects the format of our CSV file to be
so by default it's expecting values to
be separated by a comma and a few other
things that we'll look at in just a bit
but since our CSV file is pretty simple
we don't need to pass any additional
arguments right now so the CSV reader
variable that we just created is going
to be something that we need to iterate
over so for example if we just print
this out as is so print CSV reader and
run that then we can see that right now
it's just an object in memory so instead
we need to loop over all these lines in
the reader and see what we get so we can
say for line in CSV reader and then
print out each line and we'll run that
ok so that looks better so each line
that we're printing out is a list of all
the values so the first value in the
list is the name as the first name the
second value in the list is the last
name and the email is the third value if
I scroll all the way up to the top you
can see that our first line is the field
names so it tells us that the you know
first value this first name last name is
the second value and third value is
email so for example if we're going by
the index like this would be index 0 and
then 1 and then the email would be index
2 if we only wanted to print out all of
the indexes then on this line here we
could say let's print out index 2 of
each line and if we run that and we can
see that now we get all of the emails
printed out now if you don't want this
first line of the field names and only
want the values then we can just skip
that first line so if anyone has seen my
video on generators and we can actually
step over value
an iterable by calling next and running
next we'll return the next value if we
want to capture that in a variable but
if we just want to step over the value
then we can come up here before our list
we can just say next CSV reader and that
will loop over that first line and then
when we iterate through this it should
start at the second value which is the
first person in the list so now if we
rerun this and scroll up to the top now
we can see that that John Doe is now the
first value okay so now let's see how we
can write to a CSV file now we can do
this with any list values but since
we're already have a list of values here
from our original CSV file let's go
ahead and just use those so let's say
that we wanted to save these same values
into a new CSV file but use dashes
instead of commas for the delimiter now
dash is probably isn't a great delimiter
but I just want to show you something
that happens when we do this now first
we're going to want to write the field
name headers into the new file so let's
take out this next statement where we're
skipping over those so now I'll come
down here and now actually above our
loop we're going to want to open a new
file for writing and so we'll say with
open and we'll call this file new
underscore names CSV we want to open
this for writing so the second argument
is aw then we'll say as and we'll just
call this a variable new file and to
write to this file we're going to use a
csv writer so we can say csv writer and
that can be any variable name but that
makes sense to me and we'll do csv and
then use this writer
method and we're going to pass in new
file to that writer method now if we
left it like this then it would just
write the same comma separated file that
we currently have now but if we want to
use dashes as our delimiter then we need
to pass that in as an argument so it's
going to be the second argument to that
writer method and we can say delimiter
equals and we'll just go use a dash now
we want to write each line of our
original CSV file into this new file so
let's indent our for loop over here so
that now we're within the context
manager of this new file and for each
line in this CSV reader which is our
original file we want to write that to a
new file so we can do that by saying CSV
writer dot write row and the row that we
want to write is that line from the
original reader so real quick before I
run this we are opening the original
file to be read and then we're creating
this CSV reader variable and we are
using the csv reader method to read that
original csv file and then we're opening
a new file for writing called new names
csv and then we're creating a csv writer
variable and we're using this writer
method of the csv module to open up a
writer using that new file with a
delimiter of a dash and then for each
line in this original csv data we are
writing out to the new file each line of
the original file so now if we run this
then we don't have any output here at
the bottom but it should have created
this new file called new named CSV and
I'll go ahead and open that up now we
can see in this new file that it's using
dashes instead of commas for the
delimiter now this makes it pretty hard
to read but I wanted to show you what it
did with two of our values here so in
our first value the email actually
contained a dash so we can see here that
our csv writer knew to put quotes around
the email since it can't contain that
delimiter and that's so when the CSV is
read back in that it would know that the
email is one whole value and that it
shouldn't be split on the dash within
the email itself and likewise here we
can see that our second person here has
a hyphenated last name of Smith Robinson
so again the csv writer knew to put
quotes around the last name so that it
can tell the difference between the
delimiters and the values that just
happen to contain dashes so now that
we've seen how that works let's actually
change this delimiter for the new file
to something that's a bit more common
so aside from commas tabs are very
common des limiters so let's use tab
instead and in Python the tab can be
represented with this backslash T and if
we rerun that and then open up the new
names file again then we can see that
now all the values are separated by tabs
instead that's a lot more easier that's
a lot more easy to read now just like we
passed the delimiter into our writer if
we wanted to read in that tab delimited
file then you could pass the delimiter
argument into the reader as well and
real quick let me show you what that
would look like if we tried to read a
CSV file with the wrong delimiter so let
me copy part of this here where we're
reading in this file and now I'm just
going to comment out everything else for
now now instead of reading the original
file names CSV we're instead going to
read the new tab delimited file that we
just created which is new underscore
names CSV now let's pretend that we
forgot to specify the tab delimiter and
just try to read this as is so let's
print out the lines that we get from
this reader so we'll say four line in
CSV reader and we will print out each
line so we can see that each line only
has one value and it didn't split on the
values on the tab because it was
expecting commas so instead you have to
explicitly pass in that we want the
delimiter to be a tab so I'll pass that
into the reader method here and say
delimiter equals a backslash t for tab
and then rerun that and now you can see
that we get the correct parsing okay so
now I'm going to delete these lines here
and uncomment out what we had before
okay so the way that we've been working
with CSV files using the reader and
writer is probably the more common way
to work with CSV data since they're the
first things that come up in the Python
documentation but my preferred method is
working with CSV data using the
dictionary reader and the dictionary
writer so let's take a look at those and
I'll explain why I prefer them over the
regular reader and writer
okay so first let's take a look at the
dictionary reader so to use this we're
just going to replace the regular
reader method here with a dict reader
and now let's print out the lines that
we give with this so I'll say four line
in CSV reader and we'll just print out
each line okay so at first glance this
may look a little more complicated each
of the values is now an ordered
dictionary and if we scroll up here to
the top then we can see that that first
line no longer contains the field names
it starts off immediately with the first
person so the reason is that the field
names are now the keys of each of these
values here now the reason I like this
is because it makes it a lot easier to
parse out the information that we want
so for example remember when we use the
regular reader if we wanted to print out
the email address then we printed out
the second index of our line well for
anyone reading your code it isn't
obvious what that second index is so
they'd have to go into the CSV file to
find that information out but now that
we have those fields as our dictionary
keys then we can get the email here by
saying I just want the email of that
line so we just access that key so now
if we rerun that we can see that now we
have all of the email information okay
and now let's look at how to use the
dictionary writer so I'm going to remove
this loop and then uncomment out the
rest of this information here now with
the dictionary reader we really didn't
need to change anything but with the
dictionary writer we actually have to
provide the field names of our file so
one line above our writer here I'm just
going to create a list of the field
names
and now instead of using this writer
method we're instead going to use dict
writer now one thing that we need to
change there here is that after the file
that we're going to be writing to we
need to pass in those field names so
I'll say field names is equal to field
names okay and now we're ready to write
the data so with the dictionary writer
you have the option of whether or not
you want to write out those headers
which are the field names in the first
row so if we want those headers which
most of the time I do then we can say
CSV writer dot right header so that's
going to write out those field names as
the first line and once the header is
written out we can loop through the
lines of the original file just like we
did before and say CSV writer dot right
row and then pass in that line so all of
that stays the same so if we run this
and then look over here at our new names
CSV file then we can see that that still
worked and like I said before the reason
I like working with the dictionary
reader and writer is because it's more
obvious what you're doing so let's say
for example that in our new CSV file we
actually only wanted the first and last
names and wanted to leave off the email
well with the regular reader and writer
we'd be modifying the indexes of those
list and like I mentioned before it's
not obvious by looking at an index what
value it's supposed to hold but with our
dictionary writer we can just remove the
email from the field names up here and
before we write each line within our
loop here we can just remove the email
key and value and one way to do that is
to just delete it so we can say delete
the email of that line so now when it
writes that row it's only going to be
writing the first name and the last name
and the email no longer exists so now if
we save that and run it and then I open
up the new names dot CSV file here then
you can see that now we just have a tab
delimited file of first names and last
names and that email is no longer there
now there are several ways that we could
have written this row we could have
deleted the email key from
line just like we did here or we could
have created a new dictionary with only
the first name and last name keys and
passed that into the right road method
so whichever way works for you in this
case I think it was easier just to
remove the email key okay so I think
that is going to do it for this video I
hope that now you have a pretty good
idea for how you can read parse and
write CSV files but if anyone does have
