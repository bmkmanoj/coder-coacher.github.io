video we'll be learning how to create a
JavaScript build system from within
sublime text so having a build system
for JavaScript it's going to be
convenient if we want to write some code
outside of the browser and just do
things like viewing console output from
directly within sublime so I have a test
javascript file here which simply logs
some messages to the console and we'll
try to get this to work within sublime
text
now the sublime text build systems can
run commands just like we run commands
from within our terminal so if we can
get JavaScript to log console output to
our terminal and we can get this to work
within sublime text also now the easiest
way that I've seen to do this is to use
node so to install node if you go on
Google and just search for nodejs
then one of the first links will take
you to the download page so go ahead and
navigate to that page and then download
that from the website and then follow
the instructions to install it now once
you finish that install then you should
be able to open up your terminal and
from within your terminal if you type
node space - V as long as you don't get
any errors and you see a version there
then that should mean that you have the
latest version of node installed now
with this node command we can actually
pass JavaScript files into that so if I
do a node and then test j/s I'm gonna be
passing in this test javascript file
that I have here now if I run that then
you can see that it outputted the
console output that I have here in my
test file so now that we have this
working from within our terminal now
let's get it working from within sublime
text so in order to do this go up to
tools and then build system and from
here we want to make a new build system
now I have another file over here that
I'm just going to copy and paste so that
I don't have to type everything out but
then I'll explain exactly what we're
doing here so this is just like running
a command from within our terminal so
this CMD right here first we're passing
in this node command and then after that
we're passing in this file variable and
this is going to be an absolute path to
whichever file that we're trying to run
from within sublime text now this
Elector line here I wouldn't worry about
that too much all it does is it helps
the automatic sublime text build system
when running files with certain
extensions now if we were to save this
as a build system right now then it
should work with the way that we have it
written down here but I did see that
some people online have mentioned that
they had trouble getting this to work
and that they had to put in the full
path to the node command in order to get
it to work properly so to get the full
path to the node command if you want to
put this in it couldn't hurt if you go
back to your terminal and just type in
which node then it's going to print out
the full path to that node command so
now if we copy this and just replace
this node with that entire path now we
can just go ahead and save this as our
build system so I'm going to go ahead
and save this and whenever it pulls up
to save it be sure that you leave on
this sublime build extension here and we
only change the name so the name of this
build system I'm just gonna call node
and save that okay so now let me not
save that so now I should be able to go
to tools and build system and I should
be able to see node here so I'm gonna go
ahead and select node as our build
system and now I'm gonna try to use that
build system to run this test javascript
file using command B and you can see
that that did work we logged out our
message here just like it worked over
here within the terminal and just to
make sure that this is working properly
let me go ahead and comment out this
slightly more difficult example using a
closure if I run that then you can see
that it logged out all of the correct
output also so I think that's gonna do
it for this video hopefully you find it
useful to be able to run JavaScript like
this from within sublime if you do have
any questions about this just feel free
to ask in the comment section below
