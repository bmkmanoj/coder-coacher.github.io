video we're going to go over get
command-line basics we're going to talk
a little bit about what git is and then
we're going to walk through how to get
get installed and then the basic
commands for working with local and
remote repositories I'm going to use a
couple of images in this walkthrough and
these images were taken from the probe
get book written by these two authors
here and it is licensed under the
Creative Commons if you want to read the
book which is a great resource you can
go to the git website click on the
documentation and the book is listed
there so this video is going to be
useful for three different types of
people first of all somebody who has
never used version control before this
is a great place to start because git is
the most widely used version control
system out there
second for people who have used version
control but not get so if you're coming
from a version control system like SVN
then it's going to be great to learn
about git also and third this will be
useful for people who have used git but
have mainly used the GUI visual tools so
the GUI tools are really useful but it's
better to learn these command-line tools
from the very beginning because the
gooeys can only do so much and you'll
eventually run into a situation where
you get stuck and the underlying
knowledge of the command line would be
extremely useful so with all that said
let's go ahead and get started so first
of all git is a distributed version
control system so if you're coming from
a version control system like SVN which
is a central version control system then
what is the difference between central
and distributed version control
well a central version control system is
located in one place so people can check
out from the central location to make
their changes and then check everything
back in but this can be problematic if
you can't get access to that central
server or that central repository so for
example if that server is offline or
you're working somewhere that doesn't
have a network connection then you'll
only be able to see the files that
you've checked out from that repository
and no additional information about that
central remote repository also if
something happens to that central
repository or that somehow gets
corrupted then you've got to hope that
there's a backup of that code somewhere
now on the other hand a distributed
version control system like it in this
situation everybody has a local
repository so you can have the option to
have that central remote repository
which we'll look at here in a little bit
but your local repository has all of the
information that your that your remote
repository has based on the last time
that you sync those two together so the
good thing about this is that if you
don't have access to that remote
repository then you can still view every
single change that's been made to that
repository since it was created so in a
way it's almost like every developer has
an entire backup of the repository so in
the worst case scenario of something
happening to the remote repository every
developer has a copy of that same
repository on their machine so that's
why it's called a distributed version
control system so now let's go ahead and
get started with git now I'm not going
to go into too much detail about the
installation here if you go to the
website which is get a sh s CM comm and
then you go to the Downloads tab here
then you can find the download and the
download for any operating system that
you're working with and the installation
is pretty self-explanatory
so after we get get installed there is a
first time setup that we have to go
through so first of all after you get
get installed then you can check the
version to make sure that it installed
correctly so if you run this command
here get bash - version so I'm going to
open up my terminal window here now if I
run git bash - version and it pops up
with some version here here it says get
version two point three point two then
that means that git is successfully
installed now once you have get
successfully installed now we need to
set up some global configuration
variables now these variables are
important because if you're working with
other developers then they need to know
who is checking the code in and out and
making changes and things like that so
this is a way to add your name to all of
your check-ins and code changes so this
is the syntax here to add these
variables in here so if I go back to my
terminal
I can type git config that stash global
user dot name and then in quotes I can
type in my name here so I'll type in
Cori Schaefer hit enter and now we can
do the same thing for email so I'll type
in user email and then here I'll type in
my email address at gmail.com hit enter
and now after we've put in those values
then to check those values we can do git
config - - list and this will list all
of our configuration values here now I'm
going to have a little bit more than you
do you'll probably only have a few
values here but I've customized my get a
little bit over time so you can see all
the values that I have listed here but
the important ones to look for are to
make sure that we have our username set
and our user email set so once you have
those values working then you are good
to move on now git config was the first
get verb that we actually use it was the
first action that we used now if you
ever need help with any of these actions
then you can use this syntax either get
help in the verb or get verb - - help
and what I mean by that is using config
as an example so say I want to see what
you can do with the config action so I
can do get help
config and hit enter and it'll take me
to the manual page and you can read all
about it here or the other syntax that
you can do is get config - - help and
read through there and you can do this
with any get action so you get ad - -
help does the same thing it takes you to
the manual page for the add action so
that's extremely useful once you start
doing more intermediate and advanced
things with git it's useful to look at
those manuals and see exactly what you
can do with them now there are two
common scenarios for
or people to begin using it so the first
scenario is that you have an existing
project on your local machine that you
want to start tracking using it and the
second scenario is whenever there is an
existing project remotely that you want
to start developing on so first let's
take a look at that first example where
you have a local code base that you want
to start tracking using it so in order
to do this it's just as easy as running
to get in it command from within the
directory in your terminal so for
example let me pull up my terminal here
now the code that I want to start
tracking if I do an LS within this
directory the code that I want to start
tracking is with us within this local
repo directory so if I CD to local repo
and then I do an LS - la in here which
will list all of the files in the
directory you can see that there is a
dot project file here and there's a calc
py file here so to begin tracking this
code with git it's just as easy as
running git init and if I hit enter you
can see that an edition initialized an
empty git repository and now if I do an
LS - la then you can see that it placed
this dot git file here now this dot git
it's actually a directory this dot get
directory contains everything that's
related to our repository so if we ever
want to stop tracking our project with
git then all we have to do is remove
this get directory just like we would
any other directory and if I do an LS L
a it's gone and we're no longer tracking
this project with git but we don't want
to do that we want to track this project
so let's do this again now you can see
it put that get directory back there and
now we are using git within this
directory so now we're using git in our
directory but we haven't actually
committed anything yet so before we
commit anything let's first run this get
status here so if I pull up my terminal
and I run git status you can see here
that we have two untracked files dot
project and calc py now this dot project
file is just a file that I created as an
example of the file that we don't want
in our repository for other people to
see so there's a lot of files that
contain personal preferences specific to
our machine or our operating system that
aren't actually part of the code that we
want tracked so for example say that I
had my personal preferences within this
dot project file I wouldn't want to add
those to the repository and whenever
other people check those out they would
be getting my preferences and we don't
want that so what we want to do is
ignore these files and to ignore files
you just have to create a dot get ignore
file so I'm going to do a touch on a dot
get ignore file which will recreate
which will create that getting more file
and now let me go ahead and open this up
in my text editor okay so the get ignore
file is just a simple text file where we
can add files that we want get to ignore
and we can also use wildcards so for
example here in this slide I have this
star TYC which will ignore all files
with a pyc extension so that's a Python
example but that's not important it's
I'm just showing the concept here so
let's go ahead and add all these files
here to our get ignore file and I'll
paste that in and save that and now let
me go back to my terminal now that we've
added those to the get ignore file and
saved it now let's rerun get status and
now you can see here that the dot
project file is no longer coming up in
our list of untracked files it's only
the dot yet ignore file and the calc py
file and we want to commit the get
ignore file because we want the
repository to know to always ignore
those files ok now let's take a step
back here and try to picture exactly
where we are right now
now with git there are three states that
we need to know about there's the
working directory the staging area and
the committed files and right now we're
currently in our working directory so
untracked and modified files will be in
our working directory and it will list
those when
get status so you can see here if I open
up my terminal then these are the files
in our working directory here now the
staging area is where we organize what
we want to be committed to our
repository now the reason for the
staging area is so that we can pick and
choose what we want committed so if
we've done a lot of work spanning
multiple files and we want to make
multiple multiple commits from those
changes then you can stage individual
files and commit those in small chunks
at once so that's going to allow us to
be more detailed with our commits so for
example you don't want to make a commit
that where you add a message that just
say it says like I made a lot of changes
to the code you want commits that are
very detailed as to what changes were
made so now that we know about that
staging area let's go ahead and add
files to the staging area so if we want
to add all the files that are currently
untracked or that we've made changes to
to the staging area then we could run
get add - capital a or we could add
these individually so for example here
if I did a git add dot get ignore then
if I do a git status and that's going to
show us okay so here we have kalki Y
which is currently untracked and then
you can see that our git ignore file is
in our staging area because we ran get
add dot get ignore and like I said in
the slide if we want to add everything
to the staging area then we can just do
get add - capital a and hit enter and
now if I run get status then you can see
that all of our files are now in the
staging area so if we were to run git
commit right now then it would commit
these changes to our repository now if
you ever want to remove files from the
staging area then you can use the git
reset command so if I did get reset calc
dot py and then did a git status you can
see that the get ignore file is still in
our changes to be committed which is in
the staging area and our kalki Y file is
in the untracked files if you want to
remove everything from the staging area
then you can run get reset without any
other options
and it will move everything so if I
think get status now that you can see
that all these files are moved back to
our working directory as untracked files
okay but we actually want to make a
commit now so let's go through this
process again what we want to do is we
want to run get add - a add everything
to the staging area and now if I run a
git status you can see that all of these
changes will be committed and in order
to get these in order to commit these
files we run git commit and then - M
which will put a message now the
messages are important you want to be
detailed as to the changes that you made
to the code but this is our first commit
here so we're just going to put
something like initial commit so if I
hit enter there you can see that it
added the two files to the repository
now if I run a git status you can see
that it says that the working directory
is clean that's because we've committed
those files and now we don't have any
modified or untracked files those are
being tracked now and we haven't
modified them since we committed them
now another useful command here is a log
command so if we run git log then we can
see the commits that we just made so
this gives us the hash number of that
commit now all those hashes will be
unique and then you can see that the our
author who made the commit and then the
message for that commit also so now for
this example we are successfully
tracking our local project and we have
made changes and committed those changes
to the repository so now let's talk
about the situation that we mentioned
earlier where we want to track an
existing remote project with git now
this is likely how most of you will be
using it if you're going to be using it
in the work place so for example say
that your company has a remote
repository and you want to clone that
remote repository and begin developing
on it now the syntax for this is get
clone than the URL and then where you
want to clone that repository so in the
example that I'm going to use I'm going
to use this remote repo here
is actually just a directory on my local
machine now usually this is going to be
a URL so for example if this was coming
from github or something like that then
it may look something more like this so
you do get clone and then the URL of the
remote repository and then where you
want to clone that repository so in this
case that dot is just means in the
current directory but like I said in
this example I'm going to be using this
directory here which is on my local
machine but it's going to behave exactly
like a remote repository would so let me
open up my terminal and let me go back
to this basics directory now if I run an
LS here then I have this directory
called clone repo I'm going to CD into
that now if I do an LS - la here then
you can see that this is completely
empty these are just relative paths here
so now I want to clone a remote
repository here so I want to do a git
clone and then the URL of the repository
and then this dot means that I want to
clone all the files from that repository
into this current directory so if I hit
enter you can see that it cloned into
the current directory now for doing LS -
la then you can see now I have files
here now I set up this sample remote
repository to be very similar to the
example that we just used in the local
directory so now that we've cloned that
remote repository now let's see how we
can view information about that remote
repository so in order to do that we can
use a couple of commands one of these
commands is get remote - V and another
is get branch - a so if I was to do get
remote - V now you can see it lists the
information to the repository here so
this is just the location on my local
machine of where this repository is and
also if I was to do git branch - a then
it will list all of the branches in our
repository not only locally but remotely
as well now we haven't gone over
branches yet but we will do that here
shortly now let's make a couple of
changes to the code base
and we can take a look at how to commit
those files and how to push them to the
remote repository so over here I'm going
to go into this clone repo and open up
this calc be Y file and now I'm just
going to make a simple change here I'm
just going to change this multiply
function to return what we want it to
return so I'll do return x times y and
I'll save that so now we've made a
change to our code so now that we've
made a change to our code how are we
going to push these changes to the
remote repository so first we need to
commit these changes locally just like
we did before so if I open up the
terminal here then the first thing I can
do is get diff and get diff is going to
show me the changes that I have made to
the code so you can see here that it has
this minus sign with the past that's
what I removed and then the plus sign
here returned x times y that's what I
added in so those are the changes that I
made to the code now if I run get status
we've seen this before and you can see
that in our working directory we have
this modified dot calc be Wi-Fi and now
if you remember we want to add those to
the staging directory so that they can
be committed
so we'll do a get add - capital a to add
out all the changes now if I run get
status again then we can see that those
are ready to be committed and now we can
do git commit dash em and then for a
message here we can just do a you know
multiply function okay so now we have
committed these files locally and now we
want to push these changes to the remote
repository so that other people have
access to those now whenever you are
ready to commit those changes and push
them to the remote repository there are
two things that you want to do I get
pull and I get push now people a lot of
the times forget to get pull but you
have to remember that we're now working
on a project that could potentially have
multiple developers and people have been
pushing code to that remote repository
while we've been working on our own
features so
what the get pool does is it will pull
any changes that have been made since
the last time that we pulled from that
repository and as you can see after we
ran that pool which said that we were
already up to date because there have
been no changes to that remote
repository since the last time that we
pulled from it and now we're ready to
push and we will do a get push and this
origin here is just the name of our
remote repository and then the master is
the branch that we want to push to so if
we run that then we have successfully
pushed those changes that we just made
to the master branch of that remote
repository so now that we've worked a
little bit with local and remote
repositories now let's go ahead and take
a look at a common workflow that a lot
of developers use when working with git
so I said before that we were going to
take a deeper look into branching so so
far we've been working directly on our
master branch but this isn't really how
you should be using it from day to day
so let's say that for example now
instead of that multiply function we
want to work on our divide function so a
common workflow that you're going to use
to do this is to create a branch for
your desired feature and then begin
working off of that branch so the syntax
for creating a branch is get branch and
then the name of the branch which we'll
just call count divide so I'm just going
to copy that now let's open up our
terminal and now let's create that
branch
so get branch calc divided and now if I
run get branch without the branch name
then it's going to list all of my local
branches you can see that I have master
here which has the asterisks beside it
that means that that's the branch that
I'm currently working on if I want to
start working on the couch divide branch
then I have to check that branch out and
that's using this syntax here get
checkout and then the name of the branch
so I'm going to do get checkout calc
divide now if I rerun that get branch
you can see that I am working on the
couch so now let's start working on the
changes that we want to make on this
branch so the changes I want to make
here I want to work on this divide
function so I want to return
x / y and i'll save those changes and
now that I've made those changes now
let's just commit this just like we have
been doing so if I do a git status you
can see that our cow py file has been
modified I want to add those changes to
our staging areas using the get add
command then I want to do a git commit
with a message of we'll just call this
the vide funk well divide function and
now we have successfully committed this
change to our local count divide branch
now this had no effect on our local
master branch and it's had no effect on
our remote repository so now let's say
that we want to push this branch to our
remote repository so this is the syntax
for doing that here this get push - u
origin which is the name of our remote
repository and then the branch that we
want to push - now I'm not going to go
too far into what that - u does since
it's a basic get video but basically the
u option just tells get that we want to
associate our local cop divided branch
with the remote count divide branch and
then in the future instead of doing this
get push - u origin count divide stuff
like that we can just do get push and
get pull like this and it will know that
those two branches are associated to
each other well we're not going to go
too far into that right now so if I pull
up the terminal here and I do this
command get push su origin calc divide
hit enter now we have pushed that calc
divide branch to the remote repository
so now if you remember earlier we did
this get branch - a command and if we
run this again this command was to see
all of our branches so if we run this
you can see that we can see our two
local branches here calc divide which
has the asterisks which means we're
currently working on that branch then we
can see that in our remote repository we
have a calc divide branch and the master
branch now there's a lot of reason
for why you'd want to push your branch
up to the remote repository and a lot of
companies that's where they run their
unit tests and things like that to make
sure that all the code runs well before
it's merged with master well let's say
that all of those unit tests and
everything ran really well and now we're
ready to merge that branch with master
now the way we want to do this is we
want to check out our local master
branch
so we'll do get checkout master you can
see here that we switch to our master
branch now we want to pull all the
changes down remember before we commit
anything to master we always want to
pull down the changes in case any
changes were made while we were working
on our feature you can see here that it
says that we're already up to date
because nobody else has made changes to
that remote branch since we've been
working on the couch divide branch and
now we can do this option on git branch
here which is - - merged and what that's
going to tell us is the branches that
we've merged in so far and you can see
here that if I run that calc divide
doesn't pop up here because it hasn't
been merged yet so in order to merge
that branch with master you do a git
merge and then the name of the branch so
I want to merge Calif ID with master so
I'm in the master branch I do a git
merge out divide and it will merge those
changes in the master now that I have
merged those changes into the master
branch and I can push these changes to
our remote master branch by doing a git
push origin master just like we did
before and then now those changes have
been pushed to the master master branch
on the remote repository so now that we
have finished merging those changes from
calc divide now that feature is done and
we're ready to delete that branch so
that same command that I ran earlier
just to double-check that everything was
successfully merged if we rerun get
branch - - merged here now you can see
that calc divided shows up here so that
means that we have already merged in all
the changes in that branch into master
so
now we're ready to delete that branch
since it's no longer necessary so we can
do yet branch and then - D which will
delete it and then calc divide which is
the name of our branch so now that has
been deleted locally but remember that
we also push that branch to the remote
repository so that command that we did
earlier get branch - a if we run that
again then you can see that we deleted
our local branch and all we have is
master but we still have this calc
divide branch on our remote repository
so to delete a branch from the remote
repository then it's this syntax here we
can do a git push origin which is the
name of our remote repository - - delete
then the branch so if we run that and
then we rerun get branch - a you can see
that all we have is our local master
branch and our remote master branch okay
and I know that that was a lot to take
in especially if you're new to something
like git but it's really not that bad
once you get the hang of it and this
becomes part of your daily routine
now really quick I'm going to run
through a faster example here because I
know that that seemed like a very long
process but if I'm not talking through
step by step then you'll see how fast it
is to actually make these changes with
this workflow so for example run the
master branch here and say I wanted to
work on the subtract function so I can
do git branch subtract and then get
check out subtract so now I'm working on
the subtract branch I can come in here
make the changes we want to return X
minus y save that do it get status over
here we've modified that we need want to
add that to our staging directory now we
want to commit those changes and you
want the commit messages to be more
detailed than that but this is just an
example and then we can do a git push
you origin
subtract so now we've pushed that branch
to our remote repository and let's say
that all those tests ran well so now
we're ready to merge this with master we
can check out our master branch and now
we can do a get pull because we want to
pull in all the changes that have been
made so now we pull it in all the
changes now we can do a git merge of the
subtract branch this will merge subtract
with master and now we can push those
changes and then you can go through the
process of the leading that branch just
like we looked at earlier but you can
see how that process isn't actually as
slow as it was with me going through and
step-by-step explaining it along the way
so that was a broad overview of using
the git command line on local and remote
repositories I know that was a lot to
take in for one video but I really hope
it was useful for you guys if you do
have any questions just ask in the
comment section below
now there's a lot that we didn't get to
in this video and I'm going to make
additional videos soon on other topics
like if you run into merge conflicts if
you need to undo your mistakes some
other common pitfalls tagging versions
and get and also advanced topics like
your get history rebasing cherry picking
and things like that so be sure to
subscribe to the channel to make sure
that you catch those later videos and
