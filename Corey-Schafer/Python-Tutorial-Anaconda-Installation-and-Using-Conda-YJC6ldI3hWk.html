this video we'll be learning how to get
started with anaconda by continuum
analytics now if you don't know what
anaconda is it is a data science
platform that comes with a lot of stuff
right out of the box so it comes with a
Python distribution a package manager
called Conda a way to manage
environments and a lot of other
libraries and packages pre-installed now
these packages are usually related to
data science so it comes with things
like numpy SCI PI Jupiter notebooks and
things like that now the number one
question people usually have when they
first hear about something like anaconda
is why would you need it so what benefit
you get from anaconda as opposed to just
installing these packages through pip or
something like that well you shouldn't
feel obligated to use anaconda it's
really just an option that some people
prefer so if you're getting along just
fine with regular Python and haven't run
into any problems then there's really no
huge reason to switch but a lot of
people especially those in the data
science community who might not be
full-time developers they find that
anaconda simplifies a lot of common
problems that beginners run into and
it's also good to use in classrooms so
that you know your students are all on
the same page so things like installing
Python on multiple platforms separating
out different environments dealing with
not having correct privileges and
getting up and running with specific
packages and libraries all of those are
things that anaconda can help with so
let's go ahead and download anaconda
here and we'll walk through some of the
features so I'm here on the anaconda
download page and if you just google
Python anaconda then this should be one
of the first results and you can also
google the company name which is
continuum analytics so at the top of the
download page here we can see that there
is a link for the list of packages that
comes pre-installed with anaconda so I'm
going to go ahead and open this up and
I'm going to pull up Python 3.5 now if
we scroll down here then you can see
that it comes with a lot of stuff right
out of the box so all those packages can
take up a lot of space now if hard drive
space is an issue for you and you don't
want to download all those packages then
they do offer a download here called
mini Conda and mini Conda is a small
bootstrap version that comes with their
Python distribution essential packages
and Conda and we'll talk about Conda in
just a second but we're going to go
ahead and download the entire thing
so that's going to include all of the
packages that it comes pre-installed
with so the download is pretty
straightforward
so I'm going to download this for my Mac
but if you're on a Windows or a Linux
machine and you can just choose one of
those for your operating system so I'm
just going to choose OS X here and then
I'm going to download this graphical
installer so I'm going to go ahead and
cancel out of this here and then I'll
just wait for this download to finish ok
so once that is downloaded let's go
ahead and open that up and run through
the Installer now we're pretty much just
going to be clicking through and
accepting defaults here so I'm going to
go ahead and agree to these and I'm
going to stall only for me and I'm going
to leave the default location and so now
I'm just going to fast forward until
this is finished installing ok so now
that that download is finished I'm just
going to go ahead and close down my
browser here and pull up my terminal
okay so when we install it anaconda it
should have automatically added that to
our path so to test this we can just go
ahead and type in Python now if
everything installed correctly and we
should have a python version 3 here and
you can see that it's using this
anaconda distribution and if you install
the full version of anaconda then we
should be able to import certain
packages that were included with that
download so I should just be able to
type in import numpy and run that and
you can see that that didn't give us an
error so that package does exist and
just to test that further let's go ahead
and also import matplotlib and see if
that works so you can see that that
worked also so we already have a couple
of packages here ok so now let's just go
ahead and exit out of Python here and
now I'm just going to go ahead and clear
my screen so that's all there is to
installing anaconda and depending on
what kind of system you're on a lot of
people find that kind of installation of
Python much easier than doing it
manually especially whenever you get a
lot of popular packages out of the box
now if you do need to add more packages
we still have pip which most of you are
probably familiar with and if you'd like
to learn more about PIP then I do have a
separate video on that but if I go ahead
and type in pip list then you can see
that it lists out all of the packages
that came pre-installed with anaconda
now anaconda also comes with its own
package manager called Conda
and Conda is useful because we can use
it to install non Python packages and
dependencies so it can install some
things that wouldn't necessarily make
sense with pip so we can view all the
commands that we can use with Conda by
running Conda - - he'll now you can see
that a lot of these Conda commands are
similar to our pip commands so in here
we have list and search and install and
things like that so let's go ahead and
clear the screen here and let's run
Conda list now if we compare this to our
pip list then we notice that all of
these with the py tags here are Python
packages that were also listed in our
pip list so if you ever need to install
additional packages then you can try
running Conda install and if for some
reason you have any issues with using
Conda or just prefer PIP then you can
still use pip install to install
packages now one thing that's really
interesting and useful about Conda is
that you can use it to manage your
environments - so some of you may have
seen my video on virtually envy where
you can make isolated virtual
environments for different projects and
Conda can do that as well
and it even has a few advantages over
birthday and B so let's take a look at
how we can create some virtual
environments now I'm not going to go
into too much depth about why we should
be using virtual environments I covered
that in some previous videos but
basically what they're used for is when
we want to work on multiple projects
these projects may use different
versions of different packages and
possibly even different versions of
Python so instead of trying to get all
of our projects to conform to our global
installations and versions we can
instead just create these separate
environments that have the specific
packages and versions that we need so
let's say that we wanted to start
working on a flask app now to create a
new environment for this application
using Conda then we can just say Conda
create and then I'm going to do a - -
name here I'm just going to call this my
app and now I'm going to go ahead and
pass in some starting packages that we
want so I'm going to say flask and SQL
alchemy now you have to have at least
one starting package when you create a
new environment with Conda but if you
don't want one then you can just pass in
something like pip or Python but it is
required to have a
but in this case we're going to be
building a flask application anyway so
let's just go ahead and pass flask and
SQL alchemy in as those packages and
then it's going to show you what it's
going to install and let's just go ahead
and hit yes okay so now we want to
activate that new environment that we
just created now this is going to be
different on a Mac than on Windows on
Windows I believe you can just say
something like activate my app but on
Mac this is actually going to be source
activate my app so if I run that you can
tell that we're in our new environment
here because it added the name of our
environment above our prompt right here
and if I clear my screen you can see
that that still stays there and once we
have that environment activated if we do
a pip list then you can see that we only
have our base flask and SQL alchemy
packages and on Mac or Linux if we want
to see the path to which Python we're
using then we can run which Python and
you can see that the Python that we're
using is now within this my app
environment okay and once you're done
with your environment and want to
deactivate it on Windows you can just
say deactivate but on Mac or Linux
that's actually going to be source
deactivate so we can also use content to
create environments using different
versions of Python also so let's say
that I wanted to create an environment
for the same flask at but using Python 2
7 instead of Python 3 5 now I'm just
going to bring back up that command that
we used to create that environment but
instead I'm just going to change this
name to my app 2 7 and I'm also going to
pass in this keyword here python equals
two point seven now this Python doesn't
have dashes before so it's not an option
it's just Python two seven there so now
I'm going to go ahead and run that and
it's going to tell us what packages it's
going to install so I'm going to go
ahead and hit YES on that and once that
environment is done installing now I'm
just going to go ahead and activate it
so I'm going to say source activate my
app two seven and now that we have that
activated let's go ahead and run Python
within here and you'll see that the
version of Python that we have here is
Python 2.7
so specifying that version when we
created our environment work for
luckly okay so now let's just go ahead
and exit out of Python and let's go
ahead and also deactivate our virtual
environment there now one useful thing
that we can do with Conda is that we can
view our environments that we've created
so if I say Conda env list and list
those out then you can see that both of
the environments that we created are
there and currently this default when
this root one is the one that's
activated and if you ever want to remove
an environment then we can just say
Conda remove and then we'll pass in the
name of our environment so I'll grab
this my app here and paste that in and
now we need to specify all of the
packages and if we just want to delete
the entire thing then we can just say
all it's going to ask us if we want to
continue and we can just hit yes and now
if I relist those environments then you
can see that the my app is gone
so I'm going to go ahead and do that
same thing for my 2.7 also say yes and
clear the screen and if I list those out
then you can see we just have our root
and a content environment okay so I
think that's going to do it for this
video I hope this gave you an idea of
why some people would prefer using
anaconda for their Python development
now it's not for everyone but if you are
someone who is working in data science
then it really does come with some nice
packages out of the box and you're
probably going to see it recommended on
certain sites so I wanted you all to
know what it was and why certain sites
might suggest it so for example Jupiter
notebooks are becoming very popular
right now if you go to their website
they recommend installing anaconda
because after the installation of
anaconda you can just say Jupiter
notebook and fire one of those up and
you can see that that just pops up ready
to go
so speaking of Jupiter notebooks I plan
on doing a tutorial on these very soon
so installing anaconda might be a good
starting point if you want to follow
along with those videos but it's also
real easy to install through pip so if
you don't want to install anaconda then
you'll still be able to follow along
just fine so if anyone has any questions
about what we cover in this video then
feel free to ask in the comment section
below and I'll do my best to answer
those if you enjoy these tutorials and
would like to support them then there
are several ways you can do that these
just ways to simply LIKE the video and
