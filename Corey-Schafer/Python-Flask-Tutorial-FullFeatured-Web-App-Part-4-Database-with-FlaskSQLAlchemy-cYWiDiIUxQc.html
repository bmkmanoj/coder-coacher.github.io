this video we'll be creating a database
for our application so that we can
create real users and posts instead of
relying on dummy data and work with
these databases in Python we're going to
be using SQL alchemy which is a very
popular ORM that people use for
different databases now if you don't
know what an ORM is it stands for object
relational mapper and basically it
allows us to access our database and an
easy to use object-oriented way and the
thing I like about it most is that you
can use different databases without
changing your Python code so if you want
to use an SQLite database for testing
and a Postgres database for production
then all you need to do is pass in a
different database URL for SQL alchemy
to connect to but all of the code to
create the database will be the same and
that's what we will be doing in this
series we'll use an SQLite database for
development and then when we're ready to
deploy this application we'll switch
over to a Postgres database for
production so let's go ahead and get
started so we can see what this looks
like so first of all we need to install
the flask SQL alchemy package and we can
do that with a simple pip install so we
can say pip install and that is flask -
SQL alchemy
now there is a regular SQL alchemy
package but flask SQL alchemy is a flat
specific extension that provides some
useful defaults and helpers for a flask
application so let's use that one
instead so once that is installed we can
import this into our application so I'm
going to go back to our project file
that we have open here in sublime text
and this file is called flask blog dot
PI for me and at the top here we can
import this by saying from flask
underscore SQL alchemy import SQL
alchemy and that is uppercase there so
now let's copy that and after we import
that then we need to specify the URI for
the database which is where the database
is located now we currently don't have a
database so let's just choose a location
where we want this database to be so for
now let's use an SQLite database because
it's the easiest to get up and running
with and SQL Lite database will simply
be a file on our file system so to set
this location we need to set this as a
configuration so we can say underneath
our secret key here we'll say app dot
config and this is going to be equal to
SQL alchemy and actually this is going
to be all uppercase here so SQL alchemy
underscore database underscore URI and
we'll set that equal to an empty string
for now okay so with sequel Lite we can
specify a relative path with three ford
slashes in the URI so we can say for
this sequel Lite database we can say SQL
Lite and then a colon and then three
sports slashes to specify a relative
path and then we'll just call this site
dot DB so these three slashes are a
relative path from the current file so
that means that this site DB file should
get created here in our project
directory alongside our Python module
that we're currently in okay so now that
we have that location set now we need to
create a database instance and to do
that we can
come up here right below our
configurations and we can say DB is
equal to and this will be equal to SQL
alchemy and we're going to pass in the
app as an argument to that okay so now
we have an SQL alchemy database instance
and are ready to work with our databases
now the great thing about SQL alchemy is
that we can represent our database
structure as classes and you'll be
hearing those classes be called models
and doing the database structure this
way is actually very intuitive after you
get the hang of it now
we could put these classes into a
separate file like we did with our forms
and we will do that in a later video in
the series but for now I'm just going to
put these within our main application
because the imports can get a little
weird with these dependencies if I was
to separate them right now so in the
next video we'll learn how to split
these files up properly but for now
let's go ahead and create those class
models that will be our database
structure so each class is going to be
its own table in the database so first
let's create the user class to hold our
users and first let me clean this up
here I'm going to separate this app from
our imports and put all of this
configuration and stuff together and I
will put the models right above our
dummy post data okay so to create this
user model I'm going to create a class
and I'm going to call this user and now
we're going to import from DB dot model
and now within our user model now we can
add the columns for this table so first
we're going to have an ID which is going
to be a unique ID and this is going to
be equal to a DB dot column and in the
column now we specify what type this is
so this is going to be an integer so
this will be D B dot integer and this is
also going to be our primary key which
just means that it is a unique ID for
our user so I'll say primary key is
equal to true okay and now we can move
on to our next column our next column is
going to be a username so we'll set that
equal to DB column now this username is
going to be a string so we can say dB
and if you remember in our validation I
said that the max length of this is
going to be 20 characters so let's just
put in a 20 there to say that it's a
string of 20 characters now we want the
usernames to be unique also so we can
pass in a unique attribute or a unique
argument here and we can say unique is
equal to true and also we have to have a
username so this can't be null so we can
say nullable is equal to false okay so
our email is going to be similar to our
username column so I'm just going to
copy that and paste this in below here
now for our email let's just say that we
don't want anything above 120 characters
or so so we want these to be unique as
well so we'll say unique is equal to
true and in all the bol equal to false
now we're also going to have an image
file now this is going to be for the
user's profile pictures so we will set
this equal to a DB column as well so I'm
just going to copy and paste this one in
here so this will be a string and I'm
going to set 20 characters as the max
here and later in the video series we'll
see why because we're going to hash
these image files that are 20 characters
long so that they are all unique now
there's going to be a default profile
picture that every user starts out with
that is the same so users aren't going
to have unique profile pictures because
sometimes they're going to be able to
share those like the default picture for
example so I'll take away the unique is
equal to true and I'll keep this
nullable is equal to false because they
have to have at least the default image
and now let's set a default value here
so this is if we do not create the user
with any specific profile image then
what is going to be the default and
we'll just set this equal to default dot
jpg and that is something that we will
add later in the series okay so let's
keep adding some columns here okay so
now let's add a password column because
users are going to have passwords and
that's going to be equal to
DB column of type DB string and I'll
paste that in now the string for the
passwords again these are going to be
hashed so the hashing algorithm that
we're going to use is going to make this
60 characters long so I'll do a 60 there
and we will again pass in a nullable
equal to false now we didn't need a
unique of true because you know people
can have the same passwords okay so now
I'm also going to specify an re PR
method and that is a double underscore
method which people called under methods
or magic methods now if you don't know
what this does this specifically is how
our object is printed whenever we print
it out so this and the double underscore
STR method as well so we're just going
to set this already PR one for now and
we'll see what this looks like in just a
second so I'm going to return what we
want this to look like when we print out
a user object so I'm gonna print out
this term user and then I'm going to put
some parentheses here and I'll just
print out this user's username and email
and image file so I'll say self dot
username and then I will copy this
section here and then put a comma and
print out the self dot email and then
put a comma and print out the self dot
image file and I won't print out the
password for this user when we print out
a user object now if you're new to using
classes in a Python and would like to
know more about the self variable that
we have here and also these magic
methods then I do have a complete series
on object oriented programming in Python
where I go over all of those concepts if
this is something that is new to you but
I'm not going to go into detail about it
here because really it does require its
own series to go over ok so now let's
create the post class to hold our post
so this is going to be similar to our
user so I'll just copy and paste this in
here but this will be for posts and
again we're going to be inheriting from
our D
model and now we're going to create
similar columns so we want another ID
column which is going to be exactly the
same so I'll post that in there now we
want a title and a title is going to be
a string column so I'll copy this up to
this point here and copy that and paste
it in now let's say that we want the
title to be a max of let's say 100
characters and now we will say that we
have to have a title for each of our
posts so nullable will be equal to false
okay so now we are going to want a date
posted column to hold the date that our
post was made and this is going to be a
DB column and the type of this column is
going to be a DB dot date/time and each
of our posts will have to have a date so
nullable again is going to be equal to
false and now we want a default for this
as well so if we don't actually specify
a date for when our post was created
then we're just going to say that it was
posted at the current time and so to get
the current time we're going to have to
import the date/time module so I'm going
to go to the top of our file here and I
will say from date/time import the
date/time class and copy that and now
down here we can say that we want the
default to be equal to date/time dot UTC
now now I'm not going to put parentheses
to actually run that function or else
we'd be saying that we want the default
to be the current time right now we
don't want the parentheses there because
we want to actually pass in that
function as the argument and not the
current time and you always want to use
UTC times when saving dates and times to
a database so that they are consistent
okay and lastly all of our posts are
also going to have content so we will
say content is equal to and this is
going to be a DB column
and the type of this column is going to
be DB dot text and again the content
will be required for every post so we
say nullable is equal to false and save
that now we'll be using an re PR for
this class as well so let's paste that
in and instead this will be we'll print
this out as a post and we want to print
out the self dot title and we'll also
print out the self dot date posted so
that we can see those values of each
instance and I will remove that user
file I'm not gonna print out the content
because the content could be extremely
extremely long and if you're looping
through posts and printing them all out
I just want a short description of that
post and the title and the date posted
will be good enough ok so one thing you
may have noticed is that I haven't added
the author to the post model yet so the
post model and the user model are going
to have a relationship since users will
author posts so specifically this is
going to be called a one-to-many
relationship because one user can have
multiple posts but a post can only have
one author and this is how we do this in
SQL alchemy so we can say up in our
users model here I will create a post
attribute and set this equal to now this
isn't going to be equal to a column this
is going to be equal to DB dot
relationship I spelled that wrong
relationship there we go okay so now
we're gonna say that this has a
relationship to our post model pass that
in as a string and then we're gonna
specify a back ref here and we'll go
over this in just a second I'm gonna set
a back ref equal to author and then also
pass in this lazy argument and set the
lazy argument equal to true
okay so again we're saying that our post
attribute has a relationship to the post
model now the back ref is similar to
adding another column to the post model
what the back ref allows us to do is
when we have a post we can simply use
this author attribute to get the user
who created the post and if that doesn't
make sense yet then we'll see this in
action and
just a bit now the lazy argument just
defines when SQL alchemy loads the data
from the database so true means that SQL
alchemy will load the data the data as
necessary in one go so this is
convenient because with this
relationship we'll be able to simply use
this post attribute to get all of the
posts created by an individual user now
notice that this is a relationship and
not a column so if we were to actually
look at our actual database structure in
some kind of SQL client we wouldn't see
this Paula this post column here this is
actually just running an additional
query in the background that will get
all of the posts this user has created
okay so now to specify the user in the
post model we can add the user ID for
the author so if I come down here into
our post model then we are going to
create an attribute called a user ID and
we're going to set this equal to and
this will be a DB column and this will
be a DB dot integer because it's going
to be the primary key of our user and
now we need to specify that this is a
foreign key which means that it has a
relationship to our user model so we're
gonna say DB dot foreign key and then we
specify what that is so with a string we
can say user dot ID now it'll be
required that each post has an author so
we're also going to pass in a nullable
is equal to false as usual
okay so again this is going to be the ID
of the user who authored the post now it
might be a little confusing because
we're using an uppercase P here in the
user model when we define the
relationship with the post but we're
using a lowercase U for the user ID in
the post model and that is because in
the user model we're referencing the
actual post class and in the foreign key
we're actually referencing the table
name and the column name so it's a lower
case so the user model automatically has
this table name set the lower case user
and the post mom
we'll have a table name automatically
set to lowercase post now if you want to
set your own table names then you can
set a specific table name attribute but
since our models are pretty simple we'll
just leave those as the default
lowercase values
oh and one mistake that I see here that
I made you probably notice this when I
did it but whenever I created this email
this is supposed to be email here and I
actually left that as username so that
should have been email so sorry about
that okay so now that we have these data
base models that represent the structure
of our database we can now use those to
create the database so to do this we're
going to use the command line so I'm
going to open up my terminal here and
I've still got my virtual environment
activated and am navigated to the
project directory so within here I'm
going to say Python and you have to be
within your project directory to get
these imports to work so now I'm going
to say from flask blog import DB so
flask blog is my application file and DB
is the instance of our database that we
created so I'll import that now we
didn't get any errors but we did get
this output from SQL alchemy don't worry
about that it's just some information so
now we can actually create our database
by saying DB dot create underscore all
and use that create all method so if I
hit enter you can see that we don't get
any errors so that should have created
our database now since we're using a
sequel Lite database for now this is
actually going to be a file on our file
system and we set our database URI to be
a file in the same directory as our
application and called that site dot DB
so if we look at our project directory
then we can see that now we have a site
DB file here in our project directory
now I know that might be a little hard
for you to see in my sidebar but I have
a Finder window open here with my
project and we can see that we have a
site DB file here that was created ok so
now we have that database but it's
currently empty
now it's also easy to add data to our
database using the command line now
we'll be using our application to add
this data later but let's go ahead and
add a user and a post just so we can see
how this
works so I will go back to the command
line and now I want to import those
models so I'll say from flask blog
import and the name of our models was
user and post so let's import those and
now let's create an instance of our user
so I'm just going to call this user user
1 and I will set this equal to our user
class and now I'm going to pass in all
of the attributes that this needs so it
needs a user name so I'll just set that
equal to Cory and also I'll pass in an
email so for an email i'll just say see
at demo comm and it also needs a
password so we'll say set a password
equal to password for now so we're
setting a plaintext password for this
example but we're going to be hashing
these passwords when we do this through
our application also notice that we
didn't specify an ID or an image file
for this user so since the ID is our
primary key it will assign this user a
unique ID automatically and we have a
default value for our image file if you
remember if we don't provide that then
it will just get that value of default
dot jpg that we specified in our model
so now let's tell our database that
we're going to want to add this user so
to add this user we can just do a DB dot
session dot add and we want to add that
user one that we just created so if we
run that we can see we don't get any
errors now that hasn't actually added
the user to our database we've just told
it that we have a change that we want to
make to our database so we could have
several changes at a time and add them
like this and then when we commit those
changes then it will make all those
changes to the database at once so for
example if I add another user here so
I'm going to call this user too and I
will set the username equal to John Doe
and set the email to JD at demo calm and
we'll keep the password sent to password
and now if I also add this user so I'll
add user to now let's commit those
changes to actually commit those to the
database so
we can say DB session dot commit and now
that those are committed they should now
actually be in the database and SQL
alchemy makes querying the database
extremely easy so let's look at a couple
of common queries so if we want to just
get all of the users then we can simply
say and I'm gonna clear my screen here
then we can simply say user dot query
dot all to get all of our users and we
can see here that it returns a list of
both users that were created so here is
our first and here is our second now if
we just wanted to get the first user
then we could access it from the list
that we that was just returned or we
could use the first method that gives
you the very first result so I could say
user dot query dot first and if I run
that you can see that we just get that
first user back now we can also filter
the results by using the filter by
method so if we wanted to filter by user
names then we could say so user dot
query and use this filter by method and
we could say that we want to filter by
users who have a username equal to Cori
and then we can do a dot all to return
all of those results and we can see that
we just get a list of one user there
with that matching username now if there
were multiple people with that same
username then that would return a list
of all those but that should never
happen in our application since our
username is unique and we can use the
first method here as well so if we just
grab that first result without it being
in the list then we can just do a dot
first there and we can see that we just
get that user with no list okay so now
let's look at this user that is getting
returned so I'm going to use that same
query again but I'm going to capture it
in a variable so I will say user is
equal to user dot query filter by user
name equals query dot first so if I hit
enter now our user is that user that was
returned from that query but now we
should have access to some additional
attributes so I could say user dot ID
and we can see that that user has an ID
of one now we can actually perform
queries using the ID as well so we
already saw
user dot query all and user dot query
dot first but if we were to say user is
equal to user dot query dot get then
this will fetch a user with a specific
ID so if I get a user with the ID of one
which should be that same user then we
can see that we get that same user as a
result so now let's look at this users
post by saying user dot posts and we can
see that that returns an empty list
because this user doesn't have any post
at the moment now remember what I said
when we wrote our model so let me bring
this up just so we can see it here so
when we wrote the model I said that the
post attribute isn't actually a column
itself that is actually running an
additional query on the post table that
grabs any post from that user so let's
create some posts written by this user
so that we can see what this looks like
so I'm going to go back to our command
line now I'm going to clear our screen
here again so that we have more room now
we still have access to that user so I
still have that first user with a user
ID of one so now let's create a post so
I'll say post underscore one is equal to
post and now we need to pass in all of
the values that a post needs so it needs
a title so I can just do a title of blog
one it also needs some content so I'll
set the content equal to first post
content with an exclamation point and
then it needs an author and the author
is a user ID so I'll say user ID is
equal to our current user dot ID so
let's run that and also notice that when
we created this post we didn't specify a
date for this post so if we remember
from our model we have a default date of
UTC now so it should populate the date
with the current UTC time if we didn't
provide anything which we didn't ok so
now let's add one more post that is
similar so I will go up here and change
the variable name I'll change this to
post two and we will set the title equal
to blog to the content equal
- second post content and we will keep
the user ID the same okay now remember
we've created these posts but they're
not added to our database yet to add
them to the database we need to do a DB
session dot ad and we can add post one
and also add post two and then we can do
a DB session commit to commit both of
those at the same time okay so now that
those posts are committed to the
database now let's look at this users
posts again so I'll say user dot posts
and we can see that now this user has a
list of two blog posts and this result
is just a list so we can loop through
these just like any other list so I
could say for post in user dot posts and
within this list I will print out or
within this loop I will print out the
post dot title so if I run that then you
can see it loops through our user posts
and prints out both of the titles for
that okay so now let me get the first of
these posts by actually querying the
post table directly so I'll say post is
equal to post dot query dot first like
we've seen before
and if I look at that then we can see
that we got the first post then now we
can get the ID of the user who created
this post just by accessing that column
so I could do a post dot user ID and we
can see that that user ID is equal to
one so we got the right ID for the user
who created this post but in the post
table that's the only information about
the user that we have we might want more
information about that author now if we
remember back to our model if I open
this up here then the post relationship
from our user model lets us not only
access that users post but it also adds
this back ref of author to each post and
that's not an actual column down here in
our post model but it allows us to use
that to access the user who created the
post so if I switch back here to the
command line then we can see what that
back ref does so if I was to say post
dot author which again isn't in our post
model but if I was to run that then we
can see that we get the and
user object that we can work with so
that's an extremely nice feature with
SQL alchemy okay so now that we've added
some sample data just to make sure that
everything was working properly now
let's delete all of this data so that in
the next video we're starting from
scratch with a nice new clean database
so this is easy to do just like we did
with DB dot create all before this time
we can simply say and let me clear the
screen here we can simply say DB drop
all and that drops all of our database
tables and rows so now to create those
tables fresh one more time then we can
just create them again so I'll say DB
dot create underscore all and run that
and that should have recreated that
database structure and now if we query
all of our users or posts so I'll say
user query dot all then we can see that
that returns an empty list so that's
good and if we do the same for posts or
post query dot all and we can see that
that is an empty list too so those are
both empty okay so I think that is going
to do it for this video we now have our
database created and a way to add data
to that database and in the next video
we'll be restructuring our application
to a package so that we can move these
models into their own file and also
learn about the other benefits of using
packages as an application structure but
