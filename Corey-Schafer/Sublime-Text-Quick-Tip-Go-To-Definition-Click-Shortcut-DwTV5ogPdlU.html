quick tip for sublime text that I find
extremely useful right now I am over
here in Eclipse
if anybody's ever programmed in Eclipse
before you know that they have this
really nice functionality where you can
hold in command and click on a function
or method and what and it will take you
directly to that definition it would be
nice if sublime text had something like
this they do have some keyboard
shortcuts but I really like that click
functionality it's helped me out with my
workflow just to be able to get there a
lot quicker so if I open up sublime text
here you can see that they don't have
anything like this if I do ctrl click it
just does a right click if I do a
command click command click just creates
multiple multiple cursors so in order to
set this functionality up we're going to
have to create a special file and so if
I open up terminal here the directory
where we need to create this file is in
our home library and then application
support sublime text 3 and that is in
packages and then user so let's go ahead
and navigate there and now I already
have the name of this file copied to my
clipboard and the name of this file is
default space
and then these parentheses OS X dot
sublime ash Mouse map so I'm going to
create that file up and it looks like I
need to put this in quotes here
ok so create that file and now you can
open up this up in any text editor of
your choice I have a sublime shortcut
here in my terminal so I'm going to go
ahead and open this up in sublime text
oh and I forgot that that command is
just that ok so now I have this file
opened up and this is going to be very
similar to
any other of the configuration files
within sublime so we're gonna open this
up here okay and then the first option
here is going to be called button and
then we want to set this equal to button
one and actually let me make these
double quotes our second value here is
going to be count and that's going to be
one the next one is going to be called
modifiers and this is going to be set
this equal to control and the reason
we're setting this equal to control is
because like I said before in Eclipse
it's command click to get to the
function definition but command click
already has some functionality within
sublime us to make these multiple
cursors so instead we're going to use
control so now we only have two more to
go this one is called press command and
set that equal to drag underscore select
and then the last one here we actually
set the command and the command that we
want is go to underscore definition and
let's save that and now I'm going to
restart sublime and go down here and
open it back up and now let's see if
those changes took effect okay so that
is not working let's see if we can find
where we made a mistake let's make sure
that we put this file in the right
directory okay and that's where the file
needs to go and let's make sure that the
file is there okay so it looks like
whenever I left the quotes off the first
time it put in some spaces here so this
there
shouldn't be any spaces here between
these parentheses so let's try to move
that file and I think I still have this
saved on my clipboard so now we'll put
this in quotes actually need to take
these quotes out here back that okay so
that should be good and let's check that
okay that should be good let me clear
the screen and don't save that okay now
I'm going to restart sublime text again
and pull it back up and now let's see if
those changes took effect okay so that
works now if we hold in control and
click on any of these functions or
methods you can see that it takes us
directly to the definition so that's
extremely nice especially in whenever
you have bigger projects with tons of
files instead of digging through to find
those definitions it's really nice just
to be able to click on those from your
imported modules and it have it take you
directly to the code so yeah hopefully
