video we're going to be looking at how
we can customize our terminal with some
pre-built dot files so in the previous
videos we looked at the differences
between the bash underscore profile and
the bash RC files and we also saw how we
could modify these files in order to
customize our prompt but really we only
scratch the surface of the potential of
what these files can do so in this video
we're going to look at some popular dot
files that other people have put
together online and look through some of
them and see if we can figure out
exactly what's going on the amount of
helpful stuff that some people have
managed to put into these files is
pretty impressive so with that said
let's go ahead and get started so first
things first I want to point out here
that I'm starting off from a completely
clean slate so I removed the bash
underscore profile and the bash RC files
that we had built in our other videos so
now I have a completely uncustomary man
prompt so let's go ahead and go grab
some dot files so if you just do a
google search on dot files then one of
the first results is a link to a github
page with a lot of great information so
I'm going to go ahead and go into this
so they give information on what dot
files are and also a link at the bottom
here has a link to a few different
tutorials to where you can learn more
about these but we've already been
looking at the basics of these files in
our previous videos so let's scroll back
up to the top and they also give some
links to some popular dot file
repositories so let's go ahead and dive
into someone else's repository and see
what they've done with setting up their
dot files now one of the more popular
ones and one that I based my own dot
files off of is this Matias vines I hope
I said that right so let's go ahead and
take a look at his repository so you can
see here that this repository is pretty
popular it's got a lot of stars and a
lot of forked repositories off of it
so if we scroll down here to the bottom
then he gives a set of instructions here
for how to use his repository and he
also mentions that if you want to give
these dot files a try
and you should work this repository
review the code and remove the things
that you don't want or need and that's
exactly what we're going to do so let's
go ahead and download this repository
and just jump right in so we could do a
git clone into a local directory or we
could just download the zip file from
this page and since we're already here
I'm just going to go ahead and grab this
zip file and you can do that with this
button right here so now that that's
downloaded let's go ahead and extract
that and back in the terminal I'm gonna
go ahead and open this up in Sablan so
I'll do sublime and I'll drag this in
here so if we look at the directory
structure of this repository it can be a
little intimidating at first let's just
go ahead and take a look at the two
files that we've already looked at in
our previous videos that is the bash
underscore profile and the bash RC files
okay so right off the bat we can see
that this is slightly different than
what we did in our previous videos so
instead of sourcing the bash RC file
from the bash underscore profile he's
actually doing the opposite and within
his bash RC file here he is sourcing his
bash underscore profile so now let's
look at his bash underscore profile and
look at some of the customizations that
he's made now I'll explain what I can
with these files but truthfully there's
so much information in here that I don't
know exactly what everything does but
he's done a pretty good job of
commenting a lot of this code for us so
if he scroll down through this file then
it's not exactly clear where he is
customizing the prompt so in our last
video we learned that to customize the
prompt we need to change the ps1
variable and that's nowhere to be seen
in the bash RC file or the bash
underscore profile so where exactly is
this getting changed well there is some
interesting lines here towards the top
of this file right here with this for
loop and what this is doing is that it's
looping through different dot files and
running some checks on them and if they
pass those checks then it is running
source on those files which if we
remember that means that it will run the
code within the
files and also just a quick side note
here if you ever want to know what these
checks are doing then what we can do is
you can open up your terminal and to
learn what those checks are doing you
can run a command called man which will
look up the manual page for test and
this will show you all of the checks
that you can perform so he was using -
are and you can see that the description
here for - are is true if the file
exists and is readable and he was also
using - F which is true if the file
exists and is a regular file so that's
useful whenever you're looking through
these files so back to the loop here the
files that he is looping over there is a
path file a bash underscore prompt
exports aliases functions and extra so
it looks like he wanted to break up his
dot file so that each one had a specific
responsibility and that's a really good
idea because otherwise these files would
just be jam-packed with so much
information in one place so the bash
underscore prompt is likely where he is
customizing the prompt the aliases file
is where he can apply some commands
shortcuts that he likes and so on so
let's take a second and imagine what's
going on so far so when he first runs
his terminal it's going to run his bash
underscore profile file and if the
terminal is a sub shell which we talked
about in previous video then it'll run
the bash RC file which in turn the bash
RC file calls the bash underscore
profile so no matter what this is the
code that's going to get executed and
when this code gets executed it's going
to loop through all of these dot files
that he specifies here and run each of
those files if they exist so now let's
go over here and open up this bash
underscore prompt file and take a look
at that and let me go ahead and just set
this to bash syntax okay so this is the
great thing about downloading these dot
files from other people and seeing what
they're doing because
these guys have put in a lot of effort
to make the additional checks that we
didn't go over in our previous videos so
I'm not exactly sure what this check is
doing here it looks like it has
something to do with the 256-color
settings this prompt get function right
underneath here this is what allows us
to add get information to our prompt so
if we're within a git repository then
the get branch and some information
about the status of our current branch
will show up within the terminal prompt
so you can see here within this function
it does certain checks to add things to
your prompt so right here it's checking
for uncommitted changes in the index
check for unstaged files and things like
that so if we go down here past the get
stuff now we'll start seeing some stuff
that should look a little bit more
familiar to us so here we can see the t
put commands and we saw some of these in
our previous videos so here we have the
reset values here are the bold and also
we have some other useful colors now in
addition to the T put colors it looks
like he's also running a check here
which has some fallbacks
if t put is not available so that's nice
to have and it's set up in a way to
where these variable names are the same
so you have orange equal to the t put
here and also orange equal to the
fallback so then you can just use that
orange variable anywhere in your script
and you don't have to worry about
whether or not it was set using the t
put or the fallback so let's keep going
and see what else we have here so here
are a couple of useful conditionals
right here so in this first conditional
here he's checking if the user is equal
to the root user and if so then we're
going to set the user style color to red
and if not then we're going to set it
equal to orange and this next
conditional here is checking whether we
are currently using SSH and if so then
we're setting the hostname to a bold red
and if not then it's going to be set to
yellow so it gives us some nice visual
feedback as to whether we're logged in
to a different machine or logged in as
the root user and now down here towards
the bottom we're finally seeing where
we're actually setting the ps1 variable
and this should look familiar because
it's similar to how we customize our
terminal towards the end of the previous
video but there is a little extra
functionality here than what we had so
first of all this top line here he has
commented that it sets the terminal
title to the current working directory
so that's pretty interesting so then we
can just walk down and see how this gets
built up so then we are applying bold
and then we have the user style and then
the user name and then down here we have
the host and then the working directory
and now this next line here is pretty
interesting so this is where we're using
the prompt get function that we saw at
the top of this file and it's adding the
desired colors if we're within a git
repository okay so those are all of the
prompt customizations but before we
apply these customizations to our own
terminal let's quickly take a look at
some of these other files that we have
in the repository so within this aliases
file here you can see some of these
shortcuts that he's added for himself so
within his terminal he can just type dot
dot and it will take him up a directory
and typing three dots will take him up
two directories and so on so some of
these other ones would be pretty useful
also so right here we can see that he is
detecting which LS flavor is in use and
depending on that it will set certain
colors accordingly so I'd go ahead and
look through these files on your own and
see if there's anything that these
people might use that you could also
like to use for yourself now another
file that I wanted us to take a look at
is this dot OS X file so this is pretty
interesting here so here he has his file
set up in a way that it will set
all of his max settings exactly how he
likes them so that's what's so powerful
about these dot files so say for example
if he was to have his computer stolen or
if he had his hard drive crash or
something like that then what he could
do is he could download his repository
onto a brand-new computer and then run
these files and just have thousands of
settings changed exactly how he wants
them in a matter of minutes so I would
look through files like that also and
see if there's anything in there that
interests you so there's a lot of cool
snippets to choose from and all of them
seem to have good comments excelling
saying exactly what they do okay and one
more file here before we apply our
changes to our prompt so I also wanted
to show you this brood Sh file that he
has here so this is a bash script that
he can run to install command line tools
that he finds useful so for example he
can install core utils which will
install in new core utilities this brew
install bash right here will install
bash 4 and that may not come with your
computer by default so all kinds of
useful stuff ok so now that we've looked
at some of those other files that come
with repositories like this let's go
ahead and get back to actually
customizing our prompt so when you
download these repositories you can just
pick and choose what you want from these
files that you want to use for yourself
so specifically we're going to be
grabbing these files that are needed in
order to customize our terminal prompt
so also first of all before you do this
if you currently have dot files that are
using for yourself like the bash RC
files or bash underscore profiles then
you'll want to move those to another
location or be sure to back them up so
that they're safe so that if you don't
like any of the changes that you've made
for any reason then you can just restore
those back so with that said I'm gonna
go ahead and just start grabbing a few
files from his repository here so I'm
gonna go ahead and do a CP to copy and
that repository is located in my
downloads folder
and not files master and what I want to
grab out of here is I want to grab the
dot bash RC file and I'm going to put
all of these in my home directory so I'm
going to go ahead and grab that bash RC
file I'm gonna grab the bash underscore
profile and I'm also gonna grab the bash
underscore prompt so now I'm gonna go
ahead and close down the files from his
repository and I'm going to go ahead and
open up the ones that are on within my
home directory so the one specifically
I'm going to open up the dot bash
underscore profile and I'm also going to
open up the bash underscore prompt file
and again I'm going to go ahead and set
this to bash syntax okay so if I go over
here to this bash underscore profile
then remember we have these checks in
place so that it only tries to source
these files if they exist so it's not a
big deal that we only grabbed the bash
prompt file because these other files
just won't meet these conditionals and
it won't try to do anything with them
and I'm gonna go ahead and leave these
other customizations in this file but
you can read through these comments and
if there's anything that you don't like
then you can just go ahead and delete
the section from the file okay so this
bash underscore profile does source our
bash underscore prompt so now that we
have these files in place if I go back
here to my terminal and I quit out and
open it back up
then these changes should take place
okay so now you can see that our prompt
is customized I'm going to go ahead and
minimize a couple of things here to get
a few things out of the way now this
looks similar to how we had it
customized in one of our previous videos
but this is a little bit more powerful
than the ones that we made before so for
example if you remember we had that code
in our bash underscore prompt dot file
that should display branch information
if we're currently in a git repository
so let me go ahead and navigate to an
old git repository that I used in a
previous project so
that was in projects and demos gets done
and that was stache demo and you can see
here that we're now currently in a git
repository and you can see here where it
says that we're on the master branch so
also let's go ahead and open up the if I
do an LS in this directory I have this
one file and this get repository so let
me make a change that file really quick
and I'll just make something really
simple here return a times B and save
that so now if I go back and clear my
prompt out now you can see here in my
prompt that have put an exclamation
point here to show that we have
uncommitted changes in our branch so
this visual feedback is a great thing to
have in your prompt so just knowing what
branch were on at a glance without
needing to type it in over and over
that's a huge plus so really if you were
happy with a customized prompt like this
then you could just stop there
but really quick let's take a quick look
at how we can customize some of these
values just slightly and that should
kind of get you on your way to being
able to customize your own prompt in any
way that you want so I'm going to go
ahead and just let this take up half the
screen here and I'll go into my bash
prompt here and go down to the PSone
values okay so let me just make a couple
of changes here so first of all the
yellow value that I usually use is a
little different I like to use the value
228 for the green value I like to use a
green value of 71 and for the blue I
like to use 153 and I'll post a link to
this color chart for these values and
the description below so that you can
see where I'm getting these values from
and now if I scroll down to the PSone
values here I mostly like how this
prompts already set up but for the sake
of showing how we can change it let's
just make a few adjustments here so
let's say that instead of wanting this @
here let's just take this out with these
spaces and let's just put in an actual @
symbol and also I really don't like this
lower case
w-4 the directory so if we look in the
terminal then you can see what this
lowercase W does is it tells our prompt
to show the full path to where we
currently are but whenever you get deep
down into a directory structure you can
see how this becomes really long and
right now when this is just taken up
half the screen it's causing our prompt
to wrap around so instead I'm going to
change this lowercase W to an uppercase
W and what that's going to do is it's
only going to display the last part of
this path instead of the entire thing
and lastly here just one last change for
this get prompt instead of this violet
and blue I'm just going to do a blue and
a blue and I'll save that so now if I go
back here to my terminal to apply these
changes I can just run source on my bash
prompt file so I can do a source and
that's within the home directory and
this is bash underscore prompt okay so
now if we run that then all of the
colors should be updated and we also
have this shorter directory path now so
that's looking good and if there are any
additional changes that you want to make
to customize your prompt then hopefully
after a few of these videos then you'll
feel comfortable just kind of hopping in
here and editing some of these values to
whatever it is that you want them to be
okay so I think that's gonna do it for
this video I hope everyone found this
walkthrough useful a lot of people have
been asking me to make a video on how I
customized my command prompt and I could
have probably made a very short video
specifically on just that but I think
these dot files are so useful that I
really wanted to show a bigger picture
of what all can be done with them so if
you have the time go and give some of
those other repositories a look and see
what all they have to offer there's a
lot of great aliases and and functions
and tips that people put in there and
it's all very well commented and
documented and it's also a great way to
learn a lot more about these types of
files but if anyone does have any
questions you know feel free to ask in
