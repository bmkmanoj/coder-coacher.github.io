video we'll be taking a look at the
pillow library for Python so pillow
allows us to work with and manipulate
images using Python so we'll learn how
we can do several things with the images
like displaying them to the screen
resizing them modifying their colors and
also saving them back to your machine so
this is extremely useful when you want
to modify a lot of images at once or if
you want to automatically run a script
on images that you upload to a certain
directory so for example I have a
website that contains images and I
usually need multiple sizes of these
images one full-size image and then
several others for thumbnails and image
galleries and things like that now I
used to manually resize all of the
images and it took a long time but with
a library like pillow you can do all of
this automatically all at once so let's
go ahead and get started and see how
this works so first off we need to
install pillow now I already have this
installed on my machine but I'll show
you the commands that I used in order to
get it running so I'm on a Mac so first
you want to Google pillow for Python and
it will take you to their documentation
and since I'm on a Mac you can install
it for whatever operating system you're
on but I went down here to OS X
installation now it's pretty easy to get
this working on your machine but it's
not quite as easy as only running the
PIP install so you also need a few
external libraries as well so I use this
brew install command here to install
these external libraries now if you
don't have homebrew installed on your
machine then you will need to do that
and there's a link here to do that as
well but I'm not going to go into too
much detail about that right now so once
you get these external libraries
installed then you can just run this pip
install pillow command and that should
take care of everything else now once
you think that you have that installed
correctly then you should be able to
open up the editor of your choice here
and in my case I have sublime text open
up here and you should be able to type
in from PIL import image so if I run
that you can see that my script ran with
no output but there's also no error so
that's a good thing now this may be a
little different than packages that
you're used to working with it's a
little strange that we did a pip install
pillow and whenever we use the package
we say from PIL import the modules that
you want but I think this is it from a
naming convention that's just kind of
been around for a while so it's how they
still do it so now that we have pill
installed let's start playing with some
images so I have a couple of images here
of my dog whenever he was a puppy that
we can work with now these images are in
the same directory as my Python file
here so I'll be able to reference them
simply with their file names if you're
working with images that are in a
different location then you can just use
their full path to the image so first
things first let's start off really
simple and see if we can just display
one of these images to the screen so
we're going to need to create an image
object and I already have image imported
here so now to create this image object
let's just call this image one and I'm
going to set it equal to image dot open
and then the file name that I'm going to
grab over here is pup one but jpg so I'm
going to say pup one dot jpg so now this
gives me an image object that I can work
with and you can do just about anything
with this image object so what we're
going to want to do is we're just going
to do image one dot show now if I run
this command you can see here that my
Python script here did pull up this
image and open it up in preview so let's
go ahead and close that down so the fact
that we were able to display that image
to the screen now we know that we're
working with the correct image so let's
go ahead and do a simple modification to
it so what if I wanted to save instead
of a jpg file what if I wanted to save
that as a PNG instead I want to do that
we can use this save method now within
the save method Here I am just going to
grab this file name here and instead of
up one not jpg I'm just going to call
this pup one dot PNG and if I run this
code you can see over here in my file
system that now we have this pup 1 jpg
and pump 1 dot PNG and I can open that
up just like I did the jpg
okay so now I'm going to delete this PNG
that we just now created now now this is
where the pillow library really comes in
handy is whenever we want to work with
multiple images at a time so what if we
wanted to convert all of these images to
PNG s so let's go ahead and do that I'm
going to create a new folder here in my
file system and I'm going to call this
P&amp;amp;G s and this will be the folder where
I hold the P&amp;amp;G versions of all of these
JPEGs
okay so first we're going to need a way
to loop over all of the images in our
current directory now to do this I'm
going to import the OS module now since
this is a tutorial on the pillow library
I'm not going to go too in depth as to
what the OS module is doing here but to
loop over the files in the current
directory I'm just going to say for F in
OS dot list
dur and then I'm just going to put a dot
here for the current directory so that
for loop will loop through everything in
the current directory so now I'm going
to say if F dot ends with and then I'm
going to say if it ends with a dot jpg
then at this point I'm just going to
print out F so if we run this then we
can see down here and our output that it
printed out all of our JPEGs that we
have in the current directory so now
that I know that that's working
correctly I'm going to go ahead and make
an image object out of each one of these
so I'm just going to say I equals image
dot open F and save that so now I'm
going to be saving all of these as a PNG
file but I want to keep the same file
name so I'm going to go ahead and split
out the file name and the file extension
from the file that I have so I'm going
to say Oh s dot path dot split text and
pass in the file name so now this is
going to break everything up into a file
name and file extension so if I print
the file name and run this then you can
see that we just got the file name
without the extension and if I print the
file extension and run that then you can
see that we just get four JPEGs so now
to save all of those as
Ang's inside the PNG folder I'm just
going to say I dot save and then within
here I can name the file so I'm going to
say P and G's to pass it into the PNG
sector II and then I will do the file
name there dot PNG and then I'll do a
dot format to pass in that file name and
I'll save that and this should be a dot
right here that's typo so now if I run
this code what it's going to do is it's
going to go through and make an image
object out of each of these files and
then save it into this P and G's
directory so I just ran that now if I
open up this PNG directory you can see
that we have all four of these files
that have a dot PNG extension on them
okay so that's one thing that you can do
with a group of images but let's try to
do that example I was talking about
before that I did on my website where
instead of giving all the files a
different extension let's see if we can
resize each file so like I said this
would be extremely useful on a web
server or something similar if you want
a resized version of all your files for
thumbnails or image galleries so not
only are we going to want to resize a
file but we also want to keep the same
aspect ratio too so that our photos
don't get squished or distorted so first
let's decide what maximum size we want
our files to be so for this example I'm
going to say that I want the size of our
files to be let's say 300 so I'm going
to make a variable here that's size
underscore 300 and your image sizes need
to be a tuple of the sizes so I'm just
going to say 300 comma 300 so now in my
file system over here I'm going to go
ahead and create a new folder and I'm
going to call this folder 300 and this
will hold all of our 300 pixel file
sizes so now that we've decided on a
file size here in my for loop right
above where I'm doing the save I'm just
going to say I dot thumbnail and I'm
going to pass in this size of 300 here
now I'm also going to modify my save
down here to save into the 300 folder
then I'm going to go ahead and do the
original file name with
underscore 300 there and instead of this
PNG extension I'm just going to go ahead
and keep the regular extension and pass
that in using the format so I'll save
FEX T there to send that file extension
so now if I run this what this does is
it goes through and it makes an image
object out of all these files and then
it does a thumbnail to the size of 300
300 that we made up here and then it
saves this into the 300 directory so if
I go over here and open up our 300
directory you can see that we have our
old file name underscore 300 G peg so if
I open up all these you can see that now
these are a small 300 pixel version of
the images of our original images now
the great thing about being able to do
this in Python is that we can just
quickly and easily modify our script to
accept any new sizes that we want so say
for example that we suddenly had a
requirement to do 700 pixel images as
well so we can go through and just as
easily add in another step to do 300 and
700 pixel images so if I change this to
700 here then what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to copy all of this and
then go down here and I'll do a size of
700 up here at top and then after it
makes the 700 image then it'll go
through and make the 300 size image so
you can see that we have two different
steps here so when it leaks through
we're going to make the image object
we're going to resize this to a 700
pixels um nail save it into a 700
directory here which I'm going to go
ahead and create so I'll create that
there and then we're going to resize it
to a 300 pixel image and then save it
into the 300 pixel folder so if I run
this you can see that finished and half
a second if I go into the 300 pixel
folder you can see that we have our 300
pixel images there and if I go into the
700 pixel holder then we have our 700
pixel images there so you can see how
library like this will be would be
extremely useful when it keeps you from
doing a lot of this work that some
people do manually every time they
upload images to the website and it's
how I used to do images from my website
too I would go in and resize these
full-sized images down one by one and
then upload them to my web server but
using a library like this makes all of
that so much faster but so far we've
only touched on a few things that you
can do with this imaging library so let
me show you a few more things just to
give you a few quick ideas before we end
the video here so for example so far
we've gone through and we've changed
file extensions and we've resized the
images but you can also rotate images
you can make images black and white you
can blur images and you can do all kinds
of things so let's just walk through a
couple of these examples so I'm going to
go ahead and remove this entire for loop
here and I'm just going to work with one
image at a time so it's a little bit
more obvious what's going on but you
could just as easily do all of these and
that for loop as well and it would do
that to all of your images okay so let
me go ahead and uncomment out this code
where I was working on this pup one dot
jpg so first let me rotate an image so
to rotate an image I'm going to do image
1 dot rotate and let's say that we just
want to rotate it 90 degrees so now
after we rotate it 90 degrees then I'm
going to go ahead and run the save
method on it and I will just call this
I'll call it pup 1 underscore mod dot
jpg so if I run this code here then you
can see we have this pup 1 mod and if I
open this up you can see that at that
image has been rotated 90 degrees okay
now let's say that we wanted to make
this image black-and-white now to do
this instead of rotating 90 degrees I'm
going to do a convert and inside what
I'm going to pass into the convert I'm
going to say mode equals ill and save
that and if I run that then you can see
over here now our pup 1 mod if we open
that up is a black and white image now
just so you know I didn't memorize that
convert and Moe
they'll for the black and wine I had to
go and look that up in the documentation
to get those values and when you first
start working with libraries like this
it's really not it's really not feasible
to think that you're going to memorize
all these off the top of your head so
you really have to get comfortable with
the documentation so whatever you're
trying to do just go to the pillow
documentation and find the values that
you need and and do it that way it's a
great resource to learn what you can do
with images but just to give you a
further idea of a couple more things
that you can do with these images let's
go ahead and do one that's a little bit
more complicated let's blur our image
now so if you want to blur an image then
we have to import another module up here
so instead of just image let's go ahead
and also import image filter so now if I
want to blur my image back and say image
1 dot filter and within filter I'm going
to pass in an image filter dot and I'm
going to do a Gaussian blur so if I go
ahead and save this and run it if I open
up this up one mod here you can see that
this doesn't seem very blurred and
that's because we use the default values
with this blur let me go ahead and make
my text a actually I'm just going to
spread this over a little bit so that
you can see all this text and I'll make
this bigger again so you can see that we
just did a Gaussian blur with the
default values and the default values
and I found this from the documentation
it's a radius set to 2 which it does
blur the image but just not very much so
if I replace that default value of 2
with say like a 15 and then I rerun this
code now let's close down this image and
we kind of already got a look at what it
looks like if we close down that image
and then open it back up you can see
that that blur is is much more blurred
than it was before so I think that about
does it for this video I hope that gives
you some good ideas for what you can do
with this image library and Python
I do recommend going and checking out
the documentation because there's so
much more that you can do with images
than just what was in the
video but if you do have any questions
about this stuff just feel free to ask
