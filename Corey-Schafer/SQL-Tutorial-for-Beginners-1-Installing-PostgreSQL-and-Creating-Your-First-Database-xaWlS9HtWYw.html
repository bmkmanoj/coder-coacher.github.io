video we'll be learning the basics of
SQL queries from the ground up now SQL
is a great language for programmers to
learn because it's hard to find a
software system these days that doesn't
talk to some type of database on the
back end and not only is it a great
thing to know but it's also a good
starting point for certain people who
are interested in getting started in
computer science because in my opinion
it's not nearly as difficult as learning
the ins and outs of a programming
language like Python or JavaScript or
Java I mean there are just a limited
number of commands and for most jobs
you're going to be using the basics of
SQL such as grabbing values from a
database that meet a certain criteria or
something like that now there are times
when more advanced queries are going to
be needed but if you learn the basics
then it's going to put you in a position
where you can do the majority of the the
queries and then you can learn the more
advanced stuff whenever you're ready
so with that said let's go ahead and get
started so in this video I'm going to
show you how I set up my environment so
that I can run SQL queries and also
we're going to create our first database
and connect to that database now for
these tutorials I'm going to be using a
Postgres database now I'm on a Mac so
I'll show you the process that I went
through to set this up on my machine so
first we're going to need to install
Postgres and on the Mac the easiest way
to do this is with the Postgres dot app
now if you search in google here for
Postgres Mac the first result is the
official website and if we open up that
website you can see that they have a
downloader here but then they also
recommend the Post Crest app here as a
simple native Mac app that runs in the
menu bar without the need of an
installer and that's what I think is the
easiest so I already have that pulled up
here but if you run the search it's the
second result here this Postgres dot app
so now that we're in this website we can
just download like this like any other
application so let's go ahead and run
that download so now once that download
is finished
go ahead and unzip this and now let's go
ahead and move this application over to
our Applications folder so I've already
got that pulled up here I'm going to
drag that on over okay now with that
Postgres app installed that's going to
give us a Postgres server that we can
talk to using the command line
now the command line isn't the best way
to visualize what's going on so we're
also going to want a graphical interface
program to inspect our databases now on
the Postgres app website that I had
pulled up earlier they list a few of
their favorite GUI tools here so I'm
going to click on this link and these
are some of the GUI tools that they
recommend now the tool that I'm going to
be using for these tutorials is this one
down here near the bottom called piece
equal now if you prefer another option
then go ahead and use what you like but
the reason that I chose this program is
because it's very clean and has a simple
layout and it also has the ability to
enlarge fonts which a few of the other
ones surprisingly didn't have now these
features are important to me because
recording these videos I don't want a
lot of windows and stuff getting in the
way and also I want to make the font
large enough for you guys to be able to
see what I'm typing so let's go ahead
and download this program just like we
did the other one and then we're also
going to move that to our Applications
folder so let's go ahead and unzip this
and I will open up Applications folder
again and just drag this over here okay
now with both of these programs
installed let's first start our sequel
server by Ronit by running this Postgres
app so now we can see that our server is
running because if we look up here in
the top menu we can see that this little
elephant icon here and it says running
on port 5 4 3 2 now it's also going to
pop up this window here with this option
to open P SQL and what that's going to
do is it's going to open up the command
line for us to start typing in commands
now I know that the command line can be
intimidating to some people but we're
not going to
in here for long all we're going to do
is create a database that we can work
with so to create this database it's
just as simple as running the command
create database and we're going to call
this sample underscore DB and we need to
end this with a semicolon so let's go
ahead and hit enter there and you can
see that it says create database now
there's a piece equal command here
backslash L if we run that then we can
view the databases that we have here and
you can see that it created a few for us
whenever we first installed the program
but we can see here that we do have this
sample underscore DB now to quit out of
this command line we can do this
backslash Q and it takes us back to our
normal terminal so now I quit out of the
command line there because we're not
going to need to use it anymore because
the command line it's not the prettiest
way to see what's going on in our
database so let's connect to the sample
database that we just created using the
P sequel application that we downloaded
earlier so I'm going to go ahead and
launch that now if you get this little
error here cannot be opened because
developer cannot be confirmed that's
because I double clicked it it's a weird
thing with the Mac if you actually right
click it and click open then it will
give you the option to override that and
just open that up anyway now you'll see
that with certain applications so now
that we have this application opened up
we're going to connect to our database
and we're going to accept most of the
defaults here you can see the port is 5
4 3 2 the same one that's listed
whenever we right-click on our server it
says it's running on port 5 4 3 2 the
one thing that we are going to want to
change here is that we're going to want
to type in the database that we created
so we call that sample underscore DB and
now we can go ahead and connect to that
database and we've successfully
connected to the database now there's
nothing here right now that's because we
don't have any tables or any information
within our database yet but we are in a
position now to where we can begin
writing a sequel command so for example
if I wanted to create a table here I
could create a table we'll just call
this test underscore table now I'm not
going to go too far into the details
here because I'm
going to go go into this further in
another tutorial but if I just create a
very basic table here with one column I
can run that query and if i refresh our
tables over here then we have a test
table with one column called a so in
this tutorial we installed a Postgres
server we created the database and then
we also installed a visual application
to where we can visually inspect this
database and we've also set it up to
where we can now run SQL queries against
this database so in the next tutorial
we'll start adding tables to our
database and we'll go over exactly how
to do that so I hope this tutorial was
useful for you guys if you have any
questions just ask in the comment
section below be sure to watch the other
videos to get more in depth in the SQL
commands and thank you all for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
