Python video we're going to be taking a
look at named tuples and what name
tuples are and why we would use them so
you can think of a name tuple kind of
like a lightweight object that works
just like a regular tuple but it's more
readable so what do I mean by this so
say that we want to represent RGB color
values red green blue color values and
code and say that we choose a tuple to
do this so here is a regular tuple so we
have color equal to and this will be our
red at fifty five will be our red 155
will be our green 255 will be our blue
so let's say that we wanted to print out
the red value so in order to print out
that red value we would just do print
color and then we would do index of zero
and if we run that code then you can see
that we got 55 for the red value now
what's going to happen here is that
someone else is going to come and look
at this code or even you can come and
look at this code weeks and months later
and they're going to read this and
they're not going to know what's going
on we have color equal to these numbers
and then we're printing out the index of
zero you know what are these numbers
somebody could look at this and think
you know is this hue saturation and
light or I don't know what's going on
here so it would be really nice if this
was more readable
now the first idea that might pop into
your head is to use a dictionary so
let's see what that would look like so
let's grab a dictionary representation
of this and let's paste this in here now
instead of printing out this index of
zero down here let's print out red and
let's save that and if we run it you can
see that we got the same thing it's 55
so what is wrong with this why wouldn't
we choose to use a dictionary well first
of all maybe we chose to use a tuple for
a reason so tuples are immutable which
means that you can't change the values
maybe that's something that we wanted
and also dictionaries require a little
bit more typing here so if we made a
more
than one color we'd have to come in and
type all this out every time we created
a new color so a named tuple is kind of
a good compromise between the tuple in
the dictionary between readability and
also it gives you the functionality of a
tuple so let's go ahead and see what
this would look like so let me copy the
example I have here and paste this in
and let's go ahead and go over this and
for now I'm going to go ahead and take
out these values here okay so first of
all to use the name tuple first we have
to import it so from collections import
named tuple and then this line here is
the syntax that we use for named tuple
so we'll do that we want a color equal
to name to pull and then the name of our
named tuple and we'll do this as color I
have all this typed up up top but I just
want you to see if you are making one
your yourself the steps here so the name
tuple is named color and then these are
going to be the values of the tuple so
the values that we want for our tuple
are red green and blue so that's what
the syntax looks like to create a named
tuple now let's take a look at the
advantages over a regular tuple here now
if you remember when we created a
regular tuple we just did the values
like this and it wasn't very readable
and now we are saying that we want this
variable color equal to color which is
what we call it our named tuple here and
right now we have 55 155 255 and that is
red green and blue now I can still use
this just like a regular to boy if I
wanted to come in here and I wanted to
do the imprint the index of 0 which
would be our red value and I can print
that and it prints out 55 but I can also
come in here and print these out by name
so I can say color dot red and print out
out and you can see that it's 55 now you
can see this is already a lot more
readable than our regular tuple because
whenever we come in here or somebody
else comes in and looks at our code
they're going to see okay they're
printing out color dot red so and then
they're going to look up here and say
okay this is a color with three values
here and they can make a guess as to
what that is now if you want to be
really explicit you can actually come in
here and add all these values in so that
whenever you come back you know exactly
what those values are but even without
those there
somebody's going to be able to come in
and see okay you created this from this
color here and then they can look back
at the name tuple where you made that
definition and they can see that it's
red green and blue with the regular
tuple you didn't have that that was that
information was nowhere to be found and
now if you remember also it's this is a
lot less typing as well if you remember
our dictionary here every time if we
were to make a new color or something
like that and I'll just call this
something else that doesn't collide with
our other one so with our dictionary
this we had all this typing to do but if
I wanted to make another color from a
name tuple then I don't have to type out
all this stuff I can just do okay I want
a color and white would be 255 255 255
and that's done and then later in the
code if I wanted to print out say the
blue value of white then I would just do
white dot blue and you can see that that
is 255 and that's also a little bit
easier to write than the dictionary if
you remember the dictionary we can't do
this
dot syntax we'll get an error we have to
put that in brackets which isn't a big
deal but it's a lot more typing it's a
lot easier just to come in here and use
the dot syntax so hopefully that kind of
clears up what I named tuple is and why
exactly you would use one and also I
hope you can see how this is a lot more
readable than
what a regular tuple might be so
whenever someone else reads your code or
whenever you come back to your code and
a couple of weeks or months then you're
going to be able to take a look at this
and see almost instantaneously what's
going on and with the regular tuple
example that we used that would have
been really hard so yeah I hope that
cleared any questions that you had about
named tuples if you do have any
questions then just ask in the comment
