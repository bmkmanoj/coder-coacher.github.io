runs every element in your array through
a specified function and that function
will look at every element and it will
run it through a condition and if that
condition returns true then that element
gets added to a return array so filter
returns an array of elements that met
every condition in your function the
best way to show you this is just to
show you an example so for example here
I have an array with a bunch of random
integers and then here I'm printing this
array out to the screen so if we write a
function called num over now this
callback here is going to have access to
the same parameters that we've seen
before and the other callbacks it's
going to have the element of the array
the current index of the array and then
it's going to have the original array
that we're doing the operations on so
for this example let's just return
whether the element is greater than 20
and then down here where we have this
far filtered array let's set this equal
to array dot filter and then let's pass
in this num over function here and then
let's print this filtered array out to
the screen let me save that now you can
see down here in this filter array every
element is over 20 if I came up here to
this num over function and said less
than 20 and save that now if we come
down here to the filtered array we can
see it only pulled out the elements that
were less than 20 so you can do any
check within this function that you want
and it will return a new array of all
the elements that meet whatever
condition it is that you specify so
is a simple example using some integers
let's try an example using an object
here and pretty much with the object
you're just going to do the same thing
that you did for the array of integers
you see that our array here is an array
of objects and each one of these objects
has a name and an age so if we wanted to
code if we wanted to filter out let's
say ages over the age of 30 and I could
say function filter age and like I said
before you don't have to pass in all
those parameters here I'm just going to
pass in the element and then I'm going
to return any element that is greater
actually that's going to be element age
because this is now an object so we want
her to turn element dot age over 30 and
let's uncomment out this variable here
and let's set this equal to array let's
see this is array 1414 dot filter and
pass in filter age and let's print this
out to the screen save that and now we
can see down in our filtered array we
only have John and Steve because both of
those are over the age of 30 so that is
how the filter method works now let's go
down here and take a look at the method
every the every method is a little
similar to the filter method but instead
of it returning an array of all the
elements that meet the criteria it
checks to see if every element meets the
criteria and it returns a boolean that
is true or false saying whether all
those elements met the criteria in the
function so for example
right a function is every and I'm just
gonna pass in the element here but it
could also have access to the index and
the original array and let's just return
if every element is greater than ten and
then I will uncomment out this variable
passed here and I'll set this equal to
array fifteen dot every and then I'm
going to pass in this is every function
and then I'm going to uncomment out this
line here to print it out to the screen
and you can see my every result is false
because if we look at the array we have
this value for here so every element in
the array is not greater than ten and as
soon as it hits this four value it'll
just return false immediately because it
knows from that point on and not every
value in the array is over ten if I
would change this four to a fourteen and
save that now you can see down here
where I'm printing this out every result
is equal to true because every value in
this array is greater than ten so that
is a short example using an array of
integers now let's take a look at an
example that is using an array of
objects and this is just the same array
of objects I used last time with three
elements here each having a name and an
age so this time I'm going to write a
function called all under and pass in
the element and we will check if all of
these elements are under the age of 50
so I will do element actually that'll be
returned element age is under 50
and let me uncomment out this variable
here set array 15 not every and we'll
pass in this all under function and then
let me output this to the screen I'll
put that so we have the every result is
false because every one of these
elements does not have an age that is
under the age of 50 if I would check if
all of these ages are under the age of
60 and save that now you can see down
here that my every result is true so
that's a few examples of how the every
method works comment that out and now
let's take a look at the sum method now
we'll just take a quick look at this one
because it is so similar to the every
method what some does whenever we looked
at every it would return false as soon
as one of the elements didn't meet the
criteria in the sum method it will
return true as soon as one of the
elements do meet the criteria so for
example if I have a function here and
I'm going to call this some odd and I'm
gonna pass in the element now for some
odd I'm just going to return whether the
element mod 2 equals equals 1 and that
will let us know whether this element is
an odd number so then the uncomment out
this variable here I'll set this equal
to array 16 look not son and we will
pass in the some odd function save that
and let me output that to the screen and
you can see that my some result is false
if we look at the array here
every single one of these elements is
even so it's saying that there are not
there are not some of the some of these
elements that are odd if I made one of
these odd not plus this at 21 and save
that now you can see that my some result
is true because it says are some of
these odd looks at the array as soon as
it hits this 21 it returns true because
that's all it needs it just needs to one
so that is our example with an array of
integers really quick we will take a
look at an array of objects it's the
same array of objects that we've been
using before with the name and the age
and I'm just gonna write a function here
called some age pass in the element and
I will return whether the element dot
age we will check if there are some
people over 50 so let's do our passed
equals array 16 dot Sun then some age
save that lets output this to the screen
save and you can see that our some
result is true because there is one
person in here that has an age over 50
if I said are there some people in here
that have an aged over 60 and you can
see down here that the some result is
now off so that is a quick look at the
sum method now let's take a look at
reduce and reduce right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
