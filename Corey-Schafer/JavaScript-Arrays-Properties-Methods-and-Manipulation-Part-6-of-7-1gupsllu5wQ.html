the harder methods to grasp just because
instead of running an array instead of
running every element through a function
and then getting response reduce and
reduce right we'll actually remember the
previous response and apply it the next
time around and I don't think I can
describe it better than the chart over
on the Mozilla developer Network so I'm
just going to show you one of their
examples here if you look at their
example they have an array that is just
0 1 2 3 4 and then they call reduce and
then within reduce they are using their
callback function and so far in this
tutorial we've been pulling these Paul
callback functions out and naming them
but putting them inside here is
basically the same thing
so instead before we have usually called
an element here and we've done element
and then index and then array but with
reduce we have previous value and
current value and you can see here that
they returned previous value plus
current value so there is two ways to
call reduce you can either not provide
an initial value or you can provide an
initial value and if you don't provide
an initial value then the first time
through the first time it runs this
function the previous value will be set
to the first value of the array the
current value will be the second element
in the array if you do provide an
initial value down here they have one
with an initial value of 10 and if they
do provide one instead of this instead
of the first time through the function
instead of the previous value equal
equalling the first element of the array
it equals the initial value that you
passed in
and the current value equals that first
element of the array but pretty much if
we go through this step-by-step what's
happening here is it calls this function
on the on the first positions of the
array so like I said here there's no
initial value so the previous value 0
the current value is 1 and what we're
returning is previous value plus current
value so 0 plus 1 and then we can see
over here they have the return value
listed 0 plus 1 is 1 and now this return
value is saved as the previous value the
next time around so now if we come down
here to the second call this previous
value is now equal to 1 and then the
current value is the next value in the
array which is 2 so 1 plus 2 is 3 so
that 3 it's saved as the previous value
for the next call so 3 and then we move
on to the next value in the array which
is now 3 so 3 plus 3 is 6 and then 6
it's carried over to the previous value
again and then the next value in the
array is 4 so previous value is 6
current values for 6 plus 4 equals 10 so
basically this reduced function is just
a way to sum up all these values and if
you provide the initial value here and
it does the same thing except it just
has this one extra call at the beginning
that takes the initial value and adds it
to the first element of the array and
then that return value it's passed in as
the previous value for the second call
and it moves to the next index so if I
pull this up in our examples here we
have this array that is 1 2 3 4 5 if I
made a function called add values and
remember we'll have previous we'll have
current and we can also pass in the
index and we can also pass in
the array so what we'll do here we'll
just I'll just show you the example that
they had so let's return previous plus
current and then let me uncomment out
this result variable here and we'll set
the result equal to Ray seventeen about
reduce and we will pass in add values
save that and let me output this to the
screen and you can see that the reduced
result is 15 because 1 plus 2 is 3 3
plus 3 is 6 6 plus 4 is 10 and 10 plus 5
is 15 so what if we did this with an
array of characters so I'll uncomment
that and now you can see this reduced
result is a b c d e because the first
time through it does a plus B and then a
plus B which is a B it's passed in as
the previous value so then the next time
through you have a B plus C and then the
next time through you have ABC plus D
and then you have a b c d plus e so
that's how that works and i grouped
together reduce and reduce right to show
you at the same time because reduce
right instead of starting at the 0th
element and working to the right what
reduce right does is it starts at the
end and it just goes to the left so if I
was to do reduce right to these add
values then you can see now this reduced
result is reversed because it starts off
here at E and E is the previous value
current value is d so it says B plus D
which is e D then the next time through
ad is the previous value and then II D
plus C is ADC
EDC plus B and then e BC B plus a and
then you get the entire reversed string
as the result so hopefully that makes
sense I know that this is one of the
more complicated methods that we took a
look at just to come kind of hammer it
in let's take a look at doing this with
an object so let me uncomment out this
and okay now you have to be careful when
you're working with objects and this is
why reduce can be a little complicated
because you might run into some things
that you didn't expect so for example if
I was to do total age here then okay so
we give previous current and then we'll
just leave off the index in there a
since we're not using it so you would
think that we could just do something
like this previous age plus current age
and you think that this would go through
all of these elements here and see and
add up all the ages the sum total total
of the ages just like it did for the
integers but if we run this our result
let's do array this is array 17 race 17
dot reduce and this is total age and
save that and let's output this to the
screen okay you can see that the reduced
result is not a number so what's the
deal here what happened well if we look
at this further then you see I have some
comments here whenever we first run
through this total age function it
starts off since we don't have an
initial value the previous value will be
the first down here where we've printed
out the original this previous value
will be an object with named cauri and
age 28 and the current will be an object
with the name John and age
Titu so we're saying previous age plus
current not age so 28 plus 52 that
returns 80 okay so that's what we
expected but then the next time through
the next time it calls total age this
return value gets passed in as previous
so then we get to the point where it
gets to previous age plus current age
but it sees this 80 and this 80 doesn't
have an age property so it doesn't know
what to do and then that's where it kind
of blows up so how can we solve
something like this it's just something
that we need to be aware of so we can do
probably the best way that there's
probably multiple ways to solve this but
probably one of the better ways is just
to pass in an initial value of 0 and
then here instead of previous age we
could just do previous plus current age
and now what happens here whenever you
pass in an initial value let me go ahead
and change what my example is down here
so let me move some of this stuff around
ok so previous will be the initial value
of 0 current is going to be the first
value of our array which is an object
with a named cauri and the age 28 so
then we run previous which is 0 plus
current age which is 28 so 0 plus 28 28
and then this return value gets assigned
to previous on the next call so we have
previous which is 28 plus we're not
looking up the dot age property so it's
previous which is 28 plus current age
which is this object here 52 so this
will return 80 save that and then the
next time through it'll do 80 plus 36
which you can see down here now on in
our HTML it's outputting
116 so that's what we expect when it
adds up all those ages so that's just
something that you have to look out for
it might not be you have to keep in mind
not only what's going to happen the
first time you run through the method
through the method reduced but you have
to keep in mind what it's going to be
looking at every time it runs through
and what previous values you're going to
be or what values you're going to be
assigning to that previous variable so
hopefully that was a good look at reduce
and you understand how that works so now
let's take a look at the map method</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
