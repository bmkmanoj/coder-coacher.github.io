method on an array will return a string
representation of that array so if i
uncomment out my code here then I have
this array that is just a string that
says this and then a number one and then
a string that says time and if I run
array 6.2 string and then I output that
string through the screen then you can
see that it returned this string that
just has Commons and and you can use
this variable throughout your code this
is usually used just for you know maybe
logging out an array to the console or
something like that so that is the to
string method now let's take a look at
the for each method the for each method
will execute a given function for each
element in the array so let me go ahead
and uncomment out these lines here and
you can see that we just have a tests
array which is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and
then I'm outputting that to the screen
here so you can see it a little bit
better so now let's go ahead and write
that callback function that we're going
to use with our for each method so I'm
just going to call this function times
10 and now this callback function has
access to a few different parameters
here
one of those is the element and that is
the current element as it's going
through the for each method this is the
current element in the array and then we
have access to the index which is the
index of that element and then we have
access to the entire array the entire
original array so let's just look at an
example as to what it would look like to
use all of these so I can type in array
which is the original array and then I'm
going to access the in the current index
of that array and then I'm going to set
that
index equal to element times 10 and now
let's go ahead and run this for each
function and then I'll kind of explain a
little bit better
as to what it did so let's do array
seven dot for each and then we'll use
that times ten function and then let me
output that to the screen okay and now
you can see that our original was one
two three four five six seven eight nine
and then after we ran our for each
function now the array is 10 20 30 40 50
60 70 80 90 so what happened here was
that when we ran this for each method
it runs times 10 for every element in
the array so it goes through so say for
example we're looking at our first
element here 1 so this element would
equal 1 the index would be zero and the
array equals the original array so we're
accessing the 0th index of the original
array and setting that equal to the
element which is 1 times 10 so that's
what you get there and then it just goes
to the next spots and then the next
elements to and the index is 1 and with
the current array and then it goes
through the entire array like that and
runs that function for every element in
the array let's take a look at a
slightly more advanced example I'm going
to go ahead and comment out that first
example and then uncomment this code
here okay so we have an array of objects
and all these objects are our three
people with a name and an age you can
see here I've already written out the
function that I'm going to use for this
for the for each method and what this
does is it just outputs each of these
people in the HTML so you can see if we
go in here it will print out person is
equal to the index plus 1 so for the 0th
index that would be 1 and then for the
next is 2 nexus 3 and then
it prints out their name and then it
prints out their age you can also see
here that I'm not using the array
parameter anywhere in here so if you're
not using one of these and the callback
functions you can actually just go ahead
and admit it and it won't have any
effect on the end result so that is the
for each method as you can see it's a
little similar to a for loop but it's a
little bit more elegant and you know you
don't have to worry about things like
out of bounds exceptions and things like
that so let's go ahead and move on to
the reverse method reverse is pretty
self-explanatory if I uncomment out my
code here you can see I have a test
array that is just 0 through 9 and then
I'm outputting this original array to
the screen here and if I want to reverse
this array all I have to do is do that
array and then call the reverse method
save that and then I'll output that to
the screen and you can see that the
reversed version of this array is 9
through 0 and just so you can see what
this looks like on a small array of
strings let me go ahead and comment that
out and uncomment that and you can see
here that this original or array is
reversed this array and then you can see
that array reversed here with the
reverse method so that is the reverse
method for the array next we're going to
take a look at the concatenated the
concatenate
it will concatenate it with other values
or other arrays so for example let me
uncomment out my code here and you can
see here I have two arrays one is equal
to ABC and the other is equal to d EF
and I've outputted both of these to the
HTML here so if I was to take this
variable array and cat and I want to set
this equal to array 9 1 which is my ABC
array and run
and then array 9 - and save that and
then I'll output that to the screen and
you can see here that this can kateri is
equal to both of these arrays
concatenated into one a b c d e f and
what this result would look like in code
is one big array that has taken all
those values and put them into one
single array so you don't only need to
send in arrays as parameters for concat
you can also use some mixed parameters
so you can see for example here I
already have this example typed out this
array can cat - is equal to our ABC
array concatenated with just some random
values thrown in here I have the numbers
one two three and then for my fourth
parameter I put in an array of de and F
and you can see whenever I output this
to the screen it still takes all those
values and concatenates it into one
single array so in JavaScript if you see
here in this comment what this would
look like in JavaScript would be one big
array that just takes all these values
and puts them into one single array like
that so that is the concatenation
a single string and it does that with a
separator that you can specify so if I
uncommon comment out my code here
we can see that I have a sample array
right here that is just 192 168 1 and 1
and if I wanted to join this into a
string then I could set this string 10
equal to a rate 10 dot join
and if I just ran that without any
parameters then you can see that by
default it makes a string with the
default separator as a comma but I can
pass in anything that I want here I
could do if I did a period there then
you can see that now I have 192.168.1.1
let me show you a couple of other
examples using an array of strings I
could join this array together and you
can put in a space to where it looks
more like a sentence or you can put in
dashes or anything that you want the
separator to be now if you have an array
of characters like the third array
example here then what you can do is you
can actually take out everything and
just do two quotes with no spaces in
between and instead of doing the default
separator which is a comma it will just
bunch all those together and whenever it
joins these together into a string you
can see it takes these array of
characters and puts them into a single
string that that reads out with all the
characters joined together so that is
how the join method works now let's take
a look at the slice method</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
