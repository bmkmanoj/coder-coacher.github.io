Python video we are going to learn how
to perform slicing on our lists and our
strings so if you don't know what
slicing is it's a way for us to extract
certain elements from these lists and
strings so for example here I have this
uh my list here that is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 9 now I have a comment underneath here
that has all of the positive indexes so
the index of 0 is equal to the value of
0 so down here where I'm printing out my
list now this is probably a refresher
for a lot of people but if we type in
the index here then it's going to give
us the value at that index so if I run
that then you can see we get the value 0
so if I was to type in the 5th index
here then it should be the value 5 now
what less people know about is that you
can actually use negative indexes also
and I have those listed in this comment
as well so the negative 1 index refers
to the last value in the list which is 9
so if I was to type in my list and got
the negative 1 index and printed that
out you can see that we get the result 9
here and if I was to go to the negative
10 index and print that out then you can
see that we get the value 0 ok so that's
how we access single values in our list
but how do we ask how do we extract a
certain number or a range from this list
well the way that we can do that is
using this syntax that I have in this
comment here so we can do a start value
and an end value separated by a colon
and then there's also the step value and
we'll take a look at that here in a
little bit so for example let's say that
I wanted to get the values from the
index of 0 all the way to the index of 5
so I want 0 through 5 here now the way
that I'm going to do that is I'm going
to type in my start index so I'm going
to start at 0 and then put in my colon
now I'm going to put in my end index now
the thing about the end is that it is
on inclusive so if I was to put a 5 here
and print this out you can see that we
get 0 through 4 because it gets to this
fifth index and then it stops it doesn't
include that so if I wanted to include
that 5 then I would actually go put my
in as the 6 index and then print that
out now you can see that I get 0 through
5 so just as another example here what
if we wanted to get the values 3 through
7 we wanted these values here so we
could start at the index of 3 and we
could go until the end index of 8
because remember this is not inclusive
so if I print that out you can see that
we got 3 3 7 now we can also mix and
match these positive and negative
indexes so if I 1 in 3 through 7 I could
also do negative 7 which you can see
here is the 3 and then I could go to
negative 2 which you can see is the 8
and if I print that out then it's the
exact same thing and I said you could
mix and match these positive and
negative so if I wanted to go 1 through
7 then I could do a positive index of 1
which is the value 1 here and go to
negative 2 which is the 8 which it will
only print to the 7 so if I save that
and print it out then you can see that
we got 1 through 7 now what if we wanted
to print from 1 all the way to the end
of the list here now remember the end is
not inclusive so if I put a 9 in here
that's not going to work because if I go
1 and an end at 9 it doesn't include the
9 value and it only prints out till the
8 so really we can leave off values so
if I left this 9 off and just left this
colon in then it's going to assume that
I want to go to the very end so if I
just do a 1 colon then it will print
from the index of 1 which is the value 1
all the way to the end of the list so if
I print that out now you can see that I
get 1 through 9 so if I made this a 5
colon and then left this empty print
that out then I get 5 through 9 now this
also works with the
beginning index here for the start index
so if I leave that out and I typed in a
negative 1 here then it'll go from 0 to
8 and you can even leave both of these
out and run it and you just get a copy
of the entire list so so far we've only
touched on this start and end index here
we haven't really touched on this step
at all well the step allows us to skip a
certain number of values so for example
here if I wanted to start at the number
2 at the value 2 then I can start at
index 2 and let's say I want to go to 8
so I'll type in negative 1 here because
then it will include the 8 now if I
print that out then we get 2 through 8
now the step will allow us to skip a
certain number of values so if I do a
step of 2 here then it will print out
every second value so if I run that then
you can see that it printed out 2 4 6 8
so what it did here is it started at
index 2 which is this value of 2 here
and it's going to negative 1 which is
the 9 but not inclusive so it's going to
go to the 8th and then it's going to
print out every second value so it
prints out the 2 skips a value print out
the for skips of value 6 and so on now
the default step is just to print out
every value it's a 1 so if I run that
then it's the same as not even
specifying the step at all now the step
is interesting because you can actually
do a negative step also which will run
and reverse now if I was just to make
this a negative 1 right now and printed
this out you can see that it is an empty
array because what it's trying to do
it's trying to go it's trying to print
out 2 through 8 but it has this negative
step so there's just no way that it can
get there like that but if I print out
from negative 1 to 2 and I reverse those
values and then print that out now you
can see that it started at the index of
negative 1 and it's going to the index
of 2 which is 2 and the step is
one so it's going from nine down to
three and remember the end index is not
inclusive even when you're going in
Reverse so now it's going from nine to
three so if I wanted to print from eight
to two in Reverse what I would have to
do is I'd have to start at negative two
which is the eighth and I'd have to go
to the index of one which is this one
here and then a negative one step so if
I run that you can see that we have
negative eight down the tube now we can
make this a negative two which will go
in reverse and every other values now we
have eight six four two and now lastly
if we just wanted the entire list
reversed then we can leave off the start
so that I'll go completely to the
beginning we can leave off the end so
it'll go completely to the end and we
can just negative set this by negative
one so if I run that now you can see
that we have the entire list and reverse
and that's basically all there is to
slicing a list in Python so you can play
around with this and try different
values and see what you get now you can
also slice strings so let's take a look
at a couple of examples here where we
can try to slice certain values out of a
string so I have a sample URL here and
I'm just going to print this URL out to
the screen so now I have a couple of
comments here so first of all let's see
if we can reverse the URL so to reverse
the URL then we did this the same thing
with the list we can just start leave
the start and end completely empty and
then we can step by negative one which
will go in reverse so now if I print
this out you can see that we print out
the sample URL up here and the reverse
of that is here so now let's see if we
can get just the top-level domain from
this URL so the top-level domain here is
this com
so how would we slice that value out of
that string well I think the easiest way
here would be to start from a negative
value so I can start at negative 1 2 3 4
so if I type in
negative for then I'm just going to go
to the end of the string from negative
four so if I print that out you can see
that we got calm now even though we're
starting at negative four our step is
still a positive one by default so we're
starting here and we're just going to
the end of the URL which is the dot-com
okay so now let's say for example that
we want to print the URL without the
beginning HTTP so to do this we can
start at 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so if we start
at index 7 and then just go to the end
of the of the string then it should give
us the URL without the HTTP and the
slashes so if I print that out now you
can see that we just have the URL
without the beginning HTTP and the
slashes and now as a final example here
let's print the URL without the HTTP or
the top-level domain and this kind of is
just a combination of the two that we
just did so we can start at index 7 and
we can go till index negative 4 and that
it will be non inclusive so if we print
that out you can see that it doesn't
include that dot so now we only have the
URL and it doesn't have the dot-com or
the HTTP at the beginning so that about
does it for this video I hope after
looking at all of these different
examples you're now comfortable with all
the different ways that you can perform
slicing and Python if you do have any
