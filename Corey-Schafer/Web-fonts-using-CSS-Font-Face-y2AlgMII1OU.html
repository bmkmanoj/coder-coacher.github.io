to show you how to use custom web fonts
on your website using the font scroll
calm web font generator here I have a
test website set up on my local server
if we look at the folder for this
website just has an index.html file and
a CSS folder here inside the CSS folder
we have a style about CSS file if we
look at this file it just has a body
element with a font family set to for
Donna so the top one over to fonts
broadcom and as you can see they have a
lot of different fonts to choose from
let's just choose the top one here the
source and spring and when you find a
font that you like be sure that you
check the license to make sure that
you're allowed to use this font on your
website here we see that this font has
the open font license so it's okay for
us to use let's go ahead and download
this ODF file
and once that OTF file downloads let's
go ahead and extract it
okay so when we downloaded the source
sans Pro it gave us all these different
fonts it gave us the bold the italic the
ligh for this tool tutorial we're just
going to use the source sans program
Euler ATF file so let's hop one back
over to font squirrel and let's go to
the web font generator
now what this web font generator does is
it takes that one OTF file and it
generates everything that we're going to
need in order to use that font on our
website so let's go ahead and go to add
fonts and we're gonna choose source sans
Pro regular OTF and before we can
download our kit we have to agree that
we've read over the licensing and that
we know that we're allowed to use this
font on our website so go ahead and
agree to that and once you do that then
you have the option to download your kit
now once your font kit is downloaded go
to your downloads folder and let's
extract that zip file okay now we can
see all the files that that font
generator created you can see we have an
e OT file here svgt TF what these are
are their different font files that are
going to be used in different browsers
for compatibility what we're going to
want to do is copy all the files that
that font Jenner created and we are
going to paste these into our own
website specifically in the CSS
directory where our own CSS file lives
okay now if you look at the style sheets
CSS that the font generator created if
we open that up
we can see that it created the font face
rule that we want to use in our own CSS
file and this font face rule already has
everything we need it has all the URLs
to those font files so let's go ahead
and copy this code and then let's open
up our own CSS file and let's paste that
at the top okay now if you look at this
top line here this font family line this
is the name that we're assigning to this
font so if I copy this I can use this
font now anywhere in my CSS file to
assign that font to any of these
elements so if I use that here at the
body element now the body will use the
source sans profile that we downloaded
so let's go ahead and save that CSS file
go back to our browser and see if
everything worked so now let's go ahead
and reload that okay so the new font
worked the custom font work that we
thought we wanted so that's one way to
do custom fonts for your website there's
a lot of different places to find these
fonts font squirrel's one of them you
can also go over here to google fonts
and you can download the fonts from
there and then run them through the web
font generator as well and go through
the exact same process hopefully this
tutorial was useful to you guys and I
appreciate you guys watching Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
