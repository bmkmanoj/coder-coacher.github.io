this video we're just going to go over a
quick to showing how you can hide secret
information and environment variables
and then access that information from
your Python code now a common problem
that I see from people who are just
getting started out is that they'll put
information directly in their code that
actually shouldn't be there so for
example if you're working with databases
or are accessing an API and have a
secret key then they'll have their
passwords or secret keys directly in the
Python script now the problem with that
is that if you're working with a team of
people or pushing your code to a
repository of some kind then anyone who
can see the code will also have access
to that secret information but if you
have that information saved and
environment variables then you'll still
be able to share your code but with your
secret information saved on your local
machine so let's see how we can do this
so I have a script open here with some
fake credentials and we can see that we
have a database username and password
hard-coded into our script and this
could also be in a secret API key or any
information that you don't want to share
with everyone else who has access to the
code so let's move these two environment
variables now setting environment
variables is done differently on Linux
and Windows machines and in this
tutorial we'll be covering how to do
this on Mac and Linux but if you're on a
Windows machine then I'll have a
separate video on how to do this on
Windows as well and I'll leave a link to
that video in the description section
below if anyone needs that but if you're
on Mac or Linux then we can set these
environment variables by modifying a
file called dot Bash underscore profile
so first let's open up our terminal and
then we need to navigate to our home
directory
now I'm already in my home directory but
if you need to navigate there then you
can do that just by typing CD and
pressing enter and now we need to open
our dot file where we can set
environment variables and I'll just open
mine and Nano since that's an easy
editor for everyone but you can also do
this in whatever editor you'd like so
I'll say Nano and that file was dot bash
underscore profile now I might have some
more information in here than you see in
your file but don't worry about that so
at the top of this file we can go ahead
and add our environment variable now to
do this we can just say export and then
the name of our variable so we'll do an
all uppercase DB user and then an equal
sign with some quotes and we don't
any spaces between the equal sign and
the value and now let's go back to our
script and grab this value so I can copy
and paste it in and now let's do the
same thing with the password so we'll
say DB pass is equal to go back here and
grab this from our file grab the whole
thing copy that and paste that in and
once we have those variables set then we
can save this in Nano by pressing
control X and then a yes to save and
then enter to keep the same filename and
now we can quit out of our terminal and
now to actually see those changes we're
also going to need to restart sublime
text so I will shut that down and then
open that back up to the same file and
now let's access those variables that we
just set now to do that we need to
import the OS module and then with the
OS module we can say OS dot and vine and
this is a dictionary so we can access
the key that we want by doing a dot git
and then passing in what we want so we
wanted the DB user environment variable
and now let's also paste this in for the
password so that was DB underscore pass
so now let's save this and run it and
now we can see that we get the values
that we'd set in our environment
variables without them actually being
hard-coded into our script so that's
going to be a lot better for us since we
no longer have to worry about our
passwords or secret information being
added to our source code okay so I think
that's going to do it for this video
like I said this was just a quick short
tip video about a common problem that I
see amongst people who are just getting
started out and if you've run into this
before then hopefully you found this
useful but if you do have any questions
about what we covered then feel free to
ask in the comment section below and
I'll be sure to answer those and also if
you enjoy these tutorials and would like
to support them then there are several
ways you can do that these are sways to
simply like the video and give it a
thumbs up and also it's a huge help to
share these videos with anyone who you
think would find them useful and if you
have the means you can contribute
through patreon and there's a link to
