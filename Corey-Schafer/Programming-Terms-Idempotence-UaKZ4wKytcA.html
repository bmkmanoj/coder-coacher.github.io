going to be another video on programming
terms and in this video we're going to
look at the term idempotence so
idempotence is actually a pretty easy
concept to grasp
once you see it in action but some of
the definitions can be a little
confusing if you look at Wikipedia the
definition for idempotence it says the
property of certain operations in
mathematics and computer science that
can be applied multiple times without
changing the result beyond the initial
application so if you're still a little
confused by that then you will usually
see this example here they'll say now
what this example is saying is that if
you have a function f and parameters X
the result from f of X if you pass that
into the function f again then that
should equal the result of just f of X
being run one time now if that's still a
little bit unclear to you
I think it'll clear it up once we see an
example of this in some working code now
the code that I have here is Python code
but you know you can use any language
for this it's it's language agnostic
it's it's the same definition for any
language that you use but just to show
you what this is I'm using Python code
here so I have a function here called
add 10 and I have a parameter that I'm
passing in to add pin that is num and if
we compare this to our f of X from the
last slide
imagine that add 10 is our F and num is
our X so now if you look down here you
can see that I am printing out add 10
and I'm just going to go ahead and pass
in 10 to that function so if I run this
then you can see down here that my
result is 20 now if we remember back to
the definition of something that is
idempotent it means that if we pass this
result into the function again and we
should get the same result that we got
the first time so if I take this
function
and I wrap it around our result here and
I run it again you can see that now we
get 30 so by definition this is not
idempotent because whenever we have F of
10 and we wrap that inside of F again
that result we get is 30 and whenever we
just do F of 10 that result is 20 so you
can see if we map this to the definition
here then this by definition is not item
potent so let's look at an example of
something that is idempotent so I have
here let me comment this one out so
there's a built in function in Python
abs it just gives you the absolute value
of a number so if I run this the
absolute value of negative 10 is 10 but
now if I take the absolute value of the
absolute value and run it again it's 10
so I can keep doing this over and over
and every time I pass in the result back
into absolute the absolute value again
no matter how many times you pass that
value in it's still going to give you 10
every time and that's what item Potence
means
so hopefully that kind of clears that up
and it doesn't have to be a function
either I mean you can have a line in
your code that is a equals 10 or
something like that just an assignment
and this is a line of code so it can be
executed and no matter how many times
you execute it in a row equals 10 equals
10 equals 10 run it over and over over
every time it's going to do the exact
same thing so that's an idempotent
statement also
so really the simple definition of
idempotence is that whenever you do
something over and over and over and
over and over and you do the same thing
that you get the same result back every
time and that you're not building on top
of that result now where you usually see
this is in HTTP methods so a lot of
these are considered idempotent so a get
HTTP method is considered item potent so
because if you go to a URL and you're
just getting the URL for this you
sir no matter how many times you reload
this page and reload this page it's
going to give you the same result every
time it's not changing anything
now put is considered idempotent also
because put is usually used for updating
values so say you update the same
parameter to the same value every time
and say you want to set you know a user
equal to Cori and then you submit that
if you submit the update to set user
equals to user equals Cori again and
again and again every time it's just
going to set that user equal to Cori and
it's not changing the value so that's
considered an item button as well now
the method that's not considered item
potent is post so post is used for
changing data in the background so say
for example you have a website with a
voting system and every time you go to a
certain URL it casts a vote so every
time you go to that URL and it casts a
vote at Casa vote and cast a vote that's
not idempotent because every time you go
to it you're getting a different result
back it's either going to vote up or
down based on the URL that you're going
to so every time you get back a
different different result so by
definition post is not idempotent now
lastly elite is considered idempotent so
this one's a little bit confusing to
some people because you would think that
if you deleted a user and then you tried
to deleted that user again maybe you'll
get a 404 because that user no longer
exists but you have to think about the
the state of your server and the effect
that it's having so say you delete user
one two three here whenever you try to
read elite and read elite and read elite
it's already deleted that user so you
can run that multiple multiple times
again and again and again and it's not
changing anything additionally on your
server so the state of your server is
still the same no matter how many times
you call in a row so after the one time
you call it every time after that gives
the same result so it is considered
idempotent
so I hope that makes that more clear
just remember whenever you run a
function or do an operation after the
first time the value can change on the
first time like for example absolute
value of 10 it changes from negative 10
to 10 but if you keep passing it in and
keep passing in and pass your result in
over and over and over
if you always get the same result that's
considered idempotent so anytime you
hear somebody mentioned item potent
source umthe enlike that you'll know
what your what they are talking about so
hopefully this video is useful for you
