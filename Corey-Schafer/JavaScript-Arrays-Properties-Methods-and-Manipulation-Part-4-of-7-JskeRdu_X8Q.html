work exactly like we'd expect it to if I
uncomment out this code here you can see
I have an array of numbers here that are
all jumbled up and if I just run the
sort method on this 313 sort and then I
output this to the screen and you can
see that this sorted array isn't exactly
what we were expecting and instead of 1
2 3 4 10 20 30 40 we're getting 110 to
2330 the reason that does this is
because by default the sort method uses
the Unicode values to sort by and this
is how these values are sorted in
Unicode if we want to sort these values
and then the other way and we need to
manually tell JavaScript how they should
be sorted and the way that we do that is
with a compare function so what a
compare function is let me go ahead and
write one of these out and that would be
the best way to explain it so function
and I'm just going to call this sort
numbs and a compare function takes in
two values I'm just gonna have this take
in a and B two parameters so you can see
I have commented down here if we return
a value that is greater than zero then
we're telling JavaScript to that the way
this array should be sorted is that the
B should come before the a if it returns
a zero we're saying that these values
are equal and that it doesn't matter
about the sort order so it'll be
unchanged if we return a value that is
less than zero then we're saying that a
should come before B so say that we are
passing in numbers to this sort to this
compare function so let's just pick two
random numbers here let's say a is 10
and let's say B is 20 and so we want
this function if it runs into these two
parameters to return a number that is
less than zero
because we want a to come before B
because 10 is less than 20 so how could
we do that well if we did 10 minus 20
that equals negative 10 that is a number
that is less than zero so we're telling
JavaScript the a should come before B so
in this case if we wanted to sort in
ascending order that would be correct
because a is less than B if a was 30 and
this would be 30 minus 20 and then that
would return 10 and that's also what we
want because now a is greater than B
this returns a number that is greater
than zero so we're saying that B needs
to come before a so we're saying 20
needs to come before 30 and if a was 30
and B was 30 that would be 30 minus 30
equals zero and that returns zero and
it's just saying that these values are
equal and that the sort order doesn't
matter so to sort this an ascending
order we could just do a return a minus
B and then if I ask this compare
function into the sort method then now
you can see down here that our array is
sorted the way that we think it should
be 1 2 3 4 10 20 30 40 and now the great
thing about these compare functions is
that you can customize them any way you
want if you want this to be sorted by
descending order then we can just do B
minus a and now it's sorted by
descending order 40 30 20 10 4 3 2 1 so
that's a brief look at sorting numbers
now let's take a look at sorting some
strings here so let me take away that
compare function so we are just using
the default sort method to sort these
strings so I have Jack Jill Cory Pete
and Ann and you can see that the using
sort by default
kind of looks like it works here but
then if we take a look at the end it
didn't actually do exactly what we
wanted because an is lowercase and like
I said before this sorts by the unicode
values and an Unicode these uppercase
characters are larger than the lowercase
characters so if we wanted this to be
case insensitive then we have to write
our own compare function for that so
let's go ahead and write a quick compare
function and see how we would do this so
I'm going to I'm going to call this one
sort alpha and I'm also going to pass in
a B usually for compare functions those
will be the parameter something like
that a B so what we can do here is now
we want to sort these by the lowercase
version of these strings we want it to
be case insensitive so what we can do is
we can make a variable inside our
function and just call it a lower equals
a dot two lower case and then we can
either make another variable called be
lower equals B dot two lower case and
then we can just compare these strings
so we can say if a lower is less than B
lower then we can return negative one
because remember if we want a to be
before B and it needs to be a number
that is less than zero so we're gonna
return negative one for that so let me
go ahead and copy this and paste it in
if a lower is greater than B lower and
we want to turn positive one and if it's
neither of those which in this case it
would mean that it's equal then we would
just return zero okay and now let's go
ahead and ask this compare function into
our sort method and whenever we save
that and look at the sort of values now
now then you can see that this sorts the
way that we want it to be sorted it's
case insensitive so we have
and Cory Jack Jill and Pete okay so that
was a quick look at sorting some strings
now let's take a look at sorting some
objects so I have a sample object here
so let me uncomment this and let me go
ahead and uncomment out the code that
will display this to the HTML okay so
what this object is is it's an object of
names and each object has a first
property and a last property for first
name and last name so now let's say that
we want to sort this first by first name
and then by last name so if we look at
the comments here you can see my
original array the way that it's
displaying now is Joe Smith and Smith
Tom Doe and Ando and then in this
comment here we have the desired sorting
would be endo and Smith Joe Smith and
Tom Doe so we're sorting on the first
name first and if the first names are
the same then we want to sort on the
last name so endo would come before and
Smith so we know we're going to need a
custom compare function to do this so
let's write one called sort names and
we're just going to use the same a and B
parameters and then let's go ahead and
try to reuse some of the code that we
used before so let's take this sort
alpha function that we wrote earlier and
let's paste that into our sort names so
then let's take this function and let's
go ahead and try to sort this and see
what happens
so whenever I save that it's not
displaying anything so there is most
likely an error in here now what's going
on is that we need to realize that now
we're trying to sort objects
now we're trying to sort objects instead
of just strings themselves so whenever
we say a dot lowercase here it doesn't
know what it is that we're trying to
access so these are the same objects
that it is that we're trying to sort so
they have the same properties so a lower
instead of a dot lowercase really needs
to be that a object and then the first
property and then two lowercase and then
B dot first not two were lowercase and
if I save that then you can see here
that it is now sorted on the first name
so now we have an Smith and OH
Joe Smith and Tom though but you can see
here it's sorted on the first name and
the last names are still out of order so
we have an Smith and we have and O so
how can we do this to where it sorts on
the first name first and if those are
equal then it'll sort on the last name
so all we have to do here is we're going
to be sorting on multiple parameters so
let's put in an if statement here and
just say if now these are the first
names here I should probably rename
these but I'm just going to leave them
the way that they are so if these first
names are equal then now we want to sort
on the last name so now we can take the
same logic that we use for the first
names copy that and we can paste it up
here into this if statement and now we
want to sort on the last name so let's
go ahead and to lowercase those also
so let's paste those in and instead of a
lower I'm going to call this a last and
instead of B lower
I'm going to call this B last and now
instead of the first names we want to
grab the last property and let's copy
that so now remember a lower and B lower
are the first names when those are equal
then we want to come in here
and sort both of these based on last
name so if the last name if the a last
name is less than the B last name return
negative one and if it is greater than
the B last name return one and if it's
the same just return zero so let's go
ahead and save that and then you can
look down here and see that our array of
names is sorted exactly how we want it
to be sorted so it's sorted by first
name and then it's sorted by last name
okay so that is a quick look at sort and
a few different examples of that now
let's go ahead and take a look at the
filter method</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
