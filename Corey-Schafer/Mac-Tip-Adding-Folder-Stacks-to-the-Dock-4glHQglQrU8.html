a quick video here and show you how to
add folder stacks to your dock so if you
have a lot of applications here that are
cluttering up your dock it's nice to
organize them all into one place
using these folder stacks now the way
that you do this is that you group all
of your applications into a single
folder and then you just drag drag it
down to the dock but there's one little
caveat here is that there's been some
people online who have said that
whenever they move any applications out
of their Applications folder or group
them into a folder then sometimes it
messes with the updates of the
application or some websites won't
recognize that the application is
already installed so you really don't
want to move applications out of your
Applications folder if that's the
default place where it expects it to be
instead what I like to do is within my
home directory I have this folder here
called dock stacks and so for example if
I made a new folder here and just called
this text editors then if I go back to
my applications instead of moving the
actual application itself so say for
example within this folder I wanted atom
brackets and let's do the new sublime
text instead of moving these out of the
Applications folder let's create an
alias and the way that you can do an A
List you can either right-click and
create an alias that way or you can hit
command option and then drag and it will
automatically create the alias so you
can see here these little arrows at the
bottom left we know that they are an
alias of the file and not the file
itself and we can see over here in the
applications that our files are still
there so if we go back then we can now
drag this text editors folder down into
our dock
and we'll just put it right there and
now you can see that we have this folder
stack here on our dock so if I close
these down now I'm able to take these
applications and just remove them from
my dock and now it saves a lot of space
because now I have them here in one
place instead of cluttering up my dock
so I hope this quick tip was useful for
you guys if you have any questions feel
free to ask in the comments be sure to
subscribe for future tips and tutorials
and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
