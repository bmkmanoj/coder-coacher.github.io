array so if I was to uncomment out this
code here then we can see that I have a
test array that is just 0 through 9 and
if I wanted to return a portion of this
array then I can use the slice method so
to do that I will do array 11 not slice
and now this takes two parameters it
takes a beginning index and an ending
index the beginning index is inclusive
in the slice and the ending index is not
inclusive so what I mean by that is if I
was to put a two here
and then print this out to the HTML then
you can see here that this sliced array
is 2 through 9 so it takes the index 2
which is 0 1 2 so starting here at this
2 and then goes all the way to the end
if you don't put in and ending index
then it assumes that you want the entire
length of the array so let me do one
with a beginning and an end index so if
I was to do 2 and 5 then you can see it
only prints out 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 because the 5 is
non-inclusive so when the slice is
performed on this array it goes to index
0 1 2 starts here and then goes to the
5th but doesn't include the 5th so then
it just prints out these three right
here 2 3 &amp;amp; 4
now what if you wanted to do something
like you only wanted the last 3 elements
of this array then what you can do here
is let me comment that out and rerun
another slice now you could do something
like you want to start at array dot
length minus 3 and let's see what that
are so
- three and let's see what that gives us
so that gives us the last three elements
of the array but you actually don't have
to write in this array dot length here
if you write a negative index then it
will be the third index from the array
dot length so you can see now that I
only have the negative three here it
still gives me still gives me the the
same result and for the ending index you
can do the same thing if I was to do
negative two then it will only print out
the seven because it goes it starts at
three from the end and then goes to
negative two but it's non-inclusive with
the ending index so you only get the
seven this was a negative one then it
would include that eight as you can see
right there so that is the slice method
and now we will move down to the splice
method okay now the splice method can be
a little tricky at first it is a way to
alter an array by adding or the leading
elements so let's go ahead and take a
look at this so I have an array here
with five different names and now I'm
outputting this original to the screen
so that you can see and I haven't done
anything to it yet so it still stays as
the original down here so now I have
this VAR deleted here and the reason I
have that is because anytime a splice
performs a deletion it will add those
elements it'll return those elements so
if you set a VAR a variable equal to the
splice then you can see what elements
were deleted if you'd like so let me go
ahead and show you an example here so I
can do array twelve dot splice and the
first parameter here is where I
myarray I want to begin my insertions or
deletions so if I want to delete an
element let's say I wanted to start at
index 2 which would be 0 1 2 that would
be here at Jill and my second parameter
here is how many elements I want to
delete so let's just delete 1 and let me
save that and now if you look down here
you can see that my original was the
five names and now after it's spliced it
is taken out Jill and now I only have
these four names and then you can see
down here that deleted was Jill and that
is I am echoing out this deleted
variable to the screen so you can see
that it deleted that name and then
returned that to this variable so if I
was to do two deletions and save that
then you can see here that it started at
index 2 which is Jill and deleted two of
the elements from the array which would
be Jill and John and you can see that's
exactly what we got here we got the
splice array with only three names now
and deleted returned Jill and John so
now let's take a look at adding some
elements to an array with splice so this
is very similar to how we did this
before so I'm going to run splice again
and I'm gonna keep this at starting at
the second index and this time I'm not
going to delete any element so I'm just
gonna put a 0 for how many elements I
want to delete and then now my third
parameter is the elements that I want to
add to the array so I'm just going to
put in a string here and add in Joey to
this array and you can see down here I
have my original array and then my
spliced version has Joey at index 2
because I didn't override or delete any
elements and you can see that deleted
down here when it's echoed out to the
HTML it doesn't have any variables
associated with
because we didn't elite anything from
the array now you don't only have to add
in single values here you can see I have
a sample array here if I was to copy
that and instead of just one name if I
put in an array of names and save that
then you can see at starting at index 2
of this array it added in those three
names that we gave in this array here as
the parameter
so now let's we've looked at the leading
and adding elements so now let's look at
overriding elements and this is pretty
similar to adding elements except
instead of only adding elements we're
also going to put in some elements to
the leap so I can do ray dot splice and
we'll just stick with that starting
index of two and before when I added
elements I put in 0 as the number of
elements to delete but now if you put in
say I just put in a 1 here then you can
see that I started at index 2 which is
Jill and I over wrote 1 position with
this value of Joey so it deleted Jill
and it put in Joey and you can see now
that my deleted variable here gets
echoed out as Jill and if I was to take
this same array the same test array here
that I added in before and add that in
and let's start at index 0 and let's
overwrite 3 positions and save that and
now you can see we started with an array
of 5 names and these first three names
have been overwritten with the three
names that we put in to our splice
function and then you can see our
deleted variable this deleted variable
here gets the return deleted objects
that splice returned for us so
that is how the splice method works so
now we are going to move down and take a
look at the sort method</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
