this video I'd like to walk through how
to set up a Python development
environment in Adam now Adam is a text
editor that is becoming a popular
alternative to editors like sublime text
now I've done a video on how to set up a
Python development environment in
sublime text but a lot of people are
starting to give Adam a try so I wanted
to put together a video on this as well
so that people can get their Python
environment set up easily now there are
some good reasons that Adam is becoming
popular so first of all it is completely
free
now sublime text is free to evaluate for
an unlimited amount of time but you'll
get pop-ups asking you to purchase the
full version every now and then so Adam
being completely free is definitely
appealing to most people and also Adam
has a lot of support it was developed by
the people at github and it comes
installed with a package manager and
makes it easy to install packages right
out of the box now so blind text has
improved that in process and some of its
later updates but there's still an
initial step there that needs to take
place before you can begin installing
packages and Adam doesn't have that
problem and we'll see some other
differences as we walk through this
setup process now if you never use
sublime text before then you can just
ignore the comparison it's got to make
throughout this video the only reason I
bring those differences up is because
these editors are very similar and they
share a lot of the same user base and
those people might find it useful to
have those differences pointed out ok so
let's go ahead and get started so I have
the Adam download page pulled up here
now I'm on my Mac so it defaults to the
Mac download but you should have a
download link for your operating system
here so I'm going to go ahead and
download that and I'm going to go ahead
and skip to where this is finished
downloading and once that's finished
downloading then we can unzip that and
on a Mac we just have to drag this app
to our Applications folder if you're on
another operating system then you might
have to go through a quick installation
ok so now let's open up our fresh
installation of Adam and now I'm just
going to go ahead and maximize this ok
so when we first open Adam it's going to
pop up with some welcome information
here so on the right we have this
welcome to guide with some documentation
to keyboard shortcuts and things like
that I'm going to go ahead and just
close that down and close this link
now on this welcome screen here I'm
going to uncheck this show welcome guide
when opening Adam and now I'm going to
close that
now this telemetry consent I'm just
going to click no here for now but you
can do whatever you want here it's just
to help them improve Adam you can
anonymously send information and stats
and things like that just so we have
something to work with I have a test
Python module here then I'm just going
to go ahead and dump in to Adam go ahead
and open that up now this is a sample
class that I use from my object-oriented
series if you don't understand what the
code is doing then you don't have to
worry about it I just wanted something
that we could work with and also
something with classes and functions so
that we can see the differences between
the different color schemes and I'm
going to make this font a little bigger
here so that we can see everything now
if you watch my sublime text walk
through and at this point we were
actually able to go ahead and run our
Python code now in Adam we can't quite
do this yet we have to first install a
package so that we can run these scripts
so let's install that first package so
that we can add this functionality so to
install package let's open up our
Preferences page and on a Mac that is
under Adam and preferences now on
Windows I think that might be under file
preferences now the Adam preferences and
settings have this nice layout we don't
have to use japes on configuration files
or anything like that so it's a nice
little interface that's pretty intuitive
so to install our package we can just
click on install down here at the bottom
now the package that we want to search
for is called script and if we search
for that and we can see that the top
result is what we are looking for now
there's also a nice feature here that
shows the total number of downloads
which gives you a good idea of how
popular a package is so just click on
install to install that package and once
that package is finished installing then
you can click on these settings to view
the settings for that package now within
these settings this is where we can
configure our packages how we like but
this is also where we can view the
readme files and get suggestions for how
to properly use the package now if we
scroll down to the bottom here then we
to see a section on keyboard shortcuts
so now with this package installed we
should be able to run our Python scripts
within Adam the keyboard shortcuts here
are for each operating system so I can
see to run this on the Mac its command I
and on Linux and windows it's shift
control B so I'm going to move over here
to this test module and run this with
the Mac command keyboard shortcut now
the output that we got here for this
script is a little small you might not
be able to read this but basically when
we printed out our executable path I got
the default path to the Python on my
machine and that version is Python 3.5
and then it also ran the other
information here within this script as
well now that default path on your
machine may be may be different than the
default path on my machine now if you
want to run at different versions of
Python or run Python from a virtual
environment here in Adam then there's
something different that we need to set
up and I'll show you how to do that
later in this video but for now let's go
ahead and install the rest of the
packages and get this customized a bit
so first of all let's go ahead and
install a different color scheme now the
color scheme I like to use is the same
one that I like to use in sublime text
and it is called pre-dawn so to install
this I'm going to go back here to the
preferences and I'm going to click on
install and instead of packages over
here I'm instead going to click on
themes to search for themes and now that
we're searching for themes I'm going to
search for pre-dawn now this part is a
little different than sublime text and
sublime and we installed the entire
theme but in Adam these are broken up
between UIs and the syntax I actually
like the default UI that comes with Adam
so I'm just going to install the syntax
coloring so over here I'm going to click
install on the pre Don syntax so now
that's installed but it's not activated
yet so to activate this then we can
click up here on themes and under the
syntax theme then now we have this
pre-dawn option so I'm going to go ahead
and select that and now if we go back to
our test module then we can see that the
look of this has been
stated and this is just a personal
preference I'd recommend you try
different themes and color schemes to
see what you like but if you watched
many of my videos and you'll probably
notice that this is the one that I
personally use so now that we have our
color scheme in place now let me show
you a few of the default settings that I
personally like to change so within our
settings here now let's go up here to
editor and within editor we can choose
our font family so the font that I use
is source code Pro and that is a font
that is available for free on Google
font and I'll leave a link to that in
the description section below now the
font size I usually like to have set to
20 and I know that that's large but
that's just because I do these videos
and want everyone to be able to see
you'll likely choose something much
smaller there now if we scroll down here
a bit
now there's one setting that I like here
called scroll past the end now if I go
to my test module without that selected
now you can see when I scroll down to
the bottom then I can't scroll anymore
once we hit the end of the file and that
kind of annoys me so I like to set that
skull press scroll pass in option and
now when I go back to my module then you
can see that we can scroll past the end
of this file and also whenever I am
programming in Python I like to have my
tab length set to four spaces and by
default in Adam that is set to two so
I'm going to go ahead and change that
okay and that does it for the editor
settings now one other thing I like to
disable an Adam is the default Auto
completing so for example if I go to my
test module down here at the bottom and
I was to type in you know employee two
equals e then you see that it's popping
up this near these autocompletes as I'm
typing and a lot of the times I don't
find these pop ups that useful
so I'd personally rather just disable
them and now to do this we can go back
to our settings and then we need to
select our packages now you can see here
are some core packages that came
installed with Adam and if I scroll down
here now you can see a short description
of what each of these do
now the one that I want to disable is
this autocomplete plus and also
autocomplete snippet so I'll disable
both of those now if I go back to my
test module then you can see it's no
longer trying to autocomplete those now
if you are someone who likes that Auto
completing capability then the
suggestions for Python code are much
more Python friendly if you install the
autocomplete Python package so let's go
over to our settings and let's click on
install and now we want to select
packages over here instead of themes now
I'm going to search for auto complete
Python now I don't personally use this
but I'll just go ahead and install this
really quick just to show you how this
looks now when this finishes installing
it's going to ask if you want to use
kite or a local engine now kite is
something that goes out onto the
Internet and finds documentation and
things like that now I think it sounds
really interesting but some of the
things that I work on it my full-time
job aren't allowed to be sent over the
cloud so I usually choose to use the
local engine instead but if you think
that clout or that type sounds
interesting then you're more than
welcome to give that a try ok so once
we've selected that local engine now if
we're back here on our test module now
if I type in you can see that it's
trying to autocomplete
as I type and these are more Python
specific so if I come back and just type
in you know this e then I'm assuming
that these bees mean built-in I'm not
entirely sure but you can see that we
have some more Python specific
auto-completion there so that is a
popular Python package but like I said I
don't personally like the autocomplete
pop-ups so I'm going to go over here and
just disable the auto complete package
that I just installed
ok so let's install a few more packages
that I like to use within atom so some
of these aren't specifically Python
related but I like the functionality
that they add so if I click on install
here we're already at this installation
page make sure that we're on packages
now one package that I like a lot is
file icons now before I install this if
you look here at our Python file in this
tree view over here it's just a simple
file icon and this package will make
those look a little better and it also
is a little bit more descriptive of what
the file actually is so you can see that
the top result here has over two million
downloads so it's a pretty popular
download so let's go ahead and install
that and once that's installed now if we
look over here to our Python file now we
can see that the icon is now a nice
colored Python icon right beside the
file name and if you work on a large
project with a lot of different file
types and I think this package not only
makes that tree look better but also
helps you find files more quickly ok so
another package that I like to install
is one called mini matte so let's go
ahead and search for that and this top
one is the one that we want here so
let's go ahead and install that ok so
once that's finished downloading if we
switch over here to our module then
we'll see now that in to the far right
over here we have this general overview
of what the file looks like and also
where we are in this file now this isn't
so useful with such a small sample
module but if we had thousands of lines
of code then this gives you a better
idea of where you are in those scripts
ok now let's add a package that's more
focused on Python programming so this
package is called python auto pep 8 so
let's go ahead and search for that
it is python auto f8 now I like this
package because it keeps everything nice
and consistent so let's go ahead and
install this and we'll take a look at
what it does now there are a few other
pet bait packages that have more
downloads than this one but I found this
one to be the easiest to set up and use
so now let's go ahead and go into the
settings of this package that we just
installed so within the settings here if
we scroll down to the bottom then we'll
see a very short readme file and it says
to make sure that we have
auto pep eight installed by using the
pip install Auto pep eight command so
I'm going to go ahead and copy this and
if you don't have that Auto pet bait
installed then we may need to install
this from the command line using hip so
actually I just installed that or copied
that but I'm just going to type it out
so pip install Auto pep eight now if
you've never used pit before it's very
simple to use I do have a separate video
on how to use pip if you need a
walkthrough but for now I'm just going
to go ahead and do that tip install okay
so now that is installed now let's go
back to the module and see if that takes
effect so let's make some changes here
and add some extra spaces that aren't
really Pepe compliant and when I save
this it should Auto format okay so I
saved it and it didn't auto format I
think sometimes whenever we install
different packages we might need to
restart atom for those changes to take
effect so I'm going to go ahead and quit
out of atom and then open that back up
okay so now let's see if I make a change
and save it okay so that still didn't
work let's open up the settings here
okay so there is a check here for format
unsafe so I forgot to check that so that
was probably the problem so now let's go
back to the module again now with that
format on saved checked now if we save
this okay so now after I save that it
you know Auto formatted so let me do
that again and save it and you can see
that everything jumps back up I have the
proper pet bait spacing now having that
Auto formatting on save is especially
nice when working with a team because
you don't want a lot of the get
differences to be differences in line
spacing and things like that
so using this helps a lot in those
scenarios okay so the last package that
we're going to install here is a linter
that will point out any of our mistakes
so I'm going to go back over here to the
settings and install packages and the
lentor that I like is a package called
linter flake 8 so it's search for that
okay so this is the package that we're
looking for here at the top so I'm going
to go ahead and install that and it also
has to install a dependency and called
winter so it installed that when we
installed the flake 8 winter okay so
just like our Auto pep 8 package let's
open these settings and let's scroll
down here to the readme file and we can
see that it has installation
instructions as well and just like with
the auto pep 8 we need to pip install
this flake 8 if we don't have it
installed already so I'm going to pull
up my terminal and just like I did with
the auto Pepe I'm going to do a pip
install and that is flake 8 ok so now
without restarting atom here let's open
up our python module and let's type in
some errors that our Lennard catch so
down here at the bottom let's make a for
loop here and let's accidentally so I'll
say for num in and I'll just make a list
of 1 2 3 4 and I'm going to accidentally
leave off the colon here at the end of
this for loop and within this for loop
I'll do a print and instead of printing
num I'm just going to print in so now if
we save this now we have two errors here
one says a syntax error at line 26 this
is unexpected indentation so now we can
actually click on these lines here where
it's showing the air and after looking
at this line that's telling us where the
syntax is bad we look at this for a
little bit and we'll probably realize
that the colon is missing here so let's
put that code in and save that and now
after I save that we can see that we
have a mark here that says unidentified
name in at line 27 so once it points out
out to us then we know that that should
be num instead of in on also looks like
it gave us that syntax error - because I
forgot to remove that line from earlier
when I was showing the autocomplete ok
and after we remove all those errors
than all of those linter
warnings go away and it's nice having
something like that watching in the
background because we all make dumb
mistakes like that and it's nice to have
something that points those out okay so
that was the last package that I wanted
to show you but one thing that I
mentioned before was that I'd like to go
over how to run different versions of
Python or how to point to a virtual
environment so if you watched my sublime
text installation video and this is
basically the equivalent of their build
systems so that very first package that
we installed to run our Python code that
was called script if we want to run our
Python code using that then like I said
before we can hit command-i to run that
but we can also hit command shift P to
bring up our command palette and then we
can type in script which is the name of
that package now you can see here that
this gives us the option to run that's
what we've already seen before and then
the keyboard shortcut over here is
command I but there's also some
additional options here and we can see
here that one of these is run options so
I'm going to go ahead and click on that
and then it pops up these different
options that we can use when running the
script now the one that I want to change
here is this command so this command
here we can plug in the path to
whichever Python that we want to use so
for example I know that my path to
Python 2 7 is in user bin Python 2 7 so
let's say that I wanted to run our
script with this Python 2 7 version so
we can either just run that or we can
save this as a profile now we're going
to want to save this as a profile
because it's something that we're going
to want to use over and over without
having to type in that path every time
so I'm going to save that as a profile
and I'm just going to call that Python 2
7 and now that python 2 7 pops up and I
can run the script with that and now if
we look at our output down here now
sorry again that this text is small but
I'm not sure if there's a way that I can
enlarge this or not but I'll go ahead
and just read to you what it popped out
here but when we print our Cystic you
table
turning out the path to that Python to
seven and when I print out the system
now it's printing out 2.7 down here so
it is using that Python 2 7 version now
the script doesn't default to any of
those profiles so if I just run the
script regularly so I just ran it again
and now down here it's popping out
Python 3.5 so if we want to run it with
that Python 2 7 profile again then we
can just pull up that command palette
and type in script and there's one
option here that is run with profile now
usually gives the keyboard shortcut over
here I'm not sure why it's not showing
up now with the keyboard shortcut on a
Mac is command shift K so now that I
clicked on run with profile then you can
see that it pops up with the profiles
that I have available and we've only
made c1 Python 2 7 1 so now I can run it
with that and down here at the bottom
this is the output for this for the
system is Python 2.7 so it did run that
correctly and you can set those run
options up for multiple versions of
Python or you can point to any virtual
environment if you need to run a Python
and a virtual environment so I think
that's going to do it for this video
that is everything specific to how I
setup a Python development environment
within atom I hope people found this
useful the most popular questions I get
on this channel are people asking how to
setup Python development environments
and what I recommend so like I mentioned
earlier I also use sublime text and have
done a video on how to set up a Python
environment within sublime text also and
I'll put a link to that video in the
description section below now if anyone
is wondering if I would recommend
sublime text or atom then I would just
say that it depends so I think that atom
is more user friendly if you're just
getting started out and if you don't
want to purchase sublime text then I
would say that atom is a great option
but I've been using sublime text for so
long that I'm more used to it and I find
myself going back to it often but really
the choice is just up to you and
whichever you prefer
so hopefully having videos on how to set
up and
armaments and both of these editors now
you can play around with them and just
decide which one you personally like
more so if anyone has any questions
about what we covered in this video then
feel free to ask in the comment section
below and I'll do my best to answer
those if you enjoyed these tutorials and
would like to support them then there
are several ways you can do that the
easiest way is just to simply like the
video and give it a thumbs up and also
it's a huge help to share these videos
with anyone who you think would find
them useful and if you have the means
you can contribute through patreon and
