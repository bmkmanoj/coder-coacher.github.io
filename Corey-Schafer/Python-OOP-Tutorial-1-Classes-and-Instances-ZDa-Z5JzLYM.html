series of videos we'll be learning how
to create and use classes within Python
and how object-oriented concepts are
applied within the language now there's
a lot to cover when working with classes
so I'm going to break these up into
several different videos we'll cover the
basics of creating and instantiating
classes will learn about inheritance
class and instance variables static
methods and class methods and several
other topics so breaking these up in
several videos will allow us to focus on
specific topics in each video so in this
video we'll be learning the basics of
creating and instantiating simple
classes but first why should we even use
classes now this isn't just specific to
Python you can see classes being used
throughout most modern programming
languages and there's a good reason for
that they allow us to logically group
our data and functions in a way that's
easy to reuse and also easy to build
upon if need be now just a quick side
note when I say data and functions that
are associated with a specific class we
call those attributes and methods and
you'll hear me use those terms a lot
throughout these videos so when I say
methods I mean a function that is
associated with a class so let's go
ahead and get started
so say we had an application for our
company and we wanted to represent our
employees and our Python code now this
would be a great use case for a class
because each individual employee is
going to have specific attributes and
methods so for example each employee is
going to have a name and email address a
pay and also actions that they can
perform so it'd be nice if we had a
class that we could use as a blueprint
to create each employee so that we
didn't have to do this manually each
time from scratch so let's go ahead and
create a simple employee class and see
what that would look like so to create a
class it's just as easy as saying class
employee now I'm going to leave this
empty for now and if we just left it
like this and we get an error so if you
ever have a class or a function that you
want to leave empty for the time being
then you can simply put in a past
statement and Python will know that you
just want to skip that for now so now we
have a simple employee class with no
attributes or methods and I wanted to
stop here because I wanted to explain
the difference between a class and an
instance of a class
so our class is basically a blueprint
for creating instances and each unique
employee that we create using our
employee class will be an instance of
that class so for example if I said
employee 1 equals employee and employee
2 equals employee then each of these are
going to be their own unique instances
of the employee class so for example if
I go ahead and print both of these out
and copy and paste that there and you
can see that both of these are employee
objects and they're both unique they
both have different locations here in
memory now this is an important
distinction because you'll hear me talk
a lot about instance variables and class
variables and it's important to know the
difference between those and I'll go
more in depth into class variables in
the next video but for this video we're
going to be looking at instance
variables so instance variables contain
data that is unique to each instance now
we could manually create instance
variables for each employee by doing
something like this so let's say we
wanted employee 1 to have a first name
and a last name so I could just do
employee 1 not first equals Korie and
then I could do employee last is equal
to Schaefer and I could also give it an
email address so I'll do employee 1 dot
a mail equals and I'll just do the first
name with the last name at company comm
and lastly let's go ahead and add a pay
onto there too so I'll do employee 1 not
pay and we'll just do 50,000 there now
let's give employee to some of these
same attributes so for this one I'll
just do test user and then I'll do test
user and I will make that 60,000 ok so
now each of these instances have
attributes that are unique to them so if
I print it out let's say I could print
out the employee 1 dot mail and
also print out the employee to email on
it looks like whenever I gave these the
instance variables I forgot to make this
employee to here so now let's run that
so now you can see that that email was
created for each employee let's say that
we wanted to set all of this information
for each employee when they're created
rather than doing all of this manually
like we did here so we wouldn't want to
have to manually set these variables
every time you can see it's a lot of
code and it's also prone to mistakes
just like I did whenever I forgot to
change the to employee too so we don't
get much benefit of using classes if we
did it this way so to make these set up
automatically when we create the
employee we're going to use a special
and knit method so now inside of our
employee class I'm going to create this
special knit method now you can think of
this method as initialized and if you're
coming from another language then you
can think of this as the constructor now
when we create methods within a class
they receive the instance as the first
argument automatically and by convention
we should call the instance self now you
can call it whatever you want but it's a
good idea to stick to convention here
and just use self so after self we can
specify what other arguments that we
want to accept so let's go ahead and
accept the first name the last name and
the pay and I know that we had email too
but we can create the email using the
first name and the last name so now
within our and knit method we're going
to set all of these instance variables
so let's do self dot first equals first
and now I'm just going to do this for
the rest of them as well so I'm going to
do self dot pay or self dot last and
self dot pay and for the email I can do
self dot email equals first plus and
then we'll put a dot between those and
then last and then we'll add on to the
end at company comm okay so whenever I
say that self is the instance what I
mean by that is that when we
self dot first equals two first here
it's going to be the same thing as us
saying down here that employee one dot
first equals Korey except now instead of
doing this manually it'll be done
automatically when we create our
employee objects now these don't need to
be the same as our arguments so for
example I could make this self dot F
name equals first but I usually like to
keep these similar if possible so I'm
going to go ahead and set that back to
self dot first equals first okay so now
when we create our instances of our
employee class right here now we can
pass in the values that we specified in
our anit method now our net method takes
the instance which we call itself and
the first name last name and pay as
arguments but when we create our
employee down here the instance is
passed automatically so we can leave off
self we only need to provide the names
and the pay so we could create these by
passing in first and we have to do this
in order so I will pass in all of the
same information that we did manually
down there and for the second one I'll
do test and user and I think I had that
at sixty thousand okay so what would
happen on this line when we create this
employee the anit method will be run
automatically so employee one will be
passed in as self and then it will set
all of these attributes so it'll set
employee one dot first is equal to first
which we passed in as quarry employee
one that last equals what we passed in
is last and so on so now that we have
that an it method in place we can go
ahead and delete these manual
assignments that we made down here and
you can see by deleting that that we got
rid of a lot of code so I'm going to go
ahead and comment out those lines we're
printing the employees and I'm just
going to go ahead and print out the
email so if I run that then you can see
that that still works okay so everything
that we have so far like the names and
email and the pay are all attributes of
our class
now let's say that we wanted the ability
to perform some kind of action not to do
that we can add some methods to our
class so let's say that I wanted the
ability to display the full name of an
employee now this is an action that
you'd likely need to do a lot with a
class like this so we can do this
manually outside the class if I was to
come down here and do print and I could
get the full name just by putting in two
placeholders there and doing a format
and saying employee one dot first and
employee one dot last and if I go ahead
and print this out and you can see that
we got the full name there but that's a
lot to type in each time that you want
to display the employees full name so
instead let's create a method within our
class that allows us to put this
functionality in one place so within our
class here I'm going to create a method
called full name and we can do that with
just doing a death of full name now like
I said before each method within a class
automatically takes the instance as the
first argument and we're going to always
call that self and the instance is the
only argument that we'll need in order
to get the full name so within this
method here I'm just going to take the
same logic that we had down here and cut
that out and I'm just going to go ahead
and return that but we have to be
careful here because now instead of
printing employee 1 first-name and
lastname I'm going to use self so that
it will work with all instances so I'm
going to do self dot first and self dot
last so now that we created that method
instead of printing like we did before
now I can just come down here and do
employee 1 dot full name and print that
out and if I run that then you can see
that we got the same thing and notice
that we need the parentheses here
because this is a method instead of an
attribute so if I left the parentheses
off and printed this then you can see
that it prints the method instead of the
return value of the
method so we're going to have to put
those parentheses on in order to run
that properly so now we have full
advantage of code reviews here so
instead of typing this out for each full
name that I want to print now I can just
use that method so now if I wanted to
print employee two's full name it's just
as easy as replacing employee one with
employee two and running that and we get
the correct answer okay and one more
quick thing that I wanted to point out
here now one common mistake that I see
when creating methods is forgetting the
self argument for the instance so let's
take a quick look at what that would
look like if we left that off so now
before I run this if I just comment it
out this printing of full name down here
and ran this then you can see I'm
actually going to remove these print
statements here as well now you can see
that this runs without any errors but if
I was to try to run this method that we
accidentally left self off of then run
this and you can see that we get an
error and the error that we got was a
type error full-name takes zero
positional arguments but one was given
now this can be confusing because it
doesn't look like we're passing any
arguments here into full name but the
instance which in this case is employee
two is getting passed automatically so
we have to expect that instance argument
in our method and that's why we added
self so I'm going to come back up here
to full name and put self back in and
now running this you can see that it
runs correctly now we can also run these
methods using the class name itself
which makes it a bit more obvious of
what's going on in the background
because whenever we do that so I'll do
employee dot full name now when we run
it from the class we have to manually
pass in the instance as an argument so
in this case I'll pass in employee one
so you can see how these are similar but
not exactly the same so I'm going to put
these side-by-side just so that we can
compare them here so these two lines
here do the exact same thing but here
when I do employee one which is a
instance and I call the method I don't
need to pass in self it does it
automatically and when we call the
method on the class and it doesn't know
what instance that we want to run that
method with so we do have to pass in the
instance and that gets passed in as self
and if I go ahead and print this out and
run it then you can see that it works
just like if we were to print out the
employee one dot full name and I wanted
to show you that because that's actually
what's going on in the background when
we run employee one dot full name it
gets transformed into this here employee
dot full name and passes in employee one
as self and that's why we have self for
these methods so I hope that makes sense
to you
that's not extremely important to know
when we're just getting started with
working with classes but we need to
understand that in later videos once we
start inheriting from other classes and
things like that so I figured it would
be a good thing to go ahead and show you
that now okay so I think that's going to
do it for this video in this video we
learned how to create simple classes the
difference between a class and an
instance of that class and we also
learned how to initialize class
attributes and create methods now we
still have a lot to cover in future
videos and we'll be going over more
advanced topics so in the next video
we'll learn about class variables and
how they differ from instance variables
