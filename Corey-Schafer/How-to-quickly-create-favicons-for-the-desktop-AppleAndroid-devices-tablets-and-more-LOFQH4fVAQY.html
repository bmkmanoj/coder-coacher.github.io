you a quick tip and how you can quickly
generate your icons for your favicon
your Apple device your Android device
and you know all these different devices
all in one place I have a test website
running on my local server here this is
just a yeoman website right out of the
box and the website that I'm going to be
using to generate all my icons is this
website real favicon generator dotnet I
really like this website I'm glad that I
found it I used to create all my icons
from scratch and then then I would have
to resize all of them for all the
different devices and then handwrite all
the code and put that into the header of
my website but since I've found this
website it makes all that really easily
so let's go ahead and get started with
this now you do already have to have
your picture that you want to use for
your website this website isn't for that
it's not for creating the picture it's
for resizing the picture and giving you
the code to use that once it generates
those for you so you need to have a
picture first
over here on my desktop I have one here
called
icon dot PNG and you can see down here
before you select your picture it says
that you want to submit a square picture
at least 70 by 70 and it should be at
least two sixty by two sixty for optimal
results this picture I have here for my
website
is I believe 800 by 800 so it is plenty
big so I'm going to click click on
select your favicon picture and then I'm
going to navigate over here to my
desktop then I'm going to select this
icon PNG and open that and once that's
finished generating it'll give you a
bunch of different options here I
usually just leave these as is but you
can play with these if you want you can
mess around with some of the colors some
of the margin sizes here if you look up
here at the picture you can change the
margin between your pictures but like I
said I usually just leave these as the
default one that I usually change is for
this wind
eight tile I usually try to pick a
picture or an image a background color
that looks a little bit better with my
icon here and then you can even choose
your own but uh I'm not gonna fuss too
much with this right now I'll just pick
black there and or this dark blue and
then kind of move on but you can match
that closer to your icon if you want but
yeah there's a lot of different options
here I usually just leave these as
default and then once you have all that
set then you can go down here and
finalize and generate your favicons and
your HTML code and once that finishes it
does a couple of things here so it has
your downloadable package of your
favicons and your other icons it also
has all this HTML code here and down
here you can kind of see what the icons
look like that it generated for you so
first I'm going to go ahead and download
this package and let's go ahead and
unzip that and now you can see why this
tool would be so useful because all of
these images here are for different
devices you have your Apple touch
devices and all the different sizes that
you're supposed to have for that
you have your androids your favicons and
things like that so to make all those
from scratch from yourself and resizing
all those would kind of be a hassle but
with this just does it all and the one
nice zip folder and you're good to go
so I'm going to go ahead and copy all of
these and copy 28 items and then I'm
going to open up my test web site here
and you can see up here in the top left
that I don't have a favicon yet so let's
go ahead and paste all those into the
root of the website and then if we go
back to where it generated our HTML we
can copy this to the clipboard now it
says it's copied and if I open up my
test web site here then I can go and
paste this into my top of my index.html
file and that's all the code that it
generated for me and I will tab that
over
and save that and if you're running the
basic website that should be all that
you have to do you should be able to
save that file and then those five icons
will show up I'm running a yeoman
website here so I'm just going to do a
grunt build to build that website and
it'll quickly run through those and now
that that build all my files I should be
able to go over here to my test website
and reload this well so actually since
I'm running this from my local webserver
this relative path to these images is
going to be a little bit different
usually you will have these at the root
of your website most likely when you put
them in your live website they'll be at
the root but just for the sake of
demonstration here I'm going to change
these to where to where it can find this
in the same folder that my website lives
and now let me rerun this grunt build
and now let's see if it can find those
icons okay so now you can see here that
the favicon is showing up in my web
browser if you know if this was a live
website and you dropped that code in
there in those images then you would
also you know if you saved that website
to your iPhone then that icon would pop
up
it would save on your Android and all
those devices that's what that website
does for you it creates all those icons
for your site's brand and creates those
to where they're accessible on all those
devices and one last quick thing about
this website if I go back to the main
page here once you've dropped in all
your icons and updated all your code to
point to those icons then you want to go
down here to your to this check your
favicon here and it'll give you a little
box here to type in your website and you
can also say if your favicon isn't in
the root directory of your website and
just tell it that you know where to look
but in my case if I go to my personal
website here kori MS com
and my favicons and all my icons are in
the root of my website so then if I
click this check button here it's going
to go out and check your website and
it's going to make sure that it can find
all those icons and that except that
those are accessible from all the
different devices so you can see all
these are in the green here so it's and
it shows you a preview too of what each
one of them looks like so on the desktop
here's what it looks like in your
browser this is the Android iOS Windows
8 and then it also gives you all kinds
of information here saying that you you
know you have the right sizes that you
have the right file formats the PNG s
and things like that so you know it's
really useful I used to do all this on
my own it took a lot of time for not
that big of a payoff but you know for
this you can make a quick icon drop it
into this website get all your icons
generated get all the code for it drop
those in and you're good to go for just
about any device that you can think of
so I hope this tip was useful for you
guys you should definitely go and check
out this website you know if you have
any questions just ask in the comment
