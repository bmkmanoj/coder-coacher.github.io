video we will look at how to update and
delete records from our database using
the update and delete commands now I'm
putting both of these into one video
because they are very similar concepts
now before we update or delete any
records in our database it's usually a
good idea to first run a select
statement on the values so that we know
that we're acting upon the correct data
but first let's look at an extremely
simple example with this test table here
so that we can see what happens
if we update or delete values without
using a where clause to filter which
records we want so if we look at this
test table here it's a very simple table
that just has eight records in it and
all of the location values here are null
so let's update this to where all of the
location values are set to the string
unknown so to do this we can run the
update statement so I'm going to go over
here to write my query and I'm going to
say update test table and then I'm going
to do set location equal to and then the
string unknown so if I run this query
and then I go back over here to the
table and reload the data you can see
that now all of the location values in
the entire table have been set to
unknown now the reason that updated all
of those values is because in our query
we didn't have a where clause so it's
just going to do all of the records so
now let's say that we want to delete all
of the records from this table so we can
do this with the delete statement and if
we want to delete everything then it's
just as easy as doing a delete from test
table so if I run this and then I go
back over here to the content and reload
the data you can see that our table is
completely empty it deleted all of the
records that we had and again the reason
that it did that is because we don't
have a where clause here so it's just
going to go and delete everything now
more commonly you're going to use these
commands to update or delete specific
records and not all of them at once
so this is where
I said that it's beneficial to first run
a select statement for the records that
you want to update or delete and that
way you know what you're acting upon is
the correct data so let's look at all of
the records from this people table by
running the query select star from
people and if we run this then we have
all of our records back so now let's say
that this record right here number 14
that we want to set Jane Smith's
occupation from student to programmer so
first let's write a select statement to
grab that record so that we're sure that
we're getting the correct one so once
the like statement that could get that
record we could do a select from people
where first-name is equal to Jane and
lastname is equal to Smith now if I run
this query and you can see that we only
get back to one result which is good
because that's the one that we want to
update now we could have also done a
where the ID is equal to 14 if we were
worried about there being multiple Jane
Smith's but this is good for our purpose
here so now let's replace this select
with our update and we're going to leave
the where clause exactly like it is so
let's do an update people and then we
will do set occupation equal to
programmer and let me capitalize this so
now if I run this query and now it
doesn't look like anything happened but
now if I do the select star from people
again and run this query you can see now
if we look at Jane Smith down here at
number 14 now her occupation is set to
programmer so now let me show you why
it's important to run the select
statement before updating or deleting
records so in this example let's say
that we want to delete all of the people
with the occupation scientists who are
younger than the age of 58 so let's let
write a select statement that we think
will do this but
we accidentally make a small mistake so
let's do select star from people where
occupation is equal to scientist and let
me fix this here and now when we do our
age less than 58
let's accidentally type in or age less
than 58 so notice when I run this query
we get back a lot of results here and
it's a lot more than we planned and it's
because we meant to say that we wanted
scientists and their age is less than 58
not or so now if we run it then we can
see that we only get one result now if I
had run the delete statement with that
bad where clause without first running
the check using the Select statement
then I would have accidentally deleted
all of those records that were returned
with that first select statement that I
didn't mean to delete so now that we
have selected this record and we know
that we're acting upon the correct data
then now if I want to delete this record
then I can just do a delete from people
and I could leave the where clause
exactly as it is so now if I run this
query and then do a select store from
people and run this if we look through
all of this data then we'll notice that
the Neil Tyson record that we had in
there has been deleted and it no longer
exists in our table so that about does
it for this video hopefully that cleared
up some different ways in which you can
use the update and delete statements if
you do have any questions just ask in
