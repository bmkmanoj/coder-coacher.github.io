this video we'll be learning about
dictionaries and how we can work with
them and Python
so dictionaries allow us to work with
key value pairs and if you're coming
from another programming language then
you may have heard these called hash
maps or associative arrays so when I say
that we'll be working with key value
pairs these are two linked values where
the key is a unique identifier where we
can find our data and the value is that
data so we can actually think of that
almost like a real physical dictionary
where we look up for definitions so in
that example each word that we look up
would be the key and the definition of
that word would be the value so let's go
ahead and take a look at some examples
so let's say that we wanted to represent
a student using a dictionary so to do
this we could just create a student
variable and set this equal to these
curly braces and that's how we start our
dictionary now within our curly braces
here we will first put in our key so
let's say that we want a key of name now
we're going to put in a colon to
separate our key from our value and for
the name here we'll just start off with
John and now let's add some more keys
and values and to separate these keys
and values we're going to put in a comma
so next let's put in a key of age and a
value of 25 and lastly we'll put in a
key of courses and for this value we'll
pass in a list of courses here so we'll
say math and comp sign so now let's
print out our student and see how that
looks so if we save that and run it and
we can see that it prints out all of our
keys and values now let's just get a
value of one key so to do this we can
add square brackets after our dictionary
and then specify the key that we want to
access so I can put in square brackets
here let's say that we want to access
the name of that student dictionary so
I'll just pass in the name key and run
that and we can see that that gave us
that value of that name key now if I
wanted the courses instead and I could
just pass in that courses for the key if
I run that you can see that we got this
list of math and Comp sign so we can see
that these values and our dictionary can
be just about anything our name is a
string our age is an integer and the
courses are a
list now all of our keys are currently
strings but they can actually be any
immutable data type so usually these
void there be strings or injures but
there are a few more data types that
they can be as well so for example
instead of name as our key here if for
some reason we wanted this to be an
integer so I'll just pass in one so a 1
is a valid key and now if I access that
key of 1 and run that and you can see
that that gave us John but I'm going to
set that back to be a string for now and
keep that as name so what happens if we
try to access a key that doesn't exist
so for example I'll try to access the
key of phone for a phone number so if we
run this then we can see that we get a
key error because that phone key doesn't
exist now throwing an error when a key
doesn't exist might not always be what
we want so sometimes we might just want
to return none or a default value so to
do this we can use the dictionaries get
method so instead of accessing this key
this way if we were instead to say not
get and use the get method so let's just
go ahead and get the name since we know
that that key already exists so if I run
that then we can see that that works
just like before and gave us the value
of John but if I try to access a key
that doesn't exist so we'll try to
access that phone key again if I save
that and run it then by default this get
method returns none instead of an error
and we can also specify a default value
for keys that don't exist so to do this
we can just pass the default value that
we want as a second argument to this get
method so I'll just put in a comma here
and we'll put in a string that just says
not found so if I save that and run it
now we can see that for keys that don't
exist it returns not found ok so let's
look at how we can add a new entry to
our dictionary so let's say that we
wanted to add that phone number to our
student dictionary and we'll set this
just above our print statement here so
to do this it's just as easy as saying
student and then we will set the key
that we want to set and set this equal
to and we'll just set this equal to a
string of 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 and if I save
that and run
we can see that it found that value is a
phone key when we ran our print
statement now if a key already exists if
we set its value like this then it will
update the value of that key so for
example if right below this I was to say
student and name is equal to and we'll
just pass in Jane if I save that and
then print out I'll comment out that for
now if I print out our entire students
variable then we can see down here that
the value for name was updated when we
assigned it to Jane now we can also
update values using the update method
now this is especially useful when we
want to update multiple values at a time
so for example let's say that we wanted
to add this phone number update this
name and also update the age as well so
to do this all in one shot we could say
student dot update and this takes in a
dictionary as an argument and the
dictionary is just everything that we
either want to add or update so we can
say that we want to update that name to
Jane and we will update the age to let's
say 26 and we also want to add this
phone key and that phone key will just
set as what we had four five five five
five nine five five now if I save that
and run it and we can see that just by
running this one statement we updated
the name to Jane the age is now 26 and
it has this new key of phone number okay
so now let's say that we wanted to
delete a specific key and its value now
one way that we can do this is by using
the del keyword which stands for word
delete so let me just remove these
updates here and then we can say so
let's say that we wanted to delete the
students age so it's as easy as just
saying it del student age and now if we
run this then we can see that now the
only keys that exist are named and
courses so that age key was deleted now
another way that we can remove a key and
value is with the pop method so if you
remember from our video on lists the pop
method will remove but also return that
value so that allows us to grab the
removed value with a variable so
we could say age is equal to and do a
student dot pop and what we want to pop
is that age so if I save that and we'll
also print the age here below student if
I run that and we can see that the age
and value were removed from our
dictionary but we also created that age
variable that contained the value that
we popped off so that pops off 25 okay
now let's look at how we can loop
through all the keys and values of our
dictionary so first if we want to see
how many keys we have in our dictionary
that we can just print out its length
with the LAN function so if I was to say
print le n of students and run that and
we can see that it returns three because
we have three keys and our student
dictionary now if we wanted to see all
of these keys then we could just print
out student dot keys if I run that that
we can see that that gave us all of the
keys of our dictionary if we wanted all
of our values then we can print out
student values if I run that you can see
that that gives us only two values now
if we wanted to see the keys and values
then we could use this items method if I
run this then we can see that now we
have these pairs of key and value pairs
so we have named John age 25 courses
with the list and we'll be coming back
to these pairs in just one second so if
we wanted to loop through all of the
keys and values in our dictionary we
might be tempted to loop through the
same way we loop through our list but if
we just loop through our list without
using any method then it'll just loop
through the keys so for example if you
were to say 4 key in student and then
print out that key if we run this then
we can see that it just looped through
and printed out all of those keys now in
order to loop through the keys and
values
we'll need to use that items method that
we just saw a second ago and so we'll
just plug that in there we'll say
student items and now these come and a
pair of two values so instead of just
key we're also going to have to access
the value so we can say for key value
and Stu
not items and now we'll print out the
key and that value so if I run that so
we can see that each loop through this
key variable was equal to each key and
this value variable was equal to each
value okay so I think that's going to do
it for this video I hope that now
everyone feels comfortable working with
dictionaries and the functionality
that's available to us and in the next
video we'll be going over conditionals
and how to write if-else and Elif
statements we'll also be learning more
about boolean and boolean operators now
