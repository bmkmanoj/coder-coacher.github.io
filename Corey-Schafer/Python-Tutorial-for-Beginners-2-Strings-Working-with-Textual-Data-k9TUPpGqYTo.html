this video we'll be learning about
Python data types and specifically we'll
be learning about how to work with
textual data and textual data in Python
are represented with strings so we
currently have opened our intro PI file
that we were working with in the last
video where we just printed out hello
world and I'll go ahead and run this so
that we can see that down here it does
print out hello world now this line here
is using the print function and we're
passing this text value into that print
function now if we wanted to create a
variable that holds that text value then
we could say now I'll just get rid of
this comment for now so if I wanted a
variable to hold that value then I can
just create a variable and we'll call
that message and we'll set that message
variable equal to our text value that we
passed in to print and here message is
our variable name so if you're coming
from another language then you might be
wondering if we need to use semicolons
or something like that to end each line
but Python doesn't need that it operates
on whitespace alone which makes it a
very clean language to work with now by
convention our variables are usually all
lowercase and if it's multiple words
then we separate those with underscore
so if instead my variable name was my
message then it would be my underscore
message so that's just a convention
that's commonly used and also these
variable names should be as descriptive
as possible as to what values they're
meant to hold so message is a good
variable name here because it's holding
our message but if I was instead to call
this variable M which is a valid
variable name but anyone reading my code
now wouldn't know when they see this in
variable what value it's supposed to
hold so message is a much better
variable name in this case so this
message variable now holds our text data
and our text data is called a string now
we can use our variable in place of this
string anywhere that we use it in our
program so instead of printing out hello
world directly here I'm instead going to
now print out this variable and that
should give us the same results so if I
run that then you can see down here we
still get the same result now we can see
that I created this string with single
quotes now you can also use double
quotes so if you're wondering if there
is a difference between the
single quotes in the double quotes and
it really just depends on what text you
have in your string so for example if
you have a single quote in your string
so for example let's create one with a
single quote instead of hello world I
will instead make our string Bobby's
world now see the problem here is that
Python sees this single quote within our
text as being the end of the string and
it's not going to know what to do with
what comes after that single quote here
because it thinks that's where the
string is closing so if you run this now
then you'll get an error now there's a
couple of different ways to handle this
we could escape this single quote with a
backslash so if I escape that single
quote and now run this now Python knows
that this single quote doesn't close out
the string and that instead this one
should now another way to handle that is
to instead so I'll take away that xscape
character now another way to handle that
is instead just use double quotes on the
outside of our string any string that
contains single quotes so if we know
that our string contains a single quote
then we can instead use double quotes on
the outside and then it'll know that
that single quote isn't the end of the
string so now if we run this then we can
see that it still works fine but that
doesn't necessarily mean that double
quotes are better because it goes both
ways if your string contains double
quotes in the message then I would use
single quotes on the outside now if we
needed to create a multi-line string and
one way we can do this is by using three
quotes at the beginning and end of our
string and these can also be single or
double quotes as well so let's go ahead
and look at an example so I'll add three
quotes to the beginning and end of our
string here and now I'll just add some
text to spans multiple lines here so
I'll just say was a good and then hit
enter to go to a new line and say
cartoon in the 1990s so now if we run
that and we can see that it printed out
our string correctly over multiple lines
okay so let's go back to our simple
hello world example so I'm just going to
take all of that and replace it with our
previous hello world example
and now let's go ahead and just run that
really quick so we're back to our
starting point so we can think of our
string as a string of individual
characters and we can access these
individual characters also so first
let's see how we can find how many
characters are in our string so to do
this we can use the LAN function which
stands for length so whenever I print
out here if I was instead of printing my
message if I was to print out this
length function and pass in message and
then run this now we're no longer
printing out our message we're printing
out the length of our message and we can
see that it says that the length of our
string is 11 and if we counted these up
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 then we can see
that that's correct and we can access
our strings characters individually so
to do this we can use the square
brackets after our string and pass in
the location of the character that we
want so I'll say print message and then
square brackets now the location is
called an index and it starts out as 0
so to access the first character of our
string we can say print the message and
then access this index of 0 so if we
print that then we can see that we got
the capital H now since the length of
our string is 11 that means that with
the first character starting out at 0
our last character would be at index 10
so it's our total length minus 1 so if I
was to say print out the location at
index 10 the value at index 10 then we
can see that we got our D character
which is the last character in that
string now if you accidentally try to
access an index that doesn't exist then
you'll get an index error so if we were
to say access the index of 11 and we can
see that that through an index error now
we can also access a range of characters
so if I just wanted to get the word
hello from our string then we could say
that we want 0 and then this colon 5 and
we'll explain this so the first index
here is our starting point and the
second in that index which is separated
by this colon is
the stopping point now one thing a
little confusing about this is that the
first index is inclusive which means
it's going to include that value but the
second index is not now there's good
reasons for this but it's still easy to
forget so basically what we're saying is
I want all the characters between the
beginning and up to but not including
the fifth index and it will be more
clear if we just go ahead and run this
so we can see that it prints out hello
so it printed out our message from the
zero index here all the way up to but
not including the 5th index here so we
got hello
now since our starting point here is
just the first index we can actually
just leave that off and it will assume
that we want to start at the beginning
so if we don't put anything there and
then : five then we should get the same
thing so if we run that we can see we
still got hello now instead if we wanted
to grab the word world from the string
then we could start at the sixth index
and then we can just go to the end and
just like leaving off our starting index
it will start from the beginning
leaving off the stop index just goes all
the way to the end so now if we run that
and we can see that it gives us back the
word world now what we're doing here is
called slicing and if you'd like to
learn more about slicing in depth then
you can watch my detailed video on that
and I'll leave a link to that in the
description section below so now let's
just go back to printing out our message
and let me run this okay so all of the
data types that we're going to review
are going to have certain methods
available to us that give us access to a
lot of useful functionality now when I
say methods a lot of people wonder
what's the difference between a method
and a function and functions and methods
are basically the same thing a method is
just a function that belongs to an
object it's not important to get into
the details of that now but if you hear
me say method or function then you can
basically think of those as the same
thing for now so like I was saying the
data types that we'll be going over all
have certain methods available to us
that give us access to a lot of useful
functionality so let's look at some of
these string methods so we can see here
that our hello
world text is capitalized but let's say
that we wanted that to be all lowercase
now to do this it's just as easy as
saying print message and then to
lowercase this we can say dot lower now
when we run this dot lower with these
parentheses here that's running the
lower method on the string so when we
ran that we can see that now our hello
world has been set to all lowercase and
if we wanted to do this to uppercase and
it's as easy as changing at lower to
upper if we run that now we can see that
hello world is all uppercase so now
let's say that we want to count a
certain number of characters in our
string and to do that we can use the
count method and the count method
actually takes a string as an argument
so we can say message dot count and now
we have to pass in an argument and it
has to know what we want to count in our
message so what for now we'll just say
count hello and if we run that we can
see that it returns that the string
hello appears in our message one time
but if we instead just passed in a
single character as argument so I'll
pass in an L if I run that you can see
that we get a 3 because there are three
L's and our message variable so if we
instead want to find the index of where
certain characters can be found and we
can use the find method so I could come
up here instead of saying dot count I
can say not fine and now this takes an
argument as well it's what we want to
find so let me type in world here and
run this and we can see when we run this
that it returns a six and that's because
world starts at the sixth index of our
message variable now if we try to find a
string of characters that doesn't exist
then it will just return negative one so
if instead of world I typed in universe
and ran that you can see it returns a
negative one because it can't find that
anywhere in our message variable okay so
now let's say that we want to replace
some characters in our string with some
other characters and we can do this with
the replace method now first I'm going
to change this change this back to
printing out our regular message so I'll
just delete these now let's try to use
our replace method right below where we
first set our message fair
Herbal and this method takes two
arguments first it takes what we want to
replace so first let me just say message
but replace so first it takes what we
want to replace so let's say that we
want to replace world and now the second
argument which is separated by a comma
is what we want to replace world with so
we'll replace world with universe so now
if we run this and this might be a
little unexpected we can see that it's
still printing out hello world now the
reason our replacement didn't work is
because it's not making that replacement
in place it's actually returning a new
string with those values replaced and
we'll learn more about return statements
when we learn about functions but
basically we need to set a new variable
here to get that returned string with
those replacements so I could say
something like new message is equal to
that original method with this
replacement so now if we set that new
variable and instead print that new
message and run that and you can see
that now it replaced the world with
universe and if you really wanted to
make the replacement to the message
variable then instead of making a new
message variable and we can just set
this same message variable again so now
we're setting the same message variable
equal to that replacement and then
printing it out so if I run that and we
can see that now the message variable
had world replaced with universe and
this may look a little strange to set a
variable to an altered version of itself
but it's very common and you'll be using
that a lot okay so now let's get rid of
this replace line here and now let's
look at how we can add multiple strings
and concatenate them together so instead
of saying hello world I'm instead just
going to set this equal to hello and
instead of calling this message I'm
going to set this equal to greeting and
just below greeting I'm going to create
a variable called name and I'm going to
set that equal to we'll just say Michael
and now lastly let's create a message
here and we want this message to combine
our greeting with our name
wanted to say hello Michael and one way
to do this is to use the plus sign
operator so we could try this by saying
greeting plus name now if we run this
and we can see that it's not exactly
what we wanted it combined them together
but it doesn't have a space there so
when you're concatenated strings
together it's easy to make mistakes like
this so what we want to do is add a
string between them so that spaces them
out so we can add a string between these
just by putting in a string literal here
and I'm also going to put in a comma and
a space to separate those and now we
also need another plus sign so that
we're adding the name after that string
so now we're saying that we want this
greeting which is hello plus this comma
and space plus the name so if I run this
then we can see that it concatenated
those strings together how we wanted now
sometimes using the plus sign isn't the
best way to go if we wanted to create a
longer more complicated string while
using our variables and adding them all
together like this might get hard to
keep track of so let's say that we
wanted to add to the end of our message
just by you know closing off a sentence
and saying welcome so to do that after
our name variable we could add another
string that is a period to close off
that sentence a space and then welcome
with an exclamation point so let's go
ahead and run that now we can see that
it printed out the string how we wanted
it to look but it's starting to get a
little complicated on this line here to
keep track of all of our plus signs and
spaces within our message instead with
strings like this it's usually better to
use a formatted string this allows us to
write the sentence as it will appear and
put placeholders in place of our
variables so let's go ahead and see what
this would look like so though instead
use a formatted string we can say
message is equal to and we're just going
to write it exactly how it appears
except everywhere where we want to
replace with a variable we're going to
put in a placeholder and those
placeholders are going to be these curly
brackets so we want a placeholder for
the greeting and then a comma
a space and a placeholder for the name
and a period and then we'll type out
welcome and an exclamation point and now
to fill those placeholders with our
variables we can say dot format and pass
in greeting for the first placeholder
and then name for the second place
holder so now let's go ahead and delete
this line where we where we were using
the plus sign operator so if we run this
we can see that we got the same thing as
when we concatenate and then together
but with longer more complicated strings
this is actually a little bit easier to
read it might look a little confusing
now since we're just seeing these
placeholders for the first time but
after you get used to this you will
realize that this is easier than keeping
track of all those concatenations and
using stream formatting like this also
gives us some extra functionality and if
you want to see everything that you can
do with that and I do have a detailed
in-depth video on string formatting and
I'll add that to the description section
below
ok and lastly if you're using Python 3.6
or above then you'll have access to
these new things called f strings now if
you aren't using 3.6 or higher then
these aren't going to work because they
were only recently released and not a
lot of people are using these F strings
yet but I'm really liking them so far
basically the idea behind f strings was
to make string formatting as simple as
possible so let's go ahead and see what
these look like
so to say that we want this to be an F
string we can just add an F right here
to the beginning on the outside of the
string now instead of using this dot
format method well instead just write
the variables directly within the
placeholders so I can remove that dot
format method and now we can pass the
variables directly within the
placeholder so we'll pass greeting to
that placeholder and name to that one so
I can save that and run it and you can
see that using that we got the same
result and like I said these F strings
are pretty new to the language so even
people who are very familiar with Python
may be seeing this for the first time
now one reason I really like these F
strings is because you can actually
write code within the placeholder so if
I wanted the name and all caps for some
reason then I could just come into the
placeholder here
and say name dot upper and run that
directly within the placeholder if I run
that then you can see that now our name
was capitalized okay so we're almost
finished up but I wanted to show you one
last trick here when you're learning
something new in Python so we saw a lot
of different methods that we could use
on our strings now if we ever wanted to
see everything that's available to us
then there are a couple of things that
we can do so first we can use this dir
function and that looks like this and
what this does is if we pass in a
variable then it will show us all of the
attributes and methods that we have
access to with that variable now don't
worry about all of these double
underscore methods yet but if we look
down here then we'll see a couple of
familiar methods that we used in this
video so for example we have dot upper
here we have not replace dot lower so
this kind of gives you a broad overview
of all the attributes and methods that
are available to you now this doesn't
show what any of these actually do so to
see more information about these string
methods then we can use the help
function but if we run this help
function on the name then that won't
work we actually need to run it on the
string class itself so we'll just type
in help and then STR for string and if I
run that and we can see that this gives
us a lot more information and I'll pull
this up here a bit so it you know tells
us everything that's available to us and
if I scroll down here a bit and if I try
to find something that we actually used
in this video okay so we have fine here
so you can see that actually gives us a
description of what these methods do and
what arguments they take now if you know
that you had a certain method available
to you but you couldn't remember exactly
what it does
then you can actually pass it directly
in to help also so if I wanted to find
out some more information about the
lower method then we could say string
dot lower and if we run that and we can
see that it gives us information and the
description just of what lower does
so using that dir function and that help
function is a great way to get a broad
overview of the methods and attributes
that are available to you and also what
using the help function gives you an
idea of what those methods do without
actually you know going online and
checking everything there okay so I
think that is going to do it for this
video I hope that now you feel
comfortable with working with strings
and are familiar with some of the useful
things that we can do with those in the
next video we're learning how to work
with numbers in Python and specifically
integers and floats but if anyone has
any questions about what we covered in
this video then feel free to ask in the
