going to be another programming terms
video and in this video we're going to
be going over string interpolation now
string interpolation is probably
something that you are already using
maybe and but you just might not know
what it means but if we look at
Wikipedia how they define string
interpolation is the process of
evaluating a string literal containing
one or more placeholders yielding a
result in which the placeholders are
replaced with their corresponding values
so basically what this is saying is that
you're using placeholders within your
strings that then get replaced by the
real values later on so let's go ahead
and take a look at this an actual code
so that we can see what's going on now
the example that I have pulled up here
is not an example of string
interpolation this is actually called
string concatenation and the reason I
want to show you this method first is
because this is the method that some
people use and I want you to see the
benefits of using using string
interpolation over concatenation that is
sometimes used so you can kind of see
what I'm trying to do here I have a name
value of Corre an age value of 28 and
I'm trying to print out a string that
says my name is and then put in the name
and I am put in the age years old so if
I run this now you can see that I get an
error so okay I have a type error cannot
concatenate string and int objects now I
am using Python for this example but
don't get too tied up in the language
that I'm using because this
concatenation and interpolation
comparison is going to be the same for
most languages that have string
interpolation so anyways so I see that I
have this area here cannot concatenate
string and in objects it's because I
have an integer age here so I need to
cast this to a string before I can make
it part of before I can add it to a
string so then if I try to run it
you can see now that my spacing is off
and this is a common problem with string
concatenation is that it's not entirely
obvious that we need spaces here because
it just adds the name directly to this
string and there's no space here so if
we add in a space then I'll have to put
in a space between the beginning and
ending of this one and then at the
beginning of this one but not at the end
here save that and run it and now after
a little bit of tweaking we get the
result that I was hoping for now let's
compare this method of string
concatenation with string interpolation
so up here at this greeting this is the
example I had before and if you remember
I had to add in these spatial spaces I
had to cast this integer to a string and
then I had to put in a space here okay
now if I save that and run that you can
see that that is the result I was hoping
to get but now let me comment out this
line and I'm commenting out this line
using string interpolation so like I
said before in the definition string
interpolation is just using placeholders
within your string and then replacing
those placeholders with the values at a
later time and right here we're doing
that with this format method here and so
first of all let me go ahead and run
this so that you can see that this does
work so I just ran the code and you can
see that it outputted the exact same
thing now you can see that this string
is much easier to read you can see where
the spaces are these little brackets
here in Python is how you do the
placeholder in the string and then
within this format method this is where
we're passing in our values and these
just go in in the order that they are
seen within the actual string so name
goes to the first placeholder and H goes
to the second place holder now these
don't necessarily have to be in order
you know you can mix these up if I take
this first part out here and I put age
and then and my name is and then I can
put name here and then within format I
can do name equals name age
equals age and now you can see if I run
that I get the result that I expected
even though these are out of order in
the format method because it knows to
fill in these specific placeholders with
these specific values even if they're
out of order so as you can see using
string interpolation is first of all
it's a lot easier to read I can see
exactly where these spaces are and the
placeholders for the values and not only
that but it's less prone to errors too
like like I was saying up here you had
to actually cast this value to a string
and you had to add in these spaces that
you know this is only one line of code
here but say you have hundreds of lines
of code you may miss a space here or
there but if you use this string
interpolation then you can see exactly
what the string is going to look like
it's pretty much like a template and
these values are hard-coded into this
file but this is great whenever you're
receiving values from a database and
then you know if you have a web page or
something you can just write out your
HTML and then you can put in these
placeholders for your HTML just like a
template and then it'll pass those
values in at a later time whenever it's
whenever it's at runtime so like I was
saying before you may already be using
stuff like this you may already be using
string interpolation and just didn't
know what the term was so now you know
now if it comes up in a conversation or
if you're talking to someone and they
mentioned string interpolation then
you'll know what they mean so yeah
