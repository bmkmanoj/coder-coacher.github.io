you a quick tip on how to bring in some
sample data into a fresh installation of
WordPress this is great whenever you're
developing a site locally and you need
to see what your theme is going to look
like whenever it encounters certain
types of elements in a post you know you
could have you could have images you
could have image galleries you could
have quotes or tables a lot of different
things that you might not think to test
whenever you're developing your site
that could show up on your main blog
down the road and it might not look the
way that you planned on it looking so
I'm going to show you a quick tip on how
to bring in some data to solve that
problem so right now I have a fresh
installation of WordPress this is the
default 2014 theme it comes with the
single hello world post this post has
one comment now I have a theme here for
my website that I want to start
developing with locally and if I
activate that theme and you can see if I
come back out here to the website then
from where I only have the one post and
the one widget in the sidebar it's kind
of hard to tell what this theme is going
to look like when it goes live whenever
I first started doing this if I
encountered this situation sometimes I
would come in here to post and just
click on add new and start adding in
sample data and find some sample images
and then I would try to make as many
posts as I could that I might encounter
on my live site but that's very time
consuming and and not to mention that
after all that time you still might miss
a few things that you didn't think to
check so the best thing for this is
something called WordPress theme unit
tests and if we go over here to Google
if you just google word Pet WordPress
theme unit then the very top link here
will be to the WordPress codex so if you
just click on that then right here it'll
give
you the test data that you can download
so if we just save this XML file and I'm
just going to save this into my
downloads folder and if we go back to
our website if we go down here to tools
and import then from here we can click
on this WordPress import and install
this and then activate plug-in and run
the importer and then from here let's
choose that theme unit test that we just
downloaded and then click on upload file
and import and then here if you have
different authors on your on your
website then you can assign those
authors to different parts of the test
data but I only have one demo user here
so I'm just going to assign that demo
user to every one of the authors and you
want to be sure to click this here
download and import file attachments
because you want to import all the
images that come with the with the theme
unit test so once this is finished
downloading it may take a second ok now
that now that that's finished we can go
back to our website and you can see here
that it is added in a bunch of different
posts and it has pretty much any markup
and any elements that you're going to
encounter in a live site so here you
have all your headings you have tables
lists you have some code there's sample
images here it'll tell you the what the
dimensions of the image should be
whether they're floated to the left or
the right or a line left or right it
also has some you can see there's four
pages of information here they have
somewhere around here image galleries so
yeah here they have image galleries that
you can see how to look on your web page
so I
highly suggest using this to test how
your website is going to look because it
pretty much covers anything that you're
going to find whenever you go live but
another thing here that I wanted to show
you if you look over here you can see
that I still only have the one widget it
doesn't it only adds in post it doesn't
add in widget so if I wanted to see what
different widgets would look like on my
page there is a plug-in that we can
install for that if we go back to our
dashboard and go to add new on plugins
there's a plug-in if we just search for
developer and these are the same guys
who make jetpack that's automatic if we
install this developer plug-in and
activate it and then it's going to ask
you if this is a plug-in for cell phones
of WordPress a theme or a theme for a
wordpress com VIP site this is a theme
for a self hosted WordPress installation
so choose that and there's a lot of
different things that come with this
developer plugin and I'm not going to go
over all of them but I you know I highly
suggest going in here and checking out
some of these some of these are really
useful this regenerate thumbnails will
if you ever change the size of your
images as you're testing out a theme
then you can just run regenerate
thumbnails and it'll take care of all
those you can test your themes with
these theme testers and theme checked
but anyways the one that I wanted to
show was this monster widget so let's
click on install and now that that's
finished installing let's go over here
to appearance and widgets and now we'll
see that we have this monster widget
and we can add this to any of our
sidebar so sidebars that I want to test
out are my primary sidebar so I'll add
it to that I want to test out my
secondary sidebar I'll add it to that
and all three of my footers so I'm gonna
add three of those okay and now that
you've done that you can go back and
check out what your site looks like and
you can see here with this monster
widget does is it adds in a lot of the
different things that you can see on a
live site so right here added in an
archived list it's got your archived
dropdowns that you can choose from
calendar category list category
dropdowns have an RSS feed some images
down here if we go down to the very
bottom we can see it does the same thing
for the footer so we can see what our
footers are going to look like now yeah
obviously this isn't what it's going to
look like on a live site because the
monster widget has so much information
in it you'd never have a footer this
large but it gives you an idea of what
these certain segments would look like
on a live site so well that's about all
one to show you guys a lot of people
already know about this but if if you
didn't hopefully it was useful I know
whenever I found out about it it helped
me out a lot I was kind of trying to you
know make these posts on my own and it
took up a lot of time and ended up
missing a lot of things too so it's a
lot easier just to pull in this theme
unit test and be done with it you know
and you can also try to pull down the
live data from your database but if you
don't have a plug-in like migrate DB Pro
sometimes that can be harder than it has
to be so I find this extremely useful
especially whenever you don't care so
much about the content and you're just
trying to get an idea of how your theme
looks visually it it really does well
when it comes to that so yeah I hope
this use I hope this tip was useful for
you guys if you have any questions you
know feel free to ask in the comments
