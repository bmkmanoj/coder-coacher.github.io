a quick little video here I just want to
show you a situation that I run into
from time to time and how I solve it so
the situation I'm talking about is if I
have a lot of tabs open but then I need
to shut down my computer or shut down
Chrome or something like that but I
don't want to lose those tabs I want to
come back to them at a later time so how
do you do this quickly and easily
without going in bookmarking each
individual one or without copying and
pasting all of the URLs into a text file
or something like that well the way that
I do this is fairly simple so if you
have a bunch of tabs open then you can
right click on the tab and then there's
an option here that says bookmark all
tabs so if you click that it's going to
open up a bookmark all tabs option here
and then usually within my bookmarks
bookmarks bar I'll create a new folder
and the folder I usually call it
something like saved or something like
that and then within the saved folder
now this is just personal preference but
I don't do this very often so I usually
just date it so for this example I'll do
Oh 7:30 15 now that's just a personal
preference you know if you're reading
about something specific then you can
name it whatever you want to name it so
let's click OK there and now if we open
up a new tab then you can see that we
have this saved folder here in our
bookmarks bar so if we click on this
saved folder and then you can see that
it saved all of our bookmarks or all of
our tabs that we currently had open so
now let's say for example that I closed
down Chrome and now I have a new Chrome
window here so in order to open up all
those tabs it's just as easy as looking
at our dated folder here or whatever you
named all of your tabs right-click it
and there is an option here that says
open all bookmarks so if we click on
open all bookmarks then if you have
enough tabs if it's only a few it's not
going to ask you this but if you've had
a lot of tabs open
I'll say are you sure that you want to
open up all these because it might take
some time to load so just click yes and
there you can see that all of the tabs
that we had open are now loading up and
we can close down our new tab there and
then you can see that we have all of our
tabs available that we saved so now once
you're done reading through those tabs
or whatever if you don't want to clutter
up your saved folder here that you
created then it's just as easy as
right-clicking on that folder that has
all the tabs that you saved then you can
just click delete and it gets rid of it
so that's the quickest and easiest
solution that I've found to whenever I'm
in this situation and I want to save a
lot of times you know I used to go
through and bookmark tabs individually
but this is a lot faster and it's a lot
easier and also you can get rid of them
just as easy so I hope you guys found
that video useful be sure to subscribe
