video we're going to be going over how
to sort in Python so we're going to look
at how we can sort a few different data
types so we're going to go over sorting
lists and tuples you can also run sword
on dictionaries and you can also sort
objects by a custom criteria but to get
started let's go ahead and look at a
couple ways in which we can just sort a
simple list of integers so I have this
list here called Li and it contains a
bunch of random numbers between 1 and 9
so if we wanted to sort this how would
we do it I'm going to make a new
variable here called s underscore Li and
I'm going to set it equal to and I'm
going to run this sorted function and
I'm going to pass in our original list
to this sorted function so I'm going to
save that and then I'm going to go ahead
and print this out to the screen so I'm
going to uncomment out this print
statement here and print out this s
underscore Li variable now if I run this
you can see here that it did sort this
list for us in ascending order so we
have 1 through 9 here now let me go
ahead and print out my original variable
as well so I'm going to print out this
Li list and if I print this out now you
can see down here that my sorted
variable is a sorted version of that
list but my original is still the
jumbled unsorted group of numbers now
what if I wanted to sort that original
list of numbers without creating a new
variable well there I can use the sort
method on the list so I can say Li dot
sort and then just close off those
parentheses and if I run that now you
can see that we have our sorted variable
here that is a sorted version of that
and also when I ran this Li dot sort it
also sorted the original list of
integers also now one difference between
this sorted function here and this sort
method is that the sorted function
returns a new sorted list so that's why
we can set it to a variable but the
sorted method just source the list in
place and then returns none
so this can be important because
sometimes people get this confused and
they'll try to so for example if I was
to copy this and I was to try to set
this s underscore Li to this Li dot sort
if I was to do that and then run this
you can see that instead of getting this
sorted list we just get this nun
value here so if you use the sort method
then don't expect a list to be returned
because it's just going to go ahead and
do that in place okay so now we've seen
how we can sort these lists and
ascending order but what if I wanted
these to be in descending order from
highest to lowest well to do that we can
just do pass in this reverse equals true
and if I save that and run it now you
can see that our new variable here is
sorted in descending order and we can
also use this exact same parameter with
the sort method so if I pass that in the
sort method then it does the original
variable in place and descending order
also okay so why would I want to choose
the sort function or the sorted function
over the sort method well that sort
method on the list is is fine if you are
working with lists and if you want to
modify it in place but the sorted
function gives us a little bit more
flexibility because we can pass in any
iterable as opposed to the sort method
which works specifically on lists so for
example here I have a tuple that has all
the same values that we had in our list
of integers and the tuple doesn't have a
sort method so if I do a dot sort and
run that then we get an error so what we
have to do here is we have to use the
sort function so I'm going to do a new
variable and do a sorted I'm going to
take off this method here since it
doesn't have one and I'm going to save
that and then I'm going to print out the
new variable that we just created here
so if I print this out save it and run
it now you can see that our s underscore
tub variable is a list of the values and
our tuple that are now sorted so for
another example here I have
of a dictionary and you can pass a
dictionary into sorted also so I'm going
to do an s underscore the I equals
sorted and pass in my dictionary there
and then I'm going to go ahead and just
print this out to the screen I'm going
to comment these out now what sorted
will do by default with this dictionary
is it's just going to sort the keys so
if I run this here then you can see that
it returned a list with the sorted keys
here so you can use either method of
sorting that you like you can use either
the sorted function or the sort method
as long as you understand the
differences but for the rest of this
video I'm going to use this sorted
function because I'm going to be working
with examples other than lists so the
sorted function is what you need for
that so so far we've sorted integers in
ascending and descending order but what
if we want to distort values based on a
different criteria so for example what
if I had a list of integers here and I
wanted to sort these based on their
absolute value so you can see I have
some negative values here now if I was
just to print out this list right now
and run this actually let me go ahead
and sort this list and I'll show you
what the default sort is for these
negative values so I'm going to do
sorted and pass in this original list
and then I'm going to print out this s
underscore Li variable and if I run this
you can see that we got the exact same
thing that it's in right now because
these negative values are considered
less than the positive values like you'd
expect so we have negative 6 negative 5
negative 4 1 2 3 okay so like I was
saying what if I wanted to sort this
based on the absolute value of these
values so it should be 1 2 3 4 5 6 so to
do this we can use a key parameter so
when I with are sorted here I'm going to
pass in a key parameter and I'm going to
say that the key equals ABS which we'll
use the absolute value function now what
this does is it runs each
element through this absolute value
function before it makes the comparison
so now if I run it with this key in
place now you can see that my sorted
variable is 1 2 3 negative 4 negative 5
negative 6
now the key parameter is extremely
useful when you're sorting objects with
named attributes so for example here I
have this very simple class called
employee and within the employee here we
just have a name and age and a salary
and this re PR method here all it does
is it tells Python how we want this
function represented when it's printed
out to the screen so now I have these
three sample employees here that I've
created with random names ages and
salaries and I'm going to put all three
of these employees into a list called
employees and now I'm going to try to
sort these based on a specific attribute
so if I try to sort these without a key
then it's not really going to know how
to sort them so let me go ahead and try
to sort them and print this out to the
screen and you can see I get this type
error here and it says inaudible uh nor
durable types employee can't compare
employee to employee so it's getting
this employee object here from this list
and it's saying hey I don't know how you
want me to sort these so we need to use
a key to sort these on and I'm going to
write a custom function in order to sort
these so remember our key takes a
function that takes each element of our
list and returns what we want to sort on
so with the absolute value example that
I used earlier I was able to use a
built-in function for the key but for
this example we need to write a custom
function so the function I'm going to
write is a very simple one it's just
going to be F and let's say I'll do this
e underscore sort and I'll pass in an
employee and then I will just return and
we'll a sort based on the employees name
so I'll do EMP name so now where I ran
this sorted function I can pass in this
key and I'm just going to pass in I'm
going to tell it to do
the key as this sort function here so
now if I run this then you can see that
it returns all of our employees based on
their name now if I wanted to sort these
based on the employees age then it would
be as easy as coming up to the sort
function here and instead of returning
the employee name I want to return the
employee age and if I run that now you
can see that it's the employee age in
ascending order and lastly if I wanted
to do this based on salary then I could
go ahead and make this salary and save
that and run it and you can see that it
sorts it by the salary and ascending
order now you can also still pass in
your other parameters here too so if I
did a reverse equals true and then ran
this then it would sort in the
descending order based on our key which
is salary so now we have all the
salaries in descending order
now if you have a complicated sort
function then it's probably best to
break out these functions into separate
functions like this but for those of you
who are familiar with lambda functions
then you probably noticed that something
this short would be easy to turn into a
lambda function so instead of setting
this key equal to this Y dot sort I
really could just do a lambda here of e
now I'm not going to go into lambdas if
you haven't seen these before then don't
worry about it it's just a way to
quickly write an anonymous function so
if I wanted to sort on the Aged I'll do
or the name I'll do a dot name I'm going
to go ahead and take out reverse here
and save that and run it and now you can
see that it is sorted by the employee's
name and ascending order and since we're
using this lambda function here this our
sort function up here that we used
before isn't actually doing anything so
I could still run that without this the
underscore sort function now I should
also mention that if you're working with
attributes like this that you can import
a function that specifically does this
so I'm just going to do my import from
down here so if I import the operator
module and do a from operator import it
is called adder get er this is it right
here
now what we can do with this is we can
just use this
as a replacement for our key so I'm
going to take this lambda out here so
I'm going to do an ad or Gitter and the
attribute that I want I say I'll just do
I'll do this as age so if I save that
and run it now you can see that it's
sorted based on the age so you might
wonder why I just didn't show you that
ad or get er right away instead of first
showing you how to do these functions
and the lambdas and things like that but
knowing how to sort with these custom
functions it'll allow you to be a little
bit more flexible down the road when you
want to sort more complicated items so I
think that about does it for this video
I hope it gives you some good ideas for
how you can sort your list and objects
and any way that you'd like but if you
