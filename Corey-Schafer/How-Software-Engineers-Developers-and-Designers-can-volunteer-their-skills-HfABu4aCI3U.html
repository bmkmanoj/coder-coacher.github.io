is going to be a little different from
the tutorial videos that I usually do in
this video I wanted to talk about
volunteering and ways for software
engineers computer programmers web
developers and web designers to give
back to their community there's a great
line from the book Tuesdays with Maurey
when the main character was talking
about giving back to your community and
he talks about not just giving back with
money by giving back with your skillset
and here's the line from that book he
says I don't mean money I mean your time
it's not so hard there's a Senior Center
that opened their here dozens of elderly
people come there every day if you're a
young man or a young woman and you have
a skill you're asked to come and teach
it say you know computers you come there
and you teach computers you're very
welcome there and they are very grateful
this is how you start to get respect by
offering something that you have now I
couldn't agree with this more you know
it's a win-win situation too because
when you share a skill that you have not
only are you helping other people but it
also helps you hone your own skills so
this got me thinking what are some
different ways in which software
engineers and programmers and developers
and designers what are some ways that
they can volunteer their skills and give
back to the community and you know
overall have a positive impact on the
world well first of all you could take
the advice directly from the book you
could volunteer at a Senior Center or
you could volunteer at an assisted
living home I took this approach a few
years ago I volunteered an assisting
living assisted living home for one
night a week for two or three hours
depending on the number of people who
needed help
now I'm not mentioning this for a pat on
the back or anything like that I'm only
telling you this because there's this
misconception out there that elderly
people aren't interested in technology
and from doing this I know firsthand
that that's just not true they want to
be connected just as much as anybody
else does and but sometimes they simply
don't have the means or have the
knowledge to get things up and running
themselves and not only that but perhaps
maybe the staff or other volunteers
there might not have that ability to
help them out either
so you know on a typical night of this
type of volunteering you might help
someone do something as simple as
setting up a free Google email account
so that they can start emailing their
family receiving pictures of their
grandchildren and when they do start
receiving those family pictures and
staying in closer contact with the
family it really does make their day now
the great thing about this type of
volunteer work is that you don't have to
be a software engineer or an expert
programmer to help with these kind of
issues the things that you would do in a
situation like that are very simple
tasks so you know there's young kids out
there who can get in there and set up
email accounts and do basic computer
troubleshooting like you know connecting
computers to the Internet and things
like that now if you're looking for
something that involves a more in-depth
skill set then maybe you want to look
into making a website for a local
business free of charge so perhaps
there's a local farmers market or a pet
shelter you know it's easy to get the
impression that every business in in
your city has a website already but
there's a lot of businesses out there
that don't especially the local
businesses also I see a lot of
developers and designers online that are
always asking for advice and trying to
come up with different projects that
they can use to build up their portfolio
so if you're wanting to learn how to
build a website or get into something
like WordPress development maybe you can
build up your portfolio and help someone
out at the same time so if you have a
favorite local business in town that
doesn't have a website or has a bad
website then this could be a great
project to take on one thing that might
be considerate though is that if you do
decide to do this and it's one of your
first websites it's you put that one of
your first websites that you've ever
made you might want to be sure to let
the people know that if your website
might not be top quality but most likely
if these people don't have a website
already or if they have a really bad
website then they're gonna enjoy
whatever additional exposure that you
can provide them anyways even if that's
just a quick and easy website that
displays you know their business address
business hours contact information if
it's a restaurant maybe their menu and
things like
that now something else that you might
want to look into is becoming a tutor
there's always opportunities to tutor
people at just about any age that you're
comfortable with and you know as
engineers and programmers most of you
have a lot of training and math and
problem solving and coding and among
other things so to check out what
tutoring opportunities are available in
your area I would just recommend getting
online and doing a quick google search
and if that doesn't turn anything up you
can usually ask people at your local
public library if they have anything
like that available I don't know if
that's the norm or not but personally
every town that I've ever lived in has
had tutoring opportunities through their
public libraries so if that's something
that interests you then I would
definitely check that out
and speaking of tutoring I would
definitely check with the maybe the
schools in your area and see if there's
a youth FIRST Robotics program first
stands for for inspiration and
recognition of Science and Technology
that's a terrific program it gets kids
of all different ages involved in
science and technology if you check the
FIRST Robotics volunteer website that
I'm at now this is us first org slash
community slash volunteers you can find
pretty much any information that you
would need how to get involved what to
expect as a volunteer volunteer training
and how to become a mentor and a coach
also if you look down here at the bottom
it says that they have close to 27,000
teams worldwide so most likely you're
going to be able to find a program like
this in your area now if you are a
female than one organization that you
might want to look into getting involved
with is called girls who code so
software and programming and coding is
an industry that unfortunately has been
pretty male-dominated throughout the
years and girls who code from what I
hear is is a great organization that's
getting more females interested in the
field of computer science if you go to
their website here
they have this tab that is get involved
so if you click on that then you can see
that they have a volunteering section
here and if you look down through the
volunteering opportunities here they've
got a few listed as well as becoming an
instructor at a girls who club or a
girls who code club so that would be a
great one to check out now everything
that I've mentioned so far has involved
personal interaction in order to
volunteer but if tutoring or helping in
person isn't something that you're
comfortable with then perhaps you could
you know you could always try answering
people's questions online at websites
like Stack Overflow or reddit or some
other online forums no I'm sure this
wouldn't be considered official public
service and any court of law or anything
like that but I personally consider it a
form of volunteering for sure you know
and this is also something that I've
been wanting to do more of myself and
for any of those people who answer
questions on these sites who might be
watching this video I would just like to
give a big thank you because you know at
this point I definitely receive a much
larger benefit from these sites than the
amount that I contribute to them you
know some people put in a ton of time
answering questions on these sites some
of these detailed answers could be
entire articles themselves and the
people will answer those questions they
don't get anything from the time that
they put in other than a thank you and
maybe some reputation points or
something like that there isn't that a
bonus to being active in these
communities you know it's something that
you can point a potential future
employer to you can point them to the
answers that you've given on these
websites and prove how well that you
know your stuff and you know there's no
absolutely nothing wrong with putting
your volunteer efforts on a resume or
anything like that now somewhat similar
to answering questions online you can
also start your own blog or your own
YouTube channel and start writing and
making videos about problems that you've
run into and how you solve them you can
share your knowledge that way now this
is kind of
because if there was one thing on the
list of things that I'm gonna show you
in this video that I don't necessarily
consider volunteer work it would be your
own blog or your own YouTube channel
because you can always put ads on your
blog articles and on your videos and if
those become popular enough then you'll
get a little bit of money kicked back
your way for that but I would still
recommend that people do this if they
can and if they have the time to do it
because not only will it help you learn
more about the topics that you write
about but you never know how many people
will run into those exact same problems
that you have and then find your
solution online now another thing that
you can do is contribute to open source
projects there's a lot of open source
projects out there that help people in
need I would recommend checking out
github 'z showcases page here and see if
there's something there that interest
you
you can see here that they have this
made in Africa section if you click on
here
you'll most likely be able to find some
great projects to work on and you're
gonna see a common theme with some of
these projects you have interactive
messaging messaging engine SMS gateway
pretty much keeping people ways of
connecting people which is extremely
important to get people connected so
that's one option
if we go back here to the showcases page
if you scroll down you also see this
government app section and within this
government app section you're gonna see
projects for NASA Code for America which
is a great organization
you also see National Park Service may
be making mapping libraries for the
National Park Service so a lot of
projects that you could contribute to
here now something else that you might
want to check out is the Mozilla
volunteer page now I've personally never
volunteered through this site so I have
no first-hand experience with it I just
saw that it was recommended online as a
way for tech people to volunteer but if
you look down here it's pretty much
exactly what we've been talking about
you can see here it says it's about
learning collaborating and sharing your
skills with a global community
coders organizers activists and things
like that and you can see that if you
click here that they say that you can
volunteer as much as you like or as
little as you like it's totally up to
you and if you click on get involved it
takes you to a page where you can be
matched up with your skillset and with
your interests that are most suitable
for you so I think that this looks
pretty neat and maybe it's something
that I'm gonna give a try in the future
and if it's something that looks
interesting to you then you should
definitely give it a shot now one of the
last things I want to talk to you about
is that if you want to be involved but
you just don't have the time to do it
then there are ways that pretty much
require very little to zero effort you
know as software engineers and
programmers a lot of us are very
fortunate to work for great companies
that pay well and that sometimes allows
us to earn more money than we need for
our personal needs so if that includes
you then I would try to find a charity
that is involved with causes that are
close to your heart and commit the
donating portions of your salary to
those charities on top of your donations
a lot of tech companies like Google and
Apple and Microsoft will match donations
made by their employees so if you're
somebody who's currently already
donating to charities definitely check
with your employer and see if they offer
a match because you could potentially be
doubling those donations and you should
definitely take advantage of that if
they offer that and there's one last
thing that I wanted to talk about before
wrapping this up and this goes for
anyone not just people in the tech
industry so it's great to get excited
about volunteering and doing good things
in the world but try not to overdo
yourself you're gonna have the greatest
impact when this becomes part of your
routine and part of your daily life you
don't want this just to be a one-time
thing so if you overexert yourself or if
you put in more time than what you have
available or if what you're doing
becomes more of a chore than something
that fulfills you then you're less
likely to keep it up and you're less
likely to try it again in the future so
I would just recommend
starting slow finding your comfort zone
and I can promise you that it's
something that you'll enjoy once you get
started so that about does it for this
video you know there's tons of ways to
get involved out there if I missed
anything which I'm sure that I did then
you know just put your suggestions for
getting involved in the comments section
below so I hope this video is useful for
everybody and thank you all for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
