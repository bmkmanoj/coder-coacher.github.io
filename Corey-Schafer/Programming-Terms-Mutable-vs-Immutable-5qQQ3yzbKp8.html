going to be another programming terms
video and in this video we're going to
look at the terms mutable and immutable
so if we look at the definition on
Wikipedia it says that an immutable
object is an object whose state cannot
be modified after it is created this is
in contrast to a mutable object which
can be modified after it's created so
let's go ahead and look at an example of
this and why you need to know these two
terms now I'm going to be using Python
in these examples but like most of my
programming term videos don't get caught
up in the language I'm using because
these terms apply to a variety of
programming languages so first we're
going to take a look at an example of
something that is immutable and in
Python a string is immutable so right
here you can see that we're setting a
equal to the string quarry and if I
print out a you can see that I get
quarry right there
now immutable doesn't mean that I can't
assign this variable again you can see
down here I could change this to John if
I run this code you can see that a was
equal to quarry now a is equal to John
but you know I said that a was immutable
that strings were immutable so what's
going on here so what's going on is that
it's not actually modifying this string
object it's creating a new string object
now to kind of see this in more detail
Python has this ID function which prints
out the memory address so if I save that
and now I run this if I run through this
code you can see that up here I said
that a is equal to Cori I printed out a
then I printed out the memory address
then I changed it down here and print it
out a again and then printed out the
memory address again so you can see
whenever I changed a here since a string
is immutable it created a new string
object so you can see here that these
memory addresses don't match so really
to show you that strings are immutable
let's try to change one single character
of a so let's say that I want to
capitalize Cory so if I said a and the
index of zero which would be the C what
if I tried to set this to an uppercase C
so let's save that then I'll put back in
here print a so it's saved that and
let's try to run it now you can see here
that we get a type error and it says
that string object does not support item
assignment that's because this is
immutable we can't change this string
object so what's an example of a an
object that is mutable well in Python a
list is mutable so if I make a list here
and let's just do one two three four
five and then let's comment this out
down here for now and let's run this you
can see that it printed out our list and
now if we wanted to change the first
value in our list let's set it to six
and we print this out then you can see
that it printed out both of the lists
and the memory address is the same so it
changed that value in place that's what
it means to be mutable okay so why is it
important to notice why is it important
to know the difference between a mutable
and an immutable object well aside from
just avoiding errors there's also
problems with memory as well so some
things can seem harmless which really
end up being really bad in performance
so for example I have this file over
here called concat and what this does is
it has a list of employees here and then
it loops through and this is some sample
HTML output so let's look at what we're
doing in our code here we have this
output which is a string equal to this
opening list here and
then we are looping through our list of
fake employees here and the same output
variable we are concatenated these lists
with these employees added onto the end
and like I said before don't get caught
up in the Python syntax just going over
these terms here so then at the very end
after we loop through all the employees
and concatenate these strings together
then we add on the closing list and if I
print this out you can see that it went
through and created some fake HTML here
with a list and halfs our list of
employees so what's wrong with doing
something like this because it looks fun
and it is fine if you have such a small
list here but this is just an example
but you know in in production code you
may have thousands of strings that your
concatenated and that's whenever it
becomes an issue so if I uncomment out
this line here where I print out the
address of output within this for loop
then you can see if I print that out
then the address every time it goes
through and it adds a new employee to
the output then it's creating a new
string object so imagine that I had
thousands of these then it would be
creating thousands of different objects
in memory so you can see all these are
all different so it's good to keep those
the differences between mutable and
immutable objects in mind whenever
you're thinking about performance also
and like I said you'll see this in under
other languages also so for example in
Java you have a string class which is
immutable and then you have something I
think it's called string buffer which is
mutable and it's used for the same thing
so whenever you're doing large amounts
of concatenation and things like that in
Java you would want to use a string
buffer instead of a string because it
doesn't take that performance hit
whenever of creating thousands and
thousands of new string object
and memory so hopefully after watching
this video you have a better idea of
what mutable and immutable means and
also some of the things that you need to
watch out for once you do understand
those differences but if you do have any
questions just ask in the comment
