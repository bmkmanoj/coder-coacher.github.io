this video we're going to be learning
how to install Ubuntu Linux on
VirtualBox so I plan on doing more Linux
tutorials in the near future so if you'd
like to have a fresh install to follow
along or if you just like to give Linux
a try then this will be a good starting
point so first we'll need to download
and install VirtualBox so this is pretty
straightforward so I'm not gonna go into
too much detail here but if you just do
a quick search on google for a
VirtualBox and it should take you to the
downloads page and that's here at
virtualbox.org now from here you can
choose your operating system and walk
through the installation so for example
I'm on a Mac so I would choose the OS X
installation here so I already have
VirtualBox installed so I'm not going to
walk through that but it's just a very
simple step-by-step process that you
click through just like installing any
other software so after you get that
installed then if you open it up then it
should look like this here so now that
we have VirtualBox installed we're gonna
need to download the ubuntu linux iso
file so this will allow us to install
the operating system so do a quick
google search for a boon tube and it
should take you to their home page that
looks something like this so once you go
here then you can go to the downloads
page and the boon to desktop should be
the first option here so if we go ahead
and choose the desktop now you can see
here it has a couple of recommended
system requirements and we can just go
over here and click download now this is
free open-source software but it will
take you to a donation page so you can
donate if you'd like to but if you just
like to download the ISO file then you
can go to not now and take me to the
download now your download here should
start automatically now you can see that
this is a pretty large file so here this
is nearly one and a half gigs so I'm
gonna go ahead and fast forward this
video to when it's finished downloading
ok so once we have that downloaded now
let's go ahead and minimize Chrome here
and pull up VirtualBox so now we're
ready to create a new virtual machine so
let's go ahead and choose new now for
the name here let's just go ahead and
call this a boon to Linux and for the
type it's just going to be Linux
it's Auto selected Ubuntu 64-bit for the
version so let's go ahead and keep that
and continue now we're not going to go
into too much detail with some of these
setup options basically we're just
saying how much memory and disk space we
want allocated to our virtual machine
and this depends on your computer but
you're usually safe staying within the
green sections here so from my memory
I'm going to go ahead and choose 4096
megabytes which is 4 gigabytes and for
the hard disk here I'm gonna leave that
default and I'm gonna leave the
VirtualBox disk image as the default
there I'm going to leave that as
dynamically allocated now for the hard
disk size I'm actually going to bump
this up to 25 Giga bytes here because
that's what a boon to recommends on
their downloads page now you can
probably get by with allocating less but
I'm going to go ahead and do the 25 so
now we have that machine created but
there's one more setting that I'm going
to change before we install Ubuntu so if
we select our machine and go to settings
then we can see that we can change some
of the values that we just set but there
are also a lot of other customizations
that we can make within here so one
change I'm going to make is I'm going to
go to the display tab and the video
memory I'm going to go ahead and bump
this up to the max and that's just going
to improve our performance when we start
the virtual machine so I'm going to go
ahead and save that okay so now we're
ready to install it boom - so we install
this using the ISO file that we
downloaded earlier so to do this we can
select our ISO by going down here to
storage and clicking on this empty
optical drive and then go to choose disk
image and then we just navigate to where
we downloaded that ISO file and select
that ISO file and click open so now you
can see that it has that ISO file
attached so now we can just go ahead and
start this virtual machine to install
boon to
okay so the actual installation here is
a pretty straightforward process but
we'll go ahead and walk through this
really quickly so now we can just go
here to install Ubuntu now this is
optional here I usually choose to
download the updates while it's
installing so I don't don't have to do
it later but for the sake of time here
I'm just going to go ahead and leave
this unchecked but it's up to you
whether you want to download those
updates now so now since this is a fresh
installation we can just leave this
erase disk and install and go to Install
Now and then here we can just choose
continue and then here you can just go
ahead and choose your timezone and then
continue and I'll just keep walking
through here and now it'll bring up to
where we can type in our name and choose
a name for our computer if we would like
and also a password and you need to
remember this password because it's
going to be what you use to log in
whenever we restart the machine so let's
go ahead and continue there and now this
will install the operating system so I'm
gonna go ahead and let this install and
fast-forward until that's complete okay
so once that installation is complete
then I'll come up here and ask you to
restart so let's go ahead and do that
now at this point you may run into this
problem where it freezes and it gives
you this warning and I have to be honest
I didn't really understand this warning
until I did a little research online but
basically it's a harmless warning and we
can just manually exit out of here to
power down the machine so if we were to
start that machine back up then it
should just be good to go but if you do
want to suppress that warning then I did
see a few people say that you could come
in here to settings and then you can go
to system and acceleration and you can
turn off this enabled nested paging but
it's never really been an issue for me
so I'm going to go ahead and leave that
checked and just start back up my
machine here okay so once we start our
machine back up then everything should
be installed and we should see a login
screen here so now we can just sign in
with the password that we specified
during the installation
okay so now
having a boom to desktop ready to go but
we're not quite done yet one thing
you're gonna want to do is install guest
additions software so guest additions
software will fix the display settings
that so that you can use the Linux in
full screen and it'll also allow you to
share directories between your host
computer and the VM and it'll also allow
you to share your clipboard which means
you'll be able to copy and paste back
and forth between your host computer and
your VM so for example right now this is
full screen and you can see that it
doesn't take up much of the screen and
that we have a lot of wasted space here
on the sides and guest additions will
fix this now there's a couple of
different ways that you can do this but
one of the simplest ways is just to come
up here to devices and then you can
choose insert guest additions CD image
so this will pop up here and ask us if
we want to run the software and we go
ahead and do that and then we will have
to put in our password and once that's
done it will ask us to go ahead and
restart so to restart we can just up
here in the top right we can choose
shutdown and when we choose shutdown we
can go to restart ok so once that's done
you can see that now we're in
full-screen and that the VM uses all the
space that it didn't before so now we
can just go ahead and log back in here
ok so now you should be good to go so
you have a working fresh installation of
Ubuntu and if you ever want to follow
along with any of my command line
tutorials then you can just come up here
and search for the terminal and run that
and you can just come in here and start
playing around with any of these
commands ok so I think that's going to
do it for this video for people who are
new to using VirtualBox one of the first
things that they usually want to know is
how to do simple things like getting
guest additions software installed if it
isn't already and we've already done
that on this machine they also would
like to know how to copy and paste back
and forth between the host and virtual
machine and also how to share folders
between the host and virtual machine and
I'm putting together a quick video
covering how to do all of that if it's
something that you want to
learn and I'll put a link to that video
in the description section below once I
get it released if you do have any
questions and feel free to ask in the
comment section below and I'll do my
best to answer those if you enjoy these
tutorials and would like to support them
then there are several ways you can do
that the easiest way is to simply like
the video and give it a thumbs up also
it's a huge help to share these videos
with others who you think would find
them useful and if you have the means
you can contribute to the channel
through patreon and there's a link to
