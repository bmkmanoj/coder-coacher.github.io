video we're gonna take a look at how to
quickly and easily spin up a local web
server so if you're working on a website
and you want to open that up in the
browser sometimes it can be a pain to
download programs like map or to do an
entire set up of Apache or something
like that it's kind of overkill if you
just want to quickly glance at it
I think the quickest and easiest way to
do this is with pythons built in simple
HTTP server now you will have to have
Python installed but if you're on a Mac
then that's gonna already be installed
for you so let's take a look at how to
do this first of all you want to open up
your terminal so I have two terminal
windows open up here and then you want
to navigate to where your website is so
for example I have a website here in the
site's directory and then demos and then
test site and if I look at the contents
of this folder then the file that I want
to take a look at is actually in this
disk folder here so I'm going to CD into
that directory and now if I do an LS in
that folder then you can see here where
we have the index.html file now to spin
up a quick local web server and to view
this file in the browser all you have to
do is type in Python - M simple HTTP
server and then you want to type in by
default it's going to be port 8000 but I
always type it in just to be sure so you
type in the port number there so hit
enter and you can see here in this
terminal window it says serving HTTP on
port 8000 so now if I go over here into
my browser and type in localhost and
then go to port 8000 and hit enter now
you can see it opens up that test
website within the browser so our local
web server is running if you come over
here into the terminal then you can see
that it actually gives you some
information - about what the web server
is doing so you can see here that a get
request on the route gave a 200 response
and then you can see where it goes and
requests the different CSS files and
JavaScript files and things like that
now you can minimize this terminal
window here but be sure to keep it open
because that is what's running your
webserver so you don't want to close
that down or else it'll close the web
server down now the thing I like about
this method is that it's so easy to spin
up another server on
and listen on another port so for
example if I go to this other demo that
I have called sample map if I CD into
that directory and then LS you can see I
have my index.html file here and so this
other web server is still running here
in the background so I could do Python -
M HTTP HTTP server and I can do this on
whatever port I want I'll just pick a
random port at44 hit enter there so now
you can see that it's serving on port 80
44 so if I go up here and go to
localhost port 80 44 hit enter and now
that website has is now running in the
browser on that local web server
listening on that port and now if you
want to close down these web servers all
you got to do is either close out of the
terminal window or within the terminal
window you can also hit control C you
can see that it'll send a keyboard
interrupt there and now if I try to
reload that page then that server is no
longer running and if I do it up here as
well and try to reload this page and you
can see that it's no longer listening on
that port so you can see how a method
like this is a lot faster than
downloading a program like map or trying
to set up a patchy or something like
that just to quickly look at your
website within the browser so that about
does it for this video hopefully you
guys found this quick tip useful
