this video we'll be going over the
basics of logging and Python now there's
a lot that we can do with logging in
Python so I'm actually going to break
these up into two separate videos now in
this video we're going to look at how to
get started with logging by replacing
our print statements with log statements
we're also going to set different
logging levels and also log information
to files now in the next video we'll
look at how we can use loggers
throughout multiple modules and how we
can configure the levels so that
different information gets sent exactly
where we want it to go okay so first of
all if you're not using logs right now
then you should definitely start trying
to work it into your code where ever it
would be useful python comes with a
logging module built in so there's no
need to install anything extra a lot of
people put off learning good logging
habits because it's easier to sometimes
just put in print statements and catch
your problems on the fly and there's
nothing really wrong with that I mean
print functions do have their place for
sure but logging is definitely something
that you'll need to have in place once
your application grows beyond a basic
project having good logs in place is
going to allow you to you know look at
behavior and errors over time and give
us a better overall picture of exactly
what's going on and you can also pipe it
into some visualization software to get
a better perspective okay so with that
said let's go ahead and get started so I
have a file here with some very super
simple functions and these aren't really
useful for anything but I wanted to
start off with something easy so that we
can focus on logging instead of what the
code is doing so I have four simple
functions here just add subtract
multiply and divide and down here at the
bottom I'm using two number variables
and these are set to ten and five for
now and then I'm running through each of
these functions and then I have some
print statements here that are commented
out okay so if I just run this code as
is then it runs successfully with no
errors but we don't really know if it
did everything correctly
so in order to print something out to
the screen here let's uncomment out all
of these print statements and let's go
ahead and rerun that so after we reran
that code we can see that the values
that we print it out all showed up in
our console down here and everything
looks correct now this is probably how a
lot of us check our work
as we go but instead of using print
statements let's look at adding some
very basic logging into this script now
first of all we're going to have to
import this and logging is a built-in
module so all we have to do is just do
import logging and you don't need to
install anything to get that to work
okay so before we log anything out let's
talk about logging levels now logging
levels allow us to specify exactly what
we want to log by separating these into
categories now there are five standard
logging levels and these are debug info
warning error and critical and I have
these pulled up in my snippets here so
that we can see a description of each of
these and I'm just going to copy and
paste this into our file here and I just
grabbed this description directly from
the Python documentation so we can see
here that debug says that this is
detailed information typically of
interest only when diagnosing problems
info is confirmation that things are
working correctly or working as expected
warning is an indication that something
unexpected happen or is indicative of
some problem maybe below this space and
the software is still working as
expected then we get down here to our
errors and due to a more serious problem
the software has not been able to
perform a function and then critical is
a serious error indicating that the
program itself may be unable to continue
running so I'm just going to leave these
commented here as we're walking through
this video so that we can have that as a
visual guide now the default level for
logging is set to warning and what that
means is that it will capture everything
that is a warning or above so by default
it will log learning err and critical
and that means that it's going to ignore
debug and info log statements so for
example down here at the bottom where we
have these print statements let's say
that we wanted to turn these into debug
logging statements so I could just say
instead of print here I'm just going to
say logging dot debug and save that now
the default behavior for these logging
statements is just to log these to the
console so right now it's very similar
to our print statement functionality so
now if I run this
you can see that it doesn't log anything
to our console and that's because the
default logging level is warning and
it's only going to log out warnings and
higher so it's not going to log these
debug and info statements so instead we
need to change so first of all let's
just say that if we change the debugs
here to warning instead and run that now
you can see that we get some output to
our console now this has a little more
information than our print function so
this tells us our logging level which is
set to warning it also has this root
here now don't worry about that root
right now and what that means we're
going to look at that in our next
logging video and now we have the
message that we passed into our logs
here okay so we've logged out some lines
to the console but we're not really
using logging correctly right now
because we have these set as warnings
and they're not really warnings we
really wanted to log these lines as
either debug or info so we need to
change our logging level to log those
debug and info statements out so do this
let's go up to the top of our file and
we're going to change some basic
configurations here and I'll just do
this below our comments and we can
change these basic configurations with
the basic config method so I'm going to
say logging dot basic config now this is
camelcase
and now to change that level we're going
to say level is equal to logging dot
debug now when you said that logging
level realize that this debug here is in
all caps now that's different than our
logging dot debug method which we used
earlier this logging dot debug is all
caps and it's just a constant that's
actually an integer in the background
and if I remember correctly I think that
all these constants are increments of 10
so I think debug is actually just 10
infos 20 warnings 30 years 40 criticals
50 and so on so now that we have our
logging level set the debug here now
let's change all of our warnings back to
debug
so I'm going to go down here where we
did logging dot warning and instead I'm
going to say logging dot debug and now
let's go ahead and rerun this okay so
now we can see that it's printing our
debug statements they're in the console
now sir this is good so far now you may
have come to this video expecting to see
actual log files and not just printing
information to the console and log files
are a great way to capture information
because it allows us to see our log
information over time in one place so
instead of logging this information to
the console let's instead create a log
file now to do this it's just as easy as
specifying a file and our basic config
method so the keyword that we're going
to use here is file name and set that
equal to whatever we want our log file
to be and I'm just going to call this
test log for now and we also need a
comma there to separate those key words
okay so now let me rerun this again now
nothing showed up down here in our
console now I'm not sure if you can see
my file system very well up here but
this new file appeared test dot log and
I'm going to go ahead and open this up
and you can see that it logged all of
the information from our script so now
if I go back to my script and I change
these numbers so instead of 10 and 5 I'm
just going to use 20 and 10 and now if I
rerun this and then open back up this
test dot log now you can see that it has
our previous values that ran and the the
latest run here so now we're going to be
able to see our logged information over
time and over multiple runs ok so one
more thing that I want to show you in
this basic logging video is how to
change the format and what I mean by the
format is if we look back at our log
file here you can see that it has the
log level and the logger which we said
that we weren't going to cover in this
video we'll cover that in the next video
and then it has the message here now to
change the format and our log we need to
add in some special values to our basic
config now to view what is available to
us I have the options pulled up here
over here in my browser now these
special format codes right here are what
is going to allow us to change our
format and you can see a description of
each of these so we have the human
readable time we have the file name the
level name the line numbers the messages
and things like that so let's say that
we wanted to change our logging format
to be the
and the level name and then the message
so I'm just going to go ahead and copy
each of these so first I'll go ahead and
grab the time here and copy that and now
to set this formatting I'm going to go
back to my sample file back up here to
the top and then my basic configuration
I'm just going to add in another keyword
and that next keyword is format and I'm
going to set this equal to I'm just
going to paste this in what we copied
over for the time and then I'm going to
separate that with a colon there and now
I'll go back over and grab the level
name so we want the level name format
I'll copy that and paste that in
separate that with a colon and now we
also want a message so I'll grab the
message and go over and paste that in so
now if I save this and I run that and
now I go back to my log file now you can
see that the format down here with our
latest run the format of our logs has
changed and now we have the time and
this comma here is just dealing with
millisecond data and then we have the
log level which is debug and then we
have our message that we burn it out
okay so now let's take a look at another
module and add some logging to it real
quick just so that we can walk over all
this one more time
a little bit more quickly so the module
that I have here is one that I pulled
from my object-oriented tutorial series
now if you don't know how classes work
or exactly what this code is doing and
don't worry about it too much we're just
going to use this as an example to add
some logging so just a quick overview of
what's going on I have this really small
employee class here and when we create
an employee it comes in here and sets
the first name and the last name on the
instance and then we're printing out
that we created an employee and then
down here at the bottom we're actually
creating two instances of two new
employees so with this print statement
in here it should tell us when these two
instances are created so I'm going to go
ahead and run this code and you can see
that it tells us that our two instances
were created and we have our print
message there okay so now let's go ahead
and add some logging let's say that we
wanted to see you know what employees
were created over time so we're going to
go through the same process that we
and the other module except we're just
going to go a little faster here so
we'll go ahead and import logging and
then we'll set up our basic
configuration I could copy this over
from the other file we'll just go ahead
and type this in real quick so I'll say
logging basic config and then within
here we'll do a file name and we'll set
that file name equal to employee log now
that's the log file that we're going to
log to now for our level here remember
that the default is set to warning let's
say let's set this equal to info I think
that the our employee creation would be
a good info log level and lastly now
let's go ahead and set the format for
our logs so to do this let's do format
equals and within this string now this
one I am going to grab from the other
example since these formatting codes can
be a little confusing now I'm just going
to go ahead and grab the level name and
the message here so I'll copy that and
just paste that in there now remember if
you want to see everything that is
available to you here then they do have
this in the Python documentation it is
up here in the Python 3 logging library
documentation down here at log record
attributes ok so now that we have our
logging configured here now let's
replace our print statement with a log
info call so instead of print I'm just
going to say logging dot info and pass
in the exact same message and just to
make sure that this is working with new
information let's go ahead and create
one more employee down here at the
bottom I'll call this employee 3 and
we'll just call this call her Jane Doe
save that ok so now if I run this code
and nothing popped up in our console but
over here in the file system we have
this employee log I'm going to open that
up and here you can see that we have all
of our logs information at the info
level and the custom formatting that we
added in ok so I think that is going to
do it for this video we've gone over how
to use basic logging instead of print
statements we also learned about the
different log levels and how to change
those levels also how to log to a file
and also how to format those
long messages so for small applications
logging like this will be a good start
but there are some issues that we can
run into once we start importing our
other modules because they all try to
share the same logger so in the next
video we'll learn how to create separate
loggers ad handlers and formatters to
those loggers and also how we can log
our information to multiple locations
and I'll leave a link to that next video
in the description section below now if
anyone has any questions about what we
covered in this video then feel free to
ask in the comment section below and
I'll do my best to answer those now if
