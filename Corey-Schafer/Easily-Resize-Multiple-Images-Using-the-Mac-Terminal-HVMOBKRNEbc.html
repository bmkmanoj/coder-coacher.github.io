video I'm going to show you how to
quickly resize a lot of images using
your terminal on your Mac now I
understand a lot of people don't like to
use the terminal I used to not like to
use a lot so if you're looking for
another way to resize a lot of images
like in an application or something I do
have another video where I show how to
do that in an application called Picasa
so if you're interested in that I will
post a link to that video in the
description but with that said I've
never seen an easier way to resize a lot
of images than this method that I'm
going to show you in the terminal so
with that let's go ahead and get started
you can see here on my desktop I have
three folders large medium and small if
I open up this large folder all of these
images that I have in here if I open
these up in a preview then you can see
that they're all high resolution high
resolution large photos so what if we
want to maybe for your website you want
a large version of a photo a medium
version and a small version that happens
a lot especially whenever you're doing
galleries and you need thumbnails or
something like that so let's go ahead
and I'm going to show you two different
ways and how to do this if we open up
this medium folder the first way I'm
going to show you is by altering the
original photo so I'm going to copy
these and then I'm going to paste them
into this medium folder and now these
are still the same large photos in the
medium folder so now let's close this
down and now in my terminal here I'm
going to right now I'm on my desktop if
I do an LS command you can see this
medium folder here I'm going to change
directory directory into the medium
folder now if I do another LS command
now you can see all of my JPEG images
now the command that I'm going to use to
change the size of all these photos is
super easy it's just s IPs sips and then
this Capital Z option and what the
capital Z option does is it maintains
the aspect ratio because we don't want
our pictures
you know getting elongated or anything
like that with weird widths and Heights
so we wanted to maintain that aspect
ratio so since this is a medium picture
let's set this to 640 pixels and the
what we want to change is everything in
this folder that's what the star is the
wild card so everything in this folder
with a dot JPEG and that's it let's just
go ahead and hit enter and you see it'll
go ahead and start that list and go
through all those images now if I come
over here to my folder and I select all
these files and preview them now you can
see that they're all resized to 640
pixels so now let me show you how to do
this without altering the original so
first let me change directory back to my
large folder with all the large original
images and if you remember last time
whenever we did the medium photos first
we copied all the larges and put them
into the medium folder but now I'm going
to show you we're in the large folder
and I'm going to show you how to resize
these images and put them directly into
the small folder without doing any
copying first so I'm just going to hit
the up arrow a couple of times in my
terminal to get back to that sips
command and now since we're gonna do the
small photos I'm going to take these
down to about 300 pixels and now it's
the exact same command but right now
we're in the large folder if we hit
enter right now it would over write all
of our large images with the 300 pixel
images but instead you can put this out
option on to the end and that's going to
be an output directory of where all
these images go so I can just put this
onto my desktop and within the desktop
I'm going to put that in this directory
called small so I'll go ahead and hit
enter and you can see it goes through
all those images and now if I go over
here and open up my small folder then we
can see all the pictures are here and if
I open them up in preview you can see
that they are
all 300 pixel images and so now
basically at this point if all you were
trying to do is resize your images then
you're done you have your folder here
with your large and then your medium and
your small and you can resize those to
any pixel amounts that you want one
thing I want to add on here though is
usually when people do this and they do
large medium and small versions of their
files usually they also want to rename
the files because they don't if they're
putting them up on their web server they
want their large medium and small x' to
all be named something different so
that's a little outside of the scope of
this video so I'm going to show you how
to do it but I'm not going to really
explain it very very much I have this
command here that I've just copied and
pasted in here and let me go into first
let me go change directory into my small
folder and I'm going to rename all of
these so let me open this up and right
now if I was to do an LS on this
directory you can see that these are all
named exactly the same thing that my
large images are named now if we wanted
to distinguish these and say okay let me
clear this out okay now pretty much what
this does is it finds all the files in
this current directory that I'm in you
have to make sure that you're within
your small directory if you run this
command because you don't want it to
change files that you don't plan it to
change but within the directory that I
want to change the file names
I accept cute this statement here that
pretty much it will disregard the
extension right here and then it's going
to tack on a 300 and then it's going to
also add back the extension here at the
end so if I hit enter there and now I
rerun that LS command again now you can
see that all the filenames here have a
300 tacked on to the end of it so yeah
maybe I'll make a video that
kind of explains the bulk renaming in
more in advance but I thought it was
something I should also add to the bulk
image resizing since its most likely
something that people are going to want
to do with all the resized images is
also rename those with the new image
sizes so that about does it
