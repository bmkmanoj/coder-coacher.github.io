video I'm going to show you how to
resize multiple images all at once
really quickly and easily using Google
Picasa if you've never used Picasa
before and you want to download it you
can easily find it over here on the
internet it is at Picasa google.com also
if using the terminal is more your style
I also have a video on how to quickly
resize lots of images just using the
terminal but in this video we're going
to be focusing on using Picasa so this
is what because it looks like whenever
you first open it up what you might see
at first is it may ask you what folders
you want to connect to Picasa if it
doesn't ask you and you can get to that
by going up here to tools and then
folder manager okay so this might be
what you see whenever you first open up
mikasa so the folder that we want to
connect I have a folder on my desktop
and it is this large folder and I will
just do scan once and click ok now
really quickly on my desktop let me open
up this large folder and I'll show you
what's in here if I highlight all these
pictures and open these up in preview
you can see that all these pictures are
really large high-definition pictures
you know if we wanted to put this on a
website maybe we would want the large
high-definition pictures for the
detailed view and then maybe we would
want some medium to small pictures for
maybe like a thumbnail view or something
like that
so that's one of the reasons that you
might want to resize lots of images at
once ok so now we have all of these
images loaded into Picasa
and we can see our folder over here to
the left and we have all the perfect
image is here so resizing these is super
easy all we got to do is highlight all
of our images and then come up here to
file and then we want to come down here
to export picture to folder click on
that and now to this export location
we're already on our desktop let's go to
browse let's go to desktop let's choose
the desktop and instead of large let's
call this medium and then image size we
want to resize too let's go ahead and
stick with 640 picture pixels that's a
good medium sized picture image quality
we'll just keep that automatic and we
won't add a note of watermark right now
but you can do that if you want to so
let's go ahead and click export and you
can see down here that it's exporting
all the pictures to the desktop and then
it'll open up the desktop and finder
whenever that finishes up but I'm just
going to close this down and then show
you that the folder did pop up here on
the desktop so if I double click on that
then we can see all the images are here
I can highlight all these open them up
in preview and you can see that they all
are 640 pixels so now you know if you
wanted we could do this again if you
wanted a really small 300 pixel picture
we could do the same thing export and
stuck a large we'll call this small
instead of 640 call this 300 export that
and it's as easy as that it's super fast
to resize the pictures this way so close
that down and open up our small
directory and you know we can open these
up and look through those and they are
all size to 300 pixels so if resizing
your pictures was all that you wanted
and needed to do then at this point you
would be done you have your three
folders of your large medium and small
pictures one thing additional that you
might want to do is rename the photos
and there's not so much an easy way to
do that but I figured its kind of
outside the scope of this video but I
will show you a way to do that anyway
just in case you need to do it it's
something that a lot of people need to
do because once they have their
different size photos they want to
rename those to this specific size of
their image so that they can distinguish
between the different sizes maybe on
their web server
for the website or something like that
so over here my terminal I'm going to a
CD into my small directory that is this
directory here on my desktop and then
I'm just going to go up to this command
that I ran earlier so you don't want to
run this command unless you know for
sure that you're in the correct
directory because this will overwrite
the names of files so only do this if
you're sure 100% that you're in the
correct directory and we are here we're
in the small directory on the desktop
and what this is doing is it's finding
within the current directory all the
files which in this case it's all JPEG
files and then we're going to execute
this bash command where we're going to
move but pretty much move is the same
thing as rename so we're going to rename
this file we're going to disregard the
extension here back one size 300 and
then also add on the dot jpg to the end
again since we disregarded it earlier so
if I hit enter there and then I run an
LS command which just lists all the
files into a directory now you can see
that all of our small images now have
this 300 packed onto the end of the
image name before these were just the
same names as the large and medium sized
images and now they have this - 300 on
the end to distinguish that they are 300
pixels wide well that about does it for
this video like I said if you'd like to
see another video on how to do this
image resizing within the terminal I do
have a video on that and I will put the
link in the description below but other
than that I hope that this video was
useful for you guys if you have any
questions feel free to ask in the

future videos and tutorials and thank
