take a look at something that you're
probably gonna see a lot in Python and
that is this line right here if double
underscore name is equal to double
underscore main so what is this doing
and why do people use it well let's go
ahead and comment this code out and just
right off the bat let's print out this
double underscore name variable so if I
save this code and run it you can see
that I just ran this first module dot PI
and what I got
whenever I printed out the double
underscore name was double underscore
main and actually to make this more
clear I'm going to go ahead and put in
that this is the first modules name
variable and let me do a format and pass
in that name variable now whenever I
save that and run it now you can see
down here first modules name and then we
have double underscore main so what
exactly is going on here well whenever
python runs a file it first goes through
before it even runs any code it sets a
few special variables and name is one of
those special variables and when python
runs a python file directly it sets this
name variable equal to main and that's
what we're doing here we're running this
file we're running this code from the
file first module pi now we can also
import modules now whenever we import a
module it's going to set this named
variable to the name of the file so in
this case its first underscore module so
let's go ahead and see what this looks
like so I'm going to go over here to
second module PI and I'm going to import
first module and save that
and whenever you import a file it runs
that code and so it's going to come in
here and it's going to print out this
line and whenever we ran this line from
first module PI we got first modules
name is double underscore main whenever
we run second module that PI and import
that module now you can see that it says
first modules name is first module and
the reason it's doing that is because
this file is no longer being run
directly by Python it's being imported
and we can actually take a look at
second module dot PI's let me copy this
from first module and let me paste this
into second module dot PI change this to
second so now I have second modules name
and let me run this so now you can see
that it's importing first module and
first modules name from this file is
first module because it being imported
second modules name is main because
python is running this file directly and
now this brings us back to the code that
we first started with so now I can
uncomment out this code and now we can
see why something like this would be
useful because we can check if double
underscore name is equal to main which
pretty much is saying is this file being
run directly by Python or is it being
imported so let me bring this down and
cut this out and I'm going to paste this
into this main method here save that so
now if I run this file first module that
PI I'm running it directly so I just ran
it and you can see that it went through
and it said if double underscore name is
equal to main run this main method came
into the main method and print it out
first modules name is main now if I go
back here to second module dot PI and I
run this code you can see imported first
module but
only printed out second modules name has
double underscore main now the reason
that it didn't print first modules name
is because now we have this check in
place if double underscore name is equal
to main now
this whenever it rent came through and
ran this code it's saw that double
underscore name was equal to first
module and not main so then it never
made it to this main method and it never
printed out this statement here and just
to illustrate this further I can go into
first module here I can type in and an
else condition and then let me take out
I'm just going to take out this main
method and from here I'm going to do a
print statement that says run directly
and then in the else I'm gonna say run
from import save that and whenever I run
this file first module dot PI whenever I
run it directly you can see that this
file was the main method got run
directly I come over here now the second
module dot PI and I import first module
and run this you can see it says run
from import because it hits this else
statement and you can see that it's
being imported so hopefully that clears
up any confusion that you may have had
about this statement here if name is
equal to main the reason this is used is
because you know sometimes there is code
that you only want to run whenever
you're running this as the main file and
sometimes there's code that you only
want to run whenever it's being imported
and one more thing here if we bring back
this main method and then I'm gonna put
in a print statement here I'm just going
to put first modules
main method and save that and then run
that within here and then also up above
this I'm going to put in a few print
statements that is just a C print this
will be run this will always be run so
save that and then whenever I run this
you can see this will always be run
first modules main method one reason
that you might want to put all of your
code inside of method like this instead
of just putting all the code that you
want to run down here in this
conditional if you make this method and
then within this conditional where it
says if double underscore name is equal
to main and then run this what that
allows us to do is if we come over here
to second module dot PI and let me rerun
this now you can see that an imported
first module and it says this will
always be run and that's because it is
outside of that main method so it's
going to get run regardless even if it's
important and then second modules name
is main now with that main method if we
wanted to run that from second module
dot PI then we can actually come in here
and call that directly so I can save
that and now if I rerun this file now
you can see that it's importing first
module and it's not meeting this
condition so it doesn't run the main
method on the import but then if we want
to run that anyway then we can say first
module dot main then it comes in here
prints that out and then continues on
with the rest of the code in second
module dot PI so I really hope this
