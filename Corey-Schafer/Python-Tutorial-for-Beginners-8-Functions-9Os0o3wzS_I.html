this video we'll be learning about
functions now functions are basically
some instructions packaged together that
perform a specific task so let's create
our first function and see why these are
so beneficial now to create a function
we'll use the DEF keyword which I
believe stands for definition and let's
just make a simple function here to get
started I'll call this hello func
now we have parentheses there because
that is where our parameters will go
when we add those in but we don't have
any parameters just yet so that will be
empty for now now it is possible to
write a function and not have any code
in it but we can't leave it completely
blank but if we want to fill this
function and later then we can use this
pass keyword and basically that pass
keyword is saying that we don't want to
do anything with this for now but it
won't throw any errors for leaving it
blank so if we want to run our function
and we can just say hello underscore
func and put in these parentheses and we
need to add those parentheses after the
function in order to execute it if we
don't have those parentheses there then
it'll equal to the function itself
so let's actually see what that looks
like so I'm going to print out that
hello function without the parentheses
in place which means that we're not
executing the function so let me run
that and we can see when we printed that
out that it prints out that this is a
function in a certain location and
memory but it didn't execute the
function so to execute it then we add in
these parentheses so now if I run this
then now it just gives us none because
we're not doing anything with this
function yet and it doesn't have a
return value so let's go ahead and put
some code into our function so first
we'll just put in a print statement and
we'll just print out some text that says
hello function with an exclamation point
and now that we're actually running that
print statement from within the function
we don't need to print out it executed
function we can just execute that
function and it should run that print
statement so we'll run that so we can
see that we executed our function here
it came within our function and ran our
print statement now one benefit of
is that they allow us to reuse code
without repeating ourselves so let's say
for example that we had to print out
some text and several locations
throughout our program so it might look
something like this so let me copy this
and I'll comment out our function
execution for now I'm just going to
paste this in about four times so now if
we run this then as we expect it prints
out our four messages
now imagine our boss came to us and told
us that the text was a little bit off
and that we didn't want to have an
exclamation point at the end of the
string well the way that we have it now
we have to come in here and change all
of those manually so I'd come in and
change all of these messages to have a
period instead now that was only four
changes to make there but in some
instances that can be in hundreds of
locations in multiple different files so
that's the first benefit of functions
and allows us to put code with a
specific purpose into a single location
so instead of printing those four
statements what we can instead do is run
our function four times so I will remove
that and uncomment our function and
we're going to execute this four
different times so now if we run that
then we can see that it ran our function
four times and executed our print
statement four different times but now
if our boss came to us and asked us to
remove that exclamation point then it
doesn't matter if this is spread out
over a hundred different lines or a
hundred different locations we can just
update it in this one spot so I can
change this to a period and now if we
run this and we can see that those
changes are seen everywhere that the
function is called now this is called
keeping your code dry which stands for
don't repeat yourself it's a common
mistake for people new to programming to
repeat the same things throughout their
code when really they could either put
their code into certain variables or
functions so that it's in a single
location so we saw earlier that since we
aren't returning anything from our
function it was actually equal to none
so what does it mean for our function to
return something now this is where
functions become really powerful because
it allows us to operate on some data and
then pass the reserved
- whatever called our function so
instead of printing the string hello
function within here let's instead
return this okay so what does this mean
exactly this means that when we execute
our function it's actually going to be
equal to our return value
so these executed functions here are
actually equal to the string hello
function so right now if we run this and
it doesn't give us any results because
it's just a string that we're not doing
anything with but if instead we print
this so let me print that executed
function and if we run that then we can
see that it prints out our string so
basically think of a function as a
machine that takes input and produces a
result when you execute a function you
can think of it almost like a black box
you don't need to know exactly how it's
doing what it's doing you're mainly
concerned about the input and the return
value so in this simple example here we
don't have any input and we can see that
the return value is a string now don't
get me wrong it's useful to know what a
function is doing but when you're first
getting started don't get caught up on
understanding every detail of what every
function does just focus on the input
and what's returned so for example when
we call the LAN function on a string so
if I print out LAN of this string test
if I run this that as we saw in a
previous video this just returns an
integer that is the number of characters
in our string so we have no idea what
the code that produces that result looks
like but we do know that we passed in a
string and that it returned this integer
and we'll see why here in a bit while
looking at functions in this way we'll
help you become better when working with
Python because we can treat the return
value just like the data type that it is
and understanding this will allow you to
chain together some functionality so we
know our hello function returns a string
so we can treat that executed function
just like a string so if we remember
back to our string methods remember that
we can uppercase a string with dot upper
so really we can take this
executed function and just chained dot
upper onto the end of it so now if we
run this now we can see that our
executed function returned the string
hello function and then we were able to
use the string method upper on that
return value to uppercase the string
okay so now let's look at how we can
pass arguments to our function and real
quick I'm going to remove that upper
method so to be able to pass arguments
to our function we'll need to create
some parameters here within our
parentheses so let's say that we wanted
to customize the greeting that our
function returns so let's create a
parameter called greeting and now within
our function will return a string where
we use that greeting instead of our
Hello text that we had before so now
I'll just pass this in with a dot format
so now before we run this we have to
pass in that greeting argument when we
execute our function if we don't then
we'll get an error so actually let's go
ahead and run this and see this error so
we can see that when we ran that it says
that
hello func is missing one required
positional argument greeting so let's
pass in that greeting argument to our
hello function and to do that we can
just pass it in directly here when we
call our function so I'm just going to
pass in high as our string so now if we
run this then we can see that when we
passed in that string high into our
function that it set that greeting
variable equal to the string high and
then returned the string high function
now this greeting variable doesn't
affect any variables outside of the
function its scope is only local to the
function which is nice because we don't
have to worry about it affecting
anything we don't want it to affect so
and if you want to learn more about
Python scope then I do have a detailed
video going in-depth as to how that
works exactly and I'll leave a link to
that video and the description section
below ok so right now this greeting
parameter is a required argument and
that is because it doesn't have a
default value now
we had a default value then it would
just fall back to the default value
whenever we didn't pass that argument in
so let's see an example of this so let's
say that we also want to be able to pass
a name to our hello function and it will
return a greeting and the name so we can
add that to our parameters by putting in
a comma here and saying that we also
want to accept this name parameter but
let's say that if no name is passed in
then we want to have a default value of
U so we can just say name is equal to U
and now let's add that to our return
string so I'll put in a comma space and
then another placeholder and we'll pass
in that name so what this is going to do
is it will return a greeting and a name
separated by a comma and a space so if
we run this we can see that even though
we didn't pass in a value for the name
argument when we executed this function
it didn't throw an error and instead use
the default value that we specified as u
but if we want to pass in a value then
it will use that value instead so when
we execute this function if I was to say
name is equal to we'll say Corre and run
that but now we can see that printed out
the greeting with the name that we
passed in now you're required positional
arguments have to come before your
keyword arguments now if you try to
create a function with those out of
order then it's going to give you an
error now this is a little more advanced
topic that trips a lot of people up but
at some point you'll probably run across
a function in Python that looks
something like this so I'll say def
student info and you might see something
where you see this star args and star
star kwargs and so let me just go ahead
and within this new function here I will
print out args and I'll also print out
chords so let's not really worry about
this function name for now it's the
arguments that I want to focus on so
seeing this star args and star star
chords can seem confusing at first but
basically all
doing is allowing us to accept an
arbitrary number of positional or
keyword arguments so for example let's
say that this student info function
takes positional arguments that
represent the crisis that the student is
taking plus the keyword arguments passed
in will be random information about the
students so you can see in both of those
examples we don't know how many of these
positional or keyword arguments that
will be and that's why we use star args
and star star quarks and the names don't
have to be args and kwargs but that's a
convention that you'll see a lot so it's
always good to stick with convention so
that people can understand your code so
let's call this function with some
random values so I'm going to say
student info and first we want to pass
in some positional arguments of the
classes that they're taking so we'll say
math and art and now for our keyword
arguments we'll pass in some random
information about the students so we'll
say name is equal to John and age is
equal to 22 so now if we run this then
we can see that when we printed the args
it's actually a tuple with all of our
positional arguments and our chords are
a dictionary with all of our keyword
values so once you have that tuple and
that dictionary then you'll be able to
do whatever you want with that
information now sometimes you might see
a function call with arguments using the
star or double star now when it's used
in that context it will actually unpack
a sequence or dictionary and pass those
values into the function individually so
to see what I mean let's make a list and
a dictionary of everything that we just
passed into our function and just to
clear up some room here I'm going to go
ahead and delete the hello function that
we started off with so now I'm going to
create a list called courses and I'm
going to set this equal to math and art
that we passed in before and instead of
a tuple I'm going to make that a list so
now for the student info I'm going to
create a dictionary called info and set
that equal to those values so now let me
get
of our positional and keyword arguments
here so let's say that we wanted to pass
all of these courses in as our
positional arguments and the info
dictionary as our keyword arguments so
if we just pass these in as is and I
passed in courses and info now if we run
this then we can see that this might not
be exactly what we thought instead of
passing the values in individually and
instead passed in the complete list and
the complete dictionary as positional
arguments so if we use the single star
in front of our list and the double star
in front of our dictionary then it would
actually unpack these values and pass
them in individually so basically it
will be the equivalent to our previous
execution where we pass them in
individually so to see what I mean
let's add a star in front of this
courses to unpack those values and a
star star in front of our dictionary to
unpack those keyword values so now if we
run this and we can see that we got what
we had before we can see that when our
function prints ARDS its the values from
our list that we unpacked and our Korg's
is equal to the dictionary values that
we unpacked now I know that's a little
confusing especially to you know get the
idea that whenever you're passing these
in that it unpacks the values and within
here it's for accepting an arbitrary
number of positional or keyword values
but it's a little more advanced of a
topic and I know it's confusing but
hopefully it makes some sense and you'll
be able to better understand what's
going on if you ever run into something
like that okay so lastly I wanted to run
through an example that ties together
everything we've learned so far in this
series of videos so I have some code
here in my snippets file that I'm going
to grab real quick and paste into the
file that we've been working with so now
let me lower this output a little bit so
that we can see everything here now
these are actually a couple of functions
that I grabbed from the Python standard
library I modified them very slightly
but it's basically the same and I wanted
to show that even though we've only gone
over the fundamentals we're already able
to look at some code from within the
standard library itself
and understand what's going on so at the
top here we have a list called month
days and this has the number of days in
each month now the first index here is
just a placeholder that's not going to
get used we're only going to be
accessing indexes one through twelve
since or those are the months and then
we have a function here called is leap
which determines if a year is a leap
year it takes a single argument that is
the year that it's checking and we can
see that there's this string after the
function definition with three quotes
and this is called a docstring
and docstrings help document what a
function or a class is supposed to do so
it's a good practice anytime you write a
function to write a doc string that goes
along with it
explaining what that function is
supposed to do now this part here can
seem a little intimidating but it's not
important that you understand how a leap
year is calculated there's not a lot of
people who know that off the top of
their head but for various reasons this
is how a leap year is calculated and
it's not important but you could
probably figure out what this
conditional is doing so we're saying
that if the year is divisible by four
and it's not divisible by a hundred or
it's divisible by four hundred so like I
was saying there's a lot of different
reasons why leap years are determined
this way and if you don't know that
that's completely fine but this function
here is going to return true if a year
is a leap year and false if it's a
non-leap year and down here we have a
days and month
function that takes a year and a month
as arguments and ill return the number
of days in that month so if we look at
how this function works we can see that
at first checks if a month is between 1
and 12 and if it's not then it returns
that it's an invalid month and then it
checks if the months that we're working
with is the second month which would
mean that it's February and is a leap
year using our function up here at the
top then it returns 29 if both of those
are true and lastly if it makes it to
the end without having returned anything
yet then it will index into our month of
days and list up here at the top
and return the value of our month so
let's just run through this one time and
see how these functions work so outside
of both of the functions we're going to
go ahead and first use this is leap year
function so we'll say is leap 2017 so if
we run this then it returns false so we
ran this function is leap passed in 2017
as our value and it went through this
complicated conditional here and
determined that that was false but if we
type in 2020 here and run that then we
can see that it returns true that 2020
is a leap year but now let's try our
days and month function which is going
to be a little bit longer of a walk
there
so we'll say days and months and we'll
pass in a year so it takes a year first
we'll pass in a year of 2017 and we'll
pass in a month of two which is February
now since 2017 is not a leap year than
this second month which is February
should only have 28 days so if we run
this that we can see that we got 28 so
let's walk through exactly what happened
just so we're sure that we understand so
we executed our days and month function
with our arguments of 2017 for the year
and two for the month so it comes in two
hour days and month function and it sets
this year variable equal to 2017 and
this month variable equal to 2 so let's
comment those here just to keep track of
them through our walkthrough so I'll put
a comment for a year as 2017 and a
comment for month as 2 so first it
checks if our month is not between 1 and
12 our month is 2 so it is in that range
so it doesn't meet this conditional and
since it doesn't meet that conditional
and we just continue on so our next
conditional asked if the month is equal
to 2 and is a leap year so our month is
equal to 2 but this is leap function
runs through its code with the year 2017
and returns false
so since is leap is false and we're
using an and operator then the whole
conditional evaluates to false so we
move on and lastly it accesses
the month days list at this month index
and remember that our month is equal to
2 so it's accessing the second index and
if we look up here to our month days
list and go to our second index so 0 1 2
then we can see that that's equal to 28
so it should be returning 28 here and
finally when we printed out that result
28 is what we got as a result now I know
that it was kind of a long walk through
but I thought it might be useful to see
how these things actually work together
and how do you go about determining what
a function should return based on the
arguments that you pass in okay so I
think that is going to do it for this
video I hope that now you have a clearer
understanding of how functions work how
we return values and the different ways
that we can pass arguments in the next
video we'll be learning how to import
modules and also learn about some of the
useful modules that come in the standard
library but if anyone has any questions
