this series of videos we'll be learning
how to build a full-featured web
application using the flask framework
and Python
so flask is an excellent micro framework
that really makes it enjoyable to work
with these back-end web applications and
also at the time of this recording they
just released version 1.0 of the
framework so it's a great time to learn
this so first of all let me show you
what will be building in this series of
videos and then we'll get started
learning how to actually put all this
together so this is the application that
we'll be building in this series of
videos and you can see that is a blog
style of an application where different
users can make different posts now these
can be regular blog post or they can be
you know smaller like Twitter updates or
whatever you want to do with it so let's
go through a little tour of the features
of this application so we can see that
we have a user management system so we
can register new users and once a new
user is registered we can go to login
and if they have forgot their password
then they can get a password reset email
sent to their email address so if we log
in here so I'll login with the email
address that I used to sign up for the
application here and once I sign in at
the top here we can see that we have a
few new options so if I go to my account
then we can see the account information
that we have here we also have the
ability to update profile pictures to
where we save pictures on the backend
web application so if we update that
then we can see that that changes there
and that picture also automatically gets
resized to save space on our web server
so we also have the ability to write new
posts here if we go to the home page we
can look at other people's posts or if
we go to a post that we have written
then you can see that we can actually
update and delete our post here so if I
update this post that can say my latest
updated post and post that if I go back
to the home page then we can see that
that post was updated and if I wanted to
delete a post I could just come in and
delete and delete and we can see that
that post is no longer there so that's a
quick tour of what we'll be building and
building an application like this is a
great way to learn the ins and outs of a
framework because we're going to have to
deal with databases and also accepting
user
input from forms and saving pictures
onto the back-end file system and
sending emails and all kinds of
different things so we're really going
to learn a lot about the framework by
building this now I'm gonna mention this
several times throughout the series but
if you're following along and would like
to download the source code of each step
in the process then I will have links to
the source code of each video in the
description section below so that you
can download that if you'd like and also
if you'd like to know how to build this
same website and another framework then
in the near future I'm also going to be
releasing a series showing how to build
the same site and Django and on pyramid
and possibly other frameworks as well
okay so let's go ahead and get started
learning how to build this using flask
so I'm just going to close out of this
application and open up my terminal here
so first of all let's start off by
installing the packages that we need to
get started out so you can do this in a
virtual environment or in your default
Python environment but it's always a
good idea to separate different projects
into their own virtual environments now
I'm mainly going to focus on flask in
these videos so if you need to install
Python or want to learn how to work with
virtual environments or are wondering
how I set up my text editor or anything
like that
then I'm gonna put links to those videos
in the description section below but I'm
not going to go into those in detail in
this series I'm just going to assume
that you're specifically ready to start
learning flask okay so first of all
let's install flask and to do this we
can do a simple pip install so I'll say
pip install flask and once that is
installed let's make sure that it
installed correctly so we can do that
just by starting up our Python repple
here and then importing flask
so if we say import flask if that
doesn't give you an error then that
installed correctly so now we can exit
out of that interpreter and now let's
create a new project from scratch so I'm
here on my desktop but you can create
this project anywhere you'd like so I'm
going to create a new directory on my
desktop so within a Mac on my machine
this is going to be m'kay Durer and I'm
just going to call this flask blog now
on a Windows machine that is going to be
a different command but you can just
create the folder on your desktop like
you would any other folder and I'm going
to open up this new project directory
and my text editor and i'm going to be
using sublime text but you can use any
the editor that you'd like so I'm going
to open up sublime text go to file open
and then open up this directory okay so
now we have a completely empty project
now within our project directory here
I'm going to create a new file and I'm
going to call this flask blog dot PI and
now we should be ready for a basic flask
application so I have the flask website
pulled up here in my browser so if I go
to this then if you go to the front page
of their documentation then they have
about the simplest application that you
can start with so let's copy and paste
this into our file and I'll explain
what's going on so I'm going to grab
this code here and paste this into our
sublime application I'm going to make
this text a little larger here okay so
at the top here we're saying from flask
import flask so we are importing this
flask class and then we're creating this
app variable and setting this to an
instance of this flask class now passing
in the double underscore name can seem a
bit confusing double underscore name is
a special variable in Python that is
just the name of the module now if we
run the script with Python directly than
double underscore name it can be equal
to double underscore main and we'll see
that in just a second basically that is
so flask knows where to look for your
templates and static files and things
like that so now we have an instantiated
flask application in this app variable
now we can create our routes so our
routes are what we type into our browser
to go to different pages so for example
you've probably been to websites that
have about pages and contact pages and
in flask we create these using route
decorators so decorators can be a
confusing topic but you don't really
need to understand how they work in
order to use flask so I would recommend
learning at some point just because
they're nice to know but if you don't
really understand them then don't worry
too much about it for this series
basically decorators are just a way to
add additional functionality to existing
functions and in this case this
a Prout decorator will handle all of the
complicated back-end stuff and simply
allow us to write a function that
returns the information that will be
shown on our website for this specific
route
so this Ford's last year is just the
root page of our website or you can
think of it as the home page and we are
simply returning the text hello world so
this is normally where we'd want to
return some HTML but we'll start off
with this text just to make sure it all
works so when we start our application
if we navigate to our home page then it
should show us this text hello world so
now let's run this so that you can see
how this works so I'm going to pull back
up my command line here and now I'm
going to navigate to my project
directory so I'm going to do a CD flask
blog and the CD command is the same on
Windows as well and now we're in the
same directory where that flask blog dot
PI module lives now before we run our
application we need to set an
environment variable to the file that we
want to be our flask application so in
my case I can say export flask
underscore app is equal to flask blog
dot PI now that's the command that you
use on Mac and Linux
if you're on Windows then that is going
to be equal to set flask
app instead of export so you can just
run that and now with that environment
variable set we should be able to run
our flask application just by saying a
flask run so if that worked and you
don't have any errors then you should
see this message that says that it's
serving your flask app on 127th 0.01 and
this is the IP address of your local
machine and the 5000 here is the port
number now this is a running webserver
this actually comes with flask itself
and you have to leave this running while
you're viewing your site or else you
won't be able to see it so if I copy
this address here and go back to my web
browser and paste this in then we should
see our sample application now this is a
little small here but we can see that we
got the text hello world and that is
what we returned from that home route
now when I said that this 127 0 dot 0
dot 1 was the IP address of our local
machine there's actually an alias for
that IP
dressed called localhost and I like
using that more than the IP address
itself so if I go back and paste in that
URL again and replace this one 2700 dot
one with localhost and hit enter then we
can see that that returns the same route
and gives us the same results okay so
now let's try to update our code to
include some actual HTML so I'm going to
wrap our text here in h1 tags which are
heading tags and this should make the
text look a lot larger so I'm going to
open up our flask blog and instead of
returning just hello world I'm going to
wrap these and h1 tags which are HTML
heading one tags so we can close that
out and save it and if we go back to our
browser and reload that page then we can
see that the changes did not take effect
so we actually need to stop the web
server and then run it again so I'm
going to pull up my command line here
and stop this using control-c and then
rerun that with flask run again and then
go back to my web server reload that
page then now we can see that those
changes took effect and we now have our
text and our h1 tags and within chrome
and other browsers as well you can view
the source code of any HTML page just by
right-clicking and then going to view
page source and if I do that then this
is a little small here but we have our
text wrapped in h1 tags okay so most
likely when you're developing a site
you're going to be making a lot of
changes to your application and it would
be a major pain to have to shutdown and
restart the web server each time you
make a small change and we can actually
get around this and have the server show
changes without restarting our
application just by running our
application in debug mode so here is one
way to do this so if we stop our current
application so I'll pull up our terminal
and hit control C now I'm going to clear
out the screen here then if we set
another environment variable so I'll say
export this one is called flask
underscore debug and I'm going to set
that equal to 1 and hit enter and
remember on Windows you use the word set
instead of export for an environment
variable so now if we run this
application
I'm going to go back and do a flask run
again then right away we can see that
there's some additional information here
in debug mode that wasn't there before
so if I go back and refresh our page in
the browser then we can see that our
application is still working and now let
me change some text in our code so I'm
going to go back and instead of this
hello world I'm instead going to change
this to homepage and save that now
without restarting the web server like
we did before I'm just going to reload
my browser and you can see that since
we're in debug mode that those changes
reloaded automatically and we didn't
have to restart that web server like we
did before okay so I also wanted to show
you that if you don't want to work with
those environment variables then there's
another way that we can run our
application directly using Python so
let's go back to our application here
and to do this let's go down to the
bottom of the file and we're going to
want to put in a conditional that says
if double underscore name is equal to
and in quotes here double underscore
main and then within this conditional we
can say app dot run and we run run this
and debug mode so we'll say debug is
equal to true
now this conditional here can be
confusing when you first see it like I
said before the double underscore name
is main if we run the script with Python
directly but if we import this module to
somewhere else then the name will be the
name of our module so this continue this
conditional is only true if we run this
script directly and I have a more
detailed video on this concept if that's
still confusing to you so if we were to
run this flash blog dot PI module with
Python then it should come in here to
this conditional and run this app dot
run statement so let's do that now so
I'll pull up the command line again and
I'm going to stop my server here and
clear out this page and now instead of
doing flask run like we did before that
uses the environment variables we could
instead just call this script directly
with Python by saying Python and then
flask blog dot PI and run that directly
if we run that we can see that we get a
similar
output says that we're running on our
localhost and debug mode so if we go
back to our browser and refresh the page
that we can see that that's still
working now running the module directly
used to be how always ran flask
applications but now the flask
documentation uses the flask run command
so I've been using that as well so the
flask command with the environment
variables also allows us to use the
flash shell for some debugging and we'll
see a couple of examples of that in
later videos now in this series that
probably we'll be running the
application directly with Python just
because I don't want to keep setting
those environment variables again
whenever I shut down my terminal okay so
now that we have this running now let's
add another route so that we can see how
easy this is using flask so let's add an
about route to make an about page for
our website so if I try to navigate to
an about page right now so that would be
forged slash about if I go there then we
can see that we get this not found air
and if we look at our command line that
was running the server then we can see
that we are last get requests returned a
404 response and that 404 response means
that the page doesn't exist so let's
create that now so I'm going to open up
sublime text and now I'm just going to
copy and paste this homepage route here
and then change a couple of things here
so for the route I'm going to say ford
slash about and we also have to change
the function name here so that's
something that's easy to forget so just
be sure that you do that and I'm just
going to call that function about and
within here instead of saying homepage
I'm just going to say about page so now
we have a route at ford slash about and
this about function is returning the
information for that page and in this
case it's just an h1 heading with the
text of about page so let's see if this
worked so let's look at our command line
and make sure the server is still
running and it is so if we reload this
page in the browser then we can see we
no longer get that 404 not found air and
instead it returns the about page text
for our route so now we have two routes
here we have this about page and if I
take that about away and just go back to
our home page then we can see that that
route still exists as well now
if we ever wanted to have multiple
routes handled by the same function then
it's as simple as just adding another
decorator so let's say that we wanted a
route of ford slash home to go to our
home page as well as just the ford slash
so I'm going to copy this and paste
another decorator right below it and
just say ford slash home and I'm also
going to change the function name here
from hello to home then now if we pull
back up our browser here and reload the
home page we can see that that still
works but also if we go to ford slash
home then that gives us the home page as
well so those two routes are being being
handled by the same function okay so I
think that it's going to do it for the
first video now we know how to get a
flask application up and running and
also how to create some basic routes and
in the next video we'll learn how to
return some more complicated HTML code
using templates and also how to pass
variables to our web page but if you
