this video I just wanted to check in and
give everyone some updates about the
channel I'm always getting suggestions
from a lot of you about some
improvements that you'd like to see a
lot of these suggestions that I get have
to do with providing the code snippets
and source code from my videos and also
some ideas for how I organize my videos
so I've been working on getting some of
those improvements in place and we'll
discuss all of that here in just a bit
also in this video I have a couple of
questions for you all and would love any
feedback that you can provide in the
comments or messages so first of all I
just want to give a big thank you to all
of you we recently hit 30,000
subscribers on the channel and I'm
getting more and more messages and
feedback every day I can't always
respond to every message and question
that I receive but I just want you all
to know that I do read every one of them
and really appreciate all the feedback
that you send my way and I especially
want to thank all the people who are
supporting through patreon now I know
that not everyone has the means to
support financially and that's totally
understandable but for those of you who
do I just want you to know that I really
appreciate it at some point I would love
to make these tutorials full time so
that i could put out a ton more in-depth
videos at a faster pace and every bit of
support makes that more and more of a
possibility and speaking of patreon I
recently updated the rewards that I
offer so if you're not familiar with
patreon it's basically a way for people
to financially support creators for as
little as a dollar a month and they also
have a feature where you can set certain
levels so that anyone who donates a
certain amount unlocks some kind of perk
or reward so the reward that I already
had in place is that anyone who supports
the channel gets a shout-out on my
personal website and that's over here on
my contributions page now that is unless
they opted out of that I do have several
supporters who chose to opt out of
getting that now I'm going to continue
adding supporters to my contributors
page here but I've also wanted to do
more than just giving a shout-out for
people who support the channel so I was
trying to think of some better rewards
that I could offer and you can see that
I've updated this over here on the side
so one thing that I was thinking was
that we could do boat giveaways
specifically for people who support the
channel so I've updated my patreon it so
that any time I do a giveaway h
supporter will
we'll get one entry for every dollar
that they contribute and then I will
randomly select a winner from those
entries so for example someone
contributing ten dollars will receive
ten entries and so on so I'm probably
going to do at my first giveaway like
this at the beginning of next month or
so and another fun thing I was thinking
was that i could write my own script to
randomly select this winter and I could
make a video showing the process for how
I go about writing a script like that so
that's one question that I had for all
of you is what do you think of these
rewards for patreon supporters because I
really do appreciate all of you who
support the channel and I want to
provide something in return so if you
have any ideas or feedback then I'm
definitely open for suggestions now the
only caveat here is that I can't do any
reward that's too time-consuming because
I still do have a full-time job and I'm
also answering a lot of viewer questions
in my free time so any rewards that I
provide will have to be something that
doesn't take up too much time because
any time that I put towards that will
take away from the time that I'm able to
put in answering questions and making
future videos and I know that for the
most part you all would like to see me
get out more videos than anything else
okay so with that out of the way let's
move on to some of the updates here now
one of the most common suggestions that
I get is that I should be putting up the
source code from each of my videos so
I've gone back through all of my videos
and tried to put all of the code onto my
github page now I've also gone through
each video and added links to the source
code in the description of each video so
this is just one example here if you're
looking for the source code then you can
look in the comment and there will
usually be a link like this the code
from this video can be found that and
it'll have a link and when you click on
that it'll take you over to my github
page where I link the source code for
those videos so in the future I'm going
to make it a habit of pushing the code
to my github page before I publish a
video and I'll be sure to add those
links to the source code in the
description of each video so be on the
lookout for that okay and another
suggestion that I get a lot is that I
should create a playlist that orders all
of my pipe on videos in such a way where
there's some kind of progression and
this would be so that someone who's
learning python can just start at the
inning of the playlist and the videos
that I suggest for a beginner will be
towards the beginning intermediate
intermediate videos will be in the
middle and more advanced videos will be
towards the end so I've created one
large Python playlist and ordered my
videos in such a way that I think it's
the best for beginners or what I think
is best for beginners will be towards
the beginning and they progress through
to the more advanced tutorials now i do
want to point out that this doesn't
exactly flow like a python class where
you should watch every single video back
to back there are some videos that
people will most likely want to skip so
for example at the beginning of the
playlist i placed all of the development
environment setup videos now i'm a
development environment setup videos for
sublime text and Adam and Eclipse and I
made setup videos for each of these
because different people have different
preferences and I wanted to give my
preferred setup for each of those but
for someone who's getting started with
Python they might only want to watch one
of these videos to get their environment
setup and then move on to the next
relevant topic they probably don't want
to watch all three of these set up
videos but with that said I did order
these in a way that I think makes sense
for someone learning python so at the
beginning we have our development
environment setup and then we move on to
you know package management with Pip and
creating virtual environments learning
about scope and so on now this is one
large Python playlist with every single
one of my Python videos now for
something that does flow more like a
class then I have created other
playlists that flow from you know from
beginning to end just like you'd expect
so if someone is only interested in
learning how to create classes and
object-oriented programming and Python
and they can just go straight to this
playlist instead and I have created
several other playlists that focus on
specific topics rather than the large
Python playlist with everything included
so just give those playlists a look and
and hopefully they're ordered
appropriately okay so I think that's
going to do it for this video now those
are by far the suggestions that I get
the most and hopefully now that those
are addressed and the videos will be
more accessible and easier to follow
along than before
now as usual if you have any questions
then feel free to ask in the comments
section below feel free to give me
suggestions or feedback about anything
that we talked about in this update
video and again thank you all for
everything and thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
