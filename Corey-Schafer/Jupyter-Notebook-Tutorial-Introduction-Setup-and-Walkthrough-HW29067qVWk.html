this video we're going to be learning
how to get started with using Jupiter
notebooks now if you don't know what a
Jupiter notebook is this is basically a
way for us to run code interactively
within a web browser
alongside some visualizations and some
markdown text to explain the process of
what's going on
now this Jupiter project evolved out of
ipython so if you've ever used ipython
or heard someone talking about that then
that has now been rolled into this
Jupiter project and there were some good
reasons behind that that I won't go into
too much detail about here but they have
an entire blog post on their website if
anyone is interested so before we even
get started let me show you why this is
useful and how powerful something like
this can be so a lot of scientific
institutions are using these notebooks
in order to clearly explain exactly how
they got the results and not only can
these notebooks show us how they got the
results but we can reproduce the results
from within the notebooks themselves so
some of you may have heard of like oh
that's the observatory that detected
gravitational waves in the late 2015
they actually put out some of their
research and notebook form so I have one
of their notebooks pulled up here which
walks you through how you can replicate
some of their processing using their own
data and you can see that this isn't
just Python code but they also have some
markdown code which gets displayed as
the instructions and also describes
exactly what's going on here but you can
see if we scroll down here we have a lot
of markdown code that's describing
what's going on we see some Python code
and we see some charts here so the way
that some of these notebooks are laid
out it almost looks like a blog post or
a textbook or something like that but
these charts and everything that we see
here these aren't just static
visualizations like some PDF file or
something like that these are
visualizations that were produced right
here in the browser by the code that
we're looking at and we can even tweak
this code and rerun these cells to get
different results so for example here we
see this chart that was produced by this
code here and I've actually come into
this cell here then I can change this
x-axis label instead of an S there I can
change that to seconds and if I rerun
that cell then you can
see that this plot gets recreated right
here within our browser interactively so
you can see how that's a really cool
concept of being able to interact with
the data and the code in this way and
you can see why notebooks like this
would be becoming very popular so that's
what we're going to do in this video
we're going to learn how we can get
Jupiter installed and how we can create
our own notebooks get set up with
different kernels what they see within
these notebooks and also how to navigate
around execute code and also some cool
tips and tricks okay so let's go ahead
and get started with installing Jupiter
so I have the Jupiter documentation
pulled up here on their installation
page and you can see that they actually
recommend installing Jupiter by using
the Anaconda Python distribution and I
have a separate video where I walk
through the installation of anaconda and
some of the benefits that you get from
that and one of those benefits is that
Jupiter comes bundled in with that
installation so I'm going to use Jupiter
for this walkthrough using the anaconda
distribution but if you don't want to
use anaconda then they also have the PIP
installation instructions here as well
so either method is up to you but I
would recommend installing anaconda and
that's what I'm going to use for this
video so once you've run through the
process of either installing anaconda or
doing the PIP installs then now we can
just pull up our terminals here and I'm
going to kill that notebook server that
was running the ligo notebooks and I'm
going to CD into a blank directory here
that is completely empty
so now I'm starting from scratch in this
directory if I do an LS dash L a on a
Mac this is going to list out all the
files and directories and you can see
that it's completely empty so now within
this demo directory to start a new
notebook we just have to say Jupiter
notebook and if I run that it's going to
start a server and pop up with this
dashboard here and this is on our
localhost port
8 8 8 8 now that server that we started
up in our terminal you have to leave
that running that's called a notebook
server and if we were to close that
window
and shut down that server then we
wouldn't be able to access our notebooks
within our localhost so you have to
leave that running and you can see that
currently in our dashboard here that we
don't have much here if we had any files
or folders in that test directory where
we started that notebook server from
then those would show up here but that
directory was completely empty so we
don't have anything here yet okay so
let's go ahead and jump right into
creating a new notebook and in order to
create a new notebook you're going to
have to have a kernel and the kernels
are basically what programming language
that you want to use so for python we
could also have a separate kernel for
python too and we'll go over how to set
that up here in a little bit but for now
I'm just going to go ahead and create a
new notebook and this is going to say
Python root and Python root on my
machine is Python three and so I'm going
to go ahead and select that okay so now
we have a completely blank notebook here
now if this is your first time using a
Jupiter notebook then I would recommend
coming up here and clicking on this help
section here and let first let's go to
this user interface tour now this tour
will give a pop up on your screen that
you can just use your arrow keys to
scroll through and it will show you
where certain things are so there it's
showing us how to change the file name
for the notebook and how some of these
menu bars what the icons mean and things
like that and also the mode indicators
it will just kind of walk you through
how everything is laid out but for now
I'm going to go ahead and exit out of
that and also let's go up here back to
this help menu and now let's click on
this keyboard shortcuts now depending if
you're on Mac or Windows these modifier
keys may be different for you but if you
do scroll down here it shows you all the
keyboard shortcuts that you can use
within either command mode or edit mode
and we'll talk about both of those in
just a second so I'm going to go ahead
and close this down but if you ever do
want to see either of those again the
user interface tour or the keyboard
shortcuts they're right here in the help
menu ok so the first thing that I'm
going to do with our notebook is I'm
just going to go up here and change this
from untitled and I'm just going to call
this testing Joop
and I'll go ahead and hit okay there so
now that renames our ipython notebook
file okay so now let's actually look at
adding some content to our notebook
so notebooks have two different modes
they have something called command mode
and the other is edit mode so command
mode allows us to perform actions like
adding and deleting cells and you can
put yourself in command mode by hitting
the Escape key and the edit mode will
allow us to edit ourselves and you can
put yourself in edit mode by hitting the
enter key and we can also just click
into a cell to enter edit mode and you
can see when I did that we get this
green highlight around the cell so
that's an indication that we're in edit
mode and another indication is up here
in the top right you see that we have
this pencil icon here if I hover over
that you can see that that says edit
mode now if I hit the Escape key to go
back to command mode then you can see
that that pencil disappears and also our
cell here turned blue but I did want to
edit that cell so let's go ahead and
just click in there again and now let's
just add some simple code so I'm just
going to do a simple print hello world
okay so now that we have some code
within our cell how do we execute this
so if I just press ENTER you can see
that I'm just adding more lines to my
Python code here so if I want to execute
this code then I can come up here to
this cell menu and you can see that we
have three different options here I can
either run the cell run the cell and
select below or run the cell and insert
below so let's go ahead and walk through
these so if I just run the cell then you
can see that it executes the code that
was in our cell and displays the output
below here and the cell that we just ran
is still selected now if I come up here
and do a run cell and select below if I
do that then you can see that execute
the code in our cell and then it
selected the cell below that one now if
there isn't a cell below it which there
wasn't then it will just insert a cell
there so if I select this top cell again
and
rerun that then you can see that it
didn't add another cell but it did
execute that code and then selected that
cell below that and lastly if I just
choose our top cell here again and do
this run and insert below you can see
that even though there was an empty cell
below here it's still expert it's still
inserted this cell below the cell that
we just executed so those are the
differences between those three
different options there and the shortcut
keys for those at least on a Mac is ctrl
enter to just execute the cell that
you're currently in and stay there
shift enter will execute the cell and
move to the next one
so that's executes the cell and select
below and the option enter is to execute
the cell and insert below so you can see
that that inserted another cell below
after I executed that content now for
the rest of the video I'm going to be
using those keyboard shortcuts just so
that I can move a little bit more
quickly here I'm not going to be coming
up and clicking on the cell to run the
cell every time so if you see code
executing it's because I'm using those
keyboard shortcuts now one thing about
the Python code here is that this
actually behaves kind of like an
interactive prompt so I don't actually
have to print this out here if I instead
just came in here and did hello world
just like we would if we started up
Python in the terminal or something like
that if I go ahead and rerun that then
you can see that we get the same output
okay so you may have noticed these
incrementing numbers here beside the
cell where it says in 13 and out 13 here
now this is something that you have to
get used to when working with these
notebooks so these cells don't
necessarily have to be executed from top
to bottom like we're used to in regular
scripts so these numbers show us the
order in which these cells were executed
so for example if I replace this top
code here and I just say name is equal
to John and I execute that now currently
that doesn't give us any output but in
this next cell
I'm just going to say name and go ahead
and run that
can see that the output is John now
that's what we'd expect so far but in
this next cell I'm going to reset this
name value here and I'm just going to
say name is equal to Cori and I'm going
to go ahead and run that and now if I
come back here to this top cell and
rerun this code here now you can see
that that name variable printed out as
having the value of Cori even though we
didn't make that assignment until after
that cell and it's because these numbers
here determined the execution order not
just how things are assigned from top to
bottom now with that said you still want
these notebooks to be readable and easy
to understand so I'm still suggest
putting things in the correct order from
top to bottom but if you ever have a
variable that doesn't have the value
that you think it should have then you
might want to check these numbers here
on the side to make sure that your
execution order isn't out of whack or
anything like that now if you do get
things mixed up and you just want to
treat this like a normal script and run
everything from top to bottom then we
can come up here to the sell menu here
and we can just click on run all and
that will run all of the cells from top
to bottom now if I rerun that then you
can see that it prints out all of these
numbers here are 1920 they're all in
order from top to bottom and our name
variable is what we would expect in a
regular script and also you may have
seen in that cell drop down here that we
also have the options of being able to
execute all of the cells above or below
our current cell so if you have some
cells that take a long time to compute
and only want to re execute all of the
cells below that point then you have the
flexibility to do that okay so that's
how you execute some basic code from
within the cells so now let's look at
how we can add some markup so markup is
text that gets translated to HTML and we
can use it within our notebooks to
explain exactly what's going on and we
saw a lot of that and the ligo example
at the beginning of the video so let's
say that I wanted to add some markdown
to the top of this document here so
first I'm going to select this top cell
and now I'm going to add a new cell to
the top like
insert and then insert cell above and
now with that top cell selected I'm
going to come up here and click cell go
down to cell type and I'm going to
choose markdown now this isn't a
markdown tutorial so I'm not going to go
into detail about exactly what markdown
text gets translated in HTML but I'm
just going to drop in some sample
markdown from a snippets file that I
have pulled up here so I'm just going to
grab all of this sample markdown here
I'm just going to paste this into our
top cell now you can see that while
we're still in our edit mode here it
kind of gives us a little sample of what
we're going to get once we actually
execute this cell but we still have our
markdown here that hasn't been
translated completely yet so I'm going
to go ahead and just run that by hitting
ctrl enter then when we run that you can
see that our markdown got translated to
HTML so we have a header here a header
to a list and we have some italics and
bold and things like that okay so that's
how you can add markdown to a notebook
now let's take a look at some other
useful features that we can use within
these notebooks so our current kernel
here is using Python so any normal code
that we add to our cells here will be
interpreted as Python code but there are
some special commands that we can use
within our cells that won't just be seen
as Python code so for example here I'm
going to add another cell here below
this so one of these special commands is
if you put an exclamation point then it
will interpret this command as a bash
command so if I do exclamation point and
do like a pip list and run that then you
can see that the output that you get
from that would be the same as the
output if you were to run that command
from both in the command line so that's
kind of cool that you can run these bash
commands from directly within the
notebook now these notebooks also come
with a bunch of built-in commands that
they call magics so if you've looked at
notebooks before then you may have seen
these these are the ones that begin with
either 1 % or 2% signs so the single %
that means that the commands arguments
will all
come from that same line and those are
called line magics and the two percent
signs these mean that the entire cell
will be used as that commands arguments
and those are called cell magics so we
can actually use one of these magic
commands to list all of the other
available commands and the command to
list all those is called
LS magic so if I put a percent sign and
do LS magic and then run that cell so
now you can see that lists out all of
these magic commands that we can use and
it splits these up into line magics here
and cell magics here so let's go ahead
and take a look at a couple of these so
I'm going to go ahead and insert a cell
below here so that we can still see all
of these magics as we're working with
these so now if I wanted to print out my
current working directory then I could
just use a single % here and do a PWD
for print working directory if I run
that then you can see that it shows the
directory that we're currently in and
you can see in this list of available
line magics they also have an LS here so
I can list the files and folders within
that directory by doing an LS and if I
run that you can see that currently we
just have our single ipython notebook
file now I can also pass normal commands
to these just like I would within a
terminal so if I do an LS - la then
it'll do the long-form of those and you
can see that there are more files and it
lists out the users and permissions and
things like that okay so those two
commands that I just showed you are just
similar to just being able to run bash
commands within our notebook which we've
already looked at but there are some of
these magic commands that give us some
functionality beyond just the bash
commands so one of the more common magic
commands that you'll see within
notebooks is the matplotlib inline
command and that is mat plot lib and
then end line so what that does is it
allows matplotlib charts to be displayed
within our notebook so I'm actually not
going to execute this
yet and I'm going to execute your insert
a cell below here and first I'm going to
grab some sample code here from my
snippets that will create a very simple
map plot Lib chart so I'm just going to
go ahead and copy that and paste that in
here now this sample here is just some
snippet code that I got directly from
the matplotlib documentation so if I
paste this in here and try to run this
without first running this in line
command so I'm going to execute this and
try to show this plot and you can see
that this is just sitting here spinning
it's not doing anything and if we look
over here this asterisk just means that
it's still trying to run the cell to
completion so I'm just going to kill
this by coming up here to Colonel and
I'm just going to do a restart and clear
output and go ahead and hit YES on that
so now I'm going to try to run this
again but first I'm going to execute
this matplotlib in line magic command
first so if I run that and now you can
see that it executed with that one there
now I'm just going to go ahead and try
to display this chart within our
notebook so now you can see after we ran
that setup command there that our plot
shows up directly in the notebook now
this is extremely useful so this is
where we really start to see why these
notebooks are becoming really popular
because to be able to show plots and
things like that as we're stepping
through our code it really helps you
explore your data and code in real time
without needing to rerun the entire
script okay so let me show you just a
couple more of these magic commands that
I think that you'll find really useful
when you start using these notebooks so
we can see that one of these sell magic
commands here is this % % - % HTML and
that will allow us to render HTML
directly without using the markdown that
we looked at before and this is a sell
magic command which means that the
entire sell will be rendered as HTML and
not just the single line so just to show
you an example this I'm going to go back
to my snippets code here I'm just going
to grab an iframe and this iframe is
just going
to pull up one of my other YouTube
videos so if I go ahead and run this
cell then you can see that we can
actually embed this iframe directly in
our notebook here and really you can use
that to render any kind of HTML that
you'd want so you can render images or
links or anything like that directly
within the notebook here so I'm not
going to show an example of all of these
commands but I do kind of want to
highlight a couple of things that you
can do so you can see that they also
have a JavaScript command here so that
would be everything that you wrote in
that cell would get interpreted as
JavaScript code you can see that they
have a bash one here so that you can
actually write out a series of bash
commands and one so now there's also a
useful magic command here that we can
use to time our Python code and that is
this time it command here so if I grab
that I'm going to go ahead and insert
another cell here at the bottom and I'm
going to use this time at command now
you may have used time it and your
regular Python scripts before but this
allows us to easily add that
functionality into our notebooks with
just this one short command so let's say
that you wanted to time a list
comprehension where you squared the
numbers up to a thousand or something
like that so I think I have that example
yeah so I have that example here in my
snippets so I'm just going to go ahead
and grab that and paste it in and now if
we run that cell then you can see it's
actually going to run that time at
command on our code there and then you
can see that the output prints the
output from that time at command and
tells us the average time that it took
to execute that so that can be really
useful if you want to compare the
execution time of different functions
and things like that you can just add
that time at command to the top of your
cell and run those for multiple
functions and get the output right below
yourselves and like I said there's
plenty more that you can do with those
magic commands so if you do just run
this LS magic command then you can see
all the ones that are available for you
here and you can just play around with
any of these that you'd like now these
Jupiter notebooks
also have the ability to render certain
things within the notebook without any
kind of magic commands so for example we
can also display a panda's data frame
from directly within a notebook now I
thought I had a snippet for this but
apparently I don't sell just go ahead
and write this out really quick
so if we want to import pandas I'll do
import pandas as PD and import numpy as
MP and now I'm just going to create a
data frame here with some random value
so I'll do a panda's data frame I'm just
going to put some random numbers in here
so I'll do MP dot random dot Rand in and
I will pass in ten and five there and
then underneath here I'm just going to
go ahead and print out that data frame
so if I run that code then you can see
that just by printing out this data
frame here it actually outputs that
directly within our notebook and a nice
readable form and so if I was to do a DF
head there and rerun that then you can
see it does the same thing with just
those first few rows now if you don't
know what these pandas dataframes are
that's not a big deal I just want to
show you how you can display certain
things within the notebooks that may be
hard to visualize or display using a
normal icon script okay so another thing
that I wanted to go over as far as these
notebooks goes is that you can export
these notebooks in several different
formats so if I wanted to export this
notebook in HTML so that I could add it
to my blog or something like that then I
could just come up here to file that
could come to download as and you can
see that we have a lot of different
options here we could download this as a
Python file I want to choose HTML so
I'll download that as an HTML and if I
open up that file I just downloaded that
you can see that we have an HTML version
of this now these cells here I can't
edit these since now it's HTML but I
could post this in a blog or something
like that and you can see that it's nice
and readable has all of our code and all
of the output
now if you actually wanted to share this
notebook file with somebody then what is
actually in these notebook files so let
me go ahead and open up one of these up
in that's not the terminal window I want
I'll go ahead and open up this blank one
here so now if I do an LS here we can
see that I have our ipython notebook
file here so let's go ahead and see what
this looks like if we open this up
within a text editor so I just opened up
our notebook file here within sublime
text and we can see that it's really
just a JSON file that has all of the
information in here that we need so
that's how these files are actually
structured in the background okay so
another thing that I wanted to mention
about these notebooks is at the
beginning of this video
I mentioned that we could create
multiple kernels using multiple versions
of Python so if I do a new notebook here
you can see that we have Python root
which on my machine is Python 3 you can
say I also have this Python 2 kernel
here so how do you go about installing a
Python 2 kernel now this is another
instance where I think it's a little bit
more convenient to go with the anaconda
installation because with the Conda
virtual environment setup all you have
to do is install Jupiter within those
virtual environments and then they will
come up here as an option as a kernel
when you create a new notebook so really
this Python 2 7 here is just a Conda
environment that came with anaconda if I
do a Conda env list then you can see
that that Python 2 7 is just in here in
my anaconda environments and I go over
how to create those anaconda
environments and my other anaconda
installation video now if you didn't go
with the anaconda installation then you
can install a Python 2 kernel if you go
to their website then they have the pip
installation instructions that you need
to go through in order to install a
Python 2 kernel ok and before I end the
video here there is one last thing that
I wanted
to mention is that if you'd like some
practice or to see how other people are
using these notebooks then you can find
a lot of examples online if you do a
Google search for for Jupiter galleries
one of the top results is this ipython
github page now there are also newer
Jupiter notebooks on here also but they
had made this page before the name
change so it still says ipython here but
if you go to this page then there are a
lot of examples of notebooks that you
can actually download directly and play
around with so for example I'll just
scroll down here to introductory
tutorials and after I clicked on that
I'll go here to collection of notebooks
and from here we see a lot of sample
notebooks that we can play around with
so they have one about cell magics and
things like that so if I get come down
and click on this example for a
trapezoid rule you can see within this
notebook here that they have some
mathematical formulas they have some
cell that are some cells with some code
and they also have some visualizations
down here at the bottom so if I wanted
to I could actually come up here to the
top right of this notebook and download
this and so now I have that ipython
notebook in my downloads folder so I'm
just going to move that to my Jupiter
demo I'm just going to say move from my
downloads folder and that was called
trapezoid rule and I'm just going to
move it into the directory that I am
currently within here so now if I do an
LS then we can see that we have that
notebook in our demo directory there so
now I'm going to go back to our
dashboard and reload this you can see
now we have that trapezoid roll notebook
so now I can click on that and I will
just keep that as the Python 3 kernel
and click OK and now you can see that we
have that sample notebook that we can
play around with on our own so now we
can see all of the cells that we saw on
the website and if we want to see how
they did something so for example if I
wanted to see how they created
this formula then we can just click on
this cell and go into edit mode and we
can see exactly how they created that
and if I rerun that sell it reruns that
code and creates that formula again okay
so I think that's going to do it for
this video I hope this gave you all an
idea for how you can begin using these
Jupiter notebooks they're really
becoming popular it's a great way to
explore your data and your code and an
interactive way it's great for
displaying plots and charts and pandas
dataframes and all kinds of different
things and it's also something that's
already being used in real research so
