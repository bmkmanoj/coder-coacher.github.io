video we will start populating our table
with some records so if you remember in
the last video we created our table
called people and we populated this
table with two fields ID which is an
integer and name which is a variable
character string of a max of 255
characters so now let's actually start
adding records to this table now there
are a few different ways in which we can
write our insert statement to achieve
this so first let's just do an insert
into and then the name of our table
which is people so insert into people
and let's just do values of 1 and Cori
so 1 will be our ID Cori will be the
name let's go ahead and run that query
and if we look at the data table and
refresh this then you can see that we
have an ID of 1 and a name of Cori that
was added to our table now this is a row
in our table this is a record so now
let's go ahead and add a another record
to our database so let's do an ID of 2
and a name of Travis so let's go ahead
and run that query and look at our data
and refresh it and you can see that now
we have an ID of 2 and the name of
Travis now we can also specify the exact
fields that we want to populate within
our table so for example here right now
I'm running insert into people values -
and then the name the ID and then the
name but we can specify the exact fields
right here after the table name so if I
type in ID and name then these are going
to match up with the values that I pass
in so 2 is going to get passed in as the
ID Travis will get passed in as the name
so right here if I was to change this to
3 and then Dave and then ran this query
if we look back at our data and refresh
that then now we have another record in
our database with the information that
we inserted but you can also switch
these around to specify whatever order
that you want so that's one advantage to
doing it this
way so instead of ID and name I could do
name and ID and then in my values I have
to change these accordingly so I can do
a name of Bronx and I can give that an
ID of 4 so if I run that then we go back
to our data even though these were out
of order since we specified the order
here if we refresh that we can see that
we have an idea for and the name of
Bronx now the values that we insert into
our table they have to match the values
that we specified for our fields so for
example if I was accidentally to mix
these up and I was to do a name of
quarry and an ID of 5 but then the order
was ID and then name so what's going to
happen here is it's going to try to
insert quarry as the ID and 5 as the
name now if I run this you can see that
I get a syntax error so you can see that
this error says invalid input syntax for
integer and we were passing quarry as an
integer and it didn't like that and it
even gives us the statement here and if
it was a longer statement it would be
useful to know which line that was on so
now it's not like that populated our
database with bad data because since it
was an error it never even got added you
can see that there's no ID of 5 here or
name of 5 nothing got added in
incorrectly so if I switch these back
around and I do the ID of 5 and then the
name as quarry that's what we did before
so I can run that query you can see this
time we got no air and if i refresh our
table data then you can see that we
added in the correct record so there we
go I know that this was a shorter video
but we've added data to our table and
now we have several records to work with
and our next video will begin looking at
how we can retrieve values from our
table using the Select command and also
we'll use the where command which allows
us to specify exactly which records we
want to retrieve so that about does it
