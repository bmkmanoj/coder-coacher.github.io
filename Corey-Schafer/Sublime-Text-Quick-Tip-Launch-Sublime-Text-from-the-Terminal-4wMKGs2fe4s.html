video I wanted to show you how you can
open up files and directories using
sublime text from within your terminal
so if you use your terminal a lot you've
probably run into a situation where
you're within a project and you find the
file that you want to open or if you
want to open up the entire project what
you do is you go into finder you find
that project or you find that file and
you open it up that way but it's kind of
time-consuming it'd be really nice if we
had a command maybe called su BL and
then the name of the file that we wanted
and we could just open up the file that
way
well sublime text actually has in a
built-in command line tool that we can
use that does this but it doesn't add it
to our path automatically to where we
can use that command so the location of
this command is in applications sublime
text contents shared support and it's
within this bin folder and it's called
su VL so if I type out this whole
command and then type in X index.html
whenever I hit enter you can see that it
opens up that file from within sublime
text so that's exactly what we want but
this file or this line here is extremely
long it would be nice if we could just
type in this SUV L command and do it
that way now there are two ways that we
can go about this first
let me echo out my path here and so what
this shows is the these are the
locations where your computer looks for
these commands so I've got a couple
extra ones here but you can kind of see
a theme here there's user local bin user
bin bin user s bin so what we our two
options are we could add this whole line
here up to this bin folder we could add
that to our path or we could add this
command into one of these existing
folders and just link it to this command
here and that's the approach that I'm
going to take I just think that
it's easier it's one line you don't have
to go in and edit your a char C files
and things like that so the one line to
do that we can do an L n s which will
create a link and then we can just copy
this from before the entire thing and
paste that in so that is what we are
linking to and then to create our link
we'll just type in user and I'm going to
go ahead and go with this user local bin
and so user local bin and the name of
the command and I'm just going to stick
with SU BL so let's go ahead and hit
enter and now if I do an LS l a within
this user local bin directory I'm going
to take away that come in and then I'm
also going to do a grep for the name of
the command so let's hit enter and you
can see here that it found one entry and
this L right at the front means that
it's a link and you can see that it has
the name of the command here and that it
links to applications sublime text app
contents shared support bin and the
command that we want so now that that's
set up for us we should just be able to
type in the short command and then the
name of the file that we want hit enter
and it opens it up in sublime text and
this isn't only for opening up files we
can open up we can use this just like we
use any other terminal tool now so it
accepts relative path so we can type in
su VL and do a dot for the current
directory and then if I open up my
sidebar here and you can see that it
opened up the entire test project I can
do that command with a dot dot dash to
open up the directory above and you can
see that now I have three projects in
this parent directory so you can use
this just about any way that you want to
use it and it's a lot faster than
tracking down these files from within
your finder if you're already looking at
them from within your terminal anyway so
that about does it for this video now
you should be able to open up any files
or dress
trees from directly within your terminal
so if you guys have any questions about
this you know feel free to ask in the
comment section below
I hope that this video was useful for
you guys and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
