walkthrough here on how to use the font
awesome icon font and your desktop
applications first of all just go over
to the phone awesome website and you can
download the zip file from here and once
that is downloaded go ahead and unzip
that and navigate in here to this fonts
folder and inside here you'll find this
on awesome OTF file and now if we open
up our Applications folder then we will
find an application here called font
book so go ahead and open that up
and if we drag this font awesome not OTF
file over here in the font book and it's
going to install that onto our Mac so
that we can use this in any of our
desktop applications so if you go into
the user file here you can see that font
awesome has been added so we can go
ahead and close these windows down and
now back over here on the font on some
website if we go up here to icon and
then they have a link here called cheat
sheet this is what we're going to use to
use these fonts in our desktop
applications so say we wanted to use
this Apple logo here we can just
highlight that and copy it and now let's
open up an application I'll open up
Photoshop here and create a new document
and this already has fallen awesome
selected for me but it's something else
for you then go ahead and select that
from the drop-down menu and then you can
just go ahead and paste that in there
and so as you can see the icons work and
we can get rid of this text and you can
use this icon just like any other font
so you can you know take the size up
without losing any clarity you can
change its color yeah and you can use
this font anywhere in any of your
applications so if I let me close down
Photoshop here and open up let's open up
pages
so it actually won't be listed in this
list here if we go up to format font and
show fonts it will be in our all fonts
collection and scroll up here and find
it there we go is that down a set in
okay perfect so yeah so we can use this
just like any other font make it a lot
bigger get rid of this text here you
know change the color do whatever you
want with it
so hopefully this walkthrough was
helpful for you guys and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
