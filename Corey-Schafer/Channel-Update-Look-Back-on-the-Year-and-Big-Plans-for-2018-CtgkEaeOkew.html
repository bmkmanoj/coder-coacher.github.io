this video I just want to give a quick
update on the channel I quick look back
on 2017 and also what to look forward to
in 2018 so first of all I've been out of
town a lot lately so I've been a bit
behind on putting out videos but I just
wanted to let you know that I will be
releasing a video this week and have a
few others that I'm currently working on
so I've just been busy traveling home
for the holidays and also I went out of
town for the Amazon Web Services
conference a couple of weeks ago and the
conference was a great experience and
there are a lot of videos that I'd like
to make in the future on Amazon Web
Services and how to get started using
those but I was also so busy that I
wasn't able to put as much time as usual
into getting videos released but I will
be putting out a video this week on
Python contacts managers so be on the
lookout for that okay so I also wanted
to give a quick update on the channel
and what to expect moving forward so
2017 was a big year for this channel the
most popular videos released this year
was probably the nine part introduction
of Python series where we covered you
know Python data structures and
functions and working with the standard
library but there was also a lot of
other popular videos released you know
covering regular expressions and unit
testing essential skills for programmers
web scraping and several other topics
and I just really want to thank everyone
who has subscribed to the channel and
also those who support the channel so at
the beginning of 2017 I think I had less
than 20 thousand subscribers and it
looks like we're going to go into 2018
with probably around eighty thousand but
just recently we hit 75,000 subscribers
just the other day so I really want to
thank you all for that and also on
patreon I think I started the year
having around 20 patreon supporters at
the beginning of 2017 and will probably
end that with around 75 supporters going
into 2018 so right now we have 74 and I
just really want to thank all of you all
currently there are 55 who wanted to be
you know who were ok with the public
contributors page on my website but I
just really appreciate all the support
that you guys give the channel and you
really make it possible because I really
wouldn't be able to put as much time
into these tutorials without you all and
it really helps with creating these
videos moving forward
so speaking of moving forward I also
wanted to mention a little of what to
expect in 2018 so I really want to put
out a lot more content in 2018 than any
year before so there have been a lot of
larger tutorials that many of you have
been wanting for a long time and I
really want to be sure to cover as many
of those topics as possible so I'm
finally going to get around to getting
out of series on creating a
full-featured web application I spelled
that wrong don't worry about that so
I'll do one of those in flask and Django
and possibly some other frameworks as
well and I'd also like to do a series on
data science where I cover you know
things like numpy and pandas and Syfy
and also I'd like to cover some DevOps
and assist admin videos covering you
know getting started with Amazon Web
Services and how to use docker and
ansible and all kinds of different
technologies and there are some other
big announcements that I have in mind
for early 2018 but I'm not quite to the
point where I'm ready to talk about
those just yet but early next year I'll
make a couple of videos covering some
more future plans that I have in mind so
that is going to do it for this video
again I apologize that the holidays and
some traveling have slowed down my
releases a little bit but watch out for
a new video coming out this week on
contacts managers and I should be back
on schedule with regular releases soon
and as usual if you have any questions
and feel free to ask in the comment
section below and I'll do my best to
answer those and also like I mentioned
before if you enjoy these tutorials and
would like to support them then there
are several ways you can do that the
easiest ways to simply like the video
and give it a thumbs up and also it's a
huge help to share all these videos with
anyone who you think would find them
useful and if you have the means you can
contribute through patreon and there's a
link to that page in the description
section below be sure to subscribe for
future videos
thank you all for an excellent year and
I'm really looking forward to 2018 and
the topics that we'll be able to cover
have a happy holidays and thank you all
for watching
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
