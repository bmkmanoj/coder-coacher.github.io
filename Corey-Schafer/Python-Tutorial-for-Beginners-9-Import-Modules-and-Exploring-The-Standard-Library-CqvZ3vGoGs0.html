this video we'll be learning how to
import modules we'll start by importing
modules that we've written and then
we'll explore a bit of the standard
library and how we can import those
modules to solve a lot of common
problems so I have a module here called
my module pi now within this module we
have a print statement and we'll talk
about that in just a minute we also have
this test variable set to test string
and then we have this function called
find index and this find index function
takes in two arguments it takes in a
list to search and a target that we're
looking for and we can see that we have
some documentation here that just says
that this finds the index of a value in
a sequence and then it returns that
index but if it doesn't find that value
then it just returns negative one so
let's say that we wrote this function
and that we want to use this and other
modules or scripts so what we're going
to want to do is import this so I have
another module over here which is just
our intro PI file that we've been
working with now within this file we
have this courses variable that is just
a list of course names so let's say that
we want to use that find index function
from my module now I actually created
this my module in the same directory as
my intro PI so that means that we're
going to be able to directly import that
now when we import a file it actually
runs all of the code from the module
that we import so that's how it creates
all the functions and variables but if
we have any other code like print
statements or anything like that then
that will be run as well so that's why I
have the print statement here in my
module so that we can see when that
happens so to import this module we can
just come to the top of the file here
and say import my module and again we
can import that directly because it's in
the same directory as our intro dot PI
file and now if we run this with this
import then we can see that it imported
successfully because it printed out that
print statement within that module okay
so let's say that we want to use that
find index function now when importing
modules like this we just can't call our
find index function we instead have to
type the module name first and then what
we want to grab from that module so if
we wanted to use that then we could say
let's say index
is equal to my module dot find index and
now we'll pass in the list that we want
to search which is courses and now the
target that we're looking for so we'll
go ahead and say that we're looking for
mass and now let's print out that index
and run that so now we can see that that
works it returned one and one is the
index of the math value okay so if we're
using this find index function multiple
times throughout our script then it
might get a little old and take up a lot
of room to keep typing my module dot
find index everywhere we can actually
specify a name that we want to use for
our imported module and usually this is
used to make the module name shorter so
for example when we're importing my
module here at the top we could instead
say import my module as mm or any other
name that we come up with and now when
using this import throughout the script
instead of typing out my module
everywhere we can instead just use mmm
so if I save that and run it then we'll
see that that still works now you'll see
this a lot with modules like numpy or
pandas so you might see someone who does
an import and they'll do import numpy as
NP or something like that now you might
be wondering if there's a way that we
can import the function itself and there
is a way to do this so instead we could
say from my module import and then what
we want to import from that module so we
want to import find index so now when we
use this throughout the code now we can
just use that find index function
anywhere and that really cuts down on
the typing so now we can save that and
run it and see that it still works now
one thing to note about that approach is
that it only gives us access to that
find index function and not everything
else and the module so for example
you'll remember that we had this test
variable equal to this test string so
when we do the import this way now we
don't have access to that test variable
since we're only now importing the find
index function now if we wanted to
import that variable then we would have
to include it by putting in a comma and
specifying what we want so we want to
say from my module import find index
comma and test so now down below here we
can print out that test variable and if
we run that and we can see that we do
have access to that test variable now
now when doing the import this way we
still have access to that as keyword so
if we wanted to make this even shorter
hand that we can say import find index
as F I and now throughout our code we
can replace that with F I and run that
you can see that it still works now at
this point that's not really readable
anymore so don't rename something like
that unless it's still readable and make
sense to others who are reading your
code so now let's go ahead and just undo
that change now using this method of
importing we'd have to add commas and
specify each value that we want to
import now there is a way to just import
everything and I'll show you how to do
this but I have to be honest I never use
this and it's pretty frowned upon and
we'll see why that is but if we wanted
to just import everything that we could
say from my module import star so if we
run this and we can see that everything
still works we still have access to this
find index function and this test
variable but the reason that this is
frowned upon is because now we can't
tell what came from that imported module
and what didn't so if we're having
problems with this find index function
and we might try to track down where
that function came from or where it was
defined and with that asterisks it's
just not obvious that it came from that
module that was imported so instead
we'll go back to importing both of those
directly so basically importing
everything with that asterisk just makes
it harder to track down a problem so
it's better to do it this way okay so
when we import a module how does it know
where to find this module so we didn't
pass in a file path or tell Python where
to find this module I just found it so
the way that this works is that when we
import a module it checks multiple
locations and the locations that it's
checks is within a list called sista and
we can actually see this list if we
import the Syst module so I'll import
sis and now down here will comment out
these two prints they
and now let's print out that sis not
path and run that so this is the list of
directories on my machine where Python
looks for modules when we run an import
and it looks in this order now this
first value here is just the directory
where I'm currently running the script
from and the my module python file that
we were importing is within that
directory also so that's how it found it
okay so what directories are added to
this cyst so directories get added in
this order first the directory
containing the script that we're running
so that is why this directory where
we're running the script is the first
value insist that path so you can always
import modules from the same directory
and next it adds directories listed in
the Python path environment variable and
we'll talk more about the Python path
environment variable in just a minute
and then after the Python path it then
adds the standard library directories
and that's how we can import those
modules from the standard library and
lastly it adds the site packages
director directory for third-party
packages and we'll look at all of these
so first let's see what it looks like
when the module that we want to import
isn't in the same directory as the
script that we're trying to import it
from so I'm going to move the module
that we've been importing from the same
directory into a directory on our
desktop so I've got finder pulled up
here and I'm just going to drag this my
module over here into this my modules
directory that is on my desktop so now
that module that we're trying to import
is in a completely different location on
our machine so if we go back to here to
our script and now try to run this and
we can see that we get this air module
not found no module named my module now
there are a couple of approaches that we
can take here first is that we can
actually manually add that directory to
our sistas list
so this sistah is a list just like any
other that we've been looking at and we
can treat it like one so before we try
to import my module we could add that
directory to sis not path so I'm going
to import this here at the top before we
try to import that
and then I'll say sis dot path dot
append and the location on my machine
this is probably going to be different
on yours but the location on mine is you
users - Cory s desktop - my modules and
I believe I need a - here at the
beginning as well so if I save that and
run it we can see that when we appended
that directory to our sis not that we
were now able to import that module and
run our code but this isn't the best
looking approach because we're appending
this directory before our other imports
and also if we were to import our module
and we had this manually hard-coded in
multiple locations and we have to change
all of those so instead we can make this
change and the next place sistah path
looks and if we remember that is the
Python path environment variable now
changing the environment variables is
different on Mac and Windows so we'll
show how to do this on both really quick
so first we'll see how to do this on a
Mac and to do this I'm going to pull up
my terminal and we can set environment
variables by adding them to the dot -
underscore profile file in our home
directory and you can edit this file
with any text editor but I'm going to
use the one built into the terminal here
called Nano since Nano is easy for
anyone to use so we're going to say Nano
and then a tilde
- just makes sure that we're working
within our home directory and we'll say
dot - underscore profile now I might
have more stuff in this file than you do
these are just personal preferences and
customizations but I'm going to scroll
down here to the end of the file and set
my Python path but you can set this
anywhere in this file that you'd like so
we're going to set this by saying export
Python path all uppercase and then
equals and now we want to set that
location so I'm just going to come over
here and grab that location and paste
that in those quotes and we want it to
look just like that no space in between
the equals and the path so to save that
we can just hit ctrl X and then Y to
save and then enter to keep the same
file name and now we can either restart
our terminal or run a source command
on that file but I'll just restart the
terminal here and pull this up and now
if we run Python then let's see if we
can import that module so import my
module and we can see that that worked
and the reason that that worked is
because if we import sis and look at our
sis
then we can see that after our current
directory that we have the directory
that was added there and the reason that
it's added is because we added it to our
Python path environment variable so now
let's take a look at how to set this
environment variable on Windows now to
set this environment variable on Windows
we can click on our start button here
and then right click on computer and go
to properties and from properties we
want to go to advanced system settings
and from here at the very bottom we can
click on environment variables and now
we can create a new environment variable
so we'll click new and we'll name this
python path all uppercase there and then
for the location that's going to be C
we're going to go to the desktop again
so again this is specific to my desktop
but it may be a little bit different on
yours so quarry MS slash desktop and
then the name of that directory is my
dash modules and again this Python path
is going to be unique to your own
machine so let's hit OK there and ok to
save those and exit out of that and now
if we open up our command prompt by
going to start run CMD and then typing
in python now we should be able to
import that module just by saying import
my module and if we run that and we can
see that it imported that module
successfully now the reason that worked
is because if we import sis and look at
our sis pad then after our current
directory you can see that our directory
that we added to our Python path is the
second one that it looks at here so that
is how we add that environment variable
on Windows so now I'll switch back to my
native OS now I do want to point out
that if you're using an editor like
sublime text or eclipse or pycharm then
these may need to have their environment
variables set in a different way
and that's different for every program
so instead of going through each
individual one and showing how you can
likely find out how to do that just by
searching for your editor plus Python
path and there should be plenty of
resources showing you how to do that
okay so going back to this sista now
after the directories in the Python path
environment variable that we just looked
at after that sista path looks at the
standard library directories now this is
what allows us to import modules
directly from the standard library so
when something is part of the standard
library it means that we're able to use
it without installing anything
separately so the standard library is
incredibly useful because if you're
performing a common task then most
likely someone has already written the
functionality and if we use it from the
standard library that we can be sure
that it's been written by some of the
best programmers in the world and has
been optimized to be as performant as
possible now that's not to say that you
shouldn't try to write your own versions
of some of these things just to get some
practice but as far as using any of that
functionality in production it's
probably a good idea to use the
tried-and-true standard library so for
example let's say that we wanted to grab
a random value from a list of values so
you could probably write something to do
this on your own but that functionality
is already available to us when we use
the random module from the standard
library so let's go ahead and take a
look at this so I'll get rid of
everything here just to clean up except
for our courses list now this random
module is just part of the standard
library and we can just say import
random and if we wanted to grab a random
value from our courses list then we
could just say random course is equal to
random dot choice and then pass in our
courses list so now if we print out that
random course and run that and we can
see it gave us a random value and if we
run this multiple times then we can see
that it gives us a random value just
about every time we run through now I'm
not going to go through all of the
functionality in the standard library
but I will create a future video to go
over some of these modules in depth but
right now I just want to give you an
idea of what's available to us so here
are a few more useful standard library
modules so if
we need to perform some common
mathematical operations then we can
import the math module and now we can do
some mathematic calculations so if we
needed to convert 90 degrees into
radians then we could say rads is equal
to mass dot radians and pass in 90 and
then if we print rads and run that and
we can see that we get that conversion
and if we wanted to get the sine of that
value and we could pass those radians
into the sine method so I can say math
not sign a sin those radians and if I
run that then we can see that one is the
sine of 90 degrees okay and another
useful module from the standard library
is the eight-time module now this allows
us to work with dates and times and
while we're at it let's also go ahead
and import the calendar module now these
have some similarities but they're also
very different so for example if I
wanted today's date and we could just
say today is equal to eight times eight
dot today and if we print this out and
run that then we can see that that gives
us today's date now with the calendar
module we can ask for example is 2017 a
leap year so I could print out and say
calendar dot is leap and pass in 2017 if
I run that we can see that that's false
but if I instead change that to 2020 and
run that then you can see that that is
true in the last standard library module
that we'll look at for now is the OS
module so I will import OS now this is
going to give us access to the
underlying operating system so for
example if I wanted to see what
directory we're currently in with this
script then I could print out OS dot get
CWD which is current working directory
so if we run that and we can see that it
prints out the current working directory
where this script is located now this OS
module has a ton of other functionality
it gives us the ability to scan the
filesystem and create files delete files
and all of that so you can see how these
standard library modules provide a ton
of functionality that might be
riki or take forever for us to write
ourselves so Python comes with a ton of
stuff available to us and makes it super
easy to get them imported and running so
another great thing about Python is that
these modules are just Python files
themselves and we can view the location
of a module just by printing out its
dunder file method where it's done your
file attribute I'm sorry so if we print
out OS dot Thunder file and thunder just
means two underscores and don't worry
why those are double underscores that'll
be a topic for a future video so if we
run this then we can see that it prints
out the location of this file on our
filesystem and if we open up that Python
directory where that file lives and we
could see the entire standard library so
I actually have this open right here so
let me open this up real quick so I
actually have opened that Python three
six directory where the entire standard
library lives now I know that this may
be a little small over here for you to
see on my screen but let's go ahead and
look through a couple of these files so
these are all in alphabetical order so
one of the first piles in the standard
library is actually this anti-gravity
module now this is kind of a joke in the
Python community so this is a module
that you can import called antigravity
that will open up a web comic on your
machine and even though this is part of
the standard library we can just open up
this module here and see exactly how
this is done so we can see that
basically it just imports this web
browser module and opens up the web
browser to this page here and I know
that people are probably going to be
curious what this comic is now so let's
go ahead and import that so back in
intro PI I'll just delete everything and
do import anti-gravity and run this file
then we can see it just opens up our web
browser to this comic and I'll leave
this open while we close out here so if
you get a chance then don't be afraid to
go into the standard library and look
around at how different things are done
it's a great way to learn now I'm not
going to lie there's definitely some
complicated code in there but you'll be
surprised how much you can understand if
you just poke around a bit okay so I
think that's going to do it
with this video so where do we go from
here so so far in this series we've
covered a lot of the fundamentals and
working with Python so we've learned
about different data types conditionals
loops functions and importing modules
and a bit of the standard library now I
think that just about anyone would agree
that no matter what specialty you plan
on going into for Python whether it's
back in web development data science
building desktop applications no matter
what route you decide to take you're
going to need the fundamentals that
we've covered up until this point but
now that you understand these
fundamentals the next topics that you
learn are up to you so you can jump into
learning object-oriented programming and
Python you can learn how to work with
files and file data start learning about
a web framework basically anything that
you want so I'm going to keep adding
additional videos on to this playlist
that I believe will be a good
progression as you continue to learn
Python but these videos won't be
numbered any more after this video and
the reason for that is that I don't want
to give the impression that you have to
watch one before understanding the
others so I don't want them to be
numbered to make you feel like you have
to understand virtual environments
before learning how to work with file
objects or something like that so you
can just skip around depending on what
it is that you're wanting to learn so I
hope that that makes sense now if anyone
has any questions about what we covered
in this video then feel free to ask in
