this video we'll be learning about loops
and iterations specifically we'll be
going over for loops and while loops now
we've seen loops a couple of times in
our previous videos when looping through
strings or lists but there's some more
functionality that we haven't gone over
yet that we'll see in this video but
first let's just do a quick recap so
we've got a list of numbers here with
numbers 1 through 5 so let's loop
through this list so to do this we're
going to use a for loop so we'll say for
numb in nums and within here I'm just
going to print out that none so what
we're saying here is that we want to
create a loop where we're looping
through each value of our list and each
time through the loop this num variable
will be equal to the next item in the
list so the first time through it will
be equal to 1 the next time through
would it be equal to 2 and so on
so if we run this we can see that it
looked through and printed each number
of our list so now let's look at two
important keywords when working with
loops and these are the break and
continue keywords so the break keyword
will completely break out of a loop and
the continue keyword moves on to the
next iteration of the loop so first
let's look at the break statement so
let's say that we are looking for a
certain number in our list and once we
find it we don't need to continue
looping through the rest of our values
now this is when the break statement
comes in handy so let's say that we're
looking for the value of 3 so I can come
in here to our list and I could say if
num equals equals 3 and within this
conditional we'll print out that we
found it and then we will break out of
that loop so now let's go ahead and run
this so we can see that it looped
through the numbers 1 &amp;amp; 2 but it didn't
hit this conditional when the num
equaled 1 and the num equaled 2 and
since those first two values didn't meet
this conditional and it didn't print out
found and it didn't break out of the
loop but when it got to number 3 it did
meet this conditional
so it printed out found and then our
break statement broke out of the for
loop and when it broke out of the for
loop you can see that we didn't iterate
through any more values so we did not
get through two values for or values
five now notice that we broke out of our
loop before we printed the number so the
three never got printed out
but if our print statement were above
this conditional then the three would
have been printed out so the break
statement breaks out of the loop but
what if we wanted to just ignore a value
but not break out of the loop completely
so to do this we can use the continue
statement now continue we'll skip to the
next iteration of a loop so if we
replace this break statement with
continue and run this so we can see here
that just like before the first two
times through with one and two it didn't
meet this conditional so it didn't do
anything within this if block and it
just printed out our number but when we
got to the number three it did meet this
conditional and it came in here and
printed out found and then our continue
statement just skip to the next
iteration without coming out here and
printing out the number three so as soon
as we hit continue then it just went to
the next iteration which was four and
five so when four and five ran through
they didn't meet these conditionals and
it just printed out the number so it's
important to understand the break and
continue statements and the differences
between those because there's a lot of
different use cases for when they come
and handy to solve certain problems okay
so now let's look at something that we
might run into which is a loop within a
loop and this is possible so within our
loop here I'm going to replace this
conditional with an inner loop so now
I'll say for letter in and I'll just
make a string here of ABC now within
this inner loop then I'll just go ahead
and print out num comma and a letter so
now what's going to happen here is that
for each number it'll loop through every
character in this string and print out
the number and the character and then
move on to the next number and do it all
over again so let's run this and see
what we get
let me make this just a little bit
larger here so now we can see that what
happened is that for one it looped
through every letter in the string and
then after it finished that inner loop
then it moved on to the next number
before doing the exact same thing so we
have 1a 1b 1c then it moved onto to 2a
2b 2c and so on so what this really did
is it gave us every combination of those
numbers and characters now you want to
be careful with nested lists because
these combinations can grow pretty
quickly so if you have nested loops with
a lot of different values and it may
take a while to loop through all of
those different combinations okay so
something that will probably run into a
lot is that there's going to be times
when we just want to go through a loop a
certain number of times and there's a
built-in function called range that is
really useful for this so let's say that
we wanted to just run through a loop ten
times so to do this we can just say for
I in range 10 and within here we will
just print out I so now if we run this
and we can see that it just prints out
zero through nine which is ten items so
we start at zero and go up to but not
including this number that we passed
into range now if we don't want to start
at zero and we can also pass a starting
value into range so if we wanted to
start at one and print out the values
one through ten and what we could do is
say that we want to start at one and now
we are going to have to go up to 11
because it doesn't include the last
value so now if we run this then we can
see that now it started at 1 and goes up
to but not including 11 so 1 through 10
okay so now let's take a look at wild
loops so our four loops iterated through
a certain number of values but while
loops will just keep going into a until
a certain condition is met or until we
hit a break so for example let's say
that we had a variable here of X equal
to zero and now we can say that while
that X is less than 10 and then
we want to do is just print out X and
then we will iterate xi1 now we have to
remember that this loop is going to go
on forever until this condition here
evaluates to false so if we want this
loop to end at some point then we have
to remember to increment this X so that
at some point it will be greater than or
equal to ten so that it breaks out so
now if we run this then we can see that
it prints out zero through nine so it
came in and saw that X was zero which is
less than ten so it goes through the
loop prints the value and increment X by
one now X is equal to one and it does
this check again so one is still less
than ten so it stays in the loop and it
does this until we increment X from nine
to ten and then it will come in here and
make that check and it checks if ten is
less than ten which it doesn't which
evaluates to false so it breaks out of
that loop now at any point you can just
use a break to break out of the while
loop just like we did with the for loop
so if I came in here and I said if X is
equal to five then we just want to break
out so if we run that and we can see
that it went 0 through 4 and once X was
equal to 5 then we hit that break
statement now sometimes you'll just want
to create an infinite loop that never
ends until we get some input or find
some value now to create an infinite
loop you can just replace the comparison
that we're doing here with a value of
true so now that we have an infinite
loop there's no conditional here that
can break out so now we have to have
this break statement in here if we ever
want to stop this loop so if we run this
and we can see that we get the same
output there now in this example we're
using a conditional but this is also how
you would keep a loop going indefinitely
until you find or receive values that
you're looking for now if you ever
accidentally get stuck in an infinite
loop then within most environments or
operating systems you can interrupt that
by pressing ctrl C to stop the process
so if we comment out our conditional
here
the break statement then this is going
to get stuck in an infinite loop and
just go on forever
so now if we run this code and we can
see that we get stuck in this infinite
loop where it just keeps incrementing X
by one and printing out X now to get out
of this on most operating systems you
can press control C and it will
interrupt that so I press control C and
you can see that it was canceled and if
you are in your terminal or command
prompt and control control C should send
a keyboard interrupt okay so I think
that is going to do it for this video I
hope that now you have a clearer
understanding of the different loops on
how to break and continue statements
work in the next video we'll be learning
how to write functions but if anyone has
any questions about what we covered in
