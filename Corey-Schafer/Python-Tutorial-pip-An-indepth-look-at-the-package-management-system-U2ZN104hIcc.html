wanted to take a look at the Python
package manager tip and also go over
some of the most frequent commands that
you're going to use whenever you start
dia you spent so with that let's go
ahead and get started so first things
first one of the best resources is if
you just type in tip help then it will
bring up all the commands and options
that you can use so you can see here
there's not a whole lot but it shows you
install uninstall freeze and also some
of the options that you can use also
with that we can also do a pip help and
then we can type in a specific commands
so if I type in pip help install now
it's going to bring up the options for
install so you can see here that we have
tack are for a requirements file you can
do an upgrade and also install things
per user basis and things like that so
with the help files all the way let's go
ahead and take a look at how we'll
actually use this so say you want to
find a package if you're looking for a
package you don't know exactly what it's
called you can just do a search so let's
say I do a pip search on this package
and it is going to return to me the
package name and also a description of
the package here so once you find the
package name then you can go ahead and
install it so I'll do a pip install and
choose the package that we searched for
and now you can see that it says that
this was successfully installed so if we
want to take a look at our install
packages we can do a pip list and it
will show us all the packages that we
currently have installed so you can see
here this is the package that we just
installed if we don't want that package
we can do a pip uninstall and choose
that package and then it's going to ask
us if we want to continue hit yes now
you can see that it's successfully
uninstalled and now let's do another fit
blue
and you can see that that package that
we just uninstalled is no longer listed
another thing you'll notice whenever it
lists packages it lists the package and
it lists the version number so how do
you know if this version is the latest
version of this package well with v list
we can do a tactic outdated or we can
just do a single - with a no hit enter
and now you can see one of our packages
isn't running the latest version of the
package this setup tools the current
version that we have installed is 12 and
the latest is 15 so to update this
package what we'll do is if if install
and then an upper case you for upgrade
and then we can type in the package now
you can see that was successfully
installed if I do a pup list of the
packages now you can see that our setup
tools is at the latest version now for
demonstration purposes let me go ahead
and reinstall the package that we
uninstalled a little bit ago and now if
I do a 5th list now let's say that
you're working on a project and you want
to provide maybe somebody else who wants
to work on the project you want to
provide them with a list of all the
packages that they need for that project
now one thing you could do is just type
out pip list and then they could
manually copy down all of those packages
and version numbers and install them
that way but if you have a really long
list of packages then this definitely
isn't the best way to do it
for this we're going to use something
called a freeze command if we type in
pip freeze and what this does is it
outputs all of our packages and version
numbers in a requirements format so if
we wanted to send this to somebody then
what we could do is pipe this or
actually output this to a requirements
file so I could type in require
that's dot txt and hit enter
now if I do cat requirements txt you can
see that it lists our package and
version number so if you were to send
this requirements text file to somebody
how would they install all those
packages using pip well I have a sample
file here that I'm going to use this our
test dot txt and you can see I have a
few packages listed here so let's say I
wanted to install all of these packages
now the way you would do this is you
could type in pip install and then
attack our and what the R is is it
saying hey we're going to use a
requirements file and the name of this
file is our underscore test txt hit
enter and it's going to go through and
it's going to install all those packages
and that version of that package now
that those are finished installing if I
do a pip list that you can see it has
installed all those packages at the
exact same version number that was in
the requirements file now those simple
basics are pretty much what you're going
to use pip for most of the time but I do
want to show you one last trick here
these packages that are just installed
if I do a pip list outdating now you can
see I have multiple packages here that
are out of date now I could go through
and do it currently doesn't have a way
to upgrade all packages that need
upgrading you could go through and do
each one of these manually but if you
have a lot of packages then you know
that could be a lot of time to waste
so on stackoverflow there is an answer
here by rbp and he gives this good
command here that we'll go through and
do this for you so let me paste this in
and walk through exactly what it does
okay so first we have pip fries which
outputs all of the requirements for the
packages that we currently have and this
tactic local here if you're in a
environment that has access to your
global packages then it will only print
out local packages and then you pipe
that output to this grep command here
and actually I'm not entirely sure what
this grep command does I think he has it
listed on his answer over here so this
skips - a package definitions I've never
run into that but maybe it's useful for
some cases so then after it runs to that
grep command then it gets piped in to
this cut command here and what this cut
command does is it sets the delimiter to
an equal sign and then it only returns
the first argument back of that result
so let's see exactly what that would
look like here so if I go all the way
back here to this grep command and hit
enter then you can see it outputs all of
these requirements files with these
equals equals and then the version
number and whenever you add in that cut
command all it does is it will cut out
after or before the equal sign there and
only return the package name so now we
have a list of all of our packages and
then lastly the last part of the command
takes this output as arguments one at a
time and runs that to the command pip
install PACU which we went over earlier
which is upgrade and that will go
through and upgrade every one of the
packages that we had outputted so if I
hit enter there now you can see that
it's gone through each package that
needed upgraded and is doing so now
after that's finished updating if I do a
tip list you can see the list of all of
our packages and version numbers if I do
a pip list outdated then we shouldn't
have any listed yeah and it returned
with no packages that need an upgrade so
that about does it I hope that this
quick overview of pip was useful for you
