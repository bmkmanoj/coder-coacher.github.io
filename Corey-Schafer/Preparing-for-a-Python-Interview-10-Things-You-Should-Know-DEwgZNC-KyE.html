video we're going to learn how to
prepare for a Python interview and ten
things that you should know before going
into this interview so I'm going to go
over some different advice and we'll
also look at some code examples to get
you ready
so one thing before I get started is
that a lot of what I'm going to say here
applies to entry-level Python positions
so if you're applying for a senior level
position then likely that's going to
require you to know all of the items in
this list but then you'll also need to
know some more advanced topics as well
so with that said let's go ahead and get
started so the first thing is that you
should know how to write code on a
whiteboard area or a piece of paper now
this isn't just specific to Python this
goes for any programming language that
you're going to have an interview with
because a lot of companies won't have a
computer setup for your interview so
you're likely going to be in a room with
either a notebook or a whiteboard and
live coding might not even come up in
your interview but if it does then you
need to be ready to do that without a
computer so if you've never done this
before then you'd actually be surprised
at how hard it is to not use a computer
so you might want to go ahead and start
doing all of your practice problems that
you're preparing for your interview do
them all on a whiteboard or on a piece
of paper and then go back and check all
of those answers on a computer to make
sure that you got all the syntax correct
and everything like that okay so moving
on to number two know the basic control
flow within Python so my control flow I
mean know how to use for loops while
loops if and else statements and things
like that so I have a code example here
that we can take a look at so I know a
lot of this looks extremely basic but
like I said before you're not going to
have a computer so you want to know how
to write these things out without
thinking about it you're not going to
have any auto-completion or anything
like that so know how to write down a
for loop and loop through a certain
amount of numbers so if I run this code
here it just loops these numbers you
want to know how to use while loops
because those could come up in an
interview as well
and then you also want to know how to
use your if and else statements and also
your L if statements here now I know
these three things you know for loops
while loops and these if statements I
know it seems completely basic but you'd
be surprised at how many people freeze
up on these very basic questions
whenever they are new to the interview
process so just be sure that you can
write them down all by hand and that you
know I'm inside it out and exactly how
the program is going to flow through all
of these conditionals okay so number
three be able to discuss how you've used
Python in the past so your interviewer
is likely going to ask you about past
projects and you just don't want to draw
a blank so if you've never used Python
professionally and you're applying for
an entry-level position then be sure to
write a basic project before the
interview so that you can have some
example of something that you've written
in your free time and also whatever you
choose to write try to make it something
that's interesting and that will be
interesting to your interviewer you know
just don't tell them how you've solved a
bunch of sample interview problems like
fizzbuzz and Fibonacci sequences and
things like that so for example if you
need a couple of ideas for some cool
programs that you could write maybe you
want to play around with web scraping
and make a script that pulls weather
information each day you can use the
beautifulsoup module for that or you
could write a program that performs
system tasks so you could write a
program that cleans up folders on your
computer or move files around displays
CPU and memory or something along those
lines so for example I've written a
really small program here that just goes
uses the OS module and the glob module
goes into this directory here if I run
this code it just goes into my demo
directory here and prints out all of the
JPEG images so you know something like
this just learn how to write a file like
this and then whenever your interviewer
ask you the question you know
you can say something interesting like
whoa once I did write a program that
looked through my file system and found
all these images and move them to a
specific location or something like that
so those are just a couple of examples
and ideas to get you started but I'm
sure that you can think of some really
cool ideas on your own after thinking
about it for a few minutes okay so
number four know how to solve common
interview problems and questions so a
little bit ago I mentioned fizzbuzz and
Fibonacci sequences and things like that
those are some common questions that
interviewers like to ask now there's
been a lot of debate around that type of
interview process on online forums a lot
of people say that those type of
problems aren't a good indicator of
programming skill and that interviewer
should should ask better problems that
more reflect real-world situations but
even though there's a lot of debate
whether interviewers should ask those
questions a lot of interviewers do ask
those questions so so whether or not you
think they should or shouldn't is a
totally different discussion but but you
should be prepared to at least answer
those questions and really it doesn't
take a long time to learn how to solve a
lot of these common problems so like for
example if you don't know what fizzbuzz
is basically it is your interviewer will
ask you to loop through a range of
numbers and if the number is divisible
by three then print out fizz if it's
divisible by five print out buzz if it's
divisible by both then print out
fizzbuzz and this is a solution to the
problem here if I print this out you can
see that it loops through and every one
that's divisible by three it prints out
fizz and buzz and if it's divisible by
both and it prints out fizzbuzz so
usually these kind of questions are
meant to weed out people who don't
understand the basic concepts of a
computer language so for example here
you have to know how to use for loops
and enter eight over a range of numbers
you know them you have to know that
modulo operator and some things like
that and it's the same thing with the
Nachi sequence that's another question
that a lot of interviewers like to ask
so the fibonacci sequence if you don't
know what that is basically you print
out a number and each each number that
you print out is the previous two
numbers added together so here let me
just print out this example it'll be
easier to show so you can see I printed
out these numbers here so 0 and 1 if you
add those together it equals 1 if you
add 1 and 1 it equals 2 if you add 1 and
2 it equals 3 and it keeps going and
keeps going so you can do this and let's
see this is four lines of Python code
here so like I said a lot of people
don't like these questions because
they're not the best indicator of
programming ability but they do like to
ask these questions and they're so short
that it really wouldn't hurt you to
learn how to solve these problems and
not only should you learn how to solve
them just don't memorize the solutions
to these because it'll be obvious that
you're just kind of regurgitating what
you've memorized you really want to
understand what's going on so for
example in this Fibonacci sequence this
is kind of a unique assignment here a
comma B equals 0 comma 1 you want to
understand what's going on there you
want to understand what's going on in
this assignment here that looks a little
bit more complicated so look this up
online understand what's going on and be
prepared for these type of questions and
these two questions aren't the only two
common questions that get asked in
interviews so after you understand these
two questions you know get on Google and
just Google Python interview questions
and take a look at the first few results
because you might even run into a
recruiter or an interviewer who has
taken the questions straight from the
first results of the Google search so
then you'd be prepared for those
questions so it's good practice just to
go through those and be ready for some
of the basic stuff that people might
throw at you
okay so moving on here number five no
basic Python data types and when to use
them so these basic data types include
strings and
this and tuples and dictionaries and
sets not only should you understand how
they differ from each other and when you
should use one over the other but also
know how to iterate over each one so for
example here we just have a list here
that we can iterate over we have a tuple
here that we can iterate over in the
same way the dictionary is kind of
unique so whenever we iterate over the
dictionary here a dictionary is key
value pairs so we want to look at the
key and value in all of the dictionaries
items and then print those out so that's
something that you'll probably get asked
and you want to know how to solve and
also sets if you don't know what I said
is pretty much it's a list with no
repeated values and if you if we loop
through this list here and print this
out you can see that all of these are
unique values even though that there are
duplicates that are added to this set so
whenever I say that you want to know
when to use different data types over
another like one question for example
that you might get asked is why would
you use a tuple instead of a list and
that's something that you want to know
the answer to so I'm not going to go
into that detail here but I will put
some links into this description below
that kind of answers some of these
questions for you and also for some
bonus points and a question like this
if you can understand the underlying
data structures and functionality of how
these data types work then that would be
great
so this that's more computer science
related but for example you should be
able to talk about a dictionary being a
hash table and exactly what that means
so yeah like I said I'm not going to go
into much depth about that topic here
but you should look up the underlying
data structures involved with these data
types and know their advantages know
their weaknesses know how data gets
accessed within these data types and
also know when to when to properly use
each data type okay so moving
here to number six know how to use list
comprehensions now this is a little bit
more advanced but this is the kind of
information that will help you stick out
amongst other candidates so for example
I have the file here of list
comprehensions now again I'm not going
to go into too much detail here I have
an entire video on list comprehensions
dictionary comprehension x' and set
comprehensions so if you want more
detail about that then I'll put that
description I'll put that link in the
description below but basically it's a
more clean and readable way to create
these lists so for example in this so
say you have a sample problem where your
interviewer gives you a list of 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8 9 10 and then he says ok just
create a list that gives me the square
of each number in that list so off the
top of your head you might want to write
a for loop that goes through each item
and then squares the item and returns a
result and all that but I think your
interviewer will be really impressed if
you just know how to do this short
little one-liner here and this
comprehension czar used in real world
scenarios all the time so not only is it
going to help you in your interview but
it's going to help you actually on the
job so here we just are creating a list
that is the square of the number for
each number in the list so if we print
that out you can see that we return to
list here with the squares of all of
those numbers okay so let's move on to
number 7 here know how to use generators
so you're going to want to know when you
want to use generators and also the
benefits that you receive from using
generators so if I go back to the common
problem example here with the fizzbuzz
and the Fibonacci sequence I actually
have a Fibonacci sequence here that I've
written using generators instead so if
they do ask you a question like this and
used generators instead then that'll be
a big bonus points for your interviewer
so in this example it's almost exactly
like the Fibonacci sequence that we went
over before except now we have a
function here
yields and yield is the keyword that
lets you know that it's a generator so
it yields your result and then we can
loop through the generator and print out
each item so if we run through then we
can see that it still works just like it
worked before but now we're using
generators instead which have more
advantages over returning a list but
there are times and when you wouldn't
want to use generators so you do want to
do your research and figure out when you
really do get those advantages from
generators and when they may not be the
best option for you at the time also no
generator alternatives to certain Python
version 2 functions so for example here
you can see that we have an X range here
so it's nice to know that this is that
that X range behaves more like a
generator than what range does so X
range yields one result of the time and
range puts the entire range of numbers
into memory at once that's the same
thing with if I go back to the data
types example here this dictionary
example here you can see that we are
using it or items instead of items
because it or items gives us one result
back at a time rather than putting all
of the items into memory so be sure to
look up generators understand what they
are when you would want to use them and
also some of these alternatives where
you can use generators in place of these
older Python 2 functions ok so moving on
here number 8 know the basics of oo p or
object-oriented programming so to
prepare for the basics of
object-oriented programming for your
interview what I would do is I would
just have a sample file or program and
write these from scratch over and over
and over until it just feels natural so
in your head you're going to want to
know the general template for a class
and so you have to remember again that
you're not going to be you
using a computer so this is one of the
main things that will trip people up if
they are just writing stuff on the
whiteboard because it's so easy on your
computer just to hit control space or
something and have it pop up and give
you the entire and nip function and fill
it all in for you but to do that from
scratch can be a challenge so I would
just write these files over and over and
over until you just know how to write
down the class what it inherits from
remember to put in your NIT functions
and self and then the arguments and then
initialize all of those parameters also
you may be asked to explain what certain
things mean for example self you might
be asked to explain what self means and
what it means to make an instance of a
class so for example I would also make
instances of your classes and here's an
example where we are taking a person
class and giving them a name then we
have a method called reveal identity
that just prints out their name so I
have an instance of that class down here
if I run that you can see that it just
prints out my name is kori when it runs
this reveal identity function and we
also have a superhero class that
inherits from person so you want to know
how to inherit from classes also you
want to know how to initialize based off
of that base class and then how to
override also how to override methods so
for example here we are calling our base
classes reveal identity and then we're
adding in some additional functionality
here so if I comment out this Koree
variable and uncomment this weight
variable and then run this you can see
that it prints out his name and then his
superhero name so there's a little extra
functionality there so like I said I
would just have a sample file here of a
base class a class that inherits from
that base class and then instances of
both of those and just write those over
and over and over until you feel really
comfortable with writing out those
templates from scratch and and being
able to do that without a computer okay
so let's move on here to number nine so
number nine have python related
questions ready to ask your interviewer
so it's good to have these questions
prepared because if you feel strong in a
certain area of Python then this will
give you a chance to bring up those
areas that you're strong in if they
don't come up in the interview so for
example let's say that you've been
really studying the differences between
Python 2 and Python 3 and how to port
Python to applications over to Python 3
if it doesn't come up in the interview
at the end they're going to ask you if
you have any questions so just bring up
bring up questions like hey do you guys
use Python 2 or Python 3 and also you
want to be prepared for follow-up
questions to your questions
so don't ask a question that you're not
prepared to answer follow-up questions
about because if you ask are using
Python 2 or Python 3 then your
interviewer may ask you oh well that's a
good question we just moved over to
Python 3 or we're thinking about moving
over to Python 3 what would you
recommend and why also can you tell me
some of the differences between those
versions and things like that
so a couple of other examples of this
maybe you've been practicing working
with databases in Python you could ask
them what they're using to communicate
with their databases ask them if they're
using SQL alchemy if you've been
practicing unit testing with Python and
it didn't come up in the interview then
you could ask them if they're currently
testing their Python code base and or
and what testing modules that they're
using so just questions like that it'll
let you bring up the areas that you're
most strong in and and then they can ask
you follow-up questions about that so
that you can really end on a strong note
okay and the last bit of advice here
that I have isn't really related to
Python but you're also going to want to
know the basics of other technologies
when you go into your interview
so in today's tech industry I mean
there's tons of technologies that
programmers use on a date
basis and you're going to want to know
some of these technologies and not just
Python so for example it'll be a huge
benefit to learn version control like
something like git it'll be nice to know
how to navigate through the command line
and basic Linux commands understand how
databases work and how to write some
basic SQL code now I know that sounds
like a lot and it can sound overwhelming
but you don't need to be an expert in
these other technologies a lot of people
get caught up on that and they feel like
they need to know everything about
everything but just at least know what
these other technologies are and know
the basics of some of those technologies
some people like to describe this as a
t-shaped skillset and I'll provide a
link to that in the description below
but basically a t-shaped skillset means
that you're advanced in a certain topic
but also that you have exposure to
several other technologies so I'd really
suggest before your job interview to go
back to the job description and see what
other technologies they list and that
just in that description besides Python
and be sure that you at least know
something about everything that's on
that list and so that about does it for
the thin things for preparing for a
Python interview that's all the advice
that I had now I do want to say that
this is my own advice and I'm sure that
a lot of other people probably disagree
with this or have other methods and and
that's okay I mean the best methods for
preparing for interviews and the
interview process in general it's always
been constantly evolving and mutating
you know what's the norm today for the
interview process might be frowned upon
the next day for example Google used to
ask these brain teasers that people
never really liked like for example they
might ask how many ping-pong balls you
that you could fit into a 747 jet and to
talk through your thought process as you
solve that problem now I believe that
they've recently stopped doing these
brain teasers and they've instead
started focusing on data structures and
algorithms really the point is that the
interview process it changes over time
different people have different advice
for how to prepare for these interviews
so by all means don't use this video as
your single resource to prepare for your
Python interview I strongly believe that
you should feel comfortable with
everything in this list but after you've
got all this stuff down then search
through other resources online to
prepare for that interview so that about
does it for this video I hope it was
useful for you guys if you have any
questions just ask in the comments
section below be sure to subscribe for
future videos thank you guys for
watching and good luck on your job
