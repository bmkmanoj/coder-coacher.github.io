thought we could take a look at the git
stash command they get stash command is
great whenever you have some changes
that you're not quite ready to commit
and maybe you need to switch branches or
even just you want to revert back
temporarily to where it was that you
started and you don't know what to do
with your changes where you can do a
stash on those changes and it will save
them in a temporary place to where you
can go and do what it is that you need
to do and then come back to those
changes later on so the best way is just
to show you an example here so I've got
a very simple dot pi file over here it's
just an add subtract multiply and divide
functions and right now they don't have
any return values so let's say that we
wanted to start working on this Python
file so we could just do a git branch
add because we want to work on the add
function first and then we can check
that out get check out add and now let's
go in here and start working on our add
function so we can do return a plus B
and save that now if I go over here and
do a git diff you can see that we have
changed these lines here now let's say
for whatever reason we need to switch
back to our master branch and check
something out or we need to see what our
PI file looked like before we started
messing with it so what we can do here
is we can just stash our changes and to
go back to where we were so to do that
we can do a git stash save and now we
need to type in a message for ourselves
to remind us of what this stash was
doing so I can just say worked on add
function so hit enter there you can see
that it is now saved and now if I clear
this out and do a git diff nothing shows
up and if I do a get status you can see
that there's nothing to commit and if I
go back over here to my file you can see
that all the changes that we made
are now gone they've been wiped out but
they're not gone for good
if I do now we just stashed it so if I
do it get stash list and you can see
here it's a stash and all the stashes
have these IDs here this one is zero and
you can see the message that we put in
that we gave ourselves to remind us of
what what these changes were so I said
that we worked on our add function so
now you can go and do whatever it is
that you needed to do you can switch
branches you know work on other things
but whenever you're ready to come back
to these changes that you made so we
want to bring these changes back there's
two ways we can do this we can do get
stash apply and then let's copy that and
just paste that in there if we do a get
stash apply I'm going to go ahead and
hit enter now you can see that it has
made these changes again if I go back to
my file you can see that our changes are
now back but now if I do a git stash
list again you can see that our stash is
still there it didn't get rid of it
that's because when we do get stash
apply we're taking all the changes that
were in that stash but we're not getting
rid of the stash so it's still there so
let me do a git checkout and I'm just
going to that just resets us back to
where we were so now if I go back to the
file this is where we started from and
so now instead of doing I mean do a good
stash list instead of doing a git stash
apply to fetch those changes I'm going
to do a git stash pop and what pop will
do is it will grab the very first stash
in the list of stashes and we only have
one here so it's going to be the top one
and then it's going to apply those
changes and then it's going to drop the
stash so now I do a git stash list you
can see that we don't have any stashes
available but even though it deleted
that stash if I click over here on the
file it did give us our changes back so
if I do a git diff you can see where we
made our changes here now let's say that
I just decided to go ahead and
and fill in the rest of these functions
here so I can do a minus B turn a times
B and return a divided by B save that so
I do a git diff you can see we have all
of our changes here and now what if
somebody told us that they wanted that
they wanted us to add in a square
function well let's go ahead and stash
the changes that we've made so far
so get stash change and we can just do
we'll call these calc functions and now
just to make sure that that worked if I
do a git stash list you can see that we
have our stashed value here and if I
click back over here on to the file you
can see that it set everything back to
what we started with so now if I want to
add in this squared function then I can
just do a square there and save that and
now if I do a git diff then you can see
that we have those changes of adding in
that squared function but now let's say
that you know maybe we need to change
branches again or something like that so
we're going to go ahead and stash these
changes so let's do it get Steph's save
and I'll say added square function
that's okay that I misspelled that so
now I do a good stash list and you can
see that it pushed our couch functions
down to the stash one and now our most
recent change is up here at stash zero
so if at this point I get did a get
stash pop then it's going to pop off the
squared function because it was in that
top position so now let me go ahead and
if I did a get stash list you can see
that it popped that one up op that one
off this one's back to the zero position
now I'm going to stash this again with
the same message that we had before and
if I could do a git stash list you can
see that now it put
square function right back on top to
where it was now what if somebody came
and told us that you know all of a
sudden we don't need the square function
anymore
so all these changes which we can just
go ahead and get rid of these so to do
that we can do a git stash drop and it's
just like get stash apply we got we're
going to take the name of the one that
we want to drop here so I'm going to get
the one that is on the add square
function I'm just going to paste that in
so we do our git stash drop with the
stash that we want which is our top one
hit enter and then if I go back over
here to my file you can see that it is
where we started and if I go back over
here to my terminal and do a git stash
list and you can see that the only stash
that we have is our changes to the calc
functions and so one more time just here
for an example let me go ahead and make
a couple more changes over here I'm
going to make one more stash I'm just
going to put the square function back in
here again and let me just go ahead and
do a git stash save ad square function
again get stash
list and you can see now we have our two
stashes again and now we say that we
wanted to get rid of all of our stashes
and not just one stash so this is going
to get rid of all the changes that we
have in there now be careful when you
run this because it's going to get rid
of all the stashes that you have but say
that all those changes that you made
were just junk and you no longer want
them anymore you can just run get stash
clear and what that's going to do is
it's going to you can see that our file
here is exactly the way it was whenever
we first started and if I do a git stash
list we don't have any of those stashes
with any of the changes that we made so
that is a brief overview of the ways
that you're most likely going to use get
stash most of the time one way that this
really comes in handy is if I check out
my master branch here say that I went in
and made of my changes to
and right now so I did return a plus B
and save that and then I did a git
status and I saw that I modified the
file and a gift if and I can see the
lines that I changed here but then I
realized that I'm on my master branch
and whenever I try to change to my add
branch it's saying hey you have
uncommitted files here we can't do that
and you don't want to commit those
changes to your master branch and you
meant to do that on your add branch well
the best way to do that is just to do a
gift stash because stash is carry over
from branch to branch so right here I
can do a guess that's safe and just call
this add function there and then so now
if I do get status you can see that
there's nothing to commit and I'll do a
git checkout ad and then get stash pop
which pops that top change off and get
diff and then from there those changes
that you meant to commit to add now you
can do that just add all your changes
and you know put in a commit message
there so that's a brief overview of get
stash and a couple of examples of how
you would use that you know hopefully
this quick video is useful for you guys
