video we're gonna be taking a look at
get add and all the different ways that
we can add files to the staging area now
there's a lot of confusion as to the
different syntaxes that you can use with
get add so for example you can use get a
dash a dash you some people do get add
with the current directory and a lot of
people are unclear as to exactly what
changes these are adding to the staging
area to get ready to be committed so in
this video we're going to take a look at
all of those and hopefully clear up some
of that confusion so just to show you
what we're working with here I'm going
to run a git status to show you the
current state of our working directory
so we've kind of got all the bases
covered here we have a file that is
being deleted from our repository we
have a modified file we have a deleted
file within a subdirectory a modified
file within a subdirectory we have a dot
file which is a good ignore file here we
have a new file within our sub directory
and a new file and our top directory so
let's go ahead and run through these git
add commands and see exactly what each
one of them does so first of all we have
get add dash a and now you can also
write - - all but - a is the shorthand
notation for that so if I run git add
dash a and then I run a get status what
that's going to do is it's going to
stage all of the changes all the
modified deleted and new files and the
dot file in the entire working tree so
when I say that it does the entire
working tree so let me reset these back
to where they were and by the way if you
run a reset what that does is it just on
stages all of the changes there so what
I mean by it doing the entire working
tree was even if I was in my sub
directory here and I go into minder if I
do get add - a within here and then run
a get status that you can see that it
still got all of those changes even
though some of the
changes were up one directory so let me
go ahead and run a git reset here to get
back to where we were and now let me go
back up to my top level directory here
and now you can also add directories
onto the git add commands so if I do get
add - a and then specify my der that I
only want to add the changes within that
directory and then run that if I run a
get status here you can see that added
all of the new modified and deleted
changes within that directory but it
didn't touch anything up here in the top
level directory because we specifically
told it that we only wanted to add
changes within that directory so let me
reset those changes and move on to the
next example
now that get add - a is actually the
default behavior for git add so I can
leave off the - a and if I just did
so my Durer here then it's going to do
the exact same thing as if we had run
get add capital a so if I look at my git
status here then you can see that it
just did the exact same thing but we
didn't need to specify the - a now that
behavior is actually new to get version
2 and get version 1 if you left off that
- a what it would do is it would ignore
the deleted files now if you still want
that get version 1 functionality then
you can still do it but you just have to
do I'd get add and you can either do - -
no all and if I do that on my dirt and
then do a git status you can see that
even within my dirty even though I
specified it it did not stage this
deleted file here now instead of no all
you could also use it is ignore removal
I believe but that's a little long I
usually just use no all so let's go
ahead and reset those chain
just and clear that out so you can also
do a git add - you option and this is
the same as - - update now what the get
add - you does is it adds all of the
modified and deleted files but not any
untracked files not any new files and it
does that for the entire tree so I just
ran that if I do a git status then you
can see here that it got all of the
deleted and modified files but not any
of these untracked files here so none of
these new files were added so let me run
a git reset here and clear this out now
just like with the - a you can specify a
directory so if I do get a - you and do
my dirt and then do a git status then
you can see that it got all of the
modified and deleted files within my der
but it didn't get this new file here and
it also did not get these deleted and
modified files in our top directory so
I'll reset those changes and clear that
out now a lot of people use the syntax
git add and then the dot which is the
current directory so if we run that and
run and get status then you can see that
it got all of the changes and it leaves
a lot of people to believe that this is
the exact same thing as running git add
- a because it looks the same as long as
you're in your top directory but let me
show you how this is different
so if I reset these changes here now if
you remember the - a is the default get
functionality so get add dot in the
current directory is the same as running
get add a in the current directory so if
you're in your top directory then it
will be the same as running get add - a
now where it's different is if we CD
down into our sub directory here now if
I run get add dot it's the same as
running get add - a in the current
directory and what the
going to do is it's going to add all of
the changes in our current directory but
not in our comp directory so now if I
run and get status you can see that it
didn't get anything within our level up
here so in our directory one level up it
didn't get any of our bolita the
modified new files or the hidden files
so how that's different from the get a -
a is that if you run this from anywhere
it does all of the changes in the entire
working tree like we showed before but
I'll go ahead and show it one more time
so if I'm running to get status now you
can see that it got all of those files
even the ones that were up a directory
okay so let me go ahead and reset these
changes and clear this out okay and let
me go up to my top directory here now
one last thing that I see people using a
lot that I wouldn't recommend whenever
they're trying to add all of their
changes to the staging area is sometimes
I'll see people do get add star now the
reason I wouldn't recommend this is
because the star is a shell command it's
it's not something that gets
specifically knows how to use it's just
going to take everything that's passed
to it what I mean by that is if I do an
LS star you can see the files and the
directories that's going to be passed
and to get add so it's going to find our
modified files our new files and it's
even going to find that directory here
and the files within that directory but
notice that it didn't find the deleted
files because those are no longer on the
file system only get knows about those
and it also didn't find our hidden files
so if I was to run get add star which is
the same as get add - a star because - a
is the default if I was to run that and
then I ran get status you can see that
we might get some unexpected results
because I said that it couldn't see the
deleted files but one deleted file got
added to the staging area and this
deleted file didn't and the hidden file
didn't get at it so what exactly is
going on here well I don't know for 100%
sure but I think what happens here in
this talk directory if I do the LS star
again I think it's also passing
my dirt to get add so get knows what to
do with that deleted file when we add my
dirt so if we were to reset this and
then clear that out so let's change into
our subdirectory and now if we run get
add star within here and then did it get
status you can see that it didn't get
either of those deleted files it didn't
get the one in the top also didn't get
the one in the current directory and it
also didn't get any of these top-level
files the hidden files or anything like
that so that's why I wouldn't recommend
using the git add star unless you really
know what's going on in the background
it's a lot easier to understand using
the dot for the current directory or
even specifically typing in the
directory that you want to add so I
would stick to the git command so get a
- a - you and things like that and I
just wouldn't use that star so that
about does it for this video I hope that
that clears up any confusion as to the
differences between the different ways
to add files to the staging area if you
do have any questions or if anything
about that was confusing then just ask
