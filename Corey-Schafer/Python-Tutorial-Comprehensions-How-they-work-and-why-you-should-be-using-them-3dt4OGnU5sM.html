video we're going to be taking a look at
list comprehensions in Python so
basically a list comprehension is an
easier and more readable way to create a
list now I think the best way to learn
list comprehensions is to first show
what it would look like in a for loop
because I think everybody is familiar
with for loops and even if you're coming
from another language you'll be familiar
with that as well so let's take a look
at some of these examples and I'll show
you some of the advantages to list
comprehensions in terms of how easy they
are to write and also in how easy they
are to read so let's go ahead and take a
look at this first example here so in
this first example I have this comment
here that this is just going to be the
easiest loop all it does is pretty much
copy it so I'm saying that I want in for
each in and nums so if you're going to
write this in a for loop first you would
create an empty list and then you see
here I have a list of numbers 1 through
10 and then I have this empty list my
nums so we're doing 4 in and nums so
it's going to loop through all these
numbers my list dot append in so it's
just going to add each number to this
list now we're going to print out that
list so let's go ahead and run that and
you can see that it's exactly what we'd
expect it's just a copy of the top list
here now let's see what this looks like
in a list comprehension and also notice
how similar the list comprehension is to
my comment here so what I'm going to say
is I'm going to make my list equal to
and then brackets so the brackets means
that we're making a list and then let's
try to pretty much copy exactly what is
in the comment here so I want in and
then for each in in nums that's a list
comprehension so what so this is what
we're returning this is what we want I
want in and then this is the for loop
here for in and nums so if I save that
and run it then I actually have to print
this out so that it shows up
so we'll run that and you'll see that
it's the exact same result that we had
from the for loop but this is much
easier right and it's pretty easy to
understand also so that's about the
easiest list comprehension that you can
do so let's do a slightly more
complicated example so in this example
here if we read the comment I'm saying
that I want N squared so n times n for
each N and nums so this is pretty
similar to our previous example but now
we're actually returning the square of n
instead of just copying all the values
so to do this in a for loop we would
create an empty list and then we would
loop through all the numbers and then we
would append the square to the list and
then when we're done we can print the
list so if I run this code then you can
see that our result we get all of the
squares of each number in this 1 through
10 list okay now let's see the same
example but in a list comprehension and
also let's notice how similar it is to
the comment again so it's almost like
reading exactly what we want so we want
n times n for n in nums
so this is what we are appending to our
list and this is the for loop here so if
I save that and then let me remember to
print it out this time and then run it
then we get the exact same result as our
for loop now there's another way to do
something like this that's very similar
if you know how to use maps and lambdas
then maybe you've made something like
this before so let me comment out this
code so map pretty much runs everything
in the list through a certain function
and lambda is an anonymous function so
if I save this and print it out you can
see that we got the same result but this
comprehension is pretty much do away
with these map functions because they're
no longer needed this works and it's a
one-liner just like the comprehension
but you can't read this and
understand exactly what it's doing
unless you already knew about these to
begin with if you compare this
readability to the list comprehension
somebody who's completely new to Python
can see this and say n x in for in and
nums and that just is readable it just
kind of flows together and you can kind
of understand what's going on with these
maps and lambdas it says map lambda in n
times in nuns it just doesn't it just
doesn't read very well and you have to
be experienced with those before you
understand what's going on
so if you are using maps and lambdas
from within your code then you might
want to check and see if those can be
converted to list comprehensions because
99% of the time they can be so I'm going
to comment these out here and erase
these and we'll move on to a slightly
more difficult example okay so in the
comment for this example I'm saying that
I want n for each n and nums if n is
even so this is going to create a list
that is all the even numbers of our
original 1 through 10 list so what's
going on in our for loop here is we're
creating our empty list and then we're
saying for each item in the numbers list
then if that number mod 2 which will
give us the remainder after we divided
by 2 is equal to 0 that means that it's
even so then append that to our list and
then at the end we'll print out a print
out our list so if we run that and you
can see that it works we get 2 4 6 8 10
so now let's look at this same example
using a list comprehension so I'm going
to say my list equal to brackets which
means that we're making a list so we
want in for n in nums if in mod 2 equals
equals 0 so what we're saying is that we
want we want an item for each item and
nums if that item
two equals equals zero so let's save
that and actually let me print it out
here and then run that and you can see
that we get the exact same result as our
for loop now just like the map and
lambda functions there's also the filter
and lambda functions which is pretty
much the same thing so instead of Matt
we have filter and what this does is it
filters it runs the list through this
function and only gives us the values
that are even so if we print this out
you can see that it works but the same
with the map lambda function people just
aren't going to know what this is if
they're new to it it's just not as
readable as this list comprehension is
so let's go ahead and delete all of this
stuff and move on to a slightly more
difficult example so in this example
here I'm saying that I want a letter
number pair for each letter an ABCD and
each number in 0 1 2 3 so for example I
would want a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 B 0 B 1 B 2 B
3 and so on so if we were to do this
with a for loop then we would create our
empty list then we would do a for loop
for letter in ABC and then within that
for loop we're going to have another
nested for loop and say for num and rage
4 which will give us 0 1 2 3
and then we're going to do a my list dot
append a tuple of the pair letter and
number so if I save that and I run it
then you can see that we got all of our
pairs we got a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 B 0 B 1 B 2
B 3 and so on so we can have these
nested for loops in list comprehensions
as well so if I was to do this in a list
comprehension I would say my list equals
create an empty list here and now what I
want is
I want letter num 4 letter in ABCD and
then right after that for loop for num
in range 4 so let's save this and print
it out and make sure I typed everything
right so we print that out and we see
that we get the exact same result as our
for loop now let's walk through this one
one more time so what we're saying is
that we want a list so we open up our
brackets and we're saying that we want
this tuple letter number for letter and
ABCD for num and range for so one thing
I probably should have mentioned earlier
is that these values that were saying
that we want they have to match these
values that we assign here so I couldn't
just call this number here I couldn't
say that I want letter num for letter
and ABCD for number and range for
because it's not going to know what this
value is this num value we have to use
the same values that we want whenever we
say that we want those values in the
list so you can see how we can start to
do some complicated lists here that take
you know a good bit of lines of code
that we can write as a one-liner and
it's slightly more readable as well but
it's not only lists that you can do
these comprehensions with you can also
do this with dictionaries and sets also
so if I delete that then let's move down
to our next example here now this is
going to be an example of a dictionary
comprehension so I have two lists here I
have names and then I have their
superhero name that matches up with
their first name so if you've never seen
this zip function here let me just print
out this zip function here so that you
know what it does so what the zip
function does is so all these match up
one to one so the first index of neigh
is uh matches up with the first index of
the heroes list here now if we run zip
and it's going to create a list of
tuples that match those up for us so
it's going to say it's going to be a
tuple of Bruce Batman and then the next
tooth will be Clark Superman and so on
so I'm going to make a dictionary
comprehension using this zip function so
let me take that out and now you can see
that in my comment here I'm saying that
I want a dictionary of the name as the
key hero as the value for each named
hero in zip names and heroes and this is
going to be a list of tuples so here in
the for loop I am making an empty
dictionary and then I'm looping through
these tuples and saying that for the
name of that tuple I want to be my key
in the dictionary and for the hero of
that tuple I want to be the value in the
dictionary and then I'll print out the
dictionary here so if I save that and
run it then you can see that we get our
dictionary using our for loop so now
let's say that we want to do this as a
list or as a dictionary comprehension so
I'm going to do my dict equal to now
instead of the brackets this isn't a
listing more it's a dictionary so we're
going to use these braces instead so for
the dictionary comprehension I'm going
to say name and then colon hero for name
comma hero in zip Heroes are actually
that's going to be names comma Heroes so
save that and now let's print this out
and you can see that we get the exact
same result that we did with our for
loop and it's easy to add restrictions
onto the ends of these comprehensions so
like in this comment here I want to do
the same thing but I don't want Peter
added to this list so here at the end I
can just say if
name is not equal to Peter and then run
that and you can see that we get our
list without Peter and spider-man
included in the list so comprehensions
really make it easy to add those loops
and those conditionals onto the existing
comprehension so now let's go ahead and
delete the dictionary comprehension
example and we'll move on to the set
comprehensions so if you don't know what
a set is a set is pretty much like a
list except it has all unique values so
you see here that we have this jumbled
mess of a bunch of values between 1 and
herbs between 0 and 10 and so whenever
we make a set and loop through and add
those values to the set the final set is
going to have all unique values so if I
have this list of nums to do this in a
for loop I'm going to say my set equal
to an empty set and then for each item
in nums my set add that item and now I'm
going to print out my set so let's save
that and run it and you can see that I
get all the unique values from that nums
list so now if I wanted to turn this
into a set comprehension then I can
comment out the for loop there and I'm
just going to save my set equal to and
this is going to be braces again just
like the dictionary comprehension but
we're not going to have a colon like the
dictionary comprehension head so now we
can do this just like the other list
comprehension so we want in for in in
nums so save that now this is doing
exactly what this for loop did it's just
adding in for each number in the nums
if I print this out and run it then you
can see that we get the exact same
result that we got with the for loop and
just like with the list comprehensions
you can add nested loops and
conditionals onto the end of this as
much as you want so let's go ahead and
delete that and so that
does it for the comprehensions now I do
have this one last example here of
generator expressions now generators are
a lot different than lists and
dictionaries and sets but I wanted to
include them in this tutorial because a
generator expression is so similar to a
list comprehension so if you do want a
more in-depth look at the advantages of
generators then you can watch my video
that I made specifically on generators
but in this example I'm just going to
focus on generator expressions
okay so if we uncomment out this code
here this is just a regular generator
this isn't an expression so if we look
at the comment I'm saying that I want to
yield n times n so the square of n for
each N and nuns just like our other
examples so here our generator function
we are passing in this numbness and then
we're saying for N and nuns yield the
square of n and then here we're saying
my gin equals this gin function and
we're passing in that list of numbers
and then finally here at the bottom we
are looping through that generator and
printing out each eye so let's save that
and run it and you can see that it ran
the for loop and printed out all of the
values in that generator now if I was to
do this with a generator expression the
syntax is almost identical to a list
comprehension but instead of the
brackets or the braces we're going to
use parentheses so now just like the
other examples we can say I want n times
n for n in numbs save that and then we
still need to keep our for loop here
because we have to iterate through that
generator so if I save that and print it
out then you can see that we got the
exact same result as we did with these
lines of code that where we had to
create the generator function and do the
for loop and then create the generator
using the phone
and all of that so you can see how this
one line of code is not only a lot
easier to write and maintain but it's
also a lot more readable as well so that
about does it for this video on list
comprehensions you'll be surprised at
how often you'll use these and how much
code that you can go through your code
base and replace these long nested
for-loops
with these list comprehensions so if you
