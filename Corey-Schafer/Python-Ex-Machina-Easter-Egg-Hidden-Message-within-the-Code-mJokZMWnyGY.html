just gonna be a short little video just
for fun we're not gonna go over tutorial
or anything like that I just wanted to
show you guys something that one of my
friends pointed out to me that I thought
was pretty neat so there's this movie I
liked a lot called ex machina and it's
about this genius programmer who owns
this multi-billion dollar company and he
goes out into the middle of nowhere to
work on this artificial intelligence
system and after he builds this AI
system he has one of his best employees
come out to the resort to give it the
Turing test and to test whether it's
actually displays real intelligence or
not and I thought the movie was great
it's super intense but there's one point
in the movie where on one of his
monitors this Python code pops up and
it's only for a split second but if you
pause it then and write down that Python
code then this is all the Python code
right here
at the top it has this comment blue book
code decryption and then the rest of it
just kind of looks like gibberish it
doesn't seem like it would actually do
anything but if we run this code then
the output is this ISBN number and an
ISBN number is a code for books so if we
copy this and then go over to Amazon and
search for this ISBN number then it's
this top result here the embodiment and
the inner life cognition and
consciousness in the space of possible
minds so I thought that was a pretty
cool Easter Egg that they threw there
into that movie like I said I thought
the movie was really good if you guys
give it a watch then be on the lookout
for that Python code it just pops up
really fast but but yeah check it out
and you can type in the Python code for
yourself and and run it and see what you
get but yeah that's it for this video
thank you guys for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
