the view lifecycle methods which allow
us to do some cool things including load
some dynamic data from a server that our
component needs to render so the
lifecycle methods that View bakes in our
before creates which as you guessed
fires if this was a function we add here
it's going to fire before our view
component gets actually created so we
have before creates we have create we
have before mounts which is before the
component actually gets mounted into the
dom and then we have mounted which is
the one we'll want to use if we want to
load any dynamic data then we also have
before destroy and destroyed if you want
to do some cleanup or something before
this component ever leaves the dom so
let's go ahead and create a mounted
method we'll just create it right here
on our view object that we're sending to
our new view and let's just do console
log mounted so this is going to fire
when our component actually mounts to
and you can see right here the ID app so
if I save and refresh hey I got it
mounted to prove this to you let's go
ahead and remove this if you remove the
element it will not mount to the dom it
doesn't know where and when this is
useful in some circumstances if you
don't want to mount it to the dom
immediately but you want to kind of get
it all set up so what I can do down here
now in my console is I can go app dot
amount and then I can just give it let's
go to mount to app and there we go it
mounted and you can see it said mounted
so that's kind of a way that you can use
that so that's when that fires it fires
when your app boom attaches to the dom
and so that's where we're going to want
to fetch some dynamic data so we could
do this with the fetch API here we could
just use JavaScript fetch API request
some data in there or whatever it is who
knows what it is then let's go ahead
take that response and let's turn it
into JSON
then we have our response and we can do
something with it
so in this case let's go ahead and use
rest learn code Academy which is a free
restful api that I set up a while ago
it's great for prototyping stuff the
date is public and it gets erased every
so often but basically how to use it as
you just go rest dot learn code dot
Academy slash API make up your own user
make sure you make up your own unique
user so I'll make this view five and
then you make up the collection so this
will be friends so the first time you
try to access it it doesn't exist it
gets created and now it's an empty array
so I can go ahead and fetch that now
that's now a full restful endpoint with
git post input so there we go
view five friends and when we get that
data back in let's say this dot data or
this dot friends equals data so there we
have it and that's now we're fetching
dynamic data let's prove that this
actually populates that dynamic list by
going to my terminal I'm gonna use curl
to actually post some people to that
friends list so we're gonna send a post
request here and the data will be named
we're just gonna give it a JSON object
I'm gonna post my name there we go we'll
and we're gonna post to that URL there
we go we added it you can see our
response back we got an ID so if I go to
here I now have one friend in my friends
list and if I now reload this I don't
have my friends list because I haven't
mounted yet so let's run that exact same
command mount it mounted it grab my
friends and there you go my friends are
now populated so now I want to insert
friend dot name instead of just friend
let's mount it again fetched it and
there at my name will so that's getting
a little annoying to have to trigger
that mouth let's add this yell back in
here
now let's go post another friend here
let's post say William and maybe one
more person Willis so now I should have
three friends or my app loads up
excellent I have three friends so that's
kind of how you'll use your lifecycle
methods to do fun stuff namely the most
common use case is going to be to load
dynamic data in the next videos let's go
ahead turn this into a full friends list
editor so we can delete friends and edit
friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
