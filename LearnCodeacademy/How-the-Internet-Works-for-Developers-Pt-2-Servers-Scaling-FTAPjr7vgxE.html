internet work from a web development
perspective if you're just jumping in
now go back and watch video 1 I'll put
links around for that and let's get into
what is the server world look like from
a web development perspective how does
the internet work from the backend
perspective of the internet so we
narrowed it down the basis of the
Internet is browsers or clients
sometimes they're call clients are
making requests to your server and my
server is going to post bacc responses
my server is 100% responsible for what
those responses are you could say give
me google.com and my Google server could
give you an image right you could say
mysite.com and my site could just give
you back a CSS file every time I'm in
control of what happens let's look at
how that actually works let me go ahead
and drag over don't get confused here if
this looks a little freaky this is what
I will call a basic website server
configuration now there are tons of
different kinds of server configurations
if you went to say Hostgator and sign up
for a website package you're going to
get what's called a cPanel cPanel sits
on top of your server it's software that
manages some things for you and here's
what it's setting up for you is they're
going to set up an Apache web server
you're going to get probably a lamp
machine lamp is it's running Linux it's
using Apache for the web server my
sequel for the database PHP for the
backend language this is kind of the
most popular for anything up to
enterprise or you know anything up to
professional level stuff if you want a
basic website this is the way to go
it's just easy Apache as a web server is
very flexible it can do a lot of stuff
but what it's most often used for is
just basic serving up of files websites
we call them so here's what Apache does
in patchy is the web server program that
runs on your server this square here
represents this machine so this is my
machine this is an actual computer
plugged into the internet with an IP
address and so Apache is set up to
listen to port 80 now don't freak out I
just said port what port 80 is is that's
the default HTTP port so if I went to
HTTP colon slash slash if I could spell
if I went to that IP address it's the
same as going to that IP address : 80
so the : 80 gives it a port I can
request port 3000 but by default it's
basically going to request port 80 so
the reason your computer has an IP
address but you can't go to that IP
address and get your files is you don't
have a web server program running it'd
be very dangerous if anybody who
accesses your IP address can just surf
your computer that's terrible
so a web server runs and it will listen
to requests and it will kind of have
access to certain parts so Apache is set
up to listen to port 80 and you can
figure different hosts to different
folders if you remember from our example
here I'm requesting google.com no path
so when I request that my browser
actually goes to the DNS lookup the DNS
lookup sends me to my server so my
server just gets a request the IP
address now but it still knows from my
headers that you're looking for
google.com so Apache knows ah my site
comm well my site comm let's look in the
site slash mysite.com slash www folder
and so the basic patchy configuration is
just going to serve you files from that
folder that's it no smart stuff it's
just going to give you files so when you
say my site comm it's going to go to the
folder that's configured for that
website and it's going to give you the
index.html if it exists or the index.php
if it exists that's pretty much your
basic configuration so you could
configure ten different web sites
mysite.com your site comm our site comm
and you could make them all look to this
folder or you can make your site comm
look to another folder on your computer
you can make our site calm look at this
folder and so that's kind of Apache
conserve one server can handle multiple
websites so you go to my site calm it by
default
Apaches website configuration it's going
to look for the index file and you know
if you give it a path say slash IMG /
logo - well then it's going to look it's
going to look at that path and say well
does that file exists let's see if
there's an IMG folder let's look in that
IMG folder to see if logo JPEG exists
hey it does let's send that back in the
response and since that's a JPEG we're
just going to be smart enough to give it
a recon tenth type of image slash JPEG
that's your basic Apache setup it's
going to automatically grab you files
and it's going to automatically set
content types for you and you can
configure the content types that you
want to return so that's kind of your
basic website setup if you get a website
and just building content for people
that's what's going on
let's look at something more complicated
so clearly Twitter doesn't do this
Twitter has to manage users and tweets
and all that stuff they're not just
handing you a jpg file how does a bigger
company handle these things so they're
running what's called a web application
a web application server is set up a
little bit differently so you've got
your web application itself this will be
Ruby on Rails or this will be if your
PHP it will be laravel or codeigniter or
nodejs this will be dotnet your web
application right here it is set up to
respond to stuff so let's say your web
application is also listening to port 80
let's say I've configured this to listen
to port 80 so now I'm going to get when
requests come to my IP address from this
machine this web application will pick
up on them aha what are they looking for
they're looking for Twitter comm okay
Twitter comm is not my twitter.com
homepage is not just a home page it's
not just in an HTML page it has all the
tweets baked into it so what I'm going
to do is I'm first going to go to my
database which would be like my sequel
or MongoDB give me all the tweets from
this users timeline and now I'm going to
go get my template I'll have what's
called a template which says it looks
kind of like HTML says head body but
then it also says for each tweets spit
out this piece of code and put the
tweets information in it so then I'm
going to template that together and then
I'm going to send that that template
mixed with the tweets as a response I'm
basically going to generate HTML
on-the-fly send that as my response back
to the user and I'm going to
the content type as text slash HTML so
as far as you're concerned the user just
gets HTML blah blah blah they don't care
how it was made they don't care what
framework made it they don't care if
CodeIgniter made it or Ruby on Rails
made it the browser just says here's
what I got and the header the response
type is text HTML so as far as I'm
concerned you gave me an HTML file I'm
going to spit out an HTML file and so
that's kind of how web application
server works if you request it's also
smart enough to know that if you request
slash images slash logo dot jpg ah
that's just a file I can go grab that
from the file system and send it back
with a content type of image slash jpg
and so it also will reply to JavaScript
requests so say JavaScript makes a
delete request delete tweet ID 1 then
your web application is listening to a
request on my site comm / delete slash 1
so or slash tweet slash 1 delete request
on that so if I send that request in
delete tweet slash 1
it knows AHA that's that's got a method
of delete so I'm now going to go find it
in the database I'm going to send a
delete boom you're out of the database
I'm just going to send them a 200 ok
no content back just a 200 ok response
absolutely no content back JavaScript
can pick up on that and say hoo hoo we
deleted it and then JavaScript can make
it go poof from your web page so that's
kind of how your web application server
has you're going to manage three
different things you're going to manage
templating of stuff in generating HTML
on the fly you're going to manage API
which is JavaScript talking to you
JavaScript says delete this I don't need
HTML back I just want you to delete this
tweet and tell me it was done okay so oh
okay delete request to this delete it
from the database it's gone and it's
also going to handle static assets it's
going to handle serving up of images
that never change you request this image
all hand hand it back you can break this
up into three applications one just for
the HTML one just for the API
one just for all the logos you can do a
million different things with it but
that's kind of how everything goes in
the web application world and so let's
say what happens when this server starts
getting so overloaded because your
website is so popular it can't handle it
anymore
well you got two choices to either
upgrade to a more powerful machine with
more RAM more processing speed all that
and that will get you by for a short
term but you're going to run out
eventually Google and Twitter can't run
this off on one big pimped-out laptop
they need something more powerful than
that so what you're going to do at that
point is you're going to let me see if
this will work okay that that got ugly
but what you're going to do is you're
going to then run multiple copies of
your exact web application so this is on
its own 63.4 file I'm just making
something up this is running on say your
dot two box it's its own machine with
its own IP address this is going to be
its own machine with its own IP address
and this is going to be its own machine
with its own IP address and then let's
see if I can pull this out here OOP
gotcha then you're going to actually
this will be a machine with its IP
address here and you will run a load
balancer which sounds complicated but
it's really not let's so let's just make
some up 3/4 dot I'll say dot one so this
your DNS for my site com points to your
load balancer now so you go my site calm
DNS points to here this guy is going to
keep track of how each of these guys are
doing and he is going to real-time send
traffic to each box each web application
in the box so if you've got your first
user will go here your second user will
go here your third user will go here and
then depending on how this is set up
different load balancing programs handle
it different some will always go one two
three one two three one two three
some will look at keep a track of who's
the busiest and send people to the
server that has the most capacity so
then it's called scaling your website
then say your users are getting more and
more and more you just add another
server in there a dot five server
configure this guy to also have a
I've server that he processes request to
and boom and sitting just keep adding
servers on and you have to figure out at
that point a deployment process so how
do I actually send this code to all the
servers in one command and that can get
a little fun but that's basically what
the backend side of things looks like I
probably covered a ton if you especially
if you're new to web development this is
a lot of information but that's
basically what the backend side of
things looks like and now you're free to
start messing with a server technology
Ruby on Rails nodejs PHP laravel you
know whatever you want to get into now
you're free to get into it I hope this
was a help to you and if you have any
questions stuff that just isn't clear
