our jQuery AJAX series in the last video
what we did is we covered how to do a
get request to grab all of our orders
from the server and spit them out so
what we have here is an empty ul of
orders no allies in it we're on page
load we are grabbing all the orders and
we're spitting out in Li for each one so
that's what's going on here you see if I
inspect this element let's make this a
little bigger here you see that I got
two allies in here we have populated an
Li for will and an Li for Laura Ubaid so
that's done let's go on and move into
the next part which is posting our new
drinks say I want to do a drink for John
and he just gets a coffee I want to be
able to add that I want that to do
something I want it to add it to the
back-end server so it's now permanently
in the database and I also want it to
add it on the page when that's
successful let's go ahead let me show
you one more thing here on this get
request or the jQuery AJAX should I say
is you can also do error and I can do an
error if this thing does not work I can
alert error loading order so I have
success and I have error if i refresh
nothing happens because it was
successful but let's say I give this a
bad URL here to s is on accident
alert error loading orders and nothing
happened cool so I'll leave that in
there and let's go into next part we
want to post new things to the backend
so let's look at here from the back-end
team they said to add an order you send
a post request to the same URL slash API
slash orders except we're not doing a
get request we're doing a post request
and which means we're sending
information up and here's the sample
post data that we are sending we're
sending a JSON post and we're sending
this information and it will respond
kind of like a get request it will also
have a response will have the item with
an ID now which is if it's successful so
we can use that ID to reference it later
if we want to update our beverage order
so let's go ahead and put that in so we
have a button here
the ID is add order so on click of that
order we want to do something we want to
make a post let's go ahead and grab our
information up top let me cache this Dom
every time we add in order we're going
to want to look at these two fields and
get the value out so I'm going to cache
these two fields up top and I think
they're called name yep they're called
name and drink there you got name equals
name and drink so on add order I'm going
to get those two values out of here and
then I'm going to post that order so
let's go ahead and put together our
little posting let's see from the
backend team we want to post a simple
object of name and drink so let's build
that object and name Val easy enough and
then drink drink Val so that's our order
right there we have our name and our
drink we're getting the value out of
these two fields and we're moving on and
we're going to do Ajax again this type
is going to be a post not a get which
means we're sending information URL is
the same and then we also have a data
field since we are passing data in we're
going to give it our order right there
our order object and a success function
and so the order you can actually pass
it an existing object or you can
actually just kind of create an object
on the fly like this if we were to do
that that would be the exact same thing
we're creating a brand new object it's a
little cleaner in my opinion to build
the object up there and then so this
stays clean so on success this is our
new order that they have given us back
we can do the exact same thing here
orders dot append
new order and new order so we're doing
is we're posting our new order to the
back end we're going to wait for that to
be successful if it's successful we are
going to add a new Li to our list so it
shows up on our page I'll also add an
error and we'll just call this alerts
error saving order not message there we
go let's see if this works so I have a
JavaScript error here let's find out
that's all about unexpected token on
line 24 yep I did bad syntax those of
you guys who are watching the video
watching that I cannot type and talk at
the same time or probably laughing out
loud at me okay so our two drinks are
populated in let's out a new one John
just likes coffee haha it did it let's
go and look at our network tab and see
what just happened
so you'll notice we did our initial get
of orders and then we did a little while
later we did a post to the same API and
let's look at that real quick you'll
notice we posted this information of
named John drink coffee and then we got
a response of named John drink coffee
and an ID of three and so now watch what
happens when we refresh our page we've
saved it to the back end and now we're
getting three drinks so if I had two
more drinks Bobby likes water not sure
why there we go so now if i refresh now
we have all four drinks awesome we have
a fully functioning app that talks to
the backend and so one thing I do not
like that's going on here is I don't
really like that we are copying this
exactly this exact same thing over again
so let's go ahead and pull that out
we're going to make a function called
add order and this will just take an
order so let's get rid of this right
here cut you out
paste you in here order nein so
basically whatever we pass it is going
to be calling it order so now I just
have to go add order and give it my
order same thing down here hate that
we're doing the exact same thing except
for we're going to be passing it the new
order in this case that should work just
fine so I refresh it's still populating
my initial orders just fine and if I do
a new one drink will be latte there we
go that's working just fine as well so
now what we've done is we have pulled
this out to a single function here but
if we want to get much more complicated
than this it's going to get really messy
I really want to start adding more
elements in here like a paragraph tag
and some strong tags but that's just
going to be a giant messy string we
really want to do this with a templating
engine so let's go ahead and add in
Hogan J s into our next I will use
mustache J s let's go ahead and add
mustache J s into our next video and
then we'll add in the delete
functionality to wrap up our application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
