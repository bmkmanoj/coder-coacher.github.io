back-end developer and you're looking
for a great way to level up this year I
may have a great solution for you here
that's right this red guy in spandex on
the Left could be you I mean look at him
that girl is totally checking him out
too I've been working on a course called
from newbie to ninja in nodejs
and I've been developing it for a while
and I'm ready to release it to you guys
it's going to be awesome so for all you
TLDR people just visit store clerk code
Academy it's on sale there now and it's
50% off these first three days for all
of my subscribers I want to give you
guys a great deal this course is 30
videos I've basically taken my five
years of day-in day-out experienced
coding nodejs and I've determined what
the core competencies of a node.js
developer are say that five times fast
core competencies of a new gist of ever
so by the time you're done with this
course you're going to have everything
it takes to be a node.js developer not
just no random bits and pieces about
nodejs
so who is this video for if you're going
to purchase a course you want to know
it's for you first and foremost it's
designed for people who are new to
back-end if you've been doing front-end
your whole life and back-end is a little
mysterious or terrifying and you're
looking for the correct on-ramp this is
the ideal course for you with each video
I made sure to stop and think how would
this feel if I was new to back-end
what terminologies would be new what
things might be intimidating and I want
to make sure I explain them well for
someone who's new to back-end if you're
experienced in back-end you'll feel
right at home along the way and I won't
dumb anything down but for anyone that's
new it's going to be a really nice
on-ramp in to back-end technologies and
building back-end applications
second it's going to be really good for
people with PHP only back-end experience
while PHP can mean a lot of things if
you've done mostly CMS is working maybe
with open source shopping carts and just
hacking things around and you can make
back-end work but you don't really feel
like a true back-end engineer this is
going to be a really good course for you
because the way nodejs runs as a
constant running service puts it
alongside of many many other back-end
applications basically if you learn
nodejs you're going to get the concepts
of many
other web technologies and a way you
wouldn't get if you have PHP only
back-end experience also if you're just
new to no js' if you're back in
developer and you want to learn no js'
this again will give you those core
competencies in a really quick way
really the only thing you need to know
is some JavaScript you don't even have
to be a JavaScript ninja and I'll put
some links to some of my free playlists
in the description below you basically
need to know the basics of JavaScript
maybe watch my JavaScript is weird and
awesome course maybe know about modular
JavaScript and promises and you'll be
good to go
so what will you learn in this course
we're going to cover six main areas
we're going to cover the nodejs basics
and all the things that took me a long
time to discover about those basics
along the way even some things that I
just learned over the last year that
have always been there and then we're
also going to learn Express Jas which is
hands-down the most popular web
application framework for nodejs we're
going to learn all its ins and outs and
how simple it is to put together a
powerful application then we're going to
move on to databases connecting to my
sequel getting and setting data and also
how to manage those databases in a great
production environment like setting up
database fixtures so your team can work
completely offline with their own
database on their machine and handling
your production database with migrations
some great things which will be really
good especially if you're new to
back-end then we're going to move into
authentication and authorization that
tricky piece of how do I do a username
password login and know that it's secure
o auth to login so you can log in with
your Google ID or with your github ID
and then authorization and private data
and making sure things stay secure then
we're going to move into Redis so that
way you can manage your sessions and
caching and Redis is just a really cool
uniquely usable database and then we're
also going to cover deployment how you
provision those production servers and
get that application out to production
basically like I said it's going to be
everything it takes to get you rolling
with nodejs and for the next three days
it is 50% off that's right 50% off
because I love me my subscribers you
guys are awesome you provide great
encouragement to me to keep the channel
going and so I'm giving you guys 50% off
just to say thank you to all those loyal
subscriber
too many of you have become good friends
over the years so three days only three
days only three days only and again
visits to earn Codecademy to purchase it
and don't forget I also have real world
docker which is now O'Reilly
best-selling training video on docker if
you go to O'Reilly comm and search for
real world docker that course is still
out there and people are really really
liking it thanks for listening have
yourselves a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
