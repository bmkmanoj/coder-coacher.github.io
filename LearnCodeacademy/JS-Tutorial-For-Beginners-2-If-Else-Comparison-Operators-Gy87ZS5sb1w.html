learned about variables and we learned
about the first two types which is the
number and string and there's really
only six or eight types in JavaScript
depending on how you look at it so
they're not going to go on and on
forever but before we get into the next
types I want to show you some extra
programming tips or some extra ways that
you can build programs with the types
that you already know let's say that my
users age is 16 years old and I want to
write a program to where if they're less
than 16 it's going to alert that they
can't drive if they're older than 16
it's going to alert that they can drive
how would I do that we're going to do
that with an if statement so I'm going
to do if and I'm going to open and close
my parentheses again and I'm going to
open and close my curly braces now for
this I'm going to want to do multiple
lines so you're going to want to hold
ctrl or shift depending on if you're on
Mac or Windows and then it's going to
allow us to do multiple lines of code
here and it won't run until we hit Enter
so I can go if age is less than remember
that sign for math class I'll show I'll
talk about it more in a minute alerts
you can not drive so this is a less than
symbol it's called a comparison operator
and basically because the littler side
points over here if the age is littler
than 16 or if it's less than 16 then we
are going to do what is ever in between
these curly braces basically if the
question we ask in here is true then
we're going to do what's between the
curly braces if it's not true we're
going to ignore what's in between the
curly braces so right now my age is 16
and I've said if age is less than 16
then alert I cannot drive it didn't do
anything at all because my age is 16 or
greater so if I change age to 15 and run
it again I hit the up arrow a couple
times one great thing about the console
is your up and down arrows will give you
all your history so I hit the up arrow a
couple times and hit enter now it says I
cannot drive because my age is changed
to 15 let's look at some more comparison
operators real quick I'm going to pull
that up again
there's the less than and then there's
greater than
so this would be if age is greater than
16 and I can also add an equals to
either of those and this means is it
greater than or equal to 16 so greater
than 16 would be 17 and up greater than
equal would be 16 and up less than would
be 15 and under less than equal would be
16 or under so 16 is also included in
the group I can also do 2 equals 4 is
exactly 16 and then I can also do not
equal 4 is not 16 so if your age is not
16 you cannot drive doesn't make any
sense
but that's kind of how you do that I
will put these in the description
because you might forget them and you
might want to remember them so if your
age is let's go back to our program
if your age is less than 16 alert you
cannot drive let's say I want to say
alert you can't drive this is going to
be a little rabbit trail but it's
important to notice there's a problem
with this code because I'm opening up my
string here with a single quote and then
I'm ending it here but I'm actually not
ending it here I'm ending it here so
that's actually going to give an error
this will not work and so what if you
want to add a single quote inside of or
an apostrophe inside of a string we have
two choices you can either go to double
quotes here and so now that's going to
work or what you can do is you can do
what's called escaping it with a
backslash the backs the backslash in a
string says whatever the next character
is don't treat it as code treat it as a
string character so this will work now
it's going to be y-o-u space CA and
apostrophe T Drive so let's hit that and
you'll see it says you can't drive with
an apostrophe and so that's called
escaping that's important to know I know
it's kind of a rabbit trail kind of off
the beaten path where we're going but
that's important so let's go if age is
less than 16 alert you can't drive if
age is greater than 16 alerts you can
drive and an exclamation because driving
is fun
a problem with our program though is
what if the user is 16 so if it's less
than 16 it'll do this if they're older
than 16 like 17 then it'll do that but
what if they're exactly 16 well let's
fix that by going less than equal so now
if you're 16 or older you can drive so
now our program will always alert
something let's change my age to 17
you also notice I didn't do var anymore
that's because I've already defined the
variable of age you only have to do var
the first time age equals 17 let's run
our program again it says you can drive
now let's change our age to 16 and make
sure that our program works age 16 yep
you can drive too let's go one more step
further with our program and what you
can actually do is you can make this go
else let's clean this up a little bit
what you can do instead of if if is you
can do what's called an if-else
statement I can say if age is less than
16 do this else we're going to do this
so basically if you're not younger than
16 we're going to do what's in here
every single time so this program will
do the exact same thing you can also do
an if-else and else if statement so what
that would do is you can add another
condition you can do another set of
comparison operations in here so if the
age is less than 16 do this else if age
is exactly 16 you can drive finally else
which would mean if they're older than
16 alerts you've probably been driving
already and you'll notice once again I
have to escape that because that's not
allowed I would have been closing this
off with why are you ' and this would
have just been bad code so now if our
age is less than 16 we're going to do
this else if our age is exactly 16 we're
going to do this and if it's anything
besides that we're going to alert that
you've probably been driving already and
so my age currently is 16 you can drive
finally let's change our age to 15
run our program you can't drive let's
change our age to 17 you've probably
been driving already and let's do
something let's change our age to 16
point 5 what do you think it's going to
do I changed it to sixteen point five
well it's going to do else because it's
not exactly 16 it's greater than 16
you've probably been driving already and
it's true just not for very long so
please keep driving safely so that is
if-else statements so now go ahead and
write maybe another program where you
prompt you get something from a user and
do something fun with it so have a great
day and enjoy Java Script lesson number
