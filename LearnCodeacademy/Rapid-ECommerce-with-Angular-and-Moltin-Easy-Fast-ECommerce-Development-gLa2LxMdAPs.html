in this video we are going to be rapidly
building an e-commerce platform with
angular and Moulton we're actually going
to be using the yeoman angular generator
because that's going to automatically
scaffold out routes and stuff for us and
then we're also be using Moulton's
ecommerce API which I covered in another
video super cool tool that's going to
let us build any kind of app we want in
just a matter of seconds so go ahead and
download those two tools if you're going
to follow along and here we go we're
going to start by I've already done an
NPM install G yo for yeoman I also have
grunt installed globally and I have
Bower installed yo globally yo Billy and
then I've also installed a generator
angular because that's our angular
generator so those three are installed
and so now I can make a directory that's
going to be let's just call this
storefronts and so now I just go yo
angular what I like to use sass with
compass yes I like sass yes I like
bootstrap yes I like sass with bootstrap
I'm just going to say yes to all those
and now it's going to install everything
for me I'm going to be right back
because I'm not going to make you watch
my install okay there we go that took
about a minute and the install finished
so let's go ahead and go sublime
into this folder and see what we got so
it's scaffold it out a one more thing we
have to do is we have to go Bower
install now that it scaffolded all that
out for us so that's going to install
all the Bower modules that were in our
where is that in our Bower JSON so it
installed all those so let's give it a
SAN app here's our index.html that it
built out for us and you see that we
basically just have an about controller
and a main controller so let's go ahead
and use that in generator to now
scaffold out some routes for us we can
go yo angular route
let's build a store out
there you go let's also build a let's
say the store is going to be all
categories so then they click on a
category let's build a category route
and they click on a product so let's
click on a product product route and
then let's do a cart route let's see if
we can get that for I don't want to take
an incredible amount of your time but I
know we can at least get to cart here in
just a few minutes so there we go now we
have a lot more files we've included
we've included our store jsr category
J's product cart I'm just going to add
I'm going to go these top links and I'm
just going to make change about to store
delete contact who needs to contact the
store ok
so there we go now all I have to do is
go grunt serve that's going to open up a
live reloading web page for us in Chrome
should be any second now go all right
there we go so home and store this is
the store view so if you look at Apps
scripts app also has now all of our
routes this is what our generator did
when we did our route generation we
created a store a category product it
maps them to the controller create our
controllers for us and created our views
for us so we basically have a full app
now we just have to connect it to
Moulton I love the angular generator one
thing I've learned about yeoman
generators take the time to find the
generators you like take the time to
learn them and you're going to get that
time back a hundredfold so if you
remember from the Moulton video you have
to authenticate first before you make
API calls so this is a little bit tricky
and angular what we have to do is we
have to now make a service there's
probably three or four ways you could do
this in angular but I'm going to do it
with the service I think it's the
simplest way you can't see but I'm
making a folder called services down
here when the font zoomed in you can't
see in sublime what's going on down
there and let me go ahead and make a new
file in here and let's save this as
molten J s and so now I'm just going to
make a service module here angular
let's not call it Moulton let's see with
this app it's called storefront app so
let's go ahead and go storefront app
Moulton I like the stuff that's not 100%
about just my app to be its own module
name so no dependencies on you and let's
do a dot factory now let's call this
Moulton off maybe yeah there you go so
there we go and what I'm going to do
here is I'm going to if you remember I
have to basically do I'm going to copy
this I have this copied over here the
Moulton stuff I need to do you create a
new Moulton object then Moulton dot off
authenticate and there you go what that
does is that authenticates and then you
can do any Moulton stuff within here so
what I'm actually going to do is I need
to kind of wait for that to authenticate
and then return an authenticated object
so I'm going to use Q for that and I'm
going to create a promise if you don't
know about promises I do have a video on
promises and so I'll put the link to
that I think I have a video on promises
so we're going to go very deferred
equals Q dot defer so what I've done is
I've kind of made a promised object
right here a deferred object and so
that's going to be what I return
deferred dot promise I'm going to return
the promise of that now you might feel
confused here for about two minutes
stick with me till we get this first
route done and it's all going to make a
lot of sense and then we get to copy
paste so I'm going to do is I'm going to
authenticate first I'm returning
instantly this promise the promise is
not resolved with anything so when
Moulton authenticates then I'm going to
resolve with the Moulton object that's
been authenticated this object right
here so this is what's ultimately going
to get returned when people require
Moulton off so there's my factory one
thing I have to do is I have to now add
since I did not generate that factory
I have to add that in myself let's go
services molten j/s and I also have to
add that molten API library
Jas molten comm /v 1 so I'm going to go
ahead and save this file save as save
page as let's go code what's that called
storefront app scripts let's make a
folder called vendor and let's call this
molten min Jas yes use Jas I'm not a
food and then let's add this maybe right
here after angular so scripts vendor
what I call molten min Jaya so now
Moulton's on my page and that molten
service is on my page let's say this see
if I have any errors here okay I still
I'm seeing the store view so that's good
I'm not seeing a mat molten min app
looks like they have source mapping on
that I'm just going to drop that off
because I don't want to see source
mapping error that error is not a
problem but I don't want to see it so
there we go now I'm loading my store
view so now I can make in my app you see
I've got these routes created I can now
make Moulton API calls here in my app so
let's go to the store view this will be
where we view all categories we're going
to do a resolve so before we load our
store view we need to resolve a few
promises we'll call this one categories
and then this will will require molten
off what molten off I believe let's see
if that's what it was called molten auth
yeah so no once again so our factory
molten auth is going to return a promise
that gets resolved with a good molten
object so let's also load in queue so
we're going to do is Q dot when molten
auth so when molten auth resolves then
we're going to be able to do stuff in
here so that resolves with the molten
objects if you remember we resolved
right here we passed in molten so molten
is what gets passed into our function
now we can make our molten calls molten
category list and this seems like a lot
of code but once we get this in we get
to copy/paste so it's really not a lot
once we get this first one done we're
going to be able to do a lot of stuff
really fast so we're going to list our
categories categories and then I
actually want to do another resolve here
don't I so what I'm going to have to do
here is queue let's make a exact same
thing we did for our auth Q dot defer
and then I'm going to go deferred dot
resolved categories and then I'm going
to return that deferred promise okay so
once again I'm making it deferred and
I'm returning that so I'm returning this
as categories and angular is going to
wait until this promise resolves with
our categories so there we go we're
going to have all our categories in
let's go to the controller that it
generated for us where we call in this
store yep we're on store let's require
categories so categories is going to
require this guy right here which is our
whole categories process we just did
scope categories equals categories and
let's console.log categories as well so
we can see that let's go ahead and
refresh here and go to store unknown
provider categories oh I hate it when
you get these things oh I know what I
did wrong I did not add since I made a
new module I did not make my app require
that module yet angular I do that a lot
that's that's something I do a lot when
I'm doing angular stuff I'll add a
module I'll add it to my HTML and I'll
forget to make my app require it so now
we're good you can see my object is
right here boom I've got one uncatted
Erised I've got one category called
uncatted eyes so let's go ahead and make
that spit it out on the page now let's
go to our views our store view so if you
remember I made scope categories
categories and what do we actually want
to print out here the ID is that and the
title is what we're looking at so let's
go back to our storage GML categories
I'll just do a list for now don't want
to bore you guys this will be an NG
repeat
let's go cat in categories so this will
be cats dot title some people prefer the
spaces here some people don't I don't
really care and this href will be what
is it actually this is ng href because
we're going to do some templating in
here pound slash category and then it
will be cats dot ID I kind of prefer
spaces when it's there and I don't like
spaces when it's here in a URL because
it makes it feel massive so let's see if
that worked here there we go on
categories and that takes us to a URL
that's not working it so there we go
category slash cat ID let's go and build
out our categories now actually let's
make sure this works so I go to store
categories let me go to my forge moulton
let's go ahead and login to will store
add a category make sure this is working
here inventory categories create a
category no parent category
awesome category now I need a
description starred awesome category
there we go so there's my categories and
now if I load up here I should see two
awesome category and I'm categorized
awesome it is real time connecting to my
store so let's go ahead and build out
that category route it's going to be
really simple I just copy and paste that
whole resolve and instead of categories
this will be products when molten auth
then product list category equals and
then this will be the ID of our category
so what we need to do here is we need to
do route we need to get that route
paramah their route currents I think
it's params dot ID so we're going to
make this category slash ID so we just
want to go to slash category we need to
go to a specific category every time so
category slash ID that will be route
current params ID we're going to list
that this should work let's go ahead and
refresh this guy so there we go that
worked and let's go into our category
controller products products you know
what I also want to get the category
so let's go back to that and we're going
to also do the category of the sublime
text multiple cursors Apple D let's go
category
I believe it's get I think I can just go
I D like that so that should work let's
see if that all works for us
okay it's not resolving it's not
instantiating okay so let's try the up
unexpected identifier got a problem here
ah no comma to do so there we go
category view is resolving so that's
good we should have a category and a
products in there so let's go to our
view and add them and this is category
title since our category object is in
there and again we'll just do an Li I'm
actually going to go over to store copy
and paste prod in products and this will
go to products prod prod title see this
works hey we got our three products
sweet see how it's going a lot faster so
far ah run categorized category and then
we've got our products I'm not messing
with any design yet let's go to a single
product and then maybe we'll do an add
to cart and a cart for those of you guys
who totally want to keep following along
any of you guys at this point you can
probably realize wow you're going to be
able to build out a whole shopping cart
in a day so definitely go just get the
free to your moulten thing try it out
try building an angular app or a
JavaScript app with just HTML you're
going to like it
I'm going to go ahead and add a product
in an add to cart and then we'll call it
because we're probably looking at about
minutes 30 minutes by then let's go
ahead we're on a product view so I'm
going to copy the category resolved
seems the most likely one product we
want the product and then this one will
also have an ID required that one's got
the route injected then we're going to
do products get we're getting that
product yep that's all we need copy
paste so let's go do that
product controller requires product
scope dot product equals product it's a
lot of products and so now we should be
able to go and then let's let's
console.log this so we can kind of get a
looked at what look at what that product
object looks like bearded man strikes
back like it let's see it looks like I
got a problem in here somewhere unknown
provider products product control I must
have made a typo in there let me look at
this guy oh I know the problem is this
is not in a resolved I'll hate it when
it's something it's always something
silly like that isn't it
there we go that's going to work because
it works unexpected token well now
there's unexpected token somewhere where
is that okay
accidentally type to you and there we go
we've got our product bearded man
strikes back we've got our description
your beards will grow collect twice as
long listening these homeless looking
guys rock your face off with a banjo
okay so we want to print that
description maybe one we want to print
pricing dot formatted dot without tax
okay let's go and just print those two
and then do an Add to Cart button so
let's go P we're going to go ng bind
HTML because we're this is HTML in the
description that it's really cool that
you actually have the ability to add
basic HTML tags to the product
description which is really nice so the
front end or the code has no we don't
care what the description is we're just
going to print it out which means I
probably want that to be in a div not a
P tag there we go so there's the
description let's do a price what was
that that was product dot pricing dot
formatted dot without tax
there we go $10 even let's make an ad
card button add two carts and then this
will go ng click head cart and let's
make this class equals BTN BTN success
so there we go we're going to add that
one to cart let's go back to product J s
and get that not product u yep that's it
so this will basically pull in that now
we need to get that moulton we need to
get that molten object in here so we can
do is go back to app J s and then this
can just be molten and we will just
return return molten off we can actually
just return I think we just returned
molten off since that's a promise
let's find out if we can do that
let me console.log that real quick yeah
there we go so we've got our whole
Moulton thing there so let's go ahead
then we're going to go Moulton carts
inserts and then we are going to go
products dot ID quantity will always be
one we could add a field there but we're
not going to do that for now and then
that third parameter why it's always no
and let's do something a little funky
here let's go let's make we all we want
to show status that we're adding that so
let's make this an ng if add status if
there's no add status we're going to
show this if there is an add status
we're not going to make it clickable and
this will be warning and this will be
adding so there we go that'll be adding
to cart so add status is null by default
add status will be I don't know true
actually I'm going to do I'm going to
actually make that I'm actually take the
status from in here's what I'm going to
do
so there we go adding to cart I'm going
to scope that apply I might not need to
do that there and then once it's
complete scope dot add status equals
success and then let's bring timeout in
so then we're going to do a timeout
maybe have one second and then we're
going to make scope add status is null
again so there we go we should add it to
the cart what I did here is we're going
to insert it to the cart
we're going to we're going to change add
status so the button is going to not be
click that's going away and this guy's
showing up and then when it's successful
we should say success for about a second
and then click back to null so they can
add another one to the cart let's see if
this works here adding to cart applies
already in progress yeah I figured that
was the case we don't need you and what
we do need you
I believe let's try that live reload
refresh Add to Cart adding to cart
success and now we can add it to cart
again great Add to Cart adding to cart
success all right so that's basically
how we're going to do it we'll leave
cart out for now maybe we'll do another
video on it maybe we won't it's not that
magical you just have to add a customer
login and then post up your address and
your credit card information but that's
a little bit more time intensive so hope
you enjoyed looking at moulten with me
today and give them a trial run sign up
look at it it's a cool API and it's one
that I'm very very glad I took the time
to look into have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
