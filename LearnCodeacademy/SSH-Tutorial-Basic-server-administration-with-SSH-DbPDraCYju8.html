going to be showing some nodes server
administration we're going to set up an
engine X load balancer we're going to
deploy some nodejs applications into the
wild but to do that you got to be
comfortable with SSH so this video is
going to kind of cover that if you're
comfortable with SSH this video is not
really for you but a lot of devs have
not really gone further than github when
it comes to SSH so this video is going
to get into it and show you how fun and
just powerful it is so basically SSH
just opens up a secure shell to another
machine usually it's going to be a Linux
machine and it just basically gets you
into the terminal of that machine so I
can go SSH we'll which is my username at
supercars comm which is a fake machine
but that I've created but basically
supercars comm is going to point to an
IP address of an actual real machine
sitting somewhere so if I SSH into that
I'm basically logging into that machine
as the wheel user it's going to ask for
my password and there you go I'm now
Willet supercars so I'm actually on that
machine logged into the will user
directory so I can do everything on this
machine just as if I was actually there
I can install things let's say git is
not currently installed so I can do sudo
apt-get install git apt-get is basically
Linux is NPM or node package manager or
homebrew it allows you to install
programs from the command line so I can
just do this and now get is installed so
I can now let me find a gist I can now
gets clone there you go i can now
Colonna gist that i wrote the other day
and there we go
I have git repository on my machine so
it's actually great for deployments if
you want to clone your directory and
pull your master branch and this is your
actual web server there you go let's say
you want to install my sequel PHP
whatever you're on the machine you can
configure and administrate
your machine all through SSH it's really
great you can also copy files using
rsync
so let me show you what I have here is
it it by the way exit is the command to
get out of you'll notice want to hit
exit I left that machine then I'm back
on my machine now which has my kind of
custom bash script here so you can use
our sink let me show you I have these
three files in my directory and I can
our sink - a V is the one and by the way
all these commands I'm going to put them
in a gist and put it in the description
so I don't just show you a bunch of
stuff and then leave you hanging but I
can our sink AV dot is my current
directory so I'm going to do all the
files in this directory will at
supercars comm and then colon because
I'm going to actually give it a path to
do that I'm going to go home directory
slash new app it's going to ask for my
password that's kind of annoying I'm
going to show you how to do password
lists SSH here in a second but you see I
created the directory home will new app
and I copied all these files there let's
actually SSH in and see if that did it
it needs my password again there we go
we have new apps so I can go CD space
new app and do directory listing and
there you go there's my files so that's
kind of actually a quick and dirty way
to do it a deployment if you want to you
can just are sync all your files
straight to your server and now your web
server is updated with your new files it
sure beats FTP it's pretty dirty it'd be
better to actually do push it to a
github repo login and do a poll from
that repo or even better use a
deployment software like Capistrano
which we'll get into in the future in
some videos there's definitely better
deployment strategies but rsync sure
beats FTP let me actually RM I'm going
to delete main CSS here let's get out
and I'm going to our sink again and then
you'll notice all it did was copy main
CSS because our sink is actually going
to sink up it's going to find out what
it needs to do it's only going to move
the files it needs to move the files
that were changed once again super beats
FTP so if you're looking for a quick and
dirty deployment there you go
just our sink that thing but we'll get
into better things later on let's show
you real quick how to do a password list
SSH you probably had to do this when you
got set up on github is you had to make
an SSH key what a key pair is is you've
got your public key and you've got your
private key when you generate it it will
create both like say you can't create a
key called
ID RSA which is standard it's going to
do ID RSA which is your private key and
it's going to do IDRs a dot pub you're
going to copy the contents of this to
the server and the pub and you're going
to move it to the authorized keys file
and then the server knows that this ID
RSA key is accepted in place of a
password so this is the one you want to
protect with your life because anybody
with this file can access your server
that has this file installed so what
we're going to do is we're going to
install this right here onto our server
and then anytime we have this key we can
connect without a password so to do that
we just go to our user folder and go to
SSH directory if that's not there you're
going to have to create it and then
whoops I just made in one called SSH
without the dot so you're going to make
a directory called dot SSH which it says
it's already there so and then if you
don't see an ID RSA file which I just
deleted mine you're going to want to
generate one that's easy SSH key gin and
then the only thing you're going to want
to do is capital C and you're going to
want to give it a comment that kind of
differentiates it to you usually just do
your email address there we go and then
it's going to say you want to make it
this file ID RSA sure hit enter
passphrase I'm going to do no passphrase
so if I hit LS now I have ID RSA an ID
RSA dot pub you're going to open this
and you're going to copy the contents to
your clipboard or if you want to do it
the quick way you can go caps
IDRs a pub pipe PB copy so I'm going to
copy that
to my clipboard and now I'm going to SSH
will at supercars comm again I'm getting
tired of typing my password so now we
are going to go into my SSH folder it
doesn't exist so I'm going to actually
make it and then I'm going to get into
it and I'm going to use Nano which is
kind of like a command line text editor
there's Nano Emacs and vim which are
kind of the three popular ones my
favorite is vim although it's the most
complicated Nano is the easiest so if
you're not used to it use Nano I'm going
to nano a file called authorized
underscore keys which it may already
exist if it already exists this will
open it if it doesn't exist nano will
create it I can now paste in my key
contents I can exit and I can save which
by the way let me show you I was doing
here I did ctrl X to exit one thing
that's nice about Nano is it gives you
like kind of a menu at the bottom
control X and then Y to save it says
enter yep so now if I hit LS I have a
file called called authorized keys and
in that is my ID RSA pub you can add
thirty different keys if you want so
thirty different people can all SSH into
your machine without a password
I can now hit exit and now let me go
back to my folder that I was in code
sandbox I think it was just SSH there we
go
so now let me pull up that rsync command
again there we go and now it does not
ask for a password I can also go SSH
we'll at supercars comm and it didn't
ask for a password so now I can actually
create like a bash script that did 50
different things on my server and it
wouldn't need a password for it I could
run one command that runs the script and
it does this whole server script so when
you've seen bash scripting that's pretty
much a lot of times along the lines of
the things you're looking at doing but
that's pretty much SSH in a nutshell it
allows you to securely connect to
another server
run some commands on it administrate
that server and in the next video we're
going to show you how to create your own
Linux server on your machine using
vagrant and VirtualBox and so you can
mess with and get to know server
administration better without blowing up
your actual live web server or someone
else's live web server so let's get into
that next video which is on vagrant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
