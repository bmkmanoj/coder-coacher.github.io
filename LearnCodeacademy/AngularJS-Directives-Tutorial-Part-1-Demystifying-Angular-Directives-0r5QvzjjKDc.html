to angularjs and developing a single
page application with it I'm going to
throw a link here in the in the
description and probably an annotation
somewhere around here if you're not on
mobile you'll see that and so in this
one we're going to get into angular's
most confusing yet most powerful feature
and that is directives lots of people
directives are kind of a black box to
them I kind of see it but it seems kind
of confusing so we're going to just kind
of in this is a lesson all to its own
because directives are quite a quite a
bit of stuff but at the end of the day
you're going to find out they're not
that confusing so let me kind of give
you the premise of where it comes from
let's say we've got this controller here
and we're just kind of importing friends
we got our friends list here our friends
JSON so this is our friends HTML
templating things so let's say for each
friend we wanted to you know start
adding some stuff you know we're going
to add our friend first name friend last
name what else do we have in here friend
age and tweets
let's go span
there we go so now we've kind of got
that and it's in an ng-repeat
let's say we want to break this out into
something more reusable that we don't
have to it's reusable now because it's
in an ng-repeat but say we're going to
use this thing all over the place might
not be used in an ng-repeat if I click
on this friend then I want to reuse all
the same code there just for the
individual person what's actually going
to make more sense is to make a
directive in a lot of ways or you can do
an ng-include template but in this case
we'll just use a directive so we're
going to make a directive called
contact card and so what I've done is
I've divined an html5 element some of
you guys really don't like calling
things that so what you can do is you
can just do a div like if you're not
building a dedicated html5 app you can
do a div with an attribute of contact
card and that will also work or if that
if you guys are still wanting to be more
compliant you can do data contact card
and support official html5 data types
since I like for it to feel cool I'm
going to call it contact card there and
we're going to move on and now you see
we have nothing so let's go ahead and
create our contact card directive I'm
going to create a new one and I'm going
to call this one app dot directives
contact card this is just my module name
this could be whatever you want it has
no dependencies I'm going to go ahead
and save you
this directives so now I've got my
directives contact card let's go ahead
and add that to my build where all those
things come in here right here add that
to all my JavaScript build however you
get it on the page is up to you okay so
now it's in there and in my app I'm
going to add this as a dependency for my
app loading up and what did I call that
I call that app dot directives contact
card there we go
so now it's going to require that to be
loaded before the app boots up and
everything's still good don't think I
have JavaScript errors nope
we're good all right sweet so let's go
ahead and build out this directive so
when we have added contact card it is
going to start looking for a directive
called
contact card except for it won't be
looking for it - space so they can for
camel space so I'm going to go dot
directive I'm going to call it contact
card like that
so what angular is going to do is it's
automatically smart enough to translate
it from the hyphenated version to the
camel cased version so I'm creating
directive context card and then I'm
doing a function which is dependency
injected so if I want to have this
require any services or whatever this is
a dependency injected function you know
I can require my friends service which I
did from my previous video you know I
can require scope any of that stuff
actually can't there's really no scope
needed at this point and what we're
going to return is an object and that
object is our directive the first thing
we're going to get into is let's go
restrict e so that way this thing can
only be instantiated by using an element
that's if I did restrict thats this if I
did restrict a that's attribute that's
when I did it div contact card that will
also work on data contact card so that's
kind of what the restrict is about
that's just so you can you know it's
more or less for self documenting
purposes I'm only going to call this
thing as an element or as an attribute
so you kind of know what to look for in
your code I'm just going to stay
restrict to e since I'm calling it as e
here let's go on to our next thing and
I'm going to go straight to controller
controller is also dependency injected
you can add whatever you want in here I
can add in my scope and I'm just going
to have this thing to a alert so we know
that this thing's firing there you go it
alerts controller so we know that the
controller is firing it fired twice
because I'm doing an injury Pete for my
two friends
so the controller is already active I
can have this do a console log of
controller there you go so it logged
twice so our controller is working it's
linking it's firing if you're not
getting that to work either this name is
not matching this name here
you're not defining it in the right way
that it's restricting to or possibly
you'll get an error here if you've not
included the directive JavaScript on the
page and the common thing that I do all
the time is I forget to add my module my
directive module as a dependency so it's
loading but it's not loading in time or
it's not requiring it to load before it
goes in processes this templating that's
usually the mistake that I make is I go
ahead I add the JavaScript file I add
the directive file but I forget to make
it a dependency so you don't get any
errors at that point because it's just
saying hey we don't know what contact
card is move on so just make sure that
you've added it in your app dependency
whatever your module name is which is
right there so just figured I reiterate
that that's the kind of thing I did
about 20 times when I was first making
directives because you just don't get an
error about it takes you a while to
figure out what's going on so let's say
I want to pass some information into
this directive how am I going to do that
the biggest way you'll do that is
through attributes I'm going to say data
equals and I can pass it in any kind of
anything in this case I'll just call it
friend which is coming from up here so
it's basically taking anything from my
current scope and it's passing it in
through an attribute and now we can
access this through scope and the scope
object I can grab data is and I do equal
and that is going to look for an
attribute called
data so that's going to say data is
equal and I can go grab data so now
scope data in my controller I can go
will be my friend for each person
let me just refold that again just in
case it I didn't explain it super well
I'm passing in the friend object
to the data attribute data is looking
for the data attribute let's say I
wanted this to be called something else
my data but I still want to look to the
data attribute I can do that and that
didn't work why didn't that work I don't
know I usually keep it name the same
thing honestly because it just gets
really confusing honestly if I was doing
this I would call it friend and then I
would call this thing friend because it
really helps to keep the naming
conventions always the same you'll get
stuff really confused all the time oh
that's what it is I'm console logging
scope data I did it right my data data
back to example number 1 so I'm still
calling it data here now I'm going to
call it my data in here for whatever
reason because I want to confuse myself
and everybody watching and it still
works so bad way to do it but that's
kind of how you can finagle with the
stuff I'm going to for the sake of
simplicity call it friend and I'm going
to call it friend and we're just going
to keep everything similar okay and
there's a couple things equals means
it's the binding is going both ways
there's some other binding characters
you can pass in instead of equals you
can make the binding just go one way or
you can make the binding go two ways you
can look at the angular docs for that
the majority of time you're just going
to want to go equals so that way if you
go changing your friend here it's going
to fly back up the chain and it's going
to change it in the controller for your
home controller usually that's what you
want to do you want it to always be
bound both ways still so so there's my
controller now I can add my own template
and I can go h1 friend dot first name
and make sure I McConnell there you go
so now I've got my own templating going
on that's really we're going to want to
use a template URL just like we do for
everything else so I will go templates
direct is and then this is what is this
contact card contacts card dot HTML
let's go make that direct is contact
card HTML so now I can take that
templating that I had I think I already
erased it didn't I yep okay let's go
each one and now we're working again so
now I've kind of got this is my
directive that matches up to my actual
directive j/s so now I can start
building my reusable code we've kind of
gone through the whole steps that we
need to take so now this thing is
completely reusable I've got my
directive it's going through the
controller let me kind of show you some
other things and now my HTML looks super
clean and actually it's super it really
makes a lot of sense actually one thing
that I like about if you're using an
html5 only app being able to define
stuff like this really kind of makes it
really clear and self documenting you
know exactly what's going on so that's
kind of how that works let's go and go
through some options that we can use
here so let's say we want to add some
HTML into our directive declaration
let's say I want to add my own h1 and
even do some scoping stuff here you'll
notice that doesn't show up if I had
hyphens or whatever nothing's showing up
because by default anything in this
directive gets completely deleted so if
you want to pull that in then use the
trance clewd true flag
and it still doesn't get pulled in
because it doesn't know where to
transclude it because you already have
your template so what you're going to do
in your template is you're going to add
any kind of element and you're going to
add the ng transclude attribute and
there you go now before my friend name
gets printed and I'll change this to h2
now before my friend and gets printed
it's going to transclude so I can put
this at the bottom and that
automatically gets put below now every
time so that's kind of where that comes
in if you want to be able to custom
tweak some part of your contact card
every time you declare it that's how you
would do that another way you can add
custom tweaking is uh you can add your
own attributes let's let's say that h1
won't always be called contact card I
can make sure that title is called
contact there and let's just
that'll be called title and then I'm
going to pull in title as well here
so now scope dot title is going to be
called and I need to make sure that this
is H defined as a string there we go
because you'll notice all these
attributes are getting looked at as
evaluated objects so this isn't a string
of friend anymore it's looking for an
object called friends so this did not
work at first because it was looking for
an object object called capital C
contact so I have to make sure I wrap it
in string quotes and so now I can
instantiate it with a different title
every time real time or I can pass it in
you know an object so that's kind of
where that comes in let's go back to my
directive so we've got our restrict
we've got our scope this is how we pull
stuff in based off of attributes we got
our trance clewd equals true that's we
want to pull some stuff in I don't
really need that anymore we've got a
replace option let's go look at the Dom
element that's getting created here
notice our Dom element is still called
contact card I don't really want that I
want to call this thing reaiiy want to
make sure that this stays as a div keep
it a little bit more compliant you can
go replace true and this will fail
should give me an error now yeah it's
going to give me an error right now
because you have to have at least one
root element if you're going to do this
I'm going to go to my contact card HTML
I'm going to make sure I wrap everything
in a div and so now instead of contact
card being the elements for that it's
going to be called div there we go so
now if I inspect this over here now
instead of my element being called
contact card
it's called div so I usually do that
it's kind of as a safe measure and that
way I can still use my html5 elements as
much as I want for clarity and then
they'll get to substitute it out for a
more compliant div so that's something
I'll do kind of always use replace and
then honestly this is about as
complicated as stuff gets once again
this controller is dependency injected
so you can insert anything you want to
you can do an interval
so you can pull on any air dependency
injected values and that'll all work
this is dependency injected as well and
let's do the link function and that's
probably about all you need to know to
write a whole lot of directives there's
also a compile function which you
probably won't need to know unless
you're doing some complicated stuff
let's say that we wanted to do some
stuff to this Dom element we wanted to
bind and listen to Dom events at that
point we'd add a link function now link
function is not dependency injected
you're going to get three you're going
to get three arguments here you're going
to get the scope so a common thing is to
not add a dollar sign there so you know
that this is actually just getting
passed as the first argument all the
time
you're not dependency injecting it
second one is elements and the third one
is attributes so if I go here I'm always
going to get the scope I'm going to get
my jQuery element if you're running
jQuery it's automatically going to be
wrapped as a jQuery element if not
you're going to be getting the jQuery
Lite angular version and then the
attributes so what you can do here is I
can go make sure out of this so now
whenever I click my elements it's going
to alert click and so that's kind of if
you want to make your directive do some
smart stuff that's going to be where you
do that you can also get the ID of your
elements that way if you're not using
jQuery it passes you your attributes so
I can automatically get my attribute ID
attribute from here which is not defined
I'll just make this the index since
we're doing it ng-repeat
and that's always calling an index
because it's directive and don't exactly
remember how to do that I haven't done
in a while but that's pretty much it
that's how you use a link of if you need
to do any Dom manipulation so hopefully
that helps you understand directives
let's kind of recap real quick restrict
this is for how you're pulling it in
scope this is for where stuff's coming
from this is how you get all your data
in these can be objects these can be
values you define real time with strings
they can be as complicated as you want
them to be and then controller you're
defining your own controller here you
could give this its own controller name
or it's usually you wanted to find the
control right here pull your templating
URL that's about it directives are not
really that complicated once you get
past building your first one or two hope
you enjoy this tutorial and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
