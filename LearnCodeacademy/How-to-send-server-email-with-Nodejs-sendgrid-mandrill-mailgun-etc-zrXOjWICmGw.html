application that can be a daunting idea
at first but it's actually really easy
for anyone that's done it so we're just
going to show you how to send email from
a node.js application the process is
very similar for a PHP or Ruby on Rails
app but since I've been doing node
tutorials we're going to stick to this
and so it's a lot easier to use an
external service because for several
reasons one you don't have to configure
your server to be a mail server if that
doesn't go to spam which can be a
journey all on its own and it's just so
much more simple and more reliable to
let someone else handle that part of the
process for you just like letting
someone else handle your hardware I
think email is something that is always
worth it to let someone else handle some
main services out there for it mandrill
SendGrid
and mailgun there's probably a dozen
more these seem to be three of the big
players I can say that of the two I've
used mandrill and SendGrid
I do prefer SendGrid they both will give
you twelve thousand emails a month for
free
four hundred a day I think is how they
cap it so they'll give you that many a
month for free although mandrels
sometimes we'll go to spam and it may
have to do with the size of the website
smaller websites or something but I also
feel like mandrill is a little bit
slower to deliver email SendGrid on a
brand new website nobody knows about
will not go to spam and it's just
reliable you'll get an email in about
five seconds so we're going to be doing
a send grid example so what you need to
do is you need to go npm install here's
what I have right here just so you can
see I have a basic I just ran Express
generator so I have just a basic Express
app haven't really done anything to it
you're going to go npm install save
SendGrid
let's install SendGrid so that's going
and then you're going to go to SendGrid
comm and you're going to sign up for an
account which won't even take your
credit card information won't do
anything if you are doing the try for
free option so you're going to go ahead
sign up for an account now one thing
SendGrid does which might be why they
don't go to spam as often is they have a
person actually approve your
count application I don't know what that
person is looking for because all they
really ask for is your name address and
website but when you sign up for that it
will take up to six or seven hours I
don't know it might take til the next
day if it's overnight I did this
yesterday just so you know that I'm not
talking from past experience what I
delete him
I just yesterday created a new site
added manual to it it went to spam took
about five or maybe might was more like
fifteen it was awhile to receive an
email a lot longer than I wanted it to
be and then I added SendGrid right away
as well
sänger did not go to spam and I got
emails within five seconds so but it did
take six or seven hours for them to
provision my account um it says in red
bar once you've logged in account is
provisioning you know you'll hear back
soon so as soon as that provisioned I
was good let's go and show you how to
install this and we'll be good so you go
to NPM SendGrid
I just type Google for those NPM
SendGrid
and this will give you kind of the
easiest way to start with that package
here's my index route so I guess I can
go res dot send okay boot up my app NPM
starts okay so there I am I just haven't
okay routes on the home page so let's go
ahead and send my email when you log
into the home page so I'm pasting that
in that's going to ask for my username
and password that I created when I made
my account so that's all that is and
then you just fill out this information
so let's make this I don't want you to
see my password so I actually set them
in the process environment variables so
I'm sneaky
ah can't set me username and password
and you know what I also don't want you
to see my personal email so haha you
don't know who I am I will say Robo say
no reply at learn code Academy there we
go and so then let's see if it's an
error let's just do res and AH and if
it's not an error that res send wahoo
okay there you go that's done it's
installed my account has been
provisioned because I did this yesterday
so let's go ahead and run this let's go
to restart where am i restart my Express
app reload this page it says woohoo
let's count 5 1 2 3 4 and email ha there
you go no reply learning code Academy
has sent me an email so that's what
you'll use if you're wanting to give you
know email confirmations that someone is
subscribe to a service or whatever email
notifications that blah blah blah has
changed so hope that helps you out and
have an excellent day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
