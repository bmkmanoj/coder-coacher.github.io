videos for you here and they're going to
be the five things that make JavaScript
super weird but also that make
JavaScript awesome these are five of the
most misunderstood or barely understood
or not even understood things about
JavaScript they're going to be very
useful very very useful if you're new to
JavaScript and honestly lots of
intermediate developers still don't
grasp these things very well so we're
going to be covering them I'm going to
do a video on each so you can re-watch
it they build on each other for the most
part they all build on each other and so
you'll want to rewatch it to you kind of
get it and then move on with each one so
let's get into the first one one of the
first things that makes JavaScript weird
is first class functions what this means
is that functions can be passed as
arguments and if you don't understand it
you're not going to understand why a lot
of the Java scrap JavaScript syntax is
the way it is let me show it to you in
code it's a lot more easy you know a lot
easier to understand let's go make a
function called add first second and all
this is going to do is consult log first
plus second all right there we go and
let's do something let's go add two plus
three let's add four plus five let's hit
save and there we go I don't know if
that's big enough for you but we we
console.log 2 plus 3 and Wii console
logged 4 plus 5 now let's add a third
one called callback and this is dumb you
see a ton and jQuery whatever the
optional last argument is a callback
function to fire when it's done and so
let's create a function here and this
one we will console.log done so there we
go and now I need to do something with
callback here so I'll go callback and
I'm going to actually fire it when I'm
done with my addition here so what I've
done is I've given an argument 1 &amp;amp; 2 our
numbers argument 3 is a function I'm
creating right now and I'm passing that
function up here it's not firing yet
it's being passed as an argument that ad
is going to hold on to it's going to do
everything it needs to do
in this case is just addition and then
it's going to fire that function later
as a callback let me show you what this
going to so now it's going to say it's
going to console.log two plus three and
then it's going to console.log done so
let me actually create another one here
and this is going to console.log done
again so this is going to do the exact
same thing it doesn't care what your
callback function is it's just going to
fire it when you're done so it's going
to console.log two plus three done
console.log four plus five and then it's
going to fire my other function again
and so that is what it means to pass a
function a function is a first-class
object and so here's kind of another way
to look at it is a function is basically
a variable I can go function log done
and that will console.log done there we
go
and so now I can actually pass log done
and let's go ahead and mute that guy so
there you go exact same thing I'm
creating a function here called log done
I'm passing it as if it was a variable
because to JavaScript it is a variable
and so I'm passing log done in it's
going to get it's now going to be
associated as callback and it will get
fired whenever and honestly in jQuery
what you're actually seeing is something
more like this if callback then fire
callback so that way you don't have to
pass callback I can just do console log
four five here there you go so now it's
going to do two plus three fire the
callback because it exists fire four
plus five and don't fire the callback
because it doesn't exist and so that's
kind of little bit closer to what's
going on it's more complicated than that
but if you want to build your own
callbacks that's a nice way to make them
optional and so that's what it means for
them to be first-class functions so in
jQuery when you're doing stuff like my
div click function
you're actually creative function right
there that you're passing to the click
and it's not going to do anything with
it until the click event fires and
that's why you can also go function
handle click you know do something smart
there something smart and then you can
actually go handle click and that looks
a lot cleaner there that's a lot of
cleaner way to do a lot of your jQuery
and that kind of leads us into video
number 2 which is event-driven
environment let's get into that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
