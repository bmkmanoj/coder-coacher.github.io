running and we can now use fleet to run
multiple copies of our web apps and this
brings us to kind of the biggest
difficulty that a lot of elbers have
when moving to a services slash micro
services architecture is oh my goodness
this IP address for web 2 could change
if this machine dies fleet is gonna
reschedule web 2 over here
so now web 2 has a brand-new IP address
and a brand new port so how do I handle
that and we basically need to bring in
service discovery that's really two
phases to be solved is service
registration you know and so Etsy D is
basically going to be our hub the
internal Etsy D this can be our hub
we're going to register that these
services exist and are running and then
nginx our load balancer is going to
query Etsy D and discover those services
and kind of watch that first for changes
so whenever services arrive or depart
nginx is going to reload its
configuration and restart itself so
let's handle that first step of service
registration to do that core OS gives us
a great tool called flannel and you see
in the cloud config file we've started
flannel here and what flannel is going
to do is it's going to give a unique IP
address to every single docker container
that runs and it's going to be an
internal IP address like at n dot o IP
address so it's only accessible to
services running in this core OS cluster
it's not going to be accessible outside
which also solves another cool problem
for us and when some app runs we don't
have to expose any public ports anymore
we only have to expose internal ports to
my docker container so right now our
some app at service is doing an
uppercase P which says hey expose all
the ports that my nodes sample app is
exposing and create a dynamic port for
them that's accessible publicly and
let's kind of just go through this real
quick
so let's I can list units I have nothing
running so let's go ahead and start some
app
that's one three four so let's get four
copies of some app running here dudududu
great still got those error messages I
need to look into what those are so
fleets control lists units great I've
got four of them running on four
different machines and so let's go ahead
and ssh into this guy have that handle
it for me and I'll do a docker PS so
that's automatically it's exposing 43000
which is getting mapped to three to
seven seven zero externally that is
available to anyone that has access to
this core OS cluster which if you
remember on digital ocean is everybody
in the world because these are all
public of course you can fix that with
IP tables but a cool thing is is using
flannel we're not even have to do that
anymore
but let me show you real quick so if I
were to kill this node let's say our to
go to digital ocean and just then the
power off signal to this machine
anything running on that machine flannel
would reassigned to another machine
really quickly pretty much as soon as it
noticed that that service died but then
they'd have a new IP address and they
certainly have a new docker port as well
so what flannel does is flannel actually
assigned this guy an internal IP address
so let me go ahead and grab that out
let's go docker exec some app one I'm
gonna run a command within some app 1
and I'm just gonna run IP address list
so you can see if I look at my eighth
ernet zero I've got this IP address that
has been given to me so now I can just
ping this port 3000 actually I'll just
ping it yep it's working and then let me
go to a different machine and let's see
fleet control list units I'm going to go
to a completely different machine a
completely different container some app
at three
and let's get into that app let's go
docker exec IT I want to do an
interactive terminal and we're going to
go into some app 4 so I'm gonna open up
a bash terminal basically within my some
app for container what mmm
did I do the wrong one yep I did that
three so some app three is the container
that's running on this machine okay
there we go now I'm in some app free
some app 3 now let's do a curl let's
actually curl this IP address port 3000
because we don't even care about an
externally exposed IP address and there
you go I've got my HTML document from my
other web service running on the other
container the two things that are great
about flannel is one we don't have to
use docker link at all so if you're
familiar with docker link docker link
you know you can link two containers
together and it'll set a bunch of
environment variables that tell you all
how to talk to them but now we don't
even have to worry about that we just
have to register each web service with
its accessible IP and the port is always
gonna be 3,000 on any of our web
containers so how do we actually
register this come on let's get to the
meeting potatoes here let me get out of
here so there's basically two ways to
register this one we are going to
register this to Etsy D internally so
we're going to use Etsy decontrol and
we're just going to set a key and then
other services can get a key or they can
watch it so the the two ways of doing
this as you can either have your some
app service actually handle this so in
this case I'm running a node.js
application that node.js application
could automatically register its IP
address and port 3000 to @cd all I have
to do is kind of give it I just have to
mount the sed control as a volume within
the container but it's not really the
best practice for a service to handle
its own registration what you want to do
instead is a sidekick service so we're
gonna create a some app discovery
service and this will kind of link to
every instance of a web service and then
it will
run alongside and it can monitor the
service for us and when the service goes
up or down we're going to either add or
remove a key from @cd so here's what
that file looks like it's got a
description we're going to announce some
app one we're going to bind to some app
one and then we're gonna start up after
what we're gonna start up after some
apple one has started and then we have
this fleet configuration here which says
it's a machine of some app once that
means whenever we start stop some app 1
then it's automatically going to start
and stop some app discovery at 1 so that
means basically once we've kind of
loaded up this service we don't have to
manually control it anymore it will
automatically be a slave of some app 1
so here's what that's doing if you're
good at bash script you're gonna see
that it's basically just going to run a
loop every 45 seconds it's gonna run at
CD control set this key right here
services some app upstream some app 1
and it's going to run this docker
inspect command and get the IP address
of some app 1 I'll show you that command
real quick let's do that SSH again so I
can just run docker inspect we're gonna
get the network settings an IP address
from some app 3 there's the IP address
so it's just going to get that IP
address ad port 3000 to it and then it's
going to give it a timeout of 60 seconds
so this key is gonna expire after 60
seconds but we're gonna heartbeat update
this thing every 45 seconds and then if
this service ever stops then we're going
to remove that key from @cd okay simple
enough let's go ahead and submit this
some app discovery
at so we're submitting this to Fleet
control and then let's go ahead and
start four copies of it so we do have to
kind of create these either by doing a
fleet control start or a fleet control
load let me show you what just happened
- if I go fleet control list unit files
we only submitted one unit file and that
was the discovery at file and whenever
you create a new number from a just from
an ad file then it what it does is it
actually clones that file so you have a
copy of it so these copies did not exist
until I ran fleet control load or fleet
control start if I had not run those
there'd be no companion services
there'd be no sidekicks for these all
there would be as a sidekick for this
guy right here which we never actually
run so I had to do a run or a start to
create those sidekick files and from now
on whenever I do a some at one service
start or stop then it will automatically
start or stop its companion as well if
you'll notice the companion service also
got loaded on the exact same machine so
sidekick one got put on the same IP
addresses some app one sidekick two got
put on the same IPs some app two and so
and so so basically they're linked as
far as fleet is concerned this service
and this service are coupled together so
let's go do fleet control lists units
we've got them running so they're all
running and let's go ahead and ssh in
and see what etsy D looks like so at C D
LS recursive so these are all my Etsy D
keys and you'll see that it has now
created a services folder with some app
in it upstream and we've got four up
streams that are set let's go ahead and
look at one of these
there we go so that's an IP address for
some app three some app two some app one
and some app for so now we can spin up
an NG next instance that watches this
folder right here
and when anything changes it reloads
itself hopefully you got this you this
is the one of the again there's the most
complicated piece understanding service
registration to me is the toughest part
service discovery is a lot easier than
service registration so let's go ahead
and move on to service discovery and
nginx</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
