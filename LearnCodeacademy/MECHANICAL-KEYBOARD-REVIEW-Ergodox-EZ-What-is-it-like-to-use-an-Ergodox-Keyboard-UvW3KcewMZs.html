review of a mechanical organ ama
keyboard and I got a really fun one for
you on this next one now the last one I
reviewed the Mattias ergo Pro is a great
keyboard for people who want something
plug and play is just going to instantly
amplify your work experience and you
just move forward with really no
glitches the next one I'm bringing to
you is completely different
it's the Ergo docks easy now for those
you guys been following the ergo docks
I'll give you a quick review if you
haven't the Ergo docks is this super
cool open-source keyboard it completely
customizable any key can be any number
of things and there's just some caveats
to it you have to build it yourself for
one it's an open source design so you
have to kind of wait for a mass drop to
take place where you can order these
things at bulk the actual printed shape
and the keys and all that stuff and then
you assemble it all together on your own
when it finally comes in say goodbye to
your wife and kids for a week because
you're going to spend your week
soldering and getting high on fumes and
then if your brain is still around after
all those fumes you've got yourself in
ergo docks keyboard assuming you didn't
mess up any of the wiring and you can
then get to customizing and really going
for that experience so what are go doc
cz has done is they've said hey let's
take away that whole building portion of
it for you let's just bulk let's get
these manufactured at scale so you can
then order them and get straight to the
fun part which is customizing your work
experience so they've manufactured a
really great
arrghh adopts lots of improvements over
the Ergo docks you would build yourself
at home you get some really cool tinting
keys here which can snap to any
different place they've got these nice
spring-loaded screws so you just unscrew
them a little bit and they'll snap in
place tighten them where you want it you
get a lot of different tinting angles
with that super cool they have an option
for these really cool wrist rests which
I mean that is not that's not ABS
plastic I don't know what it's like a
polymer rubbery
it's heavy like I would not want to get
hit in the face with this thing that's
how you know it's good really great you
can see I've already changed my tenting
position on this one to something
awkward and then
then you can basically get to
customizing right away anything you want
ergo Doc's easy will let you pick a
number of different key caps I went with
the Gator on Browns which are very
similar to a Cherry MX brown so they're
nice in a they're tactile but they're
also pretty quiet so you could
definitely still use them in an office
situation and they feel really really
good that nice mechanical key switch
tactile response that you're looking for
so as for what the ergo docks actually
feels like to use it's really
interesting I call it a journey keyboard
because you don't buy it because it's
awesome on day one the reason is is
there's economic changes you notice
instead of the keys being offset which
means hey that might be great for my
right hand but for my left hand it also
has to offset the rose that's a 19 and
1819 original typewriter design people
all of our keyboards still reflect the
original that's crazy our fingers don't
do that we're not like surfers from the
60s it might be fine for your right hand
but your left hand is just hey guys so
it's just really cool that it's all
everything set up in columns which is
the ergo docks design but at first you
don't realize how used to typing
terrible you are you start typing like a
child at first because your left hand
keeps trying to go like that so you're
missing stuff all over day one best way
I know how to explain it you feel like a
child day two of using the ergo docks
you basically I've been using this for a
week now just so you guys can a week
non-stop day two you start to get a feel
for actually how it works okay cool I'm
not doing too bad day three you start to
actually love where all the the
customized thumb switches are and that's
that's right there is six key switches
for each thumb you can do a lot of stuff
and never really move so your thumb just
got a lot more useful after a few days I
started getting that desire to customize
it myself I do a lot of Apple or a
command tab I do a lot of command shift
a lot of command alt commands so I made
those very easy to where I could command
tab command shift all those things just
by using my thumbs I also started
customizing my own firmware layer to
where if I hit akame
and if I hit a key over here with my
thumb these fingers can now control my
mouse around the screen and then I can
hit a key to optionally change how fast
that mouse moves so after just I'd say
about four days I moved from very very
frustrated at the newness of it to
starting to get addicted to it and not
wanting to go back to a normal keyboard
anymore
now back and forth is still super
seamless and easy because I've been on a
keyboard my whole life but I started
finding myself missing all those super
organized and also once I started
learning to control my mouse with the
keyboard I was able to kind of move
these further away from my mouse and not
have to worry about it just look at the
screen and do super fun stuff so now I
could put a screen on the ceiling and
just put these on my arms and be a
weirdo you can do a lot of great things
with a keyboard once you learn to
control your mouse with it so it's a
journey keyboard I'm actually going to
do some update posts and videos later on
because I'm going to commit to doing a
journey of at least a month on this
keyboard and see just how fun it gets
I'm going to customize a lot more stuff
I'll probably share my firmware up that
I've come that I feel like is good for
web development and it's just a it's a
really fascinating keyboard to me I say
fascinating because it's this mix of I
don't know what to do with you yet and I
love you it's just this fun weird mix so
if you--if you're the customizing kind
of person who loves to tweak stuff take
a look at the ergo Doc's keyboard let's
do a sound sample of these gaiter on
brown switches and call it a day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
