mobile web shall we
you've probably heard it said that it is
a mobile first world and if you haven't
heard it you just heard it and that's a
very important saying in web development
because it means that people are going
to view your website on a mobile device
as much or a lot more than on a desktop
these days unless you're in a really
unusual industry which actually I'm in
web videos I don't get a lot of mobile
traffic because people don't want to
watch code on their phone but unless
you're doing something really unusual
like that it's a mobile first world the
way your website looks on a mobile
device is very important so it's said to
build a great advice is to build your
website for the mobile web first and
then make it look good on desktop and so
we're going to kind of show you some
basic ways of how I'll approach some web
development how I'll view the mobile
experience in an easy way
and so let's get into it here's kind of
my to-do list the first thing is I'm
going to build it in the browser it's
really nothing magical or mysterious
about it
let's say I have this web page which is
basically I copied it from start
bootstrap com it gives you kind of this
I tweaked it a little bit but it gives
you this basic shell of a bootstrap site
and so once again start bootstrap com
gives you a great way to start and I'm
just going to resize it down and see
what it looks like on the mobile
experience I'm going to be using live
reload I'm going to set that up upfront
not only for what I'm developing the
mobile experience but later on it's
going to be very useful when I'm viewing
it in devices you'll get to see that a
little later so I have some videos in
the description on how to use live
reload you'll want to get that going it
will help you out a lot it's not too
hard to hit refresh here but later on
when we're using multiple devices it's
going to be really helpful to have live
reload so I'm using localhost 8080 I'm
using live server in this example and so
you know now I can change instead of
rocking new website let's just hit save
rocking website let's say the site's
going to kill it this sites gonna really
kill it
alright cool that still fits in a mobile
view and that kind of gives me an idea
of what my website's going to look like
so that's phase one nothing super
amazing going on just
sighs your browser the next thing I'm
going to do is some device specific
emulating or profiling so what I'm going
to do in Chrome Chrome's my favorite for
this is I'm going to go developer tools
I'm going to click on this button right
here and what this button will do is
it'll allow me to select a model I can
select the iPhone 6 I can toggle from
portrait tours on ttle now whenever you
select a new device it's a really good
idea to reload your browser so the
viewport gets updated and see it looks
different after a refresh a lot of
people forget to refresh when they
change their device that's a very
important thing that you want to do and
then you can reload your dimensions see
what it looks like portrait and
landscape and another great feature is
the network throttling which allows me
to throttle my internet connection down
to 3G and see what people are going to
get on a 3G connection or god forbid the
the security plagued 2g network so many
security holes in the 2g network which
is why the CIA loves using 2g that's
another topic for another day so there
you go that's some device specific
profiling what's it going to look like
on an iPad and all that so that gives
you a little bit of a better idea once
again it's still pretty easy we're on
our machine we can do some really rapid
development the next phase I'm going to
start using an actual iOS simulator
which I'm sorry you can only do on Mac
if you're a PC user once you get into is
development it really helps to drop that
chunk of change to get a Mac so what
we're going to do for this is we're
going to go to the App Store and we're
going to get Xcode if you don't already
have it it is free but it usually
doesn't come on a Mac so that'll be an
install I get the chance to update which
I should do that will take forever to
install because it's gigabytes of the
application is huge once you've
installed Xcode then we're going to go
to applications and you're going to
right-click or control-click on Xcode
and do show package contents so we're
now in the Xcode package and we're going
to go content applications and there's
an iOS simulator and we're just going to
drag that out to our dock so now
whenever we want we can just run the iOS
simulator and then
actually going to boot up iOS on our
machine so there you go it's it's huge
I'm I'm not using my Retina display
right now but if I was this would not
look so huge because the iOS 6 has a
Retina display so if I go to iOS 5 you
can see it's a lot smaller they're a lot
more manageable and there we go and I
didn't want open passbook no go away ah
hardware home button and so there you go
I'm running an iOS I'm running a i phone
5 for this sake let's run the iPhone 4
did it do
there we go and now I can go to Safari
and I can go to localhost 8080 here and
I can view my website here an actual iOS
exactly as it will look I can also if I
hold the Alt key I can do two finger
gestures so are the Alta option key so I
can do two finger gestures there and if
I'm holding the Alt key and I hold the
shift key at any point you'll see they
lock in position for like a two finger
scroll kind of thing so you can start
that's kind of how you'll you'll view
your website in an iOS simulator it's
pretty quick it's still really nice to
keep it on your device and another great
thing is live reload will still work you
can see that's kind of annoying looking
so I can take a really back off of it
hit save and live reload works on the
iOS simulator which is great so in
mobile view maybe I don't want the word
really in there it creates an extra line
that I don't like okay so that's good
the simulator for most of the time
really gets the job done it's pretty
accurate as to what it'll look like but
if you want to actually look at it on
your device that's pretty simple that's
going to be the next step forward is I'm
going to look at this on some actual
devices so what I'll do is I will put
those devices on the same network that
I'm on I'll go to System Preferences and
I'll go to network here and then I will
go to advanced and I'm going to look at
my IP address which is right here
192.168.1.1 so that will be on my actual
physical device ipads
I you know iPhones Android devices
whatever I can grab I'm going to grab
them all one nine two and then I'm going
to go here I'll just use the simulator
for this part but this is going to work
on my iPhone that's on the network as
well when I two dot one six eight dot
one dot seven colon 8080 so instead of
localhost I'm going to my IP address and
there you go that's my actual website as
well and so I can I will have sometimes
five or six devices when I'm fine-tuning
things
I'll have the iPad up I'll have my
iPhone up I'll have the Android up all
on my desk and they're all up on the
website and so now when I go really
going to really kill it when I hit save
all those devices are going to live
reload right there live reload still
going to work and then they'll
automatically just refresh my web page
and I can see it and that's there's
their software and there's a bunch of
tools that kind of simulate all this
stuff for you they'll simulate your
Android and they'll simulate your iPhone
but honestly my favorite is is let's do
it in the browser maybe pull up an
emulator while we're developing this
thing let's go as fast as we can and
then when it's time to really check it
out on devices just get the actual
devices you know borrow a friend's
Android and and just actually fine-tune
it have one in the office if you're a
company have like your target you know
five devices say we our goal as a
company is we want this site to look
good on these five devices and these are
the ones we officially support and
that's kind of how we'll do that so
there's my thoughts on mobile web if you
have any just awesome tools that you
can't live without post them on here as
well I would love to see them and I know
a lot of people would love to see them
as well so hope you're having a great
day and that's my thoughts on mobile
development</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
