beginner coding videos that are really
going to help encourage new people to
get into coding whether you're in high
school college or if you're 35 you're
looking for a better career maybe a
better way to take care of your family
and also encouraging people in the
meantime you do code to level up learn a
new technology and enjoy the learning
curve and the pain of learning that new
technology to give you guys a little bit
of extra encouragement and incentive I
will be giving away a beautiful dot
keyboard ultimate for yes I reached out
to the awesome people adopt keyboard
because I have long since loved and
admired their beautiful mechanical
keyboards I said hey would you provide
one so I can give way to coders to
encourage them to code and they said
yeah that's a paraphrase this is
something like that and so anyway this
is a dot keyboard ultimate 4 as you
notice there's no key cap inscriptions
why would I give this one away well let
me tell you the story how Das Keyboard
came into being the owner and founder
actually created a blank keyboard for
himself because he wanted to type better
he got it within a few weeks that he was
typing double the speed so then all his
friends wanted one I mean dot keyboard
was born so if you're a web developer
you're in development and you don't
touch type meaning typed by sense of
feel and knowledge of where the keys are
you really should be touch typing I mean
this is your career this is what you do
or if you're learning this is what you
want to do you should learn how to touch
type it's not that hard to do and
honestly getting a keyboard like this
will get you there a lot faster and
honestly the ultimate four looks amazing
while you can get a dot keyboard with
all the letters on there I specifically
said give me the without the letters it
looks cooler and it will be more
beneficial to whoever wins this it's
also cheering MX switches which are
arguably the best switches you can have
so that way if you're in an office
setting its clicky but it's quiet it's
about it allows a normal keyboard listen
to that one of the reasons this keyboard
specifically the dock keyboard ultimate
is so quiet is this is aluminum not
plastic it's beautiful anodized aluminum
which actually makes it feel and sound
very
different from a keyboard encased in
cheap plastic housing it feels well
listened to it I mean that that's quiet
and it feels better that's one of the
things I love about DAF keyboard their
quality is really really good and
honestly for a cherry MX blue keyboard
or a Cherry MX you know blue or brown
this is brown you're not going to find a
better price point really this is 169
that's about as good as you get while
you might be able to find cheaper
guaranteed it's going to be cheaper
construction along with it so that's
pretty much it dot keyboard ultimate for
for one of you lucky winners how do I
enter you subscribe you thumbs up you
comment I will be randomly selecting
from the comments somebody who will win
this beautiful keyboard and if you don't
win I'm so sorry go ahead check out Das
Keyboard calm as well they have a great
lineup of keyboard super cool stuff
super cool stuff coming and have
yourselves an awesome day good luck
learn coding keep coding level up enjoy
your coding lives to me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
