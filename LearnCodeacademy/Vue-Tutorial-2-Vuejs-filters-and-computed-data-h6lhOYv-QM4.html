filters and computed data to work with
our data even more so here we've been
spitting out just plain information but
let's say name was actually set as first
last first is Bobby and then same here
for John there we go I think I changed
his last name but that's okay obviously
our application will break now we don't
have John dot name anymore so instead of
having to spit out John first space John
last and Bobby first space Bobby last we
could make a computed value here we can
make an object and any of these will be
computed values they will be treated
just like data even though they are
really a derivative of our data set so
let's say Bobby full-name we can return
this I'll use a template string for it
so we have that's a Bobby's full name so
now down here I can say Bobby full name
and then I can also create John full
name and obviously this is more work
than it would be to just create their
name down here but computed values are
very very useful in many other
situations so a John full name would be
John's first and last name and now I can
go John full name and I'm spitting out
computed values I could also say John
age in a year plus one
so in one year johnny is going to be 36
now computer values are great in a lot
of cases but in a lot of cases we can do
this in a reusable fashion using filters
so we can create a filters object here
and we can just call this one full name
and full name will get any value and it
will return values out first space you
don't last so now what I can do is I can
spit out the entire object John at a
pipe and say full name and there you see
we get the exact same results so now I
could also go Bobby full name and I can
use that full name filter that exact
same full name filter to return Bobby's
full name what's also great about this
is let's say later on we decide that we
want to return last comma first then
that can apply to everybody in our list
as well now boom John and Boone comma
Bobby we do the exact same thing for age
in one year
so we returned a gin one so in this case
we'll go age age in one year actually
John age
Bobby age age in one year and so now
this will bump up to that 36 and Bobby
just became 26 as well so that's how you
can use filters to create reusable
computed values and then computed values
can also be used to just make
computations that are one-off
computations against your data set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
