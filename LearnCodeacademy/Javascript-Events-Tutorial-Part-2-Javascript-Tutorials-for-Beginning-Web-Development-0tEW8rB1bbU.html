this simple to-do list editor which
we're going to build today I can change
it to Apple or I can change it to
watermelon there we go
and so that's basically my to-do list
editor and so that's what we're going to
build in this so if you remember from
the prior lesson you can actually do
selectors let me kind of show you what
this app is going to be let me show you
the HTML and kind of what I'm
envisioning here so basically I have a
ul with three allies in it those are
their three allies each Li has a span
and an input so the span is what I see
when I'm not in edit mode the input is
going to be one I want to see when I'm
in edit mode so kind of the way I'm
going to do this is I'm going to add a
class edit here and when class edit is
on let me save this a live reload when
class edit is on the span goes away the
input gets shown so all I have to do to
change edit mode is add that class
remove that class okay very simple seems
easy enough so how I did that with CSS
is my li input by default is a
display:none so this guy is always
hidden by default and then when you have
a class edit the span goes to
display:none and then class edit the
input gets display initial so now the
input is shown when edit is on span goes
away input gets hidden so three simple
CSS rules and I have the functionality
for that so now on JavaScript when I
click on an Li I want to add the Edit
class so now I'm at net edit mode I type
in my input and when I blur my input
whenever I leave or whenever I hit the
enter key
so that's be something I add to whenever
I leave or hit the enter key then I want
to update this with my value that I
changed and then I want to remove my
edit class so that's kind of my program
let's go ahead and write it you'll
actually see it's pretty simple so let's
go and first get our check list our
check list UL right here so that's ID
check list so we're going to go check
list equals documents gets element by ID
there we go so I've got the checklist
let's go and get all the items within
the checklist now so one cool thing is I
can actually search within my checklist
for all my items so I can go instead of
documents I don't want to search my
entire document
I just want to search within my
checklist for all the items so checklist
query selector all I can do query
selector all because it's going to be
very fast there's only a few items
within my checklist to begin with and so
I don't I'm not worried at all about
speed or performance with using query
selector also there I have all my items
right now so this is going to be an
array let me go a console.log it so this
is going to be an array of three lis
we've got that Li that Li in that Li so
we want to loop through this array and
then we want to add a listener to each
item in the array so if you remember
from a few lessons ago let's do a for
loop here so there I equals zero I items
dot length so we're going to start off
at zero as long as I is less than items
length we're going to keep increasing I
so now I can go items and once again
these for loops are weird you just got a
coda MinnKota min code them and write
them and write them and write them till
you just finally get it and remember and
have it memorized because it just it's
not very natural this is one of the
parts of programming that does feel like
actual code because it's not English so
it's okay if that seems annoying to you
for a while at first so now for each
item we're going to add an event
listener and let's do a click events and
then this right here if we do a function
here that's not a very good idea because
now it's going to every time we loop run
through this loop for each item it's
going to create a new function to do the
same thing so we don't want to do that
let's just go ahead and do edit item
let's just actually make a function
called edit item so we've only created
one function that's living in memory
down here and then it's going to run
that function on any one of these items
click events so this is better
programming right here than adding a
function in there you can do it it'll
probably work just fine
but this is better programming to
your function out and then add your
event listener to that function so
basically whenever we click we want to
edit this item so let's go at
console.log I'm going to console.log
this which might seem like a funny word
but basically since any one of our items
can trigger this function we need a way
of knowing which item was clicked and
that's the this this is whichever item
had the event listener attached to it so
if I were to click on this which is item
1 or item 0 then this will be item 0 let
me just show you in practice here so I'm
console logging this every time there's
a click there we go so I clicked on
apples and there you go
this is the LI containing apples so if I
were to click on this prior to click on
the second li then the value of this is
now the oranges Li if I were to click on
the third Li the value of this would be
the bananas Li so that's what this is
it's the context that this function is
running in so now I can actually edit
which ever one got clicked so I could go
if this stock class name does not equal
edit actually you know I'm just going to
say this class name equals edit I was
going to I was going to have it be edit
if it didn't equal my room it always
needs to be edit no matter what so even
if it was edit before we click on it now
it's going to be edit so there we go now
it's working sort of it never goes away
but it's working step one complete when
you click on it it goes into edit mode
so now we want to do is let's do a
little bit more I think let me go to
refresh this I also want to focus on
this input box which is really simple to
do this stop focus actually I want to
get the input inside of it so as you see
I've clicked on this Li and so that is
the value of this right here but I want
to get the input and I want to focus on
the input you know what I also want to
select all the text inside of it so
that's pretty simple really just go vert
input equals this dot query selector all
actually just query selector
so I'm going to get the input inside of
my Li and then I'm just going to go
input dot focus so there we go let's
refresh this when I click hey you know I
have that nice little focus bar around
my input box and then let's also get a
selection range set selection range so
we're going to start at zero and we're
just going to go input value dot length
so basically the whole length of
whatever our current value is we're
going to select from zero which is here
all the way to the full length of our
text because what the input dot value is
is that's our current value of our input
let me show you here I'm going to
console.log my current value is and then
input dot value so I'm going to when I
click there you go my current value is
Apple's my current value is oranges so
that's what that input value is an input
value dot length is how many letters I
current have currently have on there so
let me just change this to length so
there we go six characters and apples
right Appl es yep six oranges o RA and G
es yep so seven characters in that and
so that's what that length is so I'm
going to create a selection from zero to
the full length I know that's kind of
confusing I am it's probably too much
but whatever so there we have this nice
little when you click on it it's it
focuses on it you see my focus gets
whichever one I clicked on and then it
selects the full text range so that's
pretty nice behavior so now I can change
it let's change this to just apple and
then I can leave my value is changed but
I want to get out of edit mode so let's
go ahead and add a blur event listener
now but I don't actually want to add
that blur event listener to the whole li
I want to add the blur to the input so
let's go ahead and get let me copy this
let's get our inputs
so I'm going to query selector all input
so now this is the array of all the
inputs inside of my checklist so that's
that
so as I'm looping through here I'm going
to also add a listener to every input so
now I'm going to go I'm going to loop
through my checklist length 0 1 2 3 and
then I'm going to add a listener for
item 0 I'm going to listener for input 0
as well so this will be a blur on blur
not blue on blur I'm going to do an
update item function so now let's just
console.log and say we blurred make sure
we're working that far so I clicked
there we go we blurred and let me
actually console.log the value
this.value apples let's say more apples
we blurred more apples okay so that's
how I'm going to get the value out and
then very simply I just want to apply
this value I've got my value on blur I
want to apply it to the span I want to
set the innerhtml of the span which is
my previous element sibling which is the
code for that so I'm just going to go
this dot previous element sibling enter
HTML if you remember that from when I
did that earlier equals distal
dis so there we go now when I blur I
want to update that so apples I blurred
of course we didn't really realize that
we're able to do that because what I
also have to do is I have to go to my
parent node which is here and I have to
remove that edit class for it to go back
out of edit mode dot class name equals
nothing so there we go our program
should be working more apples got it I
edited my span
took it out adit mode and we're good to
go
so one more thing that let's do let's go
ahead and add an event listener for a
key press and let's go item key press so
if I hit that Enter key I want to do the
exact same behavior I want to update
that item the same way so let's do our
function key item key press so whatever
the key press event is fired we're going
to run item key press which is this guy
and so one thing that this guy gets is
he gets an event object every time it
fires let's go and console.log that
event objects so you can see it so I'm
going to go ahead and keep press I'm
going to hit an a key hey there we go
that's a keyboard event you can see
there's a whole bunch of information
about what actually happened to that
event and here's the important one for
us it's the witch event dot which it is
the 97 key which is the a key
well great that doesn't help me out at
all so you can see B is the 98 key let's
actually console vault log event dot
which you can kind of see what's going
on here ABCDE 97 98 99 100 let's see
what enter is enters 1313 so there's no
way on earth you're going to memorize
this I always have to Google JavaScript
key codes I will give you this link as
well in the description here's all your
key codes enter is 13 enters key 13 so
usually I do one of two things
I either look up a key codes list or I
do exactly what I did here I just
console.log event which and I figure out
which key I actually am looking for so
in this case I'm looking for the Enter
key I hit enter a few times okay that's
13 all right 13 is what I want to
respond to so if I know that feels like
true programming to actually look up a
key by number if event which equals 13
then we're actually going to we want to
run update item but we want to run it
with this being
the event that was clicked on the this
here so we basically want to run update
on it but we can't just run update item
because then it won't know what this is
we actually have to run update item with
this being the thing that got the key
press of 13 so we do that by simply
saying call update item call this so now
it's going to basically run update item
and it's going to set this to be
whatever I give it so I could give it
window or I could give it hi so now this
would equal the string hi which of
course would break because hi has no
parent node there's no such thing as hi
dot previous element sibling so that's
going to break but as long as I give it
this now my item which got the key press
which is my input is going to be the
this value when update item runs I hope
that makes sense it's kind of a trickier
concept we're basically passing the
value of this from my function on item
key press to my function on update item
it's called changing the context so
let's see this works apple hit enter
boom excellent let's change this to
banana excellent and then Apple again
enter excellent it works so there's the
program I'm going to go ahead and put
this up probably on code pen for you
guys to play around with hope it helped
you out if it's too confusing and it's
over your head just play around with
looking up a get element by ID and
adding an event listener to it have some
fun with that then maybe mess with
looping through arrays of things kind of
more these concepts that I'm doing here
and then calling something bypassing
context that's a little of a trickier
thing as well so if that's over your
head that's totally understandable have
a great day and hope you enjoyed the
lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
