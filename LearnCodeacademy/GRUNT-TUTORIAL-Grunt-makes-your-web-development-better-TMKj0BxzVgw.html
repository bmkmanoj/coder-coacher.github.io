grunt if you don't know what a build
system is or missed my spiel on what a
build system is I'm going to put a link
to that in the description and hopefully
you've already watched the video on the
basic introduction to node J s because
that will be a requirement for this if
you don't know node so that's also down
there and let's go ahead and get started
we're going to use grunt today to
concatenate our javascript files and
we're also going to concatenate our CSS
files and they're going to watch so it's
going to do these whenever we save
that's going to be our first step that
we do and so let's go ahead and get
started the first thing we're going to
do is run npm install
- g for global grunt CLI so grunt
command-line interface is what CLI is
for so now everyone on the computer will
have access to the grunt command and
then we don't have a package.json
started yet so I'm going to run NPM and
Nitz that's going to create a
package.json for me I'm just going to
say ok ok ok ok ok ok and there we go
there's my package.json now I can't have
this called grunt because I actually
have to install the package called grunt
you let me show you what happens if I go
npm install - s to save grunt into my
package grunt it's going to say refusing
to install grunt as a dependency of
itself so I'll call this grunt project
save it and now I can run npm install s
grunt there we go
grunt is now installed I have node
modules and grunt is there excellent so
the only other thing I need to do is I
need to create a grunt file J s with a
capital G I believe it has to have a
capital G I believe so so when you run
grunt it's going to low it's going to
load the grunt file and that's pretty
much all that happens so what we do if
you remember from nodejs we're going to
do a module dot X ports equals function
and function gets grunt and that's it
for you and so now for our first action
member grunt is a task runner so let's
create some tasks to run dot register
tasks
and let's give it a name let me go
fullscreen here let's register tasks
called speak maybe and give it a
function to run when you run the task
speak
we'll just console.log I'm speaking
there we go so now if I run grunt speak
it's gonna say hey I'm speaking woohoo
let's create another command register
task yell I'm yelling so now if I run
grunt speak it speaks and grunt yell I'm
yelling there you go congratulations
you've made your first two tasks now we
all have to all we have to do is make
these tasks smarter one other thing that
you can do is you can go grunt register
tasks both and then I can give it an
array let me go fullscreen again so you
can see it and this will require run
speak and yell so that it's going to run
speak and yell so the both tasks will do
both let's verify that that works grunt
both I'm speaking I'm yelling and also
if you call this defaults whatever task
you call default will run when you just
run grunt so there we go grunt so that's
how you Rudd register tasks you do grunt
dot register task whatever's in the
function gets fired when the task gets
called so that's pretty basic nothing
super smart going on now we have to do
is let's load some common tasks that
we're going to use all the time and so
to do this I'm going to go to the grunt
website and look at the plugins what's
awesome about grunt is not so much that
grunt runs tasks but that it's got a
billion awesome awesome plugins to plug
into it so grunt contribute is going to
be the first one we look at we're going
to concatenate files together and one
thing with grunt you get good at is you
get good at looking at I'm actually
going to look at this on github might be
a little more familiar to you guys you
get good at looking at readme files and
figuring out what to do so I'm just
going to scroll down I know where to go
here there's a grunt and NIT config so
here's kind of how these tasks work one
you're going to install them there you
go
save Deb so let's go ahead and run this
command to install it npm install
installing grunt contribute asks grunt
contributes let's get rid of these guys
now we're loading a task from our npm
module and so if that's going to do is
that's going to look for pre
configuration on what our concatenations
are going to be and so grunt is always
going to load its configurations for
your different tasks in the same place
and that is called the grunt init config
it'll all make sense here in just a
second here some copy and pasting this
so this grunt init config object right
here holds all of our configuration for
all of our tasks and all these grunt
predefined tasks are going to look in
that config to know what to do so let's
get rid of this options here we don't
need a separator so basically grunt
contribute cat is going to look at the
King cat part of the object and that's
going to know that the configuration
forking cat is in there and so we're
going to call this action of concat dist
you can call it whatever you want you
can call it happy I will call it disks
for distribution and let's go Jas what
does I call these one and to json' Jas
js2 Jas and we're going to do build
usually things will be called build for
a built for a built project or dist for
a distribution so build I think is a
little bit more popular and we'll just
call it JSP or we'll just call it
scripts jeaious it's not dot min because
it's not been minified yet so there we
go so now since I did load NPM tasks I
can run grunt can cat because that's
what the NPM tasks for grunt can cat is
so I can now run grunt can cats there
you go and file build script J s what
that should be called scripts J s so
there we go there's a build folder that
appeared now and there's a script that's
got both of my files in it and that's
pretty much it that was really really
easy so let's go ahead tweak some things
let's go build J s slash scripts going
to delete that folder go away and then
let's make one we'll call this J s and
let's make this one CSS and so now
you'll go CSS what are these two called
main and theme let's go full screen
again CSS theme dot CSS and you would go
build CSS Styles CSS there we go so once
again my grunt can cat command comes
from this it's loading it from the npm
module and so concat is going to look at
this and it's automatically going to run
everything in here when i run grunt can
cat let's run it again we created
scripts j s and we created styles J's so
now my build folder is looking a little
bit different
we've got styles that has all my Styles
awesome I was now able to break these up
and I've got J s which is my script so
these are the two that I'm actually
going to deploy so now let's go the next
level with this and let's watch my
filesystem for changes I don't want to
have to run grunt concat every time I
want to just be able to save this file
boom and have it automatically do some
changes so for that plug-in we are going
to go back a few and that's just called
grunt contributing
you go grunt contribute contribute errs
to grunt and so those are always trusted
plugins those are always going to be
good ones we're going to run this
command here like I said with grunt you
get really good at reading readme files
and then we're going to load NPM tasks
right
your watch it's my grunt file there we
go and then here's our watch example and
so with watch it's going to watch for
file system changes and when that
happens you get to run tasks so let's go
let's keep it JIT we'll call it J s and
this will be called J s star star which
means any folder star which means any
file ending in J s so any file ending in
dot J s that's in the J s directory
that's not really fully necessary but I
want a little bit more control because
I'm a controlling person whenever that
happens we're going to run can cats and
then we're also going to remove options
spawn and so there we go that's our J s
and then we'll also do a CSS CSS and
that will also run can cat cats really
fast so I can run that every time so now
you'll notice something different when I
run grunt watch it runs and it just
stays there forever because it's
actually sitting actively waiting for me
to make some changes let me hit save
here okay
okay and that didn't work because I must
have something wrong in my J's file here
so let's see oh I have two things called
J s and there's my problem
this one was overriding this one happens
all the time
so I'm going to hit ctrl C to cancel out
of that
let's run grunt watch again and hit save
there we go
file J s won't dot one dot J s was
changed and so it redid them both and
now let's try saving a CSS file awesome
same thing so if I change this
background a pink then my build CSS now
has that as a background of pink awesome
terrible idea but it's awesome and you
can also go like this I can just run
concat J s on that
to cancel that and start that up again
so now when I run J s it's only going to
run the can catch a s thing you'll
notice it did not create a style.css
again it just can created the JavaScript
because it only ran this portion and so
that's kind of why you'll give them a
name so you can actually refer to
portions of a task by name this will be
can categorize
so rank on cats and this will run watch
but you go let me zoom out so you can
see that so I added a default task as
well there and so once that's saved I
can now cancel out of that and I can
just run grunt and that will start off
doing the build right away which is good
because we'll want to build it before we
run our server the first time and now
it's running watch as well so our build
folder exists and we are now watching
these four changes so if I get rid of
the both of those okay's it changes my
scripts J s and it'll also build out my
CSS let's go back to red because pink is
a terrible idea so there you go that's
your introduction to grunt hope you
liked it and we'll get into the next
part of our build in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
