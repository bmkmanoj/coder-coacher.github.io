informational video that I've ever done
as a response to getting a lot of
questions probably 50 people have asked
me just in the last 30 days this
question and the question is how do I go
to get a job in the web development
industry I'm on the learning process how
do I know when it's time to look what
does that process look like who's going
to hire me how just tell me about that
world and so this video is going to kind
of dive into that world for those of you
guys who are on the learning curve or
look into now or eventually jump into
the web development industry in a career
on that which by the way great industry
great career I cannot say enough good
things about it so let's get into it
there's been several times along over
the years where I've had to interview
people for the company that I'm looking
for I was either a key role in hiring
that next person or I was just among the
interviewers and so I'll kind of talk
from the employer perspective so you can
kind of see where the employers are
going for because if you're a good fit
for the employer then you're ready to
get a job so as an employer I'm looking
for a resume because that's what I'm
going to get and I'm looking for
indicators on this resume and as the and
with the person when I sit down and meet
with them the first thing I'm going to
be asking is is this person on the
playing field that I'm on they don't
have to know everything I know they
don't have to be able to do what the
good people on the team can do but
they've got to at least be able to be on
the playing field so the indicators of
that are one what technologies do you
use everyone uses HTML CSS so that's
kind of a prerequisite to getting into
web development you've got to know the
languages the web is built on so you
know HTML CSS how can you show me that
you have a modern usable skill set take
a day and learn how to use sass and how
to compile sass or less for CSS these
are going to happen really fast and easy
but when I see that on there I know
you're not just some HTML CSS code or a
sass and less and stylist okay this is
good this means that you learn you know
new stuff another very common thing
you're going to see HTML CSS jQuery tons
of jobs that say those three things
as pretty much what they're looking for
contrary to popular belief there are
lots of employers looking for people who
can do basic HTML CSS and jQuery because
they have a lot of high-end depths to do
all the complicated stuff but they need
people to push through the content they
need to be able to say here's a
Photoshop PSD file I need you to be able
to you know slice an image out of it and
then do the rest in HTML CSS so
Photoshop slicing HTML CSS and know some
basic jQuery
to do a little bit of custom
functionality on your page I'll get back
to jQuery in a second on what that means
and how good a jQuery you need to be
another key indicator if I see github on
there ok good this person takes coding
seriously designers don't really care
about github coders live on github so
create your own github repository do
some pull requests get comfortable with
it if you know how to put a repo on
github how to make branches and do pull
requests there's some videos I have on
that I'll put them in the description
you're good to go with that another
thing is is create your github account
and put your own work on github so they
can actually see that you use github
repositories for your own work ok
another big plus they actively use
github day in and day out huge indicator
some indicators that don't have to do
with skill is but are still key
indicators is what text editor do you
use do you use sublime text because that
goes a long way because every serious
coder I know right now
I'd say at least 80% of them use sublime
text that doesn't mean that the coders
that don't use it or bad coders it's
just bad coders or should I say newbies
oftentimes don't use professional level
tools yet if you can show you use
professional level tools that's going to
get you off the mindset of oh he's a
nubian doesn't know what he's doing
other things what operating system do
you use Windows is fine you can totally
do web development on Windows and do a
great job at it but most web developers
are going to use Mac OS or they're going
to use Linux
so you have a Windows machine consider
installing for free it's free and you
can install it alongside of Windows boot
to Linux so you can boot up to either
one if you see Linux on a if I see Linux
on a resume okay I'm not going to think
new be here because development newbies
just don't use Linux they usually have
their Windows computer maybe a Mac
computer which is cool but if I see
Linux on there I'm gonna be like ok this
is this is a person that takes what they
do seriously and they really want to
learn professional ways of doing things
and sublime text and all that they'll
run on Linux
anyway the terminal it's all the same
Linux and Mac OS are very very similar
in the way you would develop on them so
that's kind of some key indicators I'm
looking for resume wise let me go back
to jQuery how do you know when you know
enough jQuery because jQuery you can
learn you're going to be learning it for
like five years
the first thing I'd want to learn is Dom
traversal you're good with selectors you
can if I give you an unordered list with
five lis in it can you find Li number
three and then can you do something to
all the Allies that are siblings of Li
number three if you someone clicks on Li
number three can you find the panel that
that is a part of you know can you
navigate the Dom decently well in jQuery
I'm actually building a full jQuery
course on that with about twelve lessons
that will cover all these issues and if
you know the stuff in the course you
should be good with jQuery that'll be in
the description if I have that at the
time you're watching this video but if
you're watching this video the day came
out I don't have that quite yet but it's
coming you're going to want to know how
to do jQuery user events so when the
user clicks on this mouse is over this
you can fire off smart JavaScript things
you're going to want to know jQuery AJAX
somewhat you're going to need to know
how to do get requests with jQuery AJAX
get say a list of tweets and put them
into your website you know through Ajax
so you'll need to know jQuery AJAX
that's probably going to be the last
part of your learning experience with
jQuery and then you need to know how to
use jQuery
plugins you need to know how to grab woo
slyer flex slider and put it on your
page and make a slider out of it which
is really easy the first time might be
daunting but there's instructions for
all these plugins on all their sites and
that's what makes jQuery great is
there's plug-ins for all this stuff you
need to be able to grab a panel plug-in
and be able to make a tab panel by
configuring that plug-in and so if you
can do that you're pretty much good with
jQuery you don't have to know how to
build your own plugins that's a plus if
you've built your own plug-in but you
definitely don't know how to do that and
that's pretty much if you know HTML CSS
and you're solid with jQuery you'll have
competition and getting that first job
might be difficult but that's the base
skill set you need to get into the
industry what also have you done is is
the next huge thing I'm going to look
for if you don't have job experience you
can create your own job experience by
building sites for other people one
thing I did when I was starting out I
was 18 at the time so I've been doing
this a long time but I did free sites
for nonprofits that I supported like
foster or adoption agencies or my church
which most likely they have a site
that's 10 years old and terrible anyway
so anything you can do just converting
it to bootstrap will be a massive
improvement and they will love the love
love love love you for that and then you
can actually on your resume say
volunteer lead developer for or lead
developer for and they can say as a
volunteer capacity you kind of hide it
in there somewhere
and so by the time it's time to look for
a job you've got history you can put on
your resume that you have job history
that you're not a newbie in this you've
done it and I can even show you my
github repositories for these sites so
you can see that I actually coded them
myself
the last thing would be possibly learn
learn WordPress learn how to make
WordPress sites you don't have to do
this but a lot of agencies and smaller
design shops crank out WordPress sites
day in and day out and if you know how
to crank out a fast word
site by a template off a theme forest
calm pop it into your WordPress you know
pop it into WordPress and in hack it
there are a lot of people looking for
people with that skill set it might be a
good first step into the industry so
that's pretty much the whole skill set
if you if you say yes to all those
questions hands down you can get a
decent job in the industry hands down
it'll be paying a decent salary and as
you grow in those you can get a really
good salary and web dev right now it may
change in the next 20 years but for
right now if you're good it's going to
be a good job and so how do you actually
go about finding the employer will be
the last thing I mentioned in this video
how do you actually find those employers
the first tip for sure is put your
resume online this is a recruiter driven
industry so there are thousands of
people out there whose full-time job is
to find people like you even if you're
new and place you in a job their job is
to find you and then find a job for you
and so get your resume online some of
the ways you do that is you apply for
jobs on monster and if they still do
this you can check that you want to make
your resume available you can probably
also post your resume on monster big big
big big point though do not put your
cell phone number on your resume if
you're posting it online because that
cell phone will ring from recruiters for
the next 10 years after you found the
great job you will still get phone calls
that there's an excellent job for you
leave your phone number off it's a good
idea to actually create a professional
email account that this is this is your
public web developer email account
because you will get daily emails for
the rest of your life as a web developer
you don't get a ton but you just you
know you just want to be aware of that
it's it's the great thing about this
industry but there's minor drawbacks you
want to stay off the radar in some ways
um and so lots of job postings
indeed.com
has job postings monster career builder
you can look Craigslist generally people
using Craigslist or knocking
recruiters which means they're not going
to be looking to pay top dollar for
someone in the field so odds of you
finding a great job on Craigslist are a
lot less if you're starting off and
you're just looking for part-time work
work on the side to build your portfolio
Craigslist will be a great place to find
that kind of work and so that's kind of
it but generally speaking I would look
for companies that are using recruiters
because those are going to be more
serious companies those are going to be
the companies that don't have the time
of day to go looking for 5,000 people
they're like look I'm just going to pay
the recruiter $10,000 to find me a great
candidate because I'm going to spend way
more than $10,000 finding those
candidates myself these are good
indicators that you're looking for a
good company here so that pretty much
wraps up my intro thoughts if you had
asked me up to coffee and said hey tell
me what you think about this industry
that would be pretty much what I'd give
you so hopefully that's helpful feel
free to comment if you have any
questions and I'll definitely do my best
to answer any questions you guys have
and hope this was a help to you guys
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
