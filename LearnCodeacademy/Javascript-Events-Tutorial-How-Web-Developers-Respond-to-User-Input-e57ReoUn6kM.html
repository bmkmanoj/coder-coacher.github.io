JavaScript events today and JavaScript
events in my opinion are really where
JavaScript starts getting fun because
you get to interact with the user as
they interact with page so what an event
is is that's anything that the user does
to interact with a webpage so if I were
to click here that's a click event if I
were to mouse over here that's a mouse
enter and a mouse leave event when I
leave so we can listen to these events
that's called listening to these events
and we can react and interact with the
user so let's kind of get into what
these events are I'm going to show you I
basically have this add numbers here
that's basically a paragraph with an
input called num1 and an input with the
idea of num ID of num2 and then we have
a paragraph with the idea of add some so
it's probably clear what we're going to
be building here is whenever they change
add one and add two we want to create
the sum yay sounds easy enough
so let's go ahead and build this out if
you remember from our prior lesson we do
selectors to actually grab an element so
let's actually get num1 here num 1
equals documents dot get element by ID
and this is num - 1 there we go and
let's get num2 as well up num2 there we
go now let's go ahead get some while
we're at it
add some is add some believe that's add
- some let's make check yep add - some
okay so we've gotten our elements here
and to add a listener it's very simple
you just take your elements and do add
event listener and then your first
argument is the name of the event so
let's do a click events and then this
function will fire or execute every time
that event takes place so let's just
console.log hi there we go
I have live reload going so this just
refreshed so now when I click it
console.log hi there you go you can see
it going let's really let's actually
make it alert hi here
hi hi okay let's do some other events
here let's do a mouse enter so now
whenever I enter it oh hi hi okay how
about a mouse leave so I'm in and I left
and then I get the height some other
events are focus and that's going to be
whenever I whip focus on it there we go
that's a focus event and now I can't get
away and then a blur event but not blue
blur event is going to be whenever I
leave that elements let's see if I can
get out of here okay some of those
events are actually tricky to get out of
when you're doing alerts so there's a
focus and let's blur blur hi there we go
so here's kind of a list of events see I
got click mouse enter mouse leave mouse
down as when your mouse clicks down
Mouse up is when you let it back up a
click is when the browser actually
registers that you clicked because you
know if you hold it down real long and
then you let go that's not going to
register as a click so click is only
when it's fast enough to be a click
mouse up mouse move is when you're
actually moving over it it will actually
send your coordinates your mouse back
keydown keyup those are actually your
keyboard events blur in focus we already
covered them here's your full list of
events which I'll include in the
description as you can see there are a
lot of them the ones you'll probably
want to focus on are the mouse events
some of these are called Mouse events
and then some of them are called
keyboard events and those are the ones
you tend to use the most where this
keyboard there you go keyboard events
these are the ones you're going to use
the most I'll put that in the
description again now let's actually get
into building this little addition
program so what we want to do is we
actually want to just add an input event
which is whenever anything changes in
the value of our input this work all the
way back to I think Internet Explorer 9
so on the input events we want to do
some addition now it's generally not the
best practice here to create a function
it's usually a better practice to insert
a function that's been created here like
add and then this is just going to do
ads so whenever the input event file
so we're going to run the ad function
which is created right there that's good
for several reasons which I can get into
more later on one of the reasons is now
I can fire that whenever either of these
run so whenever the num1 has an input
event
I can run ad and when num2 has an input
event
I can run ad so that's one reason alone
that it's great to pull it out so that
way you can share this function between
multiple elements that's kind of a good
practice so we're going to do here is
we're going to actually get our two
values ver 1 equals num1 dot value
that's going to be the actual value 2
equals num2 dot value
let's console.log both of these one to a
b c d e f so there we go we have our two
values excellent
and then let's actually add some we want
to change the entertainer HTML add some
enter HTML equals one actually we'll
just say yeah one plus two so let's go
check it out we got 12 and we have 24
and we got one two two four because
anything that comes in from an input is
a string type it's not a number type so
how you convert that from a string type
to a numbers just go parse floats so
that's going to parse it into a floating
number floating integer floating number
I forget exactly that's supposed to be
called so let's do 12 and 35 okay 34
okay so that works but if you notice
when this is empty it says nod which
means not a number that's because we
just tried to parse undefined as a
number so we can do here is we can do an
or 0 these little double bars mean or
which means if this value is basically
no undefined non which is not a number
then it's going to say okay that doesn't
exist let's use the or value instead so
I could say null or zero and I could do
no
or zero and basically one would equate
to zero and two it equate to zero so
really how this pans out to be is if
this doesn't create a number we're going
to use zero instead this doesn't create
a number we're going to use zero instead
so there we go let's try this now
thirty-four excellent it did 34 plus
zero and then plus one for 35 all right
there you go we did our little number
addition and let's do a little maybe
your sum is and of course this will
actually do something tricky as well
three four plus two four
why did that do that well because as
soon as we start adding a string to
numbers then it can't do that so it adds
a number plus a number so kind of the
way you get around this is go sum equals
one plus two ah two numbers together I
can do that javascript says and now we
can add some in there so that'll work
34 plus two excellent in another way
that you could do that is you could just
go parenthesis like that one plus two
and so that will do whatever's inside of
the parenthesis first so that's a number
plus a number that'll work and then it
will add that number plus the string in
which case it will turn them all into
one big string so I'll just leave like
that it's a little bit cleaner
if you ask me excellent so there's our
addition our addition is working
thanks to click events so let's go ahead
and do maybe one more example here I'm
going to turn off this HTML and turn on
this HTML so what I have here is I have
a list of allies and I have a list of
images now the images have a class of
hide which means they're hidden up here
my class hide in the CSS is display:none
so I basically want to be able to click
on this a tag and then I want that to
show an image actually show it and hide
it let me go and say this you kind of
see what we have here so you have Simon
Cowell Bruce Willis and Ben Carson three
great guys of course and then up
basically I want to click on one of
those and so I've added an 8
raph of pound pound we'll just by
default just reload your same page it
doesn't really matter what we put in HRF
because we're going to be returning
false which means we're going to cancel
this out it's never going to go anywhere
so if that was google.com it's not going
to go to google.com we're actually going
to cancel that out but it's good to put
something in there so by default if you
have a link that you're going to be
canceling with JavaScript just put pound
in there so we have ID of Simon ID of
Bruce idea of Ben and then our images we
want a toggle or Simon pick Bruce pick
and Ben pick okay let's go and build
this out let's get rid of this
JavaScript I will put that in the
description on maybe code pen or
something for you for a little bit later
but for now we'll get rid of that let's
go and grab that Simon elements better
Simon equals document dot get element by
ID and then this is just Simon there we
go and let's get Simon pick Simon - pick
I believe yet there we go so when Simon
is going to get an eventlistener
click function so whenever Simon gets
clicked we're going to run this function
if Simon pick class name so if it has
the hide class then we're going to
remove it class name equals there we go
so basically if it has a class name hide
we're going to remove it so let's go and
click hey there is and then else we're
going to put it back on so we go now
it's going to toggle there is area isn't
okay excellent so now let's do the same
thing for Bruce Willis and Ben Carson
and then we'll make this app a little
bit cleaner so let's get everything that
says Simon and change it to Bruce I'm
using sublime text multiple cursors here
sublime text
and a lot of text debtors have this
control D or Apple D or command D I
guess that's going to automatically
select all the same steps so I can
change it which is awesome what and we
got Ben Carson
so Simon did that let's do Bruce
let's find everything in here that's
called Simon Bruce it just makes it so
much faster to do this stuff and then
Ben here we go we should have all three
Simon
Bruce Ben let's see what happens if I
click a couple of them and now they're
both showing that's something we can
deal with a little later okay so all
three of them are in here but I don't
like this for a lot of reasons one this
is a lot of almost identical code
there's this thing that coders talk
about all the cop all the things all the
time called dry dry code don't repeat
yourself
I almost said do not don't repeat
yourself d ry dry code this is not dry
code because there's all this repeating
this is basically exactly the same thing
as this which is basically the exact
same thing as this that's a really bad
idea so we actually want to find a way
that we can share all this so let's go
ahead and create a new function here I'm
just going to go ahead and mute you guys
out and let's actually do a new function
so that add event listener I'm just
going to actually copy you let's get at
one function that everybody can share
that everybody can use we'll call it
pick link there we go so now Simon can
listen to that and Bruce can listen to
that and Ben can listen to this
excellent so now pick link can kind of
do all of this at once I'm going to go
ahead and scroll down eyes area get you
guys some space up there pick link and
then what we're going to do here is
we're actually going to get it one thing
that's interesting about an event
listener let me go ahead and just
console.log this for you basically when
we start sharing stuff we don't know who
got clicked on so we don't know if we
clicked on
I'm in Bruce or Ben when we fire this
function so we have to look that up
based off of this this will be the
element that got clicked so this will be
Simon if you clicked on Simon the value
of this will be Bruce if you clicked on
Bruce well here I'll just console.log it
so you can see there we go so this is my
a for Simon if I click on Bruce then I'm
console logging this then that's going
to be Bruce Willis base can be ben
Carson so what I've done here is you'll
notice I've added this data - IMG
attribute so you're free to use with
HTML 4 or 5 data - anything you want so
I just called it IMG because this is
going to be the ID of the image that I
want to toggle when I click on Simon
you'll notice that this has the idea of
Simon pick and so basically when I click
on this link I want to toggle Simon
click so I added data image of Simon
click data image of Bruce pick sorry
Simon pick data image of Ben pick so I'm
actually going to snatch that out so
here's kind of how that'll work I'll go
ver pick instead of before I was
automatically looking at Simon pick
Bruce pick or Ben pick well now I don't
know which pick it is so it's just going
to be very picky equals document dot get
element by ID and I actually want to
snatch the attribute out there out of
there so ver pick ID equals this dot
attributes so this again is my a link
that got clicked on and I want to look
at my attributes list and I want to grab
data - IMG so I can't go day 2 - IMG
that's bad syntax that's going to its
data - IMG so there's another way that
you can access attributes is I can do
this and so that's going to be the data
IMG so I can also do this attributes
basically you can use it to access any
value you want so I don't need to do
that for attribute so I can do the
cleaner version which is this way this
data attributes dot data IMG is
basically what I'm doing dot value
so I'm going to get the value out of the
data IMG attribute and so pic ID let's
go to console log pic ID make sure I got
this runner right there you go
Simon pic is the idea I'm getting Bruce
will pick and Bend pic awesome so now I
just have to do pic ID so I'm getting my
element this is the pic that I want to
show and now I just have to kind of copy
and paste this code here let's copy and
paste this get rid of my comments and we
toggle it over a little bit so now I'm
just doing pick if picked out class name
as hi get rid of it excellent
this should totally work let's see
Simon's working Bruce is working Ben is
working so now what we did is it took a
little bit of figuring out a little bit
of reworking but look how much shorter
my code is now so I've added three
listeners I don't need you I don't need
you and I don't need you excellent
that's a very simple code and this is
good for several reasons one I'm only
creating one function so I'm using a
little less memory than if I created
three different functions and now any
future functionality I want to add into
my program it's all I have to do is
change this one function and all three
of them will get the results so remember
that problem I had earlier where if I
click on several I see them all well
what I want to do is I actually want to
hide every image I want actually hide
every image that's in existence on the
page first and then I want to show
everything so I'm going to go document
dot query selector all image there we go
and then I would basically loop through
that I could go very image all images
and then I could loop through all images
and I could tell each image to have a
class of hide and then I could run
through the rest of the code and show
the one that I want to show I might as
well do it for you right since I just
told you about it let's do a for loop
véra equals zero remember that for loop
and how annoying they are you just got
to keep doing it to you remember how to
it I is less than all images dot length
I plus plus man it takes a while to
remember that for loop basically I'm
just going to go through I as many times
as it takes all images I so I want to
get the image that I'm looking for
let's see dot class name equals hide so
I'm going to add hide class name to
every image on the page and then I'm
going to go through with the rest of my
program let's see if this works
oh it works excellent excellent that is
exactly what I wanted it to do am i only
showing one
yep I'm only showing one awesome there
you go that's JavaScript event listeners
mixed in with some for loops and some
selectors that's kind of tying some
stuff together for you if it got a
little complicated with this example
don't worry just mess around with your
math example for a while I'm going to
post both of these on code pen and I'm
going to put that link in the
