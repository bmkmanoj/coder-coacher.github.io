video some stuff I've wanted to talk
about for a long time got a cool product
here in my hands the level by fluid
stance a lot of you guys have seen this
and wondered if it's any good yes it is
I'll talk about that in a second
basically if any you guys have been
following my Twitter I don't really talk
about my Twitter but it's at learn kodak
add AC ad so if any for those of you
guys that have followed it i've been
talking about my stand-up desk situation
a lot recently and how much i love it
and yes I've been doing full time web
development 40 hours a week since I was
18 and sitting is a major problem is a
major health problem got some quotes
here from other people not just me Tim
Cook CEO I think from Apple
he calls sitting the new cancer and then
I think Huffington Post said sitting is
the smoking of our generation there's
some infographics if you check out
Pinterest that show how much higher the
percentage of death is for people who
sit 40 hours a week I mean it's just
it's bad sitting 40 hours a week is bad
and back in the day you didn't really
have a choice this is what companies did
even web companies you had to wear your
nice shirt and you had to sit 40 hours a
week at a desk and that's just what we
did but research and health conscious
companies are coming out and they're
just giving us a lot more options a lot
of web companies especially if you
request a stand up desk or a stand up
sit down desk they'll probably provide
it for you or if you request a thing to
help you with your development
experience they'll probably provide it
for you
so basically my experience about six
months ago I started doing a stand-up
desk and I am absolutely positively
never ever ever ever going back I don't
stand full eight hours a day I tend to
stand about six hours a day but it's
just you feel so much better throughout
the day you have so much more energy
throughout the day and a lot of issues
like back issues even even if you have a
great ergonomic chair I used to work at
webmd.com and they gave us really good
those really expensive
ergonomic chairs and you don't deal with
near as much
with your back but you still deal with
all the other health issues that are
associated with sitting for a long time
so back issues kind of go away right
away your core gets stronger standing up
you notice that which has the developer
noticing your core at all its kind of
revolutionary and then neck issues kind
of went away I started kind of having
some neck issues I had a little forward
head posture you know where your neck
kind of does that thing from trying to
fix code issues that went away really
quick you know I got my monitor up
higher than desk level and I went away
real fast so basically physically you
just feel a lot better standing and then
the only thing you notice is is you
can't stand very long because you find
yourself doing a hard stand where you'll
you'll put you're trying to solve a
problem you're focused you find yourself
putting all the pressure on one hip or
the other hip or just one knee or one
ankle for a long period of time your
your feet can't handle the the pressure
of standing for a long period of time
again especially because you're focused
and that's really where this product
makes a massive difference this is the
fluid stamps level or the level by fluid
stance and it's a stand-up desk balance
board and it's not a balance board like
you'd find at the GM where it's made for
drastically increasing your balance and
strengthening your legs it's a much more
gentle if you can look at the slope of
that it's a much more gentle balance
whatever gentle slope and so it's very
natural very easy to stand on my wife
jumped on it and could stand on it right
away she doesn't do skateboarding or any
extreme sports like that and she could
easily just stand on it and enjoy it
standing on it my toddlers love this
thing and I love it I mean it just
really it's fun to go to my desk in the
morning with this thing here cuz it's
just fun and I'll show you kind of what
it does in a minute but the best thing
about it is you don't do those hard
stands there's more of a motion
throughout the day you can change to I
don't know 30 40 different positions you
can kind of roll your feet back sideways
you don't really stretch your calf out
for part of the day and you can roll
your feet forward and just get a whole
bunch of a lot of range
motion you don't do those hard stands
and your feet don't really get very sore
I could probably stand on this thing a
full eight hours in the day and my feet
wouldn't be sore by the end of the day
or at least not anywhere as close as
they'd feel if I was standing on the
ground I couldn't stand eight hours
straight on the ground without something
like this to put it plainly and it's not
best-in-class it's pretty much only in
class there's kind of a cheap knockoff
plastic kind of thing that you can find
on Amazon but it's not even a similar
kind of product it only goes back and
forth and it's just not even in the same
class so this is every bit worth the
price they tend to range from about
around $200 to around $400 depending on
what you want this deck made out of but
I can say I would much rather have a
cheaper sit-stand desk with one of these
guys than a really nice like $2,000
sit-stand desk now as far as the desk
component itself you can either I think
the best way to go is a sit stand
adjustable desk IKEA makes a $400 one
that's electric that you can change
throughout your day so if you're in or
near a big city that has an Ikea
that's your cheapest way to go if your
company's buying you one and budgets not
as much of a concern you can go to the
Sleep Number store they have several
options of really good sitting standing
desks that are more around the 1 to 2
thousand dollar range and that's it I
mean I really just I kind of had to do a
video on it and I was able to really get
my hands on this
I've used this non-stop since I got my
hands on this thing it is it is awesome
and I'm not getting paid to tell you
this I think it's very important I say
this because some people would think
that I'm getting paid to tell you this
I'm not so it's it's just basically a
great product that I think people should
know about and request from their work
to get them one so let's kind of show
you how this thing works all right so
here you go here it is I've got it on a
piece of wood right here because I do
think it's best experienced on what it
totally works on carpet and rugs but you
just stand on it and as you can see it's
not that big of a balance issue and if
you ever start swaying to one direction
it takes no effort
get it back especially if you have a
desk that gives you any kind of pressure
at all I'm not touching a desk right now
and it's a lot of fun just twisting it
back and forth all the little different
ranges of motion you get like I said you
can stretch out your calves kind of get
that work on there then lean forward you
can even do like a walking motion while
you're sitting there working of course
you ever get bored just give yourself a
little spin see if I can grab the wall
here so the spin is of course kind of a
professional level move I'm not gonna
lie I'm really kind of a professional at
this but yeah this thing is great and
again I'm not touching a desk right now
touching a desk it's even easier even
more comfortable even more natural let
me kind of show you how it works on a
rug this is a very thick rug still works
just fine no issues whatsoever in some
ways it's actually a little easier in
that you don't spin if you don't want to
move back and forth as you go then this
is some kind of rug or paddle actually
help you out I mean that it just kind of
gives you a forward backward left right
motion you're not really getting to that
spinning you got to kind of work to spin
at this point and then a low carpet if
you can hear me I'm a little further
from the microphone now low carpet kind
of gives you that in between really easy
to spin at this point and it's not going
to damage the carpet at all and honestly
this piece of pine right here I got a
piece of pine that's kind of a tester
for what it's going to do to a hardwood
floor pine obviously being a pretty soft
wood a really light wood didn't really
do any damage to this thing after a
straight week tiny little scrapes and
scuffs so if you're gonna do it on a
nice hardwood floor I would definitely
get some kind of pad they sell a floor
pad for it that obviously looks a lot
better than this you could also go cheap
and just go to Home Depot for six bucks
to get one of these which works just
fine or get some sort of hard plastic
chair mat or something like that but
again the thing works great super fun
just hop on it every morning have a
great time and your legs your knees I'm
notice these ankles are just kind of
moving constantly and I can code just
fine on it that's that's the best thing
too it's not distracting from coding at
all it's it's a distraction-free thing I
feel like it actually helps me focus
better because a lot of us coders are
kind of a little bit a DD and we need
something to kind of keep us engaged and
so this helps with that okay that's it
as you can see it's super fun product
stand up desk is awesome again I'm
telling you guys you got to try it at
least try the Pinterest tack one of
those myriad of Pinterest acts for
making your own stand-up desk to try out
thanks to fluids dance for getting me

check out their website I got a link to
that in the description again I'm not
getting paid to tell you this is a great
product - it is just a great product and
that's it you guys have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
