today and I am super excited about this
because this is where you move from
designer worlds to developer world
html/css say that stuff's great it's
considered more a little more design
because it's outputting looks and when
you move JavaScript now you're starting
to move into functionality and the good
news is is if you learn JavaScript
you're set up to learn a bunch of other
languages because programming is
programming is programming they're all
very very similar so what we're gonna do
is go to open up Google Chrome and hit
View developer JavaScript console or if
you're on the Mac Apple alt-j or command
alt-j so I can hit command alt J and
toggle this thing open closed curl you
can do JavaScript two ways you can do it
in your HTML code like in your text
editor or to learn it and to do a lot of
things you can do it straight in the
browser this is the easiest way to learn
so this is what we're going to do
because basically we're typing real time
into JavaScript and it's gonna real time
give us what we're doing so for instance
I can go alert open up a colon and then
go in quotes hi there
close out the colon and hit semicolon or
not :
these are whatever they're called
brackets braces so there you go alert hi
there and look we created an alert and
it says hi there so that's great there
you go your programmer I can also go
alerts you can do two commands on one
line as long as there's a semicolon
there it's going to know that you're
done with a command and it's gonna look
for the next thing as a new command so
that's one of the important things
semicolons hi there I say okay hi again
C program means not that terrifying
people it's it's not this actual other
language people call them languages but
the languages are in English it's more
or less just a list of commands so
another thing you can do is console or
in the console right now so I can do
console dot log hi there
up and then it spits out hi there and so
now I can go console dot log hi there
alert hi there
so now it's gonna log hi there and then
it's immediately going to alert hi there
so there you go so that's kind of your
basics I'm running commands and I'm
putting in the commands my they're
called arguments I'm basically telling
the command alert whatever I give you as
an argument so in this case I'm telling
it to alert a text string of hi there
let's get into what is a text string I
just use that weird word don't don't
freak out on me it just basically means
remember that all these characters are a
thing so if I go hi there it knows that
hi there is a text string let me kind of
tell you the difference between a text
string and a non text string or a string
so if I go to if I go 20 it does not
know that that's the number 20 it just
knows that that's a string ie it's a
letter two and a letter zero if I do 20
without quotes well okay now it knows
that that's a number see if you spit out
there's no quotes there it knows that
that's the number 20 here Watch let me
show you something if I do quotes and go
20 plus one it's a string it's a to a
zero a space a plus a space a 1 that's
what a string type is it's not smart it
just knows it's these characters if I go
20 plus 1 well now it's doing math for
me because I'm using numbers so that's
kind of the difference between a string
type and a number type they're called
types and that's that's a keyword you
want to remember as you move forward is
there's probably five types in
JavaScript
maybe there's six there's there's
basically just a few types not an
endless amount of types string and
number are things you'll have in any any
any programming language and across most
languages these are going to be the same
so let's get into how we actually do
programming and then once we kind of get
comfortable with the basics of
programming the next video I'll show you
how to actually do some stuff on your
web page with it but first we got to get
a little bit more comfortable with
JavaScript as a language so I'm going to
clear this out I'm going to introduce
the concept of variables a variable it's
just a lot easier to think of it as a
container tell you what I won't even
explain it I'll just show you how it
works it'll make sense their name so I'm
making a variable called name
we'll there we go so now I basically
said hey name equals will so anytime I
hid name it goes will so if I go alert
name without quotes I'm not giving it a
string now I'm giving it a variable
which is already defined my name is will
so if I hit alert it says will let's do
that again I'm going let's go let's call
this one message equals hello there so
now I can go alert message hello there
if I go alert messaging quotes and it
says message because I gave it a string
I didn't give it a variable I didn't
give it a container we already defined I
gave this a brand new thing that I
created as a string any time I do quotes
I'm creating a new thing I'm creating a
new string if that makes sense
what happens if you try to alert
something you haven't defined yet alerts
new message which we've not created it's
a zap new message is not defined you
haven't created something called new
message yet well let's make a variable
called new message now I can do alert
new message and there you go my new
message so hope that wasn't too
redundant for you but that's kind of how
you're going to do things I can also
create a variable called my number and I
can make this one a number instead of so
now if I do my number
it knows 200 and notice there's no
quotes around it
it knows that it's a it's knows that
it's an integer or a number so what I
can do is there my age equals 33 Shh
don't tell anyone so now I can go my age
plus 20 if I spelled my age correctly up
it knows that in 20 years I'll be 53 so
you can do math with variables it as far
as JavaScript is concerned there is no
difference between saying my age equals
20 and going 33 plus 20 it's like well
let's just look up what my age is okay
my age is exactly the same as third
three so what variables do is they give
you the ability to store information and
pull it back up at a later time this is
very very useful it's basically the core
of programming you're saving information
you're looking it up at another time so
let's get into an if-else statement if
you're not in too far over your head if
not just watch the video over again and
it'll make sense pretty quickly for you
we can do this let me define age equals
33 again I don't know why did triple
equals so ages 33 and I'm going to go if
and then I'm going to do brackets again
age is less than remember from your math
school greater than less than symbols
yep so age is on the littler side of the
arrow so if age is less than 35 and then
I'm going to do these guys and then for
this you're gonna have told shift and
hit enter because if you hit enter it's
going to execute the command so I hit
shift in hit enter I'm gonna go you're
still young and then I'm gonna hit shift
and enter again and I'm going to close
out that bracket so let's look at what I
did I said we're gonna do a check here
if and then whatever is in here equals
true then it's gonna go execute
whatever's between these braces which in
this case is just a single alert so at
this point I go if my age is younger
than 35 alert that I'm still young let's
hit enter and see it happens but still
young so now watch this I'll go age I
don't have to hit ver because age has
already been defined age equals 37 now
you only need to use ver the very first
time you're oh yeah for a very first
time you only have to use ver the very
first time you're defining a variable so
now if I run the same thing if age is
less than 35 nope doesn't it look that
I'm still young so what I can do now is
I can go else holding shift and return
again
so if age is less than 35 alerts still
young oh man getting old so now it's
gonna check it out if you're like if
you're younger than 35 or if this number
is less than 35 alert that you're young
else alert getting old and well this is
called an if statement and then it's an
if-else statement
and that's another core thing that
you're gonna use programming in any
language it's just for checking stuff
out say you've downloaded the user from
Twitter and you want to see if they have
tweets if if tweets let me see let me
give you an example of what we do here
tweet count equals zero so thank you go
you know you've loaded up your user if
tweet count is less than one you need to
make some tweets and so it's going to
alert that to the user or it's going to
spit out a message on the page it's
going to do something that's a lot
prettier than this ugly generic alert so
that's kind of the concept of how you
use JavaScript and programming you can
also say if there's more than five
tweets then you only show five if you
know you can this is basically where you
get some of those programming basics in
there let's do one more thing and then
we'll move on to in the next video where
we actually do some cool fun stuff in
our page if you're not freaking out so
far we did a string type we did a number
type we did if-else let's do some arrays
so arrays are the third type we're gonna
learn in JavaScript clear that again my
list an array is basically a list of
things and a ran array is done with
brackets so whenever you do brackets
like that it creates something of an
array type and what you do is you just
give it a bunch of values I'll do a
grocery list here so eggs and I'm doing
each one in quotes you'll notice you can
use single quotes or double quotes it's
kind of
- changeable with JavaScript eggs milk
fruits so now if I go my list I've got a
list of three items eggs milk fruit and
so that's what an array is an array
stores a list of items for you usually
if you were to download a friends list
from you know Twitter or whatever you
would get an array of all of your
friends so that's kind of what a razor
for they're kind of like a ul Li thing
you know a ul is a list of items and
this is kind of the JavaScript
equivalent of a UL it's a list of things
so you can go my list zero and that's
going to get the first the zero entry
which is eggs a lot of people that kind
of is weird to them index number zero I
thought that was the first item that
should be one yeah well for whatever
reason programming languages usually use
a it's called a zero index this is 0
this is 1 this is 2 so I can go my list
0 equals and I can change this to a
different string I can call it now
veggies so now if I go my list you'll
notice they work just like variables
it's basically just a group of variables
except for each one doesn't have a name
they have an index now I can go my list
to 1 equals older 1 eggs and I go my
list so now we go veggies eggs fruit so
you notice we're just kind of changing
this thing I can also go my list 3 which
there is no 3 equals add friends to the
list hit my list now we have 4 things in
here and you can also at any point time
go my list length and see if we got four
items in there so we have four items
item 0 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 which is a little
confusing to people but now that you
know what you know it and that's pretty
much how you'll use arrays and if you're
yeah and that's pretty much it we'll go
ahead and end this video for now and
then
next video I want to get you into
something that's usable that's fun right
away so we're gonna skip JavaScript
knowledge point 2.0 and we're just gonna
go straight into using jQuery to do fun
stuff hope you enjoyed this lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
