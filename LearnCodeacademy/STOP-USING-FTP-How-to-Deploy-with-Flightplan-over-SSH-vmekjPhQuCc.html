getting your files into production for a
website say you cyberduck or something
you drag your files in there's a much
better way I know I recently did a video
where I showed you how to sign up for
hosting from Hostgator and I showed you
how to use FTP to get the files over but
that's really an entry level way of
getting in if you learn just a couple
more things you can do this in a much
more stable much more much more
trustworthy and an easier much faster
way there's absolutely no reason this
should take this long just to put a few
files online when you make changes so
we're going to stop this and close this
yes please stop get out of here let's go
do this in a much better way so what
you're going to need I have a gist here
that I will put the link to online and
we're just going to step right through
it so you can see how easy this is
couple prerequisites let's make sure you
install nodejs from nodejs org now let's
make sure you have get on your machine
or github as it's often called and make
sure get that on your computer and then
let's move forward so you're going to
open up your terminal and you're going
to run this command NPM install - G the
desk G is important the first time
flightplan the - G means we're going to
install it globally which means we're
actually going to have access to the fly
command now I can say fly there's no
target specified but flies on my machine
and then you're going to get into your
folder that your project is in which is
Will's awesome site comm for me and now
I'm just going to run now I'm not going
to run Will's awesome site I'm going to
run npm install flight plan without the
G and that's going to actually install
it into my project so now you can see if
I go to my project I have node modules
and flight plan is in there so that's
great
next up if your project is not currently
a git repository you don't really have
to know what that means but you're going
to need to run these three commands in
your project and that's get in it let me
clean this up here for you get in it
there you go now I'm my project is a git
repository get add - a capital a and get
commit - M
and then in quotes you're going to do a
commit message first commit there you go
now all my files are in a github
repository the only prerequisite to
using flightplan is you have to keep
your files in a github repository so now
we're going to create our flightplan j/s
file let me copy this new file paste it
in save it as flightplan j/s there we go
now I have flightplan j/s the only thing
you're going to want to change is your
host to be your website and your
username to be whatever your Hostgator
or whatever log in is now one of the
reasons I recommend Hostgator is they
allow you to SSH in that's something
your host has to allow you to do in
order to do this kind of deployment they
recoil yeah this is for hostgator right
here when hostgator allows you to ssh in
you have to do it to port 20 to 22 so
lots of web hosts don't allow you to ssh
in at all some require you to use a
different port so that's something
you're going to need to know if you're
not using Hostgator and that's it i've
called this target production which
means if i hit fly production it's going
to copy all my files to production ok so
that's it I've saved it and let's test
it out let's just go fly production
copying them all it's gonna ask my
password to do and there you go it did
it you're like no way there's no way it
was that easy oh really well let's check
it out let's go to index dot HTML and
instead of learn code being really rocks
it's really rocks fly production ask for
my password
there you go and let's refresh our
website learn code really rocks no way
why was that so fast because this uses
our sink and our sink only pushes the
files that changed which is really nice
refresh there you go learn code now it
just really rocks so there you are
that's how to do great deployments using
flight plan for any kind of website and
if that if you want to make it if that
password gets really annoying for you I
have an SSH video that will show you how
to set a password list SSH so you don't
need to
that every time so your computer is
authorized to do that to the server
without a password hope you enjoyed this
video have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
