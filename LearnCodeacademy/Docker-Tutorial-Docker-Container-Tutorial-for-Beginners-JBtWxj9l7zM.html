docker right now so we are going to spin
up a docker server and then we are going
to run a web server application on it so
first off on my digitalocean let's go
ahead and create a droplet that we can
use this will be dr. test and let's get
the cheapest one if you've not used
digitalocean it's a lot of fun and it's
a cheap way to explore docker in a
destroyable way I'm going to go to
applications and I'm going to click on
docker so it's basically a bun - but it
has docker pre-installed it's really
easy to install docker on a bun - but
anyway that's easy enough add my SSH key
and go so there you go that's creating
while that's creating let me show you
some commands and once again I have a
link for $10 of digitalocean credit that
is a referral link that's down there in
the description so if you want free
credit to play around you can use that
while that's going let me show you the
docker commands that we're going to use
today these are the basic commands if
you look at all of them there's a lot
and it can be a little daunting but the
the basic commands are pretty simple
there's docker run which will take any
image it will create a new container
from the image and then it will start
that container which is different from
docker start docker start starts an
existing container that is not running
right now so when a container is run
with docker run you can stop it doctor
stop give it a name or an ID and it'll
stop it now if you want to restart that
container again doctor starts will
restart that container so if you were to
run docker run four times you're going
to create four new containers from that
image just important to know because
that confuses a lot of new people docker
PS gives you a list of all your running
containers if you do PS flag a then it's
going to include all your stopped
containers which is very useful because
sometimes you want to see how many
containers you've accidentally created
over time and then docker RM will remove
a container delete a container by name
or ID okay so that is probably created
yeah sure why not let's go and snatch
that IP address out and I'm going to add
an Etsy hosts entry just to make it
simple let's eat it to do
let's call it docker dot me so now dr.
dot me is my new docker machine and I
can SSH schrute at docker me and do that
on a second tab as well over here I
might not need a second tag tab but yeah
I'll do it okay so we are logged into
our docker virtual machine and you can
see that I have the docker command yep
there's all your doctor commands yeah a
little bit daunting so the first thing
you want to do is docker login and
docker login will allow you to either
create a new account or log in with
existing credentials on docker hub now
you can change this to point to Quade IO
or some other docker repository and
maybe have a private repository but by
default it's going to be dr. docker hub
I've already logged in so I'm good to go
so there we go let's clear that out so
once you're logged in you can now run
containers any public container that's
been released just kind of like think of
it as a github repository so I can go
docker run and then there's a company
called ton amour to tum' that has this
hello world that's just basically a
hello world web app let's say this is my
full-blown web application I've built it
and I've put it up to the docker hub
repository I can now run it on any
machine we will get into how to build
this in the next tutorial but I feel
like it's a lot easier on docker to
learn by just running existing
containers so if I say docker run the
first thing it's going to do is it's
going to pull all the layers that it
needs to run that and kind of this is
one of the reasons I recommend using
digitalocean because this is pretty fast
they have a really great internet
connection or any VPS server for that
matter so all these layers are basically
the changes that they've made on top of
the files on top of the docker file
system so maybe this layer right here
was installing Apache maybe this layer
here was adding a few files to the file
system
maybe this layer was configuring the box
a little bit so my box is running right
now if I go over to my other window and
I go docker PS you'll see that I've got
a container that is running right now
it's got this ID let me zoom down a
little bit because that seems kind of
stop yeah and now of course my screens
acting weird okay here's my container ID
here's the image that it's running from
that's the command that it ran and you
can see that it's exposing port 80 and
then it's got a name of tender hulking
so let me go to docker me port 80 and
this will not work dr. dot me port 80
does not work the reason that does not
work is because it's exposing a port
into the docker daemon but the doctor
daemon is not exposing that port out to
the rest of the world and so if you want
to expose a port you actually have to
run it differently let me go a docker I
can actually do like a control see over
here let me run that again docker run
and this time I'm going to give it a
port to expose out to let's say 8080 is
80 so I'm going to map the containers
port of 80 out to my server my web
servers port of 8080 so now I can access
it that's a great feature for docker and
the reason they do this is say you want
to run five copies of your one web
application
well that web application exposes say
port 80 or port 3000 but we want to run
that is four different ports because we
want to run different copies of it so it
makes a lot of sense that you have that
that feature so there we go let's run it
again and as you know from before I hit
run so now I have two containers that
I've created on my machine
let's go docker me 8080 there you go
hello world I'm now seeing my doctor web
application let's go back here and you
see that I'm seeing some blogs that
everything's coming through and now let
me go ahead ctrl C and stop that so if I
go docker PS flag a I've created two
copies of this of this web server so let
me go ahead and I can let me just go and
delete both of these now I'm going to
copy this container ID docker RM kill
you
docker RM kill you
so now PS a I have no containers created
no containers running so let's say in a
standard scenario I'm
going to run say four copies of my
container and I'm going to load balance
between them so I could do something
like this docker run I'm going to give
this one a name web one so I can refer
to it by name ports you'll be 80 81
coming from port 80 inside of totem
slash hello world I should just
pronounce it differently every time I
say it so there we go
that one's going to run and I'm also
going to run you as a daemon I'm going
to do flag D which runs it in the
background so you've noticed here I've
got this run command with flag D flag
name flag P that's the most daunting
thing about docker to me when I was
learning this a while back is lots of
flags it feels like is there going to be
an endless amount of flags here because
honestly most command line applications
you have one flag maybe two docker you
can have up to four or five and so if
you if you and your mind just tell
yourself hey going to be a lot of flags
I just got to deal with it then you'll
be fine after a couple days there's only
so many flags so let's run the exact
same thing web two is going to be port
8080 too and web 3 is going to be port
8080 three and we'll stop with three
webs so now if I go docker PS I've got
three three web instances running web
one web to web three I can get to it
port 8080 one port 8080 to port 8080
three and you know each one of these has
a different host name which is a docker
ID in this case so that's kind of cool
now I could add an engine ex instance
that would load balance between these
three and it would look to these
different ports I could do a lot of
different cool things I can also now
start and stop them by name so docker
stop web 3 and now that's not going if I
go dock or PSN I have to running if I go
docker PS dash a I've got three in
existence but it exited a while ago so
now I can start web 3 again docker start
web 3 so that's kind of the basics of
docker and in the next video let's get
into running or building our first
docker application building our first
image so we can push it up to the
repository
Tory and run it from anywhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
