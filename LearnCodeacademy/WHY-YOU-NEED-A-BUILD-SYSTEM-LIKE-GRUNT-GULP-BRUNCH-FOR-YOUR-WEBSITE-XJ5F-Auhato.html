need a build system now I can remember
the first time as a earlier web
developer somebody said run a build
system or run a build on your JavaScript
and it totally freaked me out
I was like what do you think I am some
sort of full-on programmer here and so
I'm going to demystify that in this
video talk about kind of what a build
system is it's not a scary thing what it
does for you and you'll hopefully see
why professional web developers all use
build systems or should use build
systems and kind of the advantages that
it will give you so why you need a build
system let's just look into what should
a build system do first off it's going
to do repetitive tasks things such as
concatenating JavaScript say you don't
want your browser to release a billion
javascript files like this this is a bad
idea because when your user wants to
load your web page this is going to
request this file from your server and
this file from your server in this file
it's going to open 20 requests to your
server and your server has to go hit the
hard drive 20 different times to return
20 different files that is not an
efficient way it's so much faster to
return one file where they're all just
back to back added into each other as if
you were to copy/paste of course copy
paste and save is a terrible way of
doing it and you do not want to deploy a
gigantic piece of code so concatenate in
JavaScript also CSS concatenating any
kind of files that should go together
into one file prefixing CSS you know
like border radius and border radius
then Mo's border radius you don't have
to do near as much of this stuff as you
used to have to do but it that's
something you shouldn't have to do day
in and day out when you're writing code
you can just write border radius and
that should be Auto prefixed for you
let's see we should run some utilities
on our code like J's hint so when we
save a J's file if there's a coding
error in there J s hint can catch it for
us a lot of times and we shouldn't have
to put that into production or sniff it
out in our console to find out that
there's an error there when it's clearly
a coding error so we should be able to
run J s hands on our code we should be
able to juggle
which is compressed and minify it and
with that is is here's like say I wrote
this mange ASI have a say name function
and assay age function I could put this
file up there and that's I don't know
how many bytes of data it is but if I
minify it I run say uglify j s on it
that can minified down let me turn word
wrap on here that can minify down to
this piece of code which is literally
half the file size this file will load
twice as fast if i deploy this file
because you'll notice what it is instead
of being called function same name it
kind of crunched it down to function a
and then later on it calls it as
function a it says a right there look
map come back to me and there you are so
it'll run function a and it'll run
function B because it rename them the
smallest possible things that they can
be called and so that's minified
javascript we can also minify CSS kind
of the same way here's CSS it can be
minify and minified down like this into
a very ugly form the problem is you
don't want to have to maintain this CSS
that's that's a headache waiting to
happen so we just want to deploy this we
don't ever want to code this or even
look at it with our physical eyes so
there's utilities to do that we also
want to run a local server in a lot of
instances so that way we don't have to
open this file by doing file opening
chrome that's an annoying way of doing
it we want to be able to go to localhost
and just view it as if it was on the web
without actually putting it up to the
web so we know that if it works on our
computer it's pretty much going to work
when we push it to our website and then
we also want to want run live reloads
whenever we save our file it'll
automatically refresh our not only our
browser but also any devices like any
iPhones or whatever that are connected
to our server and so this all these
things are done by a build system now
common build systems are grunts grunt is
probably the most popular still it was
kind of like almost exclusively the most
popular gulp is the new guy on the block
and is very very popular I'd say they're
about equal
right now brunch is a much more
simplified one that's also out there as
well but if you're going to learn one
I'd say learn grunt first because it's
still kind of the one that most
companies are using gulp is the one that
most companies starting up new projects
are going to be using so gulps going to
be an important one to learn here very
soon let's start with grunt then go gulp
and then why is this good for you I kind
of always mentioned already mentioned
PageSpeed is huge if you're loading if
you're making 20 requests to the server
just for your JavaScript files that's
going to slow things down
also if these things are not minified
it's literally each one is taking twice
as long to load as it has to so that's
not a good thing you want to be able to
load one or two maybe three javascript
files that are compressed they're very
small and they have all the code that
you need a usually good idea is you're
want to load maybe one javascript file
for your they're called vendor vendor
files that would be like jQuery
bootstrap any code that you're not
writing is called vendor code so maybe a
compressed vendor one and then another
one that's your actual application code
so whatever is for your website deploy
one for that now if you have this
massive application and there's a
hundred different pages and you know
maybe all the user profile pages need
code that the rest of the website
doesn't need well then you can load
another one that's just you know user
and that would have all this stuff for
you know that when the user is logged in
and that stuff so but you don't want to
deploy anything you don't have to deploy
you don't want to make any requests you
don't need to make and this is very
common you look at a lot of web pages
and you'll see just dozens of requests
happening and their pages terribly slow
compared to what it could be and they
don't actually have to change their code
they just have to change the way their
code is being deployed so PageSpeed is
huge a development workflow is really
the big win to me though you can use
cool technologies like sass you know
instead of having to write your CSS well
if you don't know sass sass is a much
more fun way
for developers to write CSS you can
break your code into multiple files back
in the day we used to write CSS files
that were gigantic and it would be such
a pain you're scrolling and scrolling
through literally thousands of lines and
and that kind of code breaks easy that
kind of code is terrible to maintain so
now you can break your code into a lot
of little files that each have a name
based off of what they do and you can
just kind of concatenate them all
together and then spit them all out as
one file and that's also easier to avoid
code conflicts if you have a team of
multiple people working on the
JavaScript files I touch to this file
there's a lot lower odds that somebody
else touched this file
they probably touched a different file
if they're working on a different task
and once again you can avoid annoying
repetitive tasks like prefixing your CSS
and stuff like that so that's what a
build system is it hopefully that makes
sense to you and in the next videos
we're going to get into building our
first build system with grunt and it is
not as scary as you think the only thing
you're going to want to do is watch my
intro to no js' to get a very very basic
understanding of what nodejs is and if
you've seen that or if you're kind of
comfortable with running node on your
machine then we're going to get into
grunt here we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
