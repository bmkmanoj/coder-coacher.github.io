topic of machine learning and neural
networks which sound a little
intimidating to people so we're gonna
break it down make it really simple to
get started in these concepts without
feeling overwhelmed we're actually going
to solve a common til developer problem
which I've had to face several times in
over the years and we're gonna solve it
with machine learning in a couple lines
of code so here's the problem which I've
had to do several times is that as
somebody's using a color picker to real
time change their text or their
background that text needs to change
from white to black depending on whether
that background is dark or light so
we're going to make a machine learning
program that determines whether any
color user picks is dark or light which
when you get into kind of coding this
programmatically with an algorithm the
way you would normally do it it's not so
straightforward because pure red means
light text beer green yeah kind of needs
dark text pure yellow definitely needs a
dark text so these different hues
actually are not so straightforward
whether they need a light or dark piece
of text so let's get into the machine
learning piece of it and again it's not
very intimidating we'll start by
installing brain is which is very easy
to use machine learning library for node
so NPM I already have it installed so
this should be pretty quick here brain
jeaious is installed again that's not
brain it's brain dot j s brain is an
older deprecated no longer maintained
version which there's a story behind
that that you don't need to know so now
we can kind of import that here again
brain dot j s not brain and so what you
want to do at this point is you just
want to create a neural network and then
run two commands against it so we're
gonna go net work equals brain dot nerve
there we go we're actually going to do
new brain dot neural network and then
we're going to network dot train we're
gonna give it some training data and
then we're also going to go cost results
the oles network dot run so once we've
my goodness that autocorrect is failing
me today so we're going to give it some
training data so one of the differences
between machine
learning and traditional programming is
traditionally if you wanted to determine
if a color was light or dark you'd start
by programming and algorithm you'd say
hey let's take the RGB values and let's
maybe I don't know Adam together and if
that number gets above a certain point
let's say that that is a light
background oh but then let's take the
edge cases oh it's more of a yellow and
we know that that needs to be dark so if
it looks more yellow let's do this rule
the neural network doesn't work that way
at all and you simply give it an array
of values an array of inputs and each
input has two things that as an input
and an output
so we give it historical data of hey for
these values historically here's what
the output has been think of it as like
flashcards to teach a toddler the
difference between cats and dogs you get
a stack of flashcards of different cats
and dogs and you show them this is a cat
this is a dog this is a cat this is a
dog and eventually their brain gets it
and they can go see a new picture and
know if that's a cat or a dog that's
exactly what a neural network is going
to do it simulates the behavior of a
human brain
so with brain DJ s it expects values
between one and zero so an input can be
one or more values and an output can be
one or more values you know so we could
say hey one equals one and trained it a
bunch of times and then we could train
it to say hey when you give it a zero
then that's an output of zero and then
our neural network could tell the
difference between ones and zeros okay
that's kind of pointless something more
useful might be hey let's try to tell
the difference between children and
adults so let's say we have a 60-inch
150-pound person the output will be one
for positive for an adult let's say we
have a 30-inch I don't know what a
30-inch person is sixty pounder maybe
that's going to be a zero that's a child
and then you give it a bunch of
real-world data and that's considered
trained and then down here we could give
it some other information let's say we
got a 70-inch 200-pounder and that
should tell us hey one that's an adult
let's go ahead try actually running this
here let's save that result there and
let's go note app you can see we got a
thirty
1% chance that that's an adult now a 31%
guestimation or accuracy level that
we're dealing with an adult that's not
very good so let's say we gave it some
more training data let's say we had a 73
inch or 250 pounder and that was an
adult let's let's see the difference
here there we go now it's a 67 percent
chance that we're dealing with an adult
so our network became more accurate with
the same data just because we gave it
more historical data points so your
network is only as good as you're able
to create your data
that's what very very important thing
with machine learning most of the trick
is coming up with data that can predict
accurately what an output and outcome
will be another thing here is we can
also change this to objects which is a
little more clear we could call this
height and we could call this weights
and then your output here could be what
you'd say adults is 1 and so that's
that's a little bit easier of a way to
make it easy to read as you're doing
these applications and they can pass
Heights and weight in and our result
will look a little bit differently now
it'll say adults 92 percent confidence
that we're dealing with in adults so
that's that's brain j/s now let's use it
to solve our problem of is this a light
color or is this a dark color the way
we're going to do that is we're going to
change our inputs to be RGB and then
we're gonna say is the output light 1 or
is it dark 1 and so all we have to do is
give it some training data by picking
some of our own colors looking at the
RGB values and we can easily convert RGB
into something between 0 &amp;amp; 1 by dividing
it by 255 because RGB colors are between
0 and 255 so if we divided by 255 255
becomes 1 0 stays 0 and 120 is somewhere
in between 0 &amp;amp; 1 so I've gone ahead and
done that I've made this RGB data set by
just picking some colors and dividing
all the numbers by 255 and saying is it
a light color or a dark color so here's
my data set now let's go ahead copy and
paste this
and I'll strip this last one off the
list here so I know that this is light
let's go ahead and comment that one out
and let's go ahead and paste our new RGB
value in here and let's see what we get
node app it says hey 95% confident with
just five training values 95% confident
that you are giving me a light color
right here awesome
so my neural network is working good and
it can predict whether a color is light
or dark so now we can go over to our
little HTML and plug in our code and we
should be working here so let's go ahead
copy all this code right here and so
here's my app right now I have an input
and a div example and I have an event
listener for that input to change it
whenever it changes I'm changing the
background so now I need to also change
the text so let's kind of bring our
stuff in here let's make it Const RGB
equals I have this little helper
function here that I got off Stack
Overflow for how to convert to RGB so
it's going to convert hex to RGB and I'm
also dividing them all by 255 and
rounding them to two decimal places
that's what this is right here so
basically just getting an RGB value so
get RGB you dot target dot value so
whenever you change that input right
there I'm gonna get the value in the RGB
numbers let's console.log that let's go
take a look
yep there's my RGB values excellent and
so now all I need to do is create that
neural network train it give it this RGB
value and whatever the output is I'll
know if it's light or dark
so let's come in with my brain neural
network
I'm also importing brain j/s right here
from unpackage comm which is basically
NPM
so I am creating a new neural network
I'm training the neural network and
let's go ahead get our results by
running RGB which is our RGB values
let's go ahead and console.log that
console.log that results so now I'm
console logging the results of whether
the colors light or dark and you can see
that I'm getting all my outputs here so
I could either say hey if light is
larger than dark then we know it's light
but I can also have brain jazz do that
for me by saying brain dot likely give
it RGB and give it the network that I'm
dealing with and that will do that exact
same thing for me so now let's go ahead
pull this up and you see now it says
dark light dark light dark light
excellent
so all I have to do at this point is say
example that style dot color is results
is dark if the result is dark then we're
gonna return white text otherwise we're
gonna return black text so that's going
to set the text color determining if
it's a dark or light background let's
see how it goes oh there we go we've got
dark we've got light dark excellent it's
toggling right how it needs to let's
check out some of these weird edge cases
okay yellow seems to be doing some
tricky stuff here so I'm gonna take a
data point that is wrong let's take that
data point here let's let's console.log
the RGB values here let's go find that
wrong data point here and we'll have our
program fine-tuned here within just a
moment let's find that data point so
instead of adding more algorithm or to
the algorithm more math more stuff like
that I just have to go in here and add
another use case with an outcome and
just train it a little bit better so I'm
gonna give it this I'm gonna say that
that is a light background we want dark
text so now it's trained let's let's see
what we have now there we go much more
how I would expect it to work so instead
of solving some strange edged cases you
can see I got another kind of weird
area there instead of solving edge cases
I just try to find quirky spots in the
data and train my data better okay I
have this little quirky flash of light
here maybe I'll just say that this data
point here is a little dark background
let's do make that a dark background and
within moments we've basically been able
to solve this problem that would have
been pretty frustrating to solve in code
there we go quirkiness is gone looks
like all those quirky possibilities are
gone let's see what it does when you
start it's pulling out the hues yeah it
definitely does what we expect it to do
so there you go that's how to get
involved in machine learning how to use
it to solve some issues that that might
not be quite as fun to solve using
traditional programming methods so I
hope this helped you out hope it gave
you the confidence to get into machine
learning and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
