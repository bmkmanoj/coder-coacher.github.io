I've spun up into production we're going
to be doing an automated deployment on
it so we can run one command and deploy
to as many servers as we have if our
application is huge and has ten servers
we can run one command and it'll send
them off to all ten so I've used
digitalocean to spin up a server called
test note app if you did not if you do
not know about digitalocean you didn't
catch my first video go ahead and catch
that now it's in the description and if
you don't know about SSH you want to
watch my SSH video that is also in the
description and that will get you up to
speed with what we're about to be doing
so we've got an email here that's
created our computer force there's the
IP address and there's our password so
let's go ahead and SSH routes at IP
address let me grab that password I
already logged in just you know so it
will ask you to change your password the
first time you log in and I've already
changed my password so let's say I've
logged in I've changed my password so
now what we are going to do is we are
going to install node that's already
installed because I spun up a digital
ocean image that has a node installed so
let's go ahead and install forever
forever is going to be our node package
that actually runs our app NPM install G
forever
there we go forevers installing and then
once that's done the next thing we're
going to do is add a user a deploy user
there you go forevers installed let's
create a deploy user so if you look at
this gist I have for you it's got all
the commands that I'm going to be
running I've got this just right here in
the description and I've got a link I've
got a link to how to create a deploy
user so let's go ahead and just copy and
paste this you can look at those
commands later on and see what they
actually are it's just going to ask for
that users new password there we go my
user is updated there's now a deploy
user who has sudo powers so he can kind
of do some sudo things you don't really
want to do things as a root it's a good
idea to have a user that at least has
you can apply restrictions too so now we
can SSH in as this user so let me go
exits we're going to SSH deploy at that
IP address so we're going to
login is that user and we are going to
now set up password list SSH
so that way that user can log-in with an
ID with an SSH key instead so the steps
for doing that as you can see here we're
going to make a directory for SSH and
get out
mkdir SSH okay let's exit there we go
I'm out and now we have to do is copy
our RSA key into the authorized keys so
I'm assuming you already have an ID RSA
key and now we are just going to copy
that if you have it by a different name
you'll want to change that I'm just
going to copy that too
oops I kept you at URL comm it's not at
URL comm because I have an IP address
here deploy at my IP address it'll ask
for my password I've copied the key over
and now I can SSH in and it will not ask
for a password
there we go I'm in awesome so now almost
done all we need to do is automate our
deployment we already have a user setup
who has permissions and so let's go
ahead an audit made our deployment with
the tool we're gonna be using for this
is called flight plan
it's an ojs library so it really kind of
will feel very familiar if you're
familiar with nodejs Capistrano is also
a great tool it's a little more
full-featured which means it's a little
more complicated to set up but you get
more features out of it
but flight plan is great for a lot of
scenarios so we're going to install
flight plan so we are on our machine
right now we're just going to go npm
install g flight plan that gives us the
fly command everywhere on the machine
there we go
and then we are in our application right
now we are going to install fly locally
in the NPM install and we're going to do
save dev fly just so you guys know too
I'm popping in and out of my terminal
because I'm using I term 2 so I can
hotkey in and out which is very nice so
now you'll notice the reason
did save dev that save devlog for those
you guys who don't know is it adds a to
dev dependencies instead of dependencies
so when I push my repository to
production I can just run npm install
production and it will only install
these guys whereas if i run npm install
it will install the dev dependencies as
well really all that does is it just
speeds up my deployment a little bit if
you have 10 dev dependencies like gulp
and stuff then your deployment on
production doesn't install any of those
it makes it just a little bit faster you
can install it here it doesn't really
matter it's not going to blow anything
up so flight plan is installed so now I
can it fly and it's going to say there's
no flight plan Jas so all I need to do
now is add a flight plan Jas file let's
touch that there we go so now it's
created and let's copy in so now I'm
going to copy and paste this flight plan
Jas code that I have for you in my gist
it's a slight tweak on what they provide
for you by default that's setup for
forever so there we go that's my flight
plan Jas here's what you're going to do
you're going to give it an app name
which you can make whatever you want
this determines the folder that it
deploys your app to the username which
we made a user call deploy and then
whatever your start file is so we run
bin www to start our app some people
call it server JIT server Jas then the
only other configuration you're going to
do is you're going to set up your IP
addresses for your staging and
production servers so let me grab that
IP address there's my IP address and
that's my production server if you had a
staging server you could also set that
up so we could deploy to staging first
and then deploy to production once
that's successful and you can set this
up as an object or you can set it up as
an array and you can add multiple
servers so when you do fly production it
will deploy to I don't know 10 or 20 of
these servers if you want I just have
one right now so that's all I have and
that's it so now I can just run fly
production and it will deploy to my
production server FRA ha ha
fly production there
go it's sending it sending it over
running my app with forever and we are
good so now I can go to my IP address
and I can go to port 3000 and check it
out there's my node application all I
need to do at this point is buy a domain
name and point it to this IP address and
I'm good so that's basically how you
deploy and if I need to redeploy I just
run fly production again or fly staging
to run to the staging servers and it's
done so let me show you kind of under
the hood what this is doing for us what
what fly is actually doing what flight
plane is doing so when you run it the
first thing it does is it gets all the
files to copy it runs this command on
your machine it runs all the local ones
first so if you have like a gulp build
or a grump grunt build you can uncomment
that and it will run that first and then
it will do run get LS files and what
that does is that gets a list of all the
files that all would be checked into
your git repository so it will ignore
node modules it will ignore anything
that's in your get ignore file I can
even show you what this command does get
LS files it shows you right there
there's all my files and they're full
URLs so that's kind of nice and then it
copies all those files with one rsync
command you can see what that our sync
command is here it's a big old messy
command that it does for you so it R
syncs them all in and then it runs npm
install production it moves them to a
temp directory runs npm install
production and then it makes a symlink
to the application name folder which
i'll show you what that is that doesn't
probably doesn't make sense and then it
stops your application with forever and
then it restarts your application with
forever let's go ahead and login to our
server
SSH deploy there we go and let me show
you what I got here so we see that I
have node app that's a folder and then I
have two different folders for my two
deployments so I have history of all my
deployments and this is actually a
symlink so it deploys your deployment to
a folder given that gives it the
timestamp that's a timestamp right there
and then it
says it makes a symlink no tap now
points to this folder so if I were to
make a new deployment it would create my
new folder put on my new code in there
and then it would change the sim link so
thou know'st to app points to here so
then if I go CD space no tap it thinks
I'm a node app but I'm really in my
deployment folder because it's a
shortcut it's a symlink and then it runs
my my command which is forever starts
and then whatever I've sets you know bin
ww
and that's what flightplan is doing for
you behind the scenes that's pretty much
how you do an enjoyable deployment to
any kind of environment you want we call
these environments staging environment
production environment and now we'll go
into the next video where I'll show you
how to enhance this by running our node
app as a service and that will make it
an even stronger deployment strategy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
