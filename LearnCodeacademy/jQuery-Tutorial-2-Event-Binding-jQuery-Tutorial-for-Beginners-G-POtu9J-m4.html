missed lesson number one I'm going to
put the link in the description you're
definitely going to want to see that I'm
also going to get a link on the screen
here you should see that if you're not
on mobile let's move forward so in the
last lesson I showed you how to do
jQuery actions or methods as they're
called one I didn't show you is the HTML
method so if I go BTN one let's get
grabbed button one I can do HTML and I
can actually change what's in the HTML
code so right now the code is just that
button one text so now it's called my
button that's kind of fun so what I
actually got to do is I got to rewrite
what's inside of that HTML element let's
look at panel one here that's this guy
this div and what I get to do here is I
can actually rewrite the entire inside
of it so I can go if I do panel one HTML
my panel so there you go all the
elements are gone that we're inside and
now the only thing inside of it is text
that says my panel I can even add new
tags bold not bolts this isn't too good
of an idea to do very much of but you
can do a little bit you can add a tag or
two and it's not considered a bad
practice okay so we know how to do
jQuery methods so let's listen to what
the users doing and do methods when the
user interacts with our page so we're
going to do is let's give an example we
click on button one I want this panel to
show and hide so let's go button one we
start with the thing we're wanting to
listen to and the method is called on
and then we give it a event name this is
a JavaScript event name so I'm going to
go on click the first these are called
arguments that I'm passing here the
first thing I'm giving it is listen to
the click event and then I'm going to go
comma and then I'm going to give it my
function which you'll recognize from up
here open closed parenthesis open closed
curly braces so anything in between
those curly braces now will fire
whenever the click event takes place so
now I can go I'm going to add the
parentheses or the semicolon to be a
good guy
now I can go panel one hide actually
I'll just go toggle that way it'll show
and hide whatever isn't so when I click
on button one it's going to run this
function and it's going to toggle panel
hey would you check that out let's
actually make that slide toggle this is
something you use probably that'll make
it a slide toggle at 200 there you go
slides and is beautiful let's make it
when I click on the panel I actually
want it to hide that panel itself so
when you click on panel 1 there you go
it's gone now I can't actually click it
to toggle it back so I have to hit the
button to well I took away my button 1
now didn't I so I can't actually bring
it back without refreshing my page but
that's how you would do that if you want
to get rid of things I could make an X
button inside of here so when you click
that X button it tells panel 1 to go
away so I can actually make it fade out
I might make a little more sense click
and it's gone and that's a lovely way of
doing things you'll notice I changed the
panel I didn't remove the whole column
which is why those things are sitting
there so let's go into a little bit more
clever usage of this so let's say we add
button 1 let's assign these buttons to
each one of these panels BTN 1 I think
is what they're called
b10 1 panel 1 fade out there we go I'm
going to go button 2 you're going to do
panel 2 I'm going to do button 3 does
panel 3 + button 4 does panel 4
there you go so now each one of these
should go away go away go away go away
come back alright did I just do fade out
yep let's do fade toggle do my nifty
sublime text multiple cursors there
there you go
any order now I actually have a pretty
living breathing page nice let's
actually change this event from click to
mouse over something you might want to
do sometimes
and it's going to toggle meets time now
I get to do some fun crazy you know
everybody's got to do that when they
make something like that right so there
you go and mouse over I can make it to
where all it does is fade out and you
have to click to bring it back in mouse
over it's going to fade out I'm going to
copy and paste all of these you notice
it's pretty easy to get a mess of jQuery
in the next video I'm going to show you
how to clean this up because this is
already kind of too much we don't really
want to do it this way and so then when
I click I'm going to tell it to fade
back in so now I have four mouse overs
on mouse-over we're going to fade out
and when we click we're going to fade
back in fade outfit outfit out click
will bring me back in there we go that's
a super fun way of doing things what I
can also do is I'll teach you one more
method here so let's go on click
function on button one click panel one
we are actually going to go find and now
we get to look inside of panel one what
I want to do is panel one body panel
body this is what I want to change here
I'll go panel actually I won't do fine
I'll just go panel 1 dot panel body and
I'm going to change that HTML to my new
panel content so now I click on that my
panel content will change to my new
panel content nice very good so that is
pretty much how you listen to events and
then tell your page to do stuff one cool
thing you could do is I could have all
these panels hidden by default which I
could do you know with a CSS class or in
this case I'll just make it I'll do it
the wrong way here and go display:none
so now all these panels are going to be
hidden by defaults and then the button
will activate them you'll get to show
them so button one on click panel one
dot show ah let's get in toggle
so on button one-click panel one will
toggle so they're all hidden there you
go and now I can copy and paste that to
button 2 if you're using sublime text by
the way Apple D is what gives you
multiple cursors like that there you go
so now they're all going to toggle
whenever I hit these so that's kind of
your intro to listening to jQuery events
the next video we're going to show you
how to clean up your jQuery because
there's no way you actually need to do
this one they all do the exact same
thing I'm going to show you how to clean
that up how to reuse some stuff in
jQuery and just how to make it a little
bit more professional so catch that
video next and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
