directives to work with our data in a
more powerful way view directives are
very very powerful they're very much
like angular directives if you're
familiar with angular and they allow us
to just in a quick line of code
accomplish great things so let's go
ahead and start by changing this friends
list from an object full of objects to
an array full of objects so let's go and
create friends let's make an array of
our friends I'll start by just doing
simple names so there we go we have an
array of friends now I can get rid of
this computed we don't need this anymore
and so we can do here is we can loop
through the friends array and spit out
an h2 for each one of our friends so
let's go ahead and do h2 and we can use
the v4 directive this will allow us to
do a for loop through our data so for
each item and Friends we're going to
create a friend object so for friend in
friends much like you do a Java Script a
loop and we can now spit out the value a
friend so yeah but we have an h2 for
each one of our friends and we're
spinning out the entire value of friend
let's go change this now to be a full
object so let's change this to an array
of objects and clean up a little mess
there so now we're gonna have an array
of friends and you notice it actually
spits out the whole javascript object
for each person great although that's
not really what we need we want friend
name actually there's no such thing as
for a name friend first or in this case
we could also do friend full name
so it'll again we can use the filter on
each object that works just fine here as
well so that's the v4 directive let's
also say we want to start changing
friends names we want to be able to edit
each friends name so what I'll do here
is I'll create their name in any
for now let's create an input and let's
actually say we want to edit their first
name so v-model
is going to be the directive for this
and we can see friend dots first and so
v-model
means that it's automatically going to
sync to that first name and when I make
changes it's two-way data-binding so if
I change the Y then automatically that
got changed it got changed in my data
and that triggered a rerender on anybody
that was listening to that data so it's
reactive to a reactive data binding
there so I can say his name is now Billy
and I say John's name is Johnny and so
that's a really simple way to edit data
that's one of the simple things that
makes view easy to work with is that
two-way data-binding so let's also make
a model for friend last you can see now
that we can fully edit any one of their
names now let's say we want to work on
that person's age let's make an H 5 for
their age how could we change their age
we can add some buttons to maybe bump it
up and down so let's make a button here
now what we can do is we can use the V
on which will allow us to act on any
user event so the user event we want as
they click so we're going to do : click
so V on : click equals and then we can
have it do something we can say friend
friend H equals friend age plus 1 let's
see if this works yep it works and then
I can also make a minus button that will
take their age down one
we can change their age change their age
back up change your age back down now
well that's a very simple quick way to
do it the better way of doing this is to
move this logic out of the template
logic in a template is generally
speaking a bad idea you want to do this
as little as possible so we can add a
methods object now let's make a methods
object and we can say increment age and
this will receive a friend it's very
important that we receive a friend not
just a number because we can now go
friend
age equals friend age plus one and so we
can do now is on click we can say hey
increment friend and now this will work
so we are going to increment age pass it
in our friend and then this will
automatically bump the age up use the up
still works and down still works in the
hacky way so let's go ahead change this
to a decrement method now decrement age
and that will be -1 so then this will be
decrement age so now we're just
essentially handing that method off
there we're handling that logic out of
the template and into a method there we
are we're able to change our friends
ages and we're able to change our
friends names so that's how you work
with data using methods and using
directives in view j/s
