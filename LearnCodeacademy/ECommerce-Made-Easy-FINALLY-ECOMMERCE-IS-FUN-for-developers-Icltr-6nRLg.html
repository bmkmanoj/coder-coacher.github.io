actually going to be a lot of fun for
anybody who's ever tried ecommerce
before I've had to do e-commerce several
times and if you're using a ecommerce
platform usually they're this bulky PHP
annoying thing that's just annoying like
when people ask me to hey will you
develop e-commerce for me I usually
grimace and just I don't want to do it
because it's one of the less fun things
that you do as a developer
however this company recently reached
out and said hey would you be interested
in looking at our product and featuring
it and I said well I've got to like the
product any product before I tell people
about it but let me take a look at it
and honestly I fell in love with it I'm
pretty much going to be using this for
e-commerce stuff in the future because
it's so easy and so cool so I wrote him
back a little while later and said yes
I'm definitely going to do a video on
this and so what moulten the company
Moulton has done is they've taken the
whole big platform out of it they say
we're not going to provide you a
platform we're going to give you api's
that connect to the admin tool that all
your support staff uses to enter
products and update prices and blah blah
blah and then you get to build it in
anything you want
so for JavaScript users you can build it
in angular or ember or whatever for PHP
users you can build it in any framework
you want yes anybody that's done
e-commerce before is already really
excited so I'm going to show you the API
real quick and then the next video we're
going to build an angular app and we're
going to build out almost the entire
store in just minutes so let's real
quick look at moulton what it is what it
does basically create a free tier
account there free tier gives you like
30,000 API requests a month I believe
it's quite a bit and so you create a new
store it takes like two questions and
you have a store and as a developer
that's about all you have to do you can
access your API keys right here for that
store and then you can also add admins
administrators to the store that can log
in to the dashboard let me show you the
dashboard real quick the dashboard is
what all your support staff will use or
if you're a small company you'll use it
but it's a great separate
of concerns because developers don't
need to worry shouldn't have to worry
about orders inventory shipping any of
that junk and so it's a really clean
slick inventory management tool I went
ahead and added three products took no
time at all and so we're going to use
api's from here on out to access the
store and start building our store any
way we want to and so let's look since
we're going to be doing angular let's
look at the JavaScript API I won't
really touch the PHP API although it's
pretty much just as simple so let me go
ahead I have this local host file spun
up over here and here's my basic HTML
file now to start off with moulton
you're going to copy that API key and
you need to load in their sdk right here
which they have all this in their Docs
they do have really good Doc's
especially for a new company they have
really good Doc's so you create your new
molten objects and then you do a Moulton
authenticate and then that's just going
to give you a callback function when
it's authenticated when it's connected
to your store and so from there on out
you can make API calls and they're very
straightforward you can go molten dot
category lit list category dot lists and
I'm not going to pass it any filters of
any kinds and so let's just console.log
categories whoops I want to console.log
that man ok there we go so I'm just
going to console.log categories after I
get them let's let live reload pick that
up and there we go I've got my one
category which is the default on
categorized category it's got my
description it's got my ID so let's go
ahead and now get all the products that
are in that category I'm going to snatch
that ID out so I can go molten product
dot list and I can search category is
that ID right there and the ID does have
to be a string it cannot be a number and
products so there we go that's going to
call back and let's just console.log
products
there we go I've got my three products
right there
super easy simple to do let's snatch a
product ID let's just do a product get
let's get this ID I think that's all I
have to do if I recall correctly all
there api's are named correctly they
really make sense which is nice yep
there's my product
there's my pricing it's got both
formatted pricing with tax without tax
which is really cool
raw stuff you've also got api's to
create a customer customer logins so yes
you don't have to manage customers and
then that way they can add in all their
information basically anything you'd get
in a full-featured shopping cart you can
do via simple api's let's go ahead and I
have that product number right there and
now I can add it to my cart cart insert
that the second Paramus how many you
want I want to add three of that to my
carts there's some third parameter be
know I'm not quite sure what that's for
maybe it's for something in the future
but for now that has to be in there so
we're adding that product three times M
I will return a cart so let's go ahead
and add that product I have already
added it before so I should see a lot
more than three in there yeah I see the
price is 1099 and I've got ten of them
in there right now so there we go and
that's going to show me kind of my
totals formatted here's where my carts
sitting right now and that's basically
the JavaScript API super-easy I'm not
going to bore you with every API call
you can do let's get into the fun stuff
in the next video we're going to do
angular and we're going to use the
yeoman angular generator which I've been
wanting to do for a while anyway because
it really speeds up your angular
development you basically don't have to
do any boilerplate and we're going to
build out a shopping cart all the way up
to check out in a matter of minutes so
let's go ahead and cover that video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
