pattern to abstract our data out of a
single component into a shared file that
multiple components can interact with
it's going to help our applications
scale forward because while putting all
the data inside of component data object
might work well for a to-do list soon
you find yourself in scenarios where
different components all want to access
the same data and you don't want to have
to pass it down through props over and
over and over again and get complex let
me show you a simple example here I'm
I'm basically rendering three components
here navigation friends and component
navigations going to put the count of
friends right here then this is
obviously our friends list and we also
want the count of friends down here so
right now we have friends list being
populated right here in the friends
component so for the navigation and
footer to be able to get this
information we'd have to take this data
and we'd have to move it up to the app
level and then we'd also have to pass it
down through rebind into friends
navigation and component which while
that works for an application this size
if you imagine a larger application
that's a whole lot of passing down props
and data and this is for a tiny bit of
data if you get a lot of data it's just
this top level view component would just
be massive so that does not scale that
does not work well so what we're going
to want to do is we're gonna actually
create a separate store as many separate
stores as we want to so that way all
this data can live in a file outside of
the view components that way our view
components kind of act like a view level
and then all the data can live somewhere
else so we're gonna do is we're gonna go
ahead and create a stores folder and
inside of that lets go and create a
friend's store so there's our friend
store now we can go ahead and go const
friend store equals this is just gonna
be a plain old JavaScript object that
we're going to export and I created it
and then exported it for a reason
because I want to be able to access it
in here so we're going to do our data
and then we're also going to do our
methods and so methods in here could be
some
usable methods like say addfriend let's
go and create some friends data here
we'll do different data so we know that
we're pulling it so we've got two
friends in an ad friend might receive a
name and then we can go friend store dot
data dot friends push
so we'll just push that name onto the
stack so that's kind of a way that you
could then interact with it so that's
why I defined friends store up here and
then exported it that way just makes it
easier on my methods I can reference
friends store data dot friends so
there's my one reusable method add
friend and there's my data that can be
shared by many components so I've
created my friend store now we can come
to our friends components and we can
actually import that so now you can
either just call this friend store which
will be friends store dot data because
you'll remember we are referencing this
now we don't want to reference the
entire friends store in our data because
this this isn't really data so friends
stores now friends store data and we can
now go friends store dot friends and
that will work now we're getting Bobby
and Billy instead of whoever Jack and
John whoever the other guys were and
then here the were calling this
addfriend method so this can now go
friends store dot methods dot add friend
and so this one I'll add a friend to the
friends object in friends store which
should be good and now that works and
what's great about this is now we can do
this exact same thing on all the other
components other components can now
access friends store
there's no messy passing in of props I
don't really care where friends store
comes from or who all has access to it I
just know that I need to have access to
friends store and then I also need
access to that data so let's go back
here we're in the footer now
don't need that new friend so now I can
he say right here
and now I have four friends five friends
you can see that it dynamically updates
just fine because it is listening to
that object that friends store data
object it binds to it and is reactive to
changes on it that's super simple and
then it's basically the exact same level
of complexity to add that to the
navigation there we go or importing
friends store we're spitting out friends
store and now we can in the header as
well
we can spit out the length of friends we
have up here you could make a button
down here that would trigger more
actions against the friends store and
the friends store components would all
update so that's kind of how you can go
with a store model a store pattern and
we can also create multiple stores let's
call this a different store
I don't know tweet store call tweet
singular to be consistent
now we'll call this tweets whatever at
this point it's a little overkill but we
can take that tweet store and any other
component can import the tweet store as
well we can now import the tweet store
we can set the tweet store here and so a
component can now bind to multiple
different stores it can add methods that
interact with multiple different stores
and what's great is is I don't actually
have to have any of the logic for adding
a friend here all I'm doing is I'm
calling the logic of add friend all that
logic can be reusable and live in
friends store so that's kind of how you
use a store pattern we have to start
scaling out the data of a view
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
