doing chrome dev tools we're gonna be
using chrome dev tools to enhance our
CSS coding to take it to the next level
make the workflow a little easier also
give us the ability to see what's going
on on somebody else's site and bring
those CSS rules over to our site easily
so let's say I got this site here a
basic bootstrap 3 panel layout looks
like factory bootstrap if you haven't
seen the bootstrap video check it out
now you're going to get your mind blown
on how awesome bootstrap is I'll put
that in the description this should look
familiar to you otherwise basic
bootstrap stuff so I mean by default
your theme with bootstrap will give you
several things let's say I want to make
this one special in this one dim you can
go panel success which is this these are
based off the colors of your theme
warning that's a yellow primary these
are all going to come from your
bootstrap theme that you're using those
are great but let's say I really want it
to be something unique in my own so I'm
going to leave that panel default so I'm
going to go panel special and we're
going to build a rule on top of
bootstrap you don't want to modify
bootstrap just so you know don't want to
modify bootstrap bad idea bad practice
if they ever upgrade it you're going to
get in big trouble you're not going to
be able to do it so you want to build on
top of it with your own customized rules
so I'm going to make panels special and
we're going to build out a rule for
panel special to make this thing look
you guessed it special so the first
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
come over here and I'm going to
right-click and do inspect element in
chrome and that opens up dev tools let's
go full screen here dev tools is what
chrome gives you Mozilla Firefox also
gives you something pretty similar to
this some features better some features
worse also ie has it pretty much of all
the devs I know most people prefer
chrome nobody prefers IE a couple people
prefer Mozilla Firefox as dev tools find
the one you like this is about Chrome so
when I right clicked and inspected the
elements it gave me the panel heading
which is the thing I clicked on you can
see this is the HTML that I actually had
going on there a couple cool things you
can do is you can real time you know
right-click and start change
HTML very special panel kind of like
what I'm doing with live reload you can
also delete a node actually delete a
whole node you know just start actually
real-time modifying your HTML code you
can right-click and do edit as HTML and
instead of a div we'll change it to a
button I could type there you go now I
have some awkward button there so real
time you can change your HTML I'm going
to refresh my page it doesn't actually
change your file it just reloads what
you're seeing at the time so if you ever
hit refresh be careful it's going to
clear everything you've adjusted in the
meantime I've made that mistake several
times or if you're using live reload you
come over here and hit save and ahh all
my Styles got tweaked and now it just
reloaded so be careful of that let's say
once again we want to make this thing
special so I can also when I click on
each element I can see every CSS rule
that is applying to that element all in
a row here and as you can see it's quite
a few and they're all coming from
bootstrap because bootstrap has just got
a lot put into it this has some you know
body styles that affect every element on
there you can see it's inherited from
body keeps going up the list and then
there's some Styles directly on panel
heading you can real time change any of
these let's change the background color
to a reddish border color too wise if
you're going more for the design at the
moment these will really help you know
you quickly flesh out design stuff even
faster than if you're using live reload
you can turn Styles off you know so I
can turn off my border-radius that
little I think it's a yeah 3 pixel
rounded corners I can turn those off
turn off my padding yeah
don't want to do that you just kind of
see what happens and if you want to
actually click you can see where they're
coming from I'm using bootstrap minified
so it's one big blob of CSS not very
helpful there but let's say I want to
build my own we can't modify these
because these are coming from bootstrap
and we're not going to modify bootstrap
so I'm gonna actually build my
on panels special class let me go ahead
hit refresh here I'm going to start
building out elements style here we're
going to start on panel heading so I'm
going to go background red color white
and then let's go tweak these to be a
more pleasant red since that default red
is hideous make that slightly off-white
there we go that looks nice
I'm also going to go border border
radius 0 to get those square corners
just to make it different I'd probably
want to do that site wide but whatever
so you notice that entered those in it
converted them to RGB colors which is
fine you can use either one and also
gave me this inline style thing so I can
double click on that and copy them which
is great and now come to my CSS file
panel special and we are actually on
panel heading so panel special panel
heading copy those Styles in there hit
save it refreshes and I got them awesome
so let's go ahead and tweak this body a
little bit let's go background color
I'll make color red too now let's go
background red let's go give it a nice
little Pleasant color and I'm feeling
special it's working let's go
border-radius zero and this won't work I
want to get rid of these rounded corners
I already know it won't work because I
tried this ahead of time and oh no I
changed border radius to zero and it
didn't happen where is that coming from
and this is something you ask yourself
when you're coding CSS all the time
where the heck is that style coming from
because this should have overwritten it
and it didn't overwrite it so I'll
scroll down I'm on panel body I scroll
down there's no border radius on here
another thing you can do is you can
click on computed and you can see here
computed style or all the ones that it's
inheriting from I will get to compute in
a little bit so I'm checking out styles
border radius has not been defined
anywhere so well clearly
I don't need that so I'll delete you and
so now what you got to do this is what
this inspectors for is I'm going to
start going up the chain so the panel
body I must be getting border-radius
from this element up here let's go up in
elements and yep there you go border
radius of four pixels so we are able to
take this four panel body let me copy
that out panel body copy those in I hate
the whitespace but oh well and now we
should be looking yep now I got our
colors when it refreshes yep so all we
need to do is get that border radius
zero on the actual panel special element
and that should take care of it yep
there we go now we got square corners
everywhere so it helped us debug that
and like said once again what you're
going to get all the time is where is
that padding coming from my set padding
to zero on this it must be coming from
up here
and let's look at this computed tab here
real quick computed will show you 100%
of the styles that are applying to that
element and so here's color you can
actually drop it down and see the hole
so you can see it's coming from panel is
getting a transparent color and then
panel default is overriding it which is
why that struck out with this grey color
right there so if I go panel heading and
I go background color you can see panel
default is going to give us that f5 f5
and panels special is overriding it so
that's another way you can kind of look
through and see you can also see that
this panel special rule is coming from
my CSS inspect stylesheet whereas this
is coming from the bootstrap file so
that's kind of how you're going to use
this kind of going to have how you're
going to use this inspector for CSS
stuff let's say there's a style there's
a let's go to CSS tricks calm and see if
there's something on here that we want
to snatch that must not be the CSS
tricks what is his website great guys
CSS
- tricks great website great stuff on
here let's say I'm like ooh that hover
thing is nifty let's look at that and
see what rule that I've made that thing
glow when I hover it over it so let's
see if we can find what that is this
looks like it is div class logo let's
click on that and then another thing you
can do is you can click on here and see
what happens on hover and that will
automatically turn hover on okay nothing
changed when I turn hover on so let me
look at - tricks and see if that changes
when I turn hover on that didn't change
when I turn hover on let's keep looking
here there we go this a when I click on
hover then you can see the glow starts
coming on so it's in the hover element
and let's go find out where that is
color hover text decoration you're just
going to start looking through all these
and I'm going to start turning these off
till I can find out which one makes the
glow go away that's not it that's not it
oh you know what it is it's when the
hovers on the a I'll bet you anything I
now see there we go
that's it so let me tell you what I just
did here is I could tell okay there's
nothing in the a that is causing that
glow to come on but it's when the hover
is turned on the a that the glow appears
so that means there must be a rule
inside as well I don't know if I'm
making sense here but I'll show you what
it is is there's a a hover span so when
we're hovering over the a the span is
going to get its own rule and that's
where it is it's going to get that text
shadow I want that I need this so I'm
going to copy text shadow and then I'm
going to say let's just go text shadow
and now I have it all the time let's go
back here oh it's glowing awesome I
snatched it but I only want it when I
hover over
right so I'm going to go panel special
I'll basically just rip off what heated
panel special hover so I'm hovering over
panel special then my panel heading is
going to get that so that should give me
nothing here we go
I want to hover haha got it and then it
glows and it's special so that's kind of
a really quick I don't know if I
confused you on the whole hover part but
that's kind of how you use this to start
seeing what's going on with that I want
to copy that onto my site that's a
pretty much basic intro to how to use
CSS for dev tools I'm going to put up
some other videos here for bootstrap at
the end and have yourselves a great day
