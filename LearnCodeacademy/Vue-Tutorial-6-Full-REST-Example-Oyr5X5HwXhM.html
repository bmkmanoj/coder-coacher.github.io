our restful api let's go ahead and add
some more code so we can actually edit
those friends delete those friends and
learn some more about view along the way
so the first thing we'll do it'll
probably the easiest let's go and delete
a friend now so instead of just spinning
out the friend's name let's go ahead and
actually had a button as well with an X
on it and while we click that button we
want to delete a friend we're going to
delete friend and we can actually do is
we can actually pass in that friend's ID
which is going to be super helpful so we
can delete that friend so let's go and
make a method
so we're going to delete that friend by
ID we can use this fetch API just the
same we're going to fetch friends / this
time plus ID so we're gonna send a
delete request to view five friends ID
and we're gonna also pass over some
headers and some more information here
so let's actually the method will be
delete and that's about all we need to
pass and we're just sending a delete
request over this object here with the
second argument in the fetch API is
configuration so we can pass in a method
we can pass in headers and all that we
won't need to parse that response at all
basically we're just going to delete our
friend and then console.log deleted so
let's see load up our friends yep and
delete it so he didn't go off the list
we'll address this in a second but if i
refresh will is now gone and if i
refresh willis is now gone excellent so
that made it pretty easy so let's go
ahead and also we want to delete them
from our friends list by index so let's
say we have a friend here let me go
ahead and post some friends back here
we're going to want to actually pull
them out of friends list when that
delete is successful and we can easily
do this by just splicing them out of
that array so we'll splice out either 0
1 or 2 so what we can do is in this
repeater we can just do comma I and
we'll also get the I variable which is
the index of that friend we can pass
that in that makes it super easy to do
we have their index and their ID I can
just go this dot friends splice that and
we're just gonna splice one person out
and since it's all reactive when we
splice that person out of the array the
whole components going to reload and
it's going to be super easy
William gone willis gone william gone
and if i refresh yep my friends are gone
if I reload this endpoint yep my friends
are gone so now that's working all we
have to do is
an edit feature and our friends adarand
editor is 100% complete so an edit is
going to be a slightly different
scenario we're probably going to want an
edit mode here to wear for editing we
see an input field and a button to save
and if we're not editing then we just
see their name as is right now view
gives us some directives that make that
kind of logic really easy the V if and
the VL so I can go a div here V if so if
we're editing I'll address that in a
minute then we display what's in that
div the else then will display the I'm
not editing mode so let's say if let's
make something up here called edit
friend edit friend up there so if edit
friend equals friend ID so for editing
our current friend's ID then we're going
to display this stuff in here so we can
do an input friend name and then a Save
button and we'll make this V on click
update friend
we'll just passing the whole friend so
if we're going to update a friend
that'll be how we do it let's go ahead
and now make an update friend method
so if we want to update our friend this
will actually be a put request we're
gonna actually pass some information
over so we need headers
we're going to send over the application
JSON content type and then we're also
going to need some data so we're going
to need to put over a request body which
will be just our friend that's been json
stringify so there we go our fetch
requests got a little bit more
complicated we are going to send a put
request to friend plus ID and we're
going to send over our friend's
information and then we're also going to
send over the content type that should
be just fine
and when that's done we're gonna say hey
we're no longer attending our friend so
we're no longer editing any friends one
more thing we're going to need down here
is we're going to need an edit button
let's go ahead and make an edit button
and there's no need to create a method
and call a method we're just gonna go
edit friend equals this or friend ID so
we're just going to really quickly just
run some logic right there in that
button when you click on it edit friend
equals friend ID let's check to make
sure that works
edit yep that goes into edit mode and
that switches that it mode out nice
let's go change it to will
I am save it uh-oh ID is not defined
let's go check that out I know what I
did wrong there there's no such thing as
ID here I need to call it friend dot ID
because I'm actually passing in the
entire friend object there we should be
good now let's check it out edit save it
and it looks like it worked let's
refresh and see if it worked
it worked excellent so we can now delete
friends we can edit friends that all we
need to do is learn how to create
friends before I do that it's getting a
little annoying to have to click this
button I want to be able to do a key
press that button click is so circa 2005
so let's go ahead say V on key up and
you can automatically do dot 13 here
which is super awesome so key press 13
is obviously the enter key so whenever
the enter key gets it update friend and
now I can simply hit enter when I'm
updating friends much much nicer so
that's really easy view just makes
things simple it just makes them fast
little things like this dot 13 make it
really easy to just get your job done
and get home early in the day so all we
need to do now is just make the ability
to create a friend we simply would do a
post request instead of a put request to
that exact same endpoint but I'll leave
that out of here cuz that's just
information you don't need at this point
have fun that's your homework add in
here the ability to create a friend
yourself and that's how easy it is to
work with dynamic data in view</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
