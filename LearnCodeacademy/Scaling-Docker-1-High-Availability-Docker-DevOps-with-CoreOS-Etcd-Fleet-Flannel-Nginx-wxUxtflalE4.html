here because we're going to be moving
beyond basic docker of how to create a
container how to create an image and run
a container and we're going to be
talking about high availability and
really scaling a production app with
docker and that involves several new
pieces of technology but it's really
it's pretty simple it's a lot of fun it
takes a while to really wrap your head
around it but once you do wrap your head
around it it's pretty simple and a lot
of fun so here's what we're going to be
building and I'll give you this link and
I'll give you a link to the gist where I
have all the code that I'm going to be
using here as well which is pretty much
copy and paste code but we're going to
be creating a core OS cluster so core OS
is our operating system that we're going
to use instead of say a bun to Linux
core OS is Linux and we're going to run
four core OS machines that are going to
cluster together and kind of act like
one machine in a lot of ways now we're
going to start running docker containers
on this cluster so we're going to run
web app one and that'll get assigned to
a machine and we're going to run a copy
of that web app - that'll get assigned
to another machine and then we're going
to say run nginx to load balance between
the two and then we'll maybe even run a
second nginx so that way in case this
one fails over we've got a second nginx
that automatically load balances between
the two so multiple levels of failover
here and then just to make it really
cool we're going to put a public-facing
nginx proxy in front of them that
automatically creates subdomains for
these services so say we want to be
accessed able to access this at some app
dot my website com
well these app this nginx instance will
automatically register that a subdomain
needs to be created to load balance
between those two copies of nginx if I
haven't confused you already you're in
for a great time here's those links and
let's go and get into it first part
which we're going to cover in this video
is what is a core OS cluster and how do
I start this thing up so we're going to
do it with digitalocean it's very simple
here's pretty much a visual of what core
OS is so again it's a Linux operating
system it basically boots up to docker
doesn't really run a lot of services on
the other big thing that they did so
imagine all these blue boxes are
capacity to run docker containers
and then the other thing they did is
they took the configuration part out of
the operating system so that et Cie
folder that Etsy folder really doesn't
exist instead there's a service called a
service called Etsy D that they all
share and so instead of looking for all
the configuration it looks to the Etsy D
service they're all going to look to the
exact same service on all your
configuration for all your apps and
everything lives in here instead so
whether you run a copy of web 1 here
here here or here it knows how to look
to Etsy D and find out where all the
databases are that it should talk to so
that's very cool it also means that your
configuration for each computer is
really really light
here's a cloud config yeah Mel this is
all you need to create a core OS machine
as a cloud config yeah Mel and this is
as complicated as it gets
really the minimum you need is you need
to tell it how to access at CD which is
this chunk right here and then we're
also going to be running a few other
services we're going to be running at CD
when it starts we're going to be running
fleet when it starts which is what we're
going to use to schedule out all of our
docker containers and we'll get into
that later and we're also going to be
running flannel which is what helps
docker containers docker containers
discover each other and talk to each
other so let's go and get started to get
started you basically you need your
cloud config file and you can copy and
paste this one this is the one in the
gist the only thing you need to do is
change this discovery URL to be your
discovery URL and by your you just copy
this URL right here and this will
generate one and so I'm going to go
ahead and do this and it's going to be
size equal three and you see every time
i refresh it creates a new URL for me so
I'm just going to snatch that URL I'm
going to paste it in and now here's my
cloud config file so every core OS
machine I create gets this cloud config
file I'm going to go to digitalocean
which is a very easy way to do this I'm
going to create my first droplet call it
core OS one pick core OS it's going to
be let's pick the stable version you
want to enable private networking
because these things these guy
you need to be able to talk to each
other you're going to click on user data
and you're going to paste in that cloud
config and it's very important that you
have this comment right here
there we go that's all I need I'm going
to give it one of my SSH keys so I can
SSH in and it's booting up core OS
machine 1 now let's go ahead and create
core OS 2 now if you haven't used
digital ocean before I it's really my
favorite cloud provider I'll put a link
for $10 of free
I guess credits that you can do these
referral things with digitalocean where
you get you can give away $10 a free
credit if you use that I get $25 a free
credit but no worries you don't have to
use it nope make sure I spell it right I
have plenty of credit as it is right now
so so here's a third core OS machine and
we'll run a fourth one and then be done
so I'm starting up 4 machines right now
they'll take a roughly a minute to start
core OS 4 pick stable give it the cloud
config give it my SSH key and we're good
okay so these are all creating right now
and so now remember this discover URL I
generated the one that's in my cloud
config I can copy that out and I can
actually look at this and you'll see
that now machines are starting to show
up they're starting to register
themselves to the cluster I'm going to
keep refreshing here real quick I should
see a second and a third appear here
soon you also notice that this is a
private IP address this is an in-house
digitalocean private IP address so even
if someone were to somehow maliciously
access this URL here they can't really
do anything malicious with it because
they don't have access to these IP
addresses only your core OS clusters can
do this only your core OS nodes can do
this on your digital ocean machine so I
should see three of these register but
not the fourth and that's because when I
generated my discovery token here I gave
it a size equals three which means the
first three that register are all going
to run at seedy anyone's after
that are not going to actually run at CD
they're going to reference the existing
at CD and the reason is is it's like a
clustering we don't need a hundred
machines running sed for failover we
really only need three to five machines
running sed for failover and you do
always want that to be a an odd number
three five seven and you really don't
need more than three five seven nine
most of the time so here's kind of
here's the two ways you'll go about
running core OS in production you'll
either run this way which is I'm going
to run say five note a 5 node cluster
and all five are going to run at CD and
they're also going to so they're going
to be running at CD for failover so if
this machine goes down at CD still has
all of its existing you know information
and then also all five of these machines
are going to run my docker applications
so that's kind of your smaller way of
doing it in production your bigger way
of doing it in production is to run five
dedicated Etsy D machines in your
cluster and then all the other ones in
your cluster do not run at CD at all
they are just your workers and so really
your procedure for spinning this up is
about the same as what we just did your
cloud config just looks slightly
different for this guy it says only run
at CD and your cloud config for these
guys says we're not going to run at CD
we're just going to you know talk to it
so that's basically all you need to know
about Ed CD core OS they're running
right now I've got three copies of ed CD
going and now I can SSH into any one of
these machines let's go ahead check it
out
I'm going to go SSH core at cores the
default user that digitalocean uses I
gave it my SSH key if you remember when
I created the machines I gave it one of
my SSH keys so I can automatically SSH
in any box and then I have docker
running so I can do docker PS nothing's
running and then I can also look at Etsy
Det CD let CD control I can list that I
can see all the keys so right now
there's just kind of some configuration
information that they're all sharing
right now this will look identical
on any one of my four machines then I
also have access to Fleet if you
remember in my cloud config I told it we
also want to run fleet and flannel so I
can also run fleet control list machines
and there you go I see all four machines
not just the three that are running at
CD so all four of these machines are
wired up to Fleet and I can now use
Fleet to run services let's get into
that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
