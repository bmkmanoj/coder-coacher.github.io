weightier issues of JavaScript here now
that you kind of know about the
first-class functions and why code looks
the way it does a venture of an
environment these are all kind of things
that are created because of the
event-driven environment and so let's go
ahead and look into what closures are in
this video this is a very misunderstood
and and oftentimes perceived as very
complex thing to JavaScript that really
isn't that complex of an idea if you
think about it from the right
perspective let's look at it from an
event driven environment perspective so
here we go on document ready function we
want to alert a I'm going to go ver a
equals one so this function runs when
the document is ready sets up this
listener and this is going to be the
only guy running when the button is
clicked the problem is is this function
already ran created a and it's done the
function is finished but we don't want a
to disappear because this function has
to access it in order to alert it
JavaScript to notice is this it notices
that there's what's called a reference
to something that is in a different
scope and so it keeps it keeps this
variable a alive the textbook definition
of a closure is something that retains
state and scope after it executes so
after this function executes it's going
to remember the state ie it's going to
remember that variable a exists and that
variable a equals one and scope which
we'll get into in the next one because
that's a video all on its own but it's
going to remember that this exists so
anytime later on this function that
references a has access to it and so
let's go ahead and see if this works
here I'm going to add save every time I
click it it's able to alert one and it's
also able to modify it I can go a plus
plus which if you're new is a fancy way
of saying a equals a plus one so now it
should alert to yep so now a exists
it's been modified a now equals two if I
click it again it's going to change a to
three and it's going to alert it again
so this a is in a closure this whole
function ran but then all the variables
of the function are saved off in memory
land and they're accessible by this guy
as long as I exist so as long as this
event listener for button exists a is
stored in JavaScript memory
it's a closure that JavaScript will not
let go of as long as there is a
reference to a so this is also where the
JavaScript is really good at taking care
of memory and the garbage collection
cleaning it up but this is kind of your
first introduction to what a memory leak
is a memory leak is when you have maybe
say a lot of variables in memory that
you don't need anymore
let's say this button is gone we don't
need this button click event to happen
anymore then we're actually going to
want to go button off click that's going
to unbind it that listener is gone
there's no more no longer a reference
this function is gone it's removed
there's no longer a reference to a and
so JavaScript will garbage collect this
entire function this whole area here all
the variables everything can now get
trashed the memory can be freed up
because JavaScript is smart enough to
know that it's not necessary anymore
there's no more code listening to it it
can be garbage collected and unless you
do that I mean it's really not a big
deal in most applications unless you get
to really huge JavaScript applications
because honestly remembering that a
equals one is nothing you can do that a
thousand times over and chrome does not
care your browser is not going to get
bogged down by a thousand tiny little
variables but that is what it means
that's what a closure is a function ran
the function executed it's done
executing it's not ever going to execute
again and then it's going to remember
that there are references to certain
variables so it will keep those
variables alive in a memory place that
is called a closure if that makes sense
that's what a closure is and let's get
on now to scope and context</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
