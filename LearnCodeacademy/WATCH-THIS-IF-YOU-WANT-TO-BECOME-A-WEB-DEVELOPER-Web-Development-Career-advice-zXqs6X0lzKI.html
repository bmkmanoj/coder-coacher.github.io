to title this video yet but as far as
I'm concerned now the title is what I
wish someone told me when I started web
development
I have people asking me all the time hey
I want to start web development what do
i do what do I learn and at what point
are employers going to say man I want to
hire this guy and so I'm like oh you
found the right video if that's you
you've got to watch this video because
I'm going to shortcut years off your
learning experience and I'm going to
tell you stuff that a lot of developers
don't like to tell people because they
like to keep it a secret because it
makes them feel like they'll be easier
to hire if nobody else knows this stuff
but I don't think that way I'm just
going to tell you everything so if
you're wanting to learn web development
I'm going to tell you this is it I'm
going to dump it all out into this video
so track with me I've got a cago mind
map here that hopefully will make it
easier to understand and I'll show you
what to learn and what order to learn it
in and what course to take to actually
be ready for a job description that
someone is trying to find today looking
to hire no matter what you do if you're
going to go into web development you
gotta learn basic front end that's HTML
CSS JavaScript this is your first step
get comfortable in the basics of all
three of these and here's the reason why
is because no matter what browser you're
using if you're using Internet Explorer
Firefox Chrome iPhone iPad
you know Android it's running these
three languages in the browser its
opening up an HTML page with CSS styles
and JavaScript functionality everything
runs this these are the three browser
languages it used to be flash was on
this list but thank God flash is dying
out just don't learn flash don't put it
on your resume it doesn't help it
doesn't really you know maybe there's a
flash developer out there that's going
to get mad at me for saying that but
it's it's basically a dead technology
basic front-end learn it learn HTML
that's easy you learn it in a couple
days
CSS you don't have to become a CSS ninja
just just learn how to do a basic layout
on your own be comfortable with it
javascript you don't have to do a whole
bunch of crazy stuff but learn the
concepts of how JavaScript talks to a
server
which if you're if you're starting off
learn jQuery and learn jQuery AJAX
jQuery AJAX command that and then you're
done I mean if you want to go back and
that's about all you need to learn at
first just learn how to how to hit a web
service get some information and spit it
out on a page basic front-end that's
your first thing to learn and then no
matter which route you take I'll go into
this next no matter which route you take
you want to learn a few things basic
terminal usage a lot of people avoid the
command line or the terminal because it
terrifies them to just see a black
screen with a prompt it's not scary it's
just scary because you don't know which
five commands to use you're going to be
locked into this realm of basic
front-end until you learn how to use the
terminal no matter which route you take
so you've got to learn it and then the
next step is learned github I got a
video on these two basic level for this
I'll put it in the description and you
know I also have a blog post that I will
put the link to in the description that
kinda is going to recap all this give
you a link to this mind map because
you're going to forget it probably then
I also strongly encourage you to to look
into team treehouse because they have
lessons to learn most of these things
and the first 15 days I have a link on
the blog post for getting the first 15
days for free video lessons and after
that it's only like 20 dollars a month a
lot of people I talked to use treehouse
and they are learning the web stuff fast
they're really really good lessons on
treehouse so check out that link no
matter what you do get 15 days for free
and so back to this you want to learn
basic terminal and github you want to
learn about web services slash they're
also called api's specifically they can
be called restful web services you don't
have to learn how to make them but you
want to kind of learn what these things
are basically what a web service is is
it's how the browser talks to a server
real time and gets information it's how
a server talks to another server and
gets information to send to the browser
that kind of thing just kind of be
comfortable with the concept of what a
web service is if you're doing jQuery
AJAX
then you'll basically be using web
services I'll leave it at that because
we'll get into it later okay
that's off to hable for now and now
you've got two choices you've learned
basic front-end you know how to use the
command line and github I'm ready to
become like a full-on developer that
people are hiring for people are hiring
front-end developers and they're hiring
back in developers and people are hiring
people that know both but you want to
pick one or the other and then you can
get a job and so to kind of before I
straight what those are let's say how
does the internet work real quick just
so you guys can understand what those
two roles are we got these three things
we got the client also called the
front-end and what that is is that's
your web browser that's chrome that's
your iPhone that's whatever and how the
internet works is you say give me
twitter.com and so the clients the
browser sends off Twitter comm and it
pulls up the twitter.com server and the
server says ok they pulled up Twitter
what do we do well we give them the
homepage by default what's the homepage
have on it it has the top hundred most
popular tweets ok so then it talks to
the database which is where all this
information stored it says give me the
top most you know top most recent tweets
or whatever that comes back to the
server the server puts it together in
HTML
spits it back out to the client in the
front end that makes it look all
beautiful with their CSS and JavaScript
and then you know the client does some
smarter things as you scroll down and
you're running out of tweets it's it
real-time talks to the server says ok I
need 10 more tweets okay let's get 10
more let's send it back out to the
JavaScript and so that's kind of your
two worlds you got your client which is
called front-end your server which is
called back-end and you kind of it used
to be these were the only developers
because if you think like 10 years ago
for the internet the front-end was ugly
it was just information and links and it
was this basic front end was front end
that's all there was but that is not the
case anymore things have to be slick and
smart and they have to have cool user
experiences and fun user experiences you
have to know where the mouse is on the
page and do specific things based off of
what the users doing you have to let
them log in and load up their profile
without reloading a new pay
I mean that's basically front-end
developer so if you're passionate about
all that stuff go front end you can
always learn back end and add back in
into it later and vice versa if you like
data and you like budgeting and finances
and you like organization and stuff like
that you're not as much of you might not
call yourself as much the the raw
creative type who has to be into indie
music that nobody's heard of you might
want to go back in at first I'm not
going to stereotype the two but either
way if you like development you'll like
them both so that's kind of that's kind
of might help you decide what to take so
I'm going to get rid of you you're gone
don't need you anymore let's say you've
chosen to go front-end developer don't
get overwhelmed there's not much on this
it just looks complicated this is if you
learn these things you are ripe and
ready to go get a job as a front-end
developer and people are going to want
to hire you so the first thing you want
to do is you want to learn a JavaScript
framework technically an MV MVC or M V
whatever MV star JavaScript framework
there's about 30 of them out there
but I'll tell you what people are hiring
mostly backbone.js developers and
angularjs developers right now used to
be backbone is like the main one and
then there's a decent bit of knockout
but the majority Jobs backbone or
angular is what they're looking for and
here's kind of why is is when you start
writing thousands and thousands of lines
of JavaScript to make this whole
application that does your whole thing
without ever navigating to another page
you need a framework that helps you
organize that code in a way that makes
sense is not complicated and just works
without breaking if the user does some
random thing so that's where these
frameworks come in they're JavaScript
they're all JavaScript but they kind of
have their own dynamic to them like kind
of their own language and their way of
doing things if I was to pick one to
learn I pick angular I honestly think
angular's backbone is barely ahead in
terms of how many jobs are out there
right now
but there's a lot of jobs a lot of
people looking for angular developers
now it's almost even and in the next
couple years I think angular is just
going to be more popular Google makes
angular it's kind of one of the big
reasons but seriously if you learn one
of these well people are looking
for backbone.js developer that's an
actual job title angularjs developer
learn one of these learn how to make a
single page web app with these things
and then if you want to learn both it'll
just make you available for more jobs
and then whichever one you learn I put
knockout on there because it's it's kind
of popular it's enough to be mentioned
and there's a bunch of other ones that
that are out there that sure they're
great to learn ember and other stuff but
hey you're learning pick one of these
two unit testing whatever you do learn
how to write tests for your application
in your framework it's going to look
different for angular and it's going to
look different for backbone this is kind
of like phase two you can get a job
without knowing unit testing it'll just
kind of show that you're a true pro if
you know how to write tests for your
application and I'll leave it at that
this is not a video where I'm going to
get into what that is so that's the but
that's going to be the toughest part
right there learn a JavaScript framework
and learn jQuery you gotta know jQuery
but that's not really a framework that
just kind of kind of falls into basic
front-end you got to learn from there a
CSS tool these are really easy these
aren't languages they're tools
sass less stylus basically you're
writing CSS for all intensive purposes
but you can do some cool stuff like
create variables and and have it reuse
certain parts of your code so you don't
have to write it for everything not
going to go into it it's pretty easy to
learn it in a few days sass is the one
to learn less is almost identical for
all intents and purposes it's almost the
exact same thing and then you want to
learn a CSS framework which is bootstrap
or foundation or pretty much the two
most popular bootstrap I have a video
out for that I'll throw it in the
description what these lets you do is
these let you write with very little
code a responsive web app like a web app
that just looks cool looks clean they
give you a lot of built in CSS rules to
help you build widgets and build page
layouts so you're not having to hand
code all this and that also sets you up
to where you can build it until the next
developer hey I did this with bootstrap
and they know how to go find information
from bootstrap on how and why you did
what you did
and that kind of falls under responsive
design you need to know what this is and
how to do it responsive design is I
don't know if you've seen all the new
web pages now if you resize your browser
the layout of the page changes to fit
the size of screen you have so if you
pull it up on an iPad the page looks
different and if you have a small
browser window it looks different images
are smaller or bigger that's called
responsive design you got to know that
now it's not it's not super complicated
you can really learn it in a couple
weeks and bootstrap and foundation are
both responsive frameworks so if you
learn them you're kind of learning
responsive design so that's a tool
that's not really so much a language and
then front-end build tools these are
just little tools that you got to learn
so remember how I mentioned if you're
building a whole JavaScript application
you're going to have thousands of lines
of code sometimes and you don't want
them all in one file that's a disaster
so you got to split them up into a bunch
of different JavaScript files maybe one
for your header one for your footer one
for your sidebar one for your profile
one for your tweets listing and then you
want to be able to build those together
into one compressed javascript file so
you're only sending your browser one
file instead of 20 or 100 files and so
that's kind of where your build tool
runs in these all run on the command
line which is why you got to learn the
command line and that's going to run
either grunt or gulp grunt is basically
the popular Big Dawg that's been out for
years
everybody everybody uses grunt gulp is
the new guy that's I think a lot easier
to use and it's basically a replacement
for grunt learn grunt first take a look
at gulp basically what this is going to
do is you get a bunch of grunt will
listen and as you save a javascript file
it'll then compress all the JavaScript
files together and spit it out and
reload your web page real time so that's
kind of what grunt does as you save your
sass file it'll process it and turn it
into a CSS file that's kind of what
grunt does and then yeoman IO yeoman
uses grunt and that's just kind of a fun
thing look into that Bower is package
management package management is
becoming a really big deal you don't
want to have to give people a jQuery 5
and a backbone.js file you just want to
say hey download the project the project
has a package file that says you'll need
jQuery backbone all that you got to
learn basically the package management
means and so instead of putting all
those files in your project you just put
a package on it which is just usually
three lines of code that says when you
run install get backbone get jQuery gets
ass get grunt get all these things and
then your projects ready to go on your
machine so got to kind of learn about
Bower and package management and then
browserify and requirejs learn how to
use one or the other of these ideally
both require J's has been the popular
guy for a while but browserify is I
think a lot better and a lot of people
are going to be using this guy in the
future and already are I'll leave that
for now so that's front-end developer
hopefully I didn't freak you out so far
but if you want to go front-end
developer route this is stuff that I so
wish somebody had told me years ago I
had to figure this out over the course
of time let's say you're not that you
want to go back in developer woohoo back
in developer I want to do that I want to
be that server guy that works with
databases here's basically a back-end
server is going to be running one of
these technologies it's going to be
running Ruby on Rails nodejs which is
JavaScript a lot of guys like that a lot
of guys don't like that PHP Python which
Python usually runs django dotnet which
is going to be the c-sharp language and
you'll be writing unit tests for
whatever technology you pick if you're
looking for jobs out there there's a ton
of Ruby on Rails jobs absolute ton of
Ruby on Rails jobs a growing number of
node.js jobs because it's really cool to
be able to write JavaScript on the front
end and JavaScript on the back end
I love node node is my favorite because
I started out as a front-end developer
node is super cool a lot of PHP jobs
they don't tend to pay as well because
it's a lot more people know PHP and it
tends to not be as used for super
high-level super large sites something
they're going to hate me for saying that
but if you're looking for jobs and
you're saying hey just tell me which one
to pick I'd say go Ruby on Rails go Ruby
on Rails nodejs if you already know
JavaScript and you like JavaScript a lot
I'd say pick one of these to learn some
PHP learn WordPress learn Symphony or
you know there's a lot of PHP has a ton
of frameworks out there for it Ruby on
Rails is the framework and nodejs is
going to be writing javascript and
you'll be writing it with express dot
j/s I actually have a video for getting
started on Express j/s it's not really
for super beginners it's kind of for
back-end developers already but I'll put
that in the description once you pick
your back-end technology you're going to
want to learn how to wire that up I'm
going to move this out of the way you're
going to want to learn how to wire that
up into different databases so say you
picked a Ruby on Rails yippee I want to
be a Ruby on Rails developer learn how a
Ruby on Rails talks to a my sequel
database once you've learned that learn
how it talks to a MongoDB database it's
probably not going to be a world of
difference there you're getting
information or you're saving information
to the database then learn how it's
saved stuff to a Redis database those
are kind of the big three to learn right
now there's probably 10 or 20 you don't
have to learn them all just get
comfortable with more than one and get
over the fear of of working with a
database that's kind of you know you
want to learn how to talk to a database
and then you want to learn some other
things is how do I build a restful
service now how do I build an API so
JavaScript can talk to me and say give
me 10 tweets and I'm going to build an
API a web service that JavaScript can
talk to that will help them retrieve
tweets through the database through my
service learn how to build services
usually any tutorial on Ruby on Rails
will teach you how to do this learn how
to do security do some googling on Ruby
on Rails security Ruby on Rails security
best practices learn what stupids
mistakes not to make with Ruby that will
leave your website vulnerable next thing
learn about OAuth 2
you ever seen those things that say hey
login with my Google account log in with
my Facebook account that's called OAuth
that is so popular right now you want to
know how someone can log into your
application with their Google account
with their Facebook account which brings
us to authorization authentication you
want to learn what those are what the
differences between the two
pretty easy straightforward learn how to
make a username password login on Ruby
and rails that's called your
authentication and then learn how to
restrict people from certain parts of
your site unless they're authenticated
unless they're logged in
that's called authorization learn how to
restrict them from getting to tweets
unless they're logged in
make sure learn how to restrict someone
from posting to someone else's Twitter
account unless they're logged in as that
person that's all authorization stuff so
learn how that works and then the last
thing on that is you want to learn
caching learn I won't go into it too
much but learn memcached learn nginx
to high level to leave for this
conversation but you want to learn some
of these caching things varnish and
squid are also good I threw those on
there if you just want to learn a ton
are you overwhelmed yet are you freaking
out there's if you look at it you don't
have to learn everything on here learn
one pick one I picked Ruby on Rails
learn how to tie it into one or more
databases learn a couple things
that's your learning curve for the next
two years go for it and then you're
going to be hired and people are going
to love you because you know the right
stuff if you're a back-end guy and
you're super loving back-end and you
want to go to a higher level look into
dev ops dev Ops is basically server
management how do I manage I have such a
big website that I have to have 20
different servers to handle all the
traffic what do people use when they're
doing that kind of stuff that's like
DevOps world that's like backends part
two I'm not going to go into that
because most you guys probably aren't
anywhere near that world but if you are
and you want to learn it there's your
list of stuff to learn your different
tools that you'll use in those arenas so
that's it I hope I didn't freak you out
and overwhelm you it's ok if you have to
watch this video for time
to not get crazy overwhelmed but if you
pick one of these tracks and learn the
technologies you're good to go
you're going to get hired you're going
to be a person that people want on their
team because these are the technologies
that people are using right now this is
what it takes to be a web developer in
2014 and hope you liked it
have an awesome day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
