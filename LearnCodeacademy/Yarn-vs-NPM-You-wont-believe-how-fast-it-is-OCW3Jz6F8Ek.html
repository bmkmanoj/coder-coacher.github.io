yarn which is a very cool new NPM
replacement if you've been doing
front-end or back-end evelopment with
nodejs then you're used to using NPM to
install all of your JavaScript packages
NPM is great but there are a few
deficiencies with it that yarn fixes and
so we're going to cover that real quick
I'm going to show you how great it is to
get started with yarn all you have to do
is npm install g yarn and then you're
good to go
yarn gets installed and it will work
with your existing package.json for lots
of projects it's just going to work out
of the box you just use yarn instead of
NPM so well that's installing real quick
there we go that's done let's go ahead
now and do an NPM install you can see I
just kind of threw a package together
and threw in some dependencies let's say
lo - ma bags my sequel react connects
Babel and web pack alright let's go
ahead do an NPM install and see how long
this takes here and I've already tested
this it takes about 25 between 20 and 30
seconds to do this NPM install which is
quite a bit of time to just get a few
JavaScript packages because it's pretty
much going through secretively and
getting them all one at a time for the
most part so there we go still going
still going still going this takes a
while there you go
still going all right that took a while
now we've got our node modules created
so let's go ahead and RMR let's rim wrap
our node modules folder and let's do
this with yarn real quick yarn install
let's see what we have here there it
goes looking up all the package
dependency trees installing everything
and boom almost boom boom that took 10
seconds much much much much faster cool
thing about yarn is it caches everything
which means if we have another project
let's say node modules is gone or a yarn
install again here this is going to be
much faster you can see the fetching was
instantaneous and now we're done in five
seconds if this was another project
using the exact same versions of some of
these packages that
packages would not have to fetch you
essentially get offline development for
everything that you've already had to
fetch before so we've established that
speed is this big plus with yarn let's
look at the next major big thing that
yarn adds for you and that's application
stability you can notice this yarn lock
file over here this is basically your
NPM shrink wrap file if you've ever
messed with NPM shrink wrap it's not a
whole lot of fun you've got to always
update it yourself sometimes you
actually have to get in there manually
and mess with it it basically locks down
your full dependency tree well because
if you don't do that then you might end
up with slightly different versions of
packages on different developer machines
or you might have a slightly different
package version on your machine and then
go to production and it doesn't work and
that can be just a lot of frustration
and so yarn automatically locks it down
all the time and it's a really clean and
easy to read format you can see that
this is the yarn lock file it's really
easy to understand let's go to reacts
react you can see there's my react
dependencies wow that's pretty nice
let's look at something more involved
let's say connects there's my connects
dependencies not too bad you can see
them all right there boom boo-boom
boo-boom and we're good to go so if you
ever want to update something let's go
ahead and look at react we're pulling
off a 0:14 there's a later version out
there so my package JSON same thing I
can go yarn upgrade react and it fetches
it very quickly as expected we're now
running react 15 for two and you can see
I'm now let's go to react I'm now
running the upgraded version of reacting
yarn lock as well so yarn lock you want
to commit to your repository to your
source control just like you would with
your package JSON and now any other
environment pulls this and doesn't
install they're going to get the exact
same versions that they're supposed to
get so between these two features it's a
really big addition a lot of cool stuff
there's a little bit of a difference in
the way you'll type the commands instead
of NPM install you'll do yarn add a lot
of CL eyes are using add instead of
install these days because it's a lot
easier
two types Oh yarn AdView go ahead add
view there we go that's added you can
see it's added right there and let's say
we want to add something else to a dev
dependency our nad D jQuery so now it's
going to add as a dev dependency there
we go J queries in our dev dependencies
so that's pretty similar and then you
could also do yarn starts just like NPM
starts so for the most part all the
commands are the same yarn remove jQuery
take jQuery way there we go and that's
pretty much it so I hope you found this
video helpful yarn has definitely been a
great addition to my team and I hope it
helps you out in your day to day
