learning Java scripts and the reason is
simple because JavaScript rocks it's
arguably the most popular language
around today and it's running in pretty
much every web browser so if you're
using your iPhone to view a website or
your iPad or your Android or Chrome or a
super old version of Internet Explorer
it's pretty much going to be running
JavaScript and what it does and
JavaScript basically adds function to
your website to your HTML and CSS so say
I want to keep track of how many times
this button has been clicked two times
three times four times that's JavaScript
or say I want to click this and it shows
some super-secret hidden content that's
also JavaScript or say I'm working on a
form and I want it to do something
my name is will hey wills a great name
well thank you
this computer's brilliant that's all
JavaScript so we're going to get into
kind of the basics of JavaScript and the
good news is his javascript is a
programming language so once you learn
it you've actually learned some computer
programming so before we add it to our
actual web page let's kind of start off
with some programming basics and
JavaScript so what I want you to do is
get google chrome download and install
it if you're gonna be a web developer
it's a really good browser to use and go
view developer JavaScript console the
shortcut key for this on Mac is command
option J or on Windows it's ctrl shift J
and that's gonna bring up your console
here and what the console does is it
allows me to code directly into my web
page now none of this gets saved onto my
web page it's just kind of happening
real time and it's the best way to learn
and to play around with code so you can
see I can type one here and it says one
I could type one plus two
hey I kind of got a calculator going on
three plus 354 357 so the first thing
that we need to learn with programming
is you need to learn what a variable is
now it's a big word but variable
basically means we're creating a
container that's going to store a value
for later on so remember in algebra when
you'd say like x equals 1 so what's X
plus 1 well that's 2
well if x equals two what's X plus one
well that's three basically of variables
that we're giving a number a name and
how you do that in JavaScript is you use
the letters var for variable so I could
say ver x equals one so now every time I
type X it's gonna say well that's one so
X plus two well that equals three
because that's as far as JavaScript is
concerned there's no difference between
saying X plus two and saying one plus
two because we said X equals one so I
could go there x equals one there y
equals two and I could say X plus y and
that equals three so now it probably
feels like you're in your math class and
for those of you guys who hated math
you're like no this is gonna be terrible
I promise this is not about math so
maybe a better example is let's say
their name equals will and you can use
single or double quotes for this but if
you're going to use letters you have to
use quotes like I said you can use
double quotes if you want so now
whenever I say name it's gonna spit out
will so now I can do alert and then I
can open up and I can say name and I can
close out my parenthesis and I hit enter
and it's gonna say will so I could also
say alerts and I could just do some
quotes right now hi will and then hit
enter so it says hi will alerts kind of
a cool function that does this little
alert window this will work in pretty
much any browser so that's kind of what
a variable is now there's some types of
variables types that's a very important
word to remember javascript has about
seven types to it and most most every
computer language has a lot of the same
types at the very beginning you'll
notice that you remember I did a number
there x equals three that's a number
type so I can do math with that I can do
X plus three and it's going to know that
this is the actual number three now if I
do that with quotes equals
three zero then that does not know that
it's the number 30 anymore I actually
whenever you use quotes it becomes a
string type and string means that all
these different digits are strung
together so it just knows that this is
the number three followed by the number
zero it doesn't know that it's the
number thirty so if I say X plus 10 well
now it's just three zero one zero
javascript is smart enough to not give
you an error it's just gonna say you
just added a number in a string let's
just lump it together into one big
string so if I say ver y equals 30
without quotes now Y is the number 30 so
y plus 10 is going to be 40 so that's
your string type and that's your number
type I'm going to teach you one more
command and you're free to create a
basic program for yourself that command
is prompt I do prompt I open and close
my parentheses and hit enter and that's
going to open up this window here so now
I can say will and it's going to return
will so I could go that really didn't do
anything yet so I like to go there name
equals prompt and then I can go will and
so now if I ever say name name is stored
as will so I could go very name equals
prompt and now if I hit a semicolon I
can add a second command alerts name so
there we go
I'm gonna go will it's gonna say okay
and then it alerted will awesome so let
me go one more thing let's make this a
little bit more their name equals prompt
their last name equals prompt alert name
plus let me do a comma plus last name
there we go so let's go we'll stir and
then it's gonna say will comma stern
alright probably would have made more
sense to do a space except for that
prompt isn't helping me out because it's
not
telling me what to do it just gives me
this little thing so you can actually
enter a prompt message in here what's
your first name there you go and now it
asks me what is your first name I'm
gonna say my first name is will so let's
fix this little program I've written
here their name equals what what is your
first name and I'm getting quite a long
line here but that's okay what is your
last name and you see a looped around
here and then I'm actually going to turn
that into a space so it loops around it
what is your first name we'll what is
your last name
we'll Stern so there you go and now you
can write your first basic JavaScript
computer program and if you were to do
some homework before going on to the
next lesson
I'd say create a prompt and alert based
program that asks for some user
information and then spits out a
combination of that information just
like I did here I alerted a name plus a
last name or maybe make an addition
program where you say you know give me
one number give me another number and
say the sum of those two numbers is blah
blah blah
that's your first homework assignment
and let's get into the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
