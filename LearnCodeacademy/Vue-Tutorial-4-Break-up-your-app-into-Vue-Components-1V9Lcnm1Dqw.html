components to break up our application
into logical components that can also be
reused throughout our application so in
this case we're looking at this friend's
logic here it really doesn't deserve to
be on the application level the very top
application level this really can be
broken out into a separate friends
module or in this case view would call
it a separate friends component so let's
go up here and ideally this would be in
a different file but we can go view
component and we can define a new
component in this case we'll just call
it friend and then it can get an object
which is realistically almost identical
to this view application object that
we're creating here it can have a
template let's give it a template it can
have its own filters and its own methods
so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go
ahead and take these filters out of here
and I'm gonna put them up into our
friend components since they really this
is logic that has to do only with our
friend our friend component and same
with these methods there so actually I
can completely remove those altogether
and I can also remove all of this this
is stuff that has to do with a single
friend so all this information in the
template here has to do with a single
friend I'm going to do a single div here
and then add all of that information
wrapped inside of that single div so
that is our friend component now all we
have to do is instead of rendering an h2
for each friend we can render a friend
and this name comes from the component
name so when you register a component by
name we can then spit that component out
on any page as an HTML tag so then for
each friend in our list we are going to
spit out a friend now this will not work
and the reason this will not work is
this because it's not receiving any data
if I look here my console you can see we
have no prop
friend nothing's defined here so we have
to say I'm going to expect some data to
be passed in here and this is called
props I'm going to get a friend object
because as you can see in here we're
expecting friend age friend full name
basically we're expecting an object
called friend and then we can V bind
this friend and it gets the value a
friend so we're essentially saying take
this item here called friend and let's
pass it in and we will call it friend in
our component so there we go that's
coming in and now everything should work
it would work if I had a comma right
there there we go you can see everything
works and everything
upgrades we can change that to Bob
change that to Johnny and now
everything's completely abstracted this
friend could be in a completely
different file out there and our
application would now look like this
we have our main level application with
our main level data only and then we're
gonna spit out child components that get
the data that relates to them passed
down in and that's kind of the basis for
how you would build an application in
View you create a bunch of components
register them all and then you can
inject them as if they were HTML
elements so it's extremely simple to
work with view components and just to
make completely certain where these
names are coming from I'm gonna call
this friend components and now it
actually changed this to friend
components so that's that name there and
if we were to call this V item in
friends then we would pass item in and
we're binding that as if the component
the component receives the value of item
and the component receives that as the
value called friend if that makes sense
so this will still work everything is
still good and so that's kind of where
all those names are getting related to
so that's how you use components to
break up your view j/s application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
