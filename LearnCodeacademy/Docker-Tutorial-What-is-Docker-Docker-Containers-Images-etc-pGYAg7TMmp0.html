series demystifying docker I'm doing it
because I've had so many conversations
with other developers people I meet at
conferences where the people will say
I'm really excited about docker because
everybody keeps saying docker is awesome
but I can't seem to wrap my head around
it and I can't seem to find any
resources online that help me actually
get started with docker and understand
you know what it's actually good for so
we're going to kind of cover that we're
going to start off with a high-level
overview what is docker then we're going
to show you with really quick just a few
lines of code how you can deploy
applications and then some kind of
various thoughts on it along the way so
let's get into it
demystifying docker first thing we're
going to do is we're going to compare
docker to vagrant or docker to a virtual
machine since this seems to be the
hang-up that I keep hearing from people
okay so I get vagrant but I don't get
docker well that's because they're
really different here's kind of three
visual people a visual demonstration
what vagrant is I'm going to kind of
show you real quickly vagrant for those
you guys who aren't familiar with it and
I'm going to show you how it's not
really a fair comparison
so vagrant is the goal is to solve the
problem of it works on my machine it
doesn't work on production or it works
on my machine it doesn't work on this
other developers machine that happens
because somewhere along the road you
might be on a different operating system
say your machine is a Mac or Windows
machine and you're pushing it out to a
Linux you know server that alone could
cause problems you might be running WAMP
or MAMP on your computer if it's a PHP
application and these guys are actually
running a full you know just native
installation of an Apache stack or you
have a different toolset that you're
using then another developer at any rate
your environments are not the same so we
solve that by spinning up a virtual
machine in our computer that's the exact
same thing we're going to be pushing to
staging or production so we'll use
VirtualBox and vagrant to spin up let's
say in a bun to 1404 machine which is
exactly what we're using in staging and
production so here that that is it's an
empty machine and then you run your
provisioning script against your virtual
machine exactly as you would against
staging or production so the
provisioning
it will install the correct version of
nodejs or rails or PHP it'll set up all
the user permissions it'll it'll install
any other software configure anything
that needs to be configured so at the
end of the day these are basically the
same environment so now I know that if I
dump my project code into here and run
it in this machine and it works it's
pretty much going to work when I push it
out to github and these servers pull it
or I push it however you do your
deployments when the code gets dumped
into these it's going to run the same
so that's vagrant in a nutshell
different boxes we dump our code into
each box let's look at docker and see
why docker is actually different
so for docker we've got our machine and
we've got our project's code and docker
runs off of containers so I use my
docker file which is usually five to
maybe thirty line fired file docker
files are really small the docker file
builds what's called a docker image that
docker image contains all my project
code it contains you know say an
installation of nodejs if it's a node.js
app it contains any installments of
programs that I need and so it's
basically my complete application
wrapped up in an image now it's not a
full say a bun to machine because I
don't need that this image is designed
to sit on top of a machine so from that
image I can then run as many containers
as I want until I run out of processing
power and RAM on my machine so this is
the virtual machine on my Mac again and
I have my docker image on the machine
and then I can run that docker image and
it runs as a container and I can run
many many containers in the machine once
again till I run out of stuff so this
image is my project go so instead of on
vagrant where I put my project code into
environments with docker you're going to
actually build your environment and now
I can run that environment anywhere if a
machine has docker on it my container is
going to run and it's going to work so
then you push that docker image up to
say docker hub or quad io which are kind
of like the github
of docker images and there's a bunch out
there you can have your own private
repository the image goes out there
that's like your github repository so to
speak and now any other machine can run
your image so let's say I called this
image my username is will our stern
let's say I did will our stern / -
that's the name of it so now on any
computer I can say docker run will our
stern
/ - and this whole image source code and
all will run with the complete
environment I didn't install nodejs on
this machine I didn't provision this
machine at all because the image has
everything and has a complete
environment all contained into one so I
could run a nodejs image on this machine
this container then has no js' installed
and has anything else installed npm and
i can also run a rails app on the same
machine rails is installed on that
container but rails is not installed in
this container so they act like virtual
machines but the really self-contained
processes so to speak let me kind of
show you an image here that i found
somewhere online i have no idea what
this puppy dog is about but this is
basically the anatomy of a docker
container so this is your actual
webserver you've got your webserver you
have the host operating system which is
a bun - or even something lighter and it
has docker installed that's all you need
docker is installed and then all the
apps run as docker containers and they
all sit on top of your host operating
systems resources so they all sit on top
of the Linux kernel they all access the
same computer's processor and RAM and
that's basically a docker container you
build your image once push it out and
now you can run it anywhere so kind of
in a large-scale production environment
here's what that looks like I've got
this big cloud cluster of say 10
computers they're all running either
Kouros or mezzos these are kind of some
of the big players basically what these
two operating systems do is they allow
all the computers to act as one they
share all their resources
and so now all you have to do is spin up
containers and they all run within your
cluster and then if you start running
out of overall cluster memory or overall
cluster computing you just add more
nodes so let's say okay I'm just going
to add 10 more computers to this cluster
and now I can run 30 more containers so
you can just say let's once again let's
say this image is called my node app I
can run my node app 4 times boom boom
boom boom and then I can spin up an
engine X container and have it load
balanced these four and then expose a
private port out to the real world so
then the real world can access my app
this is how docker works it's it's
really awesome for cloud computing
really awesome for cluster computing and
that's where it really really starts to
shine but actually I think docker is one
of my favorite uses of docker is to just
provision a single machine and deploy
with no provisioning at all you just
spin up a machine make sure docker is
installed and then you can run your
containers on it so that's kind of your
brief overview if you're not a visual
person this is probably confusing but if
you're a visual person it probably
helped let's just get into docker show
me the code we'll do that in this next
