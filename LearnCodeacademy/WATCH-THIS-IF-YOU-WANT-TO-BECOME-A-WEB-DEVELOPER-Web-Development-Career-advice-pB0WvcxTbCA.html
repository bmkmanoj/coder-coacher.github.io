video this is a video that I did about a
year ago and it's been pretty much my
most popular video or one of my most
popular videos and so a lot of people
said hey give me some 2015 updates and
so here you go this is what you need to
learn if you are wanting to become a web
developer now in 2015 we're going to
start at the beginner level and we're
going to work our way up to intermediate
and advanced and I'm also kind of going
to give you the order that you want to
learn things and the the possible
directions that you can take in your
learning experience so let's just jump
right into it you'll notice here I'll
give you a link this is a coggle dot ID
mind map so this link will be in the
description everything that's blue has a
URL that you can click on which means
I've already got a video for it
yay which is nice so we've got at least
a lot of the basics covered and you'll
be able to see as we move along what
videos I have covered for you so if you
want to be a web developer you're going
to want to start with HTML CSS
JavaScript and what these are is these
are the languages that the browsers run
these are the three languages that are
very core to the internet because
whether you're on an iPhone Google
Chrome a super old version of Internet
Explorer your browser is going to be
running it's going to be putting
together an HTML page with CSS Styles
it's going to be adding JavaScript for
any functionality on that so these are
the kind of the first three languages
you have to learn if you're going to get
into web development and so how do you
know when you're done with basic
front-end I say when you can put
together an HTML page style it somewhat
decently do some basic JavaScript and I
add a jQuery here because that's kind of
that's kind of a basic get a lot done
without a lot of code javascript library
and so I actually have a whole series on
jQuery and I'm starting up a series
about three or four maybe five lessons
in JavaScript so far so once you've kind
of got some basic jQuery down you're
good to move on you can either go up
here to front-end or down here to
back-end regardless of which are out you
take here's some things you're going to
want to learn next in order top to
bottom you're going to want to learn how
to FTP up to a web host and set that at
web host up it's not as complicated as
it sounds I got a video kind of walking
it through the whole thing I recommend
Hostgator for that I keep some coupons
and
Geils by the way down here on several
things you want to check that out
especially if you're learning that's
kind of where I keep any coupons that I
come across you want to learn how to set
that up again not as hard as it sounds
you're going to want to learn some basic
terminal usage the command line is
terrifying to new developers because
computers we tend to think in terms of
point-and-click whereas the command line
is commands that seems scary but there's
only about 10 or 20 commands you have to
learn to get started it's just kind of
scary because we're not used to typing
out commands we're used to clicking file
open instead of typing file open it's
not that big of a deal
learn the command line you'll be really
glad you did
basic SSH is kind of the next thing so
when you're starting off with web
development you start off by FTP all
your stuff up to a server later on as
you go you're going to FTP less and less
you're going to SSH a lot more so get to
know SSH next github which is actually a
combination of git and github which is a
website it's kind of the most common
place for coders and companies to keep
their code their source code so you'll
definitely want to learn that that's
going to be on so many jobs so so so
many jobs require you to know github or
will wonder why you don't know it if
you're applying so that's the next thing
to go as you can see I've got videos for
all these which will hopefully help you
out in your learning next thing you're
going to learn how the client and server
talk to each other I got two videos on
that that really explain it in hopefully
an easy way I got some kind of basic
visuals for you and then lastly you're
going to want to learn about restful web
services this is get post put and delete
requests I kind of have a video that
provides a free service for you to learn
that with JavaScript so that's kind of
no matter which route you take you got
to learn this stuff too
and I would suggest learning this before
you pick a hardcore route or at least
make sure you learn it towards the
beginning so kind of in between basic
and wanting to end up here so let's say
you've got basic front-end down then
there's two routes for you to go up here
front-end or back-end you can learn both
but you generally have to start with one
or another at two stereotyped things if
you
you're not sure which you pick if you
like art creative graphics maybe come
from a design background you probably
feel more at home around front end if
you like data accounting finance
budgeting you know left brain side of
stuff back end will probably be a more
logical choice
although either way you'll work great in
both if you can do one you can totally
do the other and so that just might give
you an idea of what to try out or take a
day trying out both and see which feels
more natural to you so don't let this
don't you don't let this terrify you
this is kind of the entire skill set of
a front-end developer these days and
honestly some of these are a list of
things you don't have to pick them all
so don't get terrified if you if you
feel like you learned a ton and then
just now got onto this branch you want
to be a front-end developer here's the
order that you're going to want to go
the first thing you're going to do is
learn about some CSS tools pre compilers
sass lesson styles this hasn't really
changed over the last year these are
kind of still the big guys and I think
these are the order probably of
popularity and all these are going to do
is these are going to allow you to add
some more functionality to your CSS you
can create like CSS variables so you can
define defined at the very top gutter
equals 10 pixels and then from there on
out you can reference gutter and it'll
compile it out to normal CSS it's not
very hard you can learn this and a day
or less you're going to all learn you're
going to want to learn one or more CSS
frameworks to start off we haven't
really seen a lot of change with these
over the last year bootstrap and
foundation are definitely still the most
popular CSS frameworks for building a
responsive website bourbon with need is
fun it's very light
Gumby skeleton these aren't even new
these have been around for a while
there's there's so many CSS frameworks
but still bootstrap and foundation are
kind of the big ones the ones that keep
staying popular so learn one or more of
those what those will do is these will
help you create a responsive website
very easily a responsive website is
basically the kind of website where as
you shrink your window size down it
displays it differently so maybe when
you get your window really small like
just this big it will look like a mobile
website and then as you get it bigger it
looks like a tablet website when you get
your window full
as it looks like a computer website
that's a responsive website it's
changing its layout depending on the
size of your screen and so you can do
that very easily with these frameworks
but then you're going to want to learn
how to do that by yourself as well at
least be able to kind of get by you'll
never be able to well it's going to take
forever to hand code a bootstrap or
foundation but you'll want to be able to
kind of know what's going on behind the
scenes so you can do some of your own
custom work at some point if you need to
so that's CSS not a ton going on this is
not months and months of work it's
really going to happen in a few days
except for this might be a few weeks or
a few months you know ongoing you don't
have to dedicate yourself to this
directly and ignore everything else for
a season so moving on then next up I
would actually say front-end build tools
would be next I'm going to rearrange
this okay front-end build tools is next
next thing you're gonna learn is build -
I actually have a video called why you
need a build system I can probably make
a link to this I'll see if I can link
this later and so I won't really explain
too much of what that does except for
basically build systems will do things
like compile your sass less stylist for
you they will take all your JavaScript
files and if I them all together into
one JavaScript file that the browser
loads these things really speed up your
development process and clean up your
codebase and help your website be more
efficient when a user loads it so the
top two task runners gulp is definitely
number one these days grunt is still
really big because there's a ton of
projects that were built on grunt so
these are pretty much if you're starting
to website pick gulp gulp hands down I
think the jury has spoken that gulp is
just easier for developers just like it
better dependency management is kind of
the next thing this is for JavaScript
how do files require other files to be
loaded in basic JavaScript like jQuery
work this is not necessary if you're
just using jQuery plugins lump them all
into one file who cares but once you
start getting a lot of code you're
writing an actual front-end application
in one of these frameworks down here you
have to split up your files at this
point because you
have a 2,000 line JavaScript file that's
too much so you need to break it up into
files that each do one thing well then
you need a way for those files to
require each other say I need to load
the math component before I start doing
math kind of things so browserify I
think is kind of number one on this now
requirejs was number one for a while
because it was kind of the first browser
if I came out and web pack is very
quickly growing because the
react community really likes web pack if
I had to pick one today I'd pick browser
fire web pack and honestly I can't
decide between the two at this point I
definitely wouldn't use requirejs
anymore not that it's bad still totally
fine to use but these would be my two
picks Bower package management not as
popular as it is as it used to be more
people are using NPM but Bower is still
a very legitimate tool well there's
definitely need for it in specific
situations so Bower something good to
get to know yeoman is very cool for
generating project folder structures and
generating your initial gulp file grunt
file with browserify and all that so I
have a video on yeoman that kind of
shows you more with that is it'll get
you up and started very very quickly a
very cool tool to get to know and then
you want to pick a JavaScript framework
and this is really what you'll grow and
be good at they're actually job
descriptions for angular developer react
developer backbone developer ember
developer kind of things so these are
the things where you want to find one
that seems to make a lot of sense to you
get really good at it
now I put these in order of what I would
learn I would definitely learn react
this is the most popular one today is
angular and then backbone was the most
popular a year ago but angular is now
the most popular and react is growing
very very very quickly Facebook backs
react Google backs angular and react
just has some very cool methodologies
behind it I will be doing react videos
in the future I'm working on some react
projects right now loving it it's so
different but it's different for very
good reasons definitely learn react if
you've been
scared of it or have been staying away
from it it's gonna be a very significant
player in the days to come
flux is is the methodology that you will
code react with it's not really a
framework it's it's more or less a way
of coding react so definitely looking to
flux as well if you're looking into
react like said angular backbone still
tons of backbone jobs out there because
backbone was the JavaScript framework to
use for a long time and honestly embers
hung around for a while it's been around
for a while was not popular but it's a
it's a very good framework and it is it
is grown in popularity slowly over time
it's very good for for large-scale apps
it does have its frustrations but it you
know it's not going away at least not
any time yet so just not as many jobs
out there so if you're learning I
wouldn't necessarily recommend ember is
your first pick even if you like it me
thrill and reactive or kind of cool ones
to look at I would not say learn them
first reactive is kind of the simplest
way if these are just way too confusing
for you and you cannot seem to get it to
click try looking at reactive reactive
is very simple but accomplishes quite a
bit then you're going to learn how to
unit test that framework of choice the
framework you've chosen mocha and
Jasmine are pretty much the biggest ones
out there what is there there's uh
there's there's a lot of other ones but
pretty much mocha and jasmine for
javascript or the top - I prefer mocha
no big real reason why these are very
very similar anyway if you can do one
you can definitely do the other and
karma is a test runner which is kind of
cool you don't have to learn that but
that's noteworthy so there you go that's
run a developer tons of front-end
developer jobs out there tons of demand
for front-end developer jobs they're
great great great jobs fun teams to be
on so it's a great track to take let's
say you're taking the back end track
lots of change in the backend track this
year as well so first off you're going
to want to pick a language directed uh
and there are tons of languages for
back-end oh my goodness
tons of languages for back-end these are
not in order because there's really no
right or wrong my personal favorites I
just love nodejs we're seeing a lot of
companies like Netflix PayPal Groupon
the list keeps going and going switching
from these monolithic Ruby on Rails
applications to much smaller broken-up
nodejs
applications with express or happy or
koa so nodejs is very fascinating to me
PHP has not gone anywhere PHP if you're
going to pick one I'd say pick one of
these three here Ruby on Rails nodejs
with express or PHP with laravel let's
say you're just a new learner say tell
me one to learn
I say look into these three languages
find the one that seems to make most
sense to you and go with that advantages
to PHP tons of PHP jobs you don't have
to be a rock star to get a PHP job
because there's a lot of companies that
don't require a lot out of their PHP
developers because of that PHP has
gotten a bad rap sometimes even though
there are tremendous PHP developers out
there so again that you'll see the pay
range is extremely broad for PHP
developers because there's just such a
range out there Ruby on Rails is much
more specific it has a Ruby on Rails way
so if you learn it you'll probably have
a little more confidence that you know
what to expect from a Ruby on Rails job
whereas this could look a thousand
different ways this is much more
specific so if you're going to learn
Ruby definitely learn Ruby on Rails for
Sinatra is very cool it's a micro
framework a lot more like Express for
node I personally if you just love
JavaScript then learn node there's
there's a growing number of node jobs
node is becoming more unpopular more and
more popular every day other languages
that there's still lots of opportunity
lots of jobs for net which would most
likely be c-sharp if it's asp.net my
recommendation is stay away Python which
generally will use the Django framework
although there are other Python
frameworks out there Java is still tons
and tons of Java jobs people keep saying
Java is going to go away from web
development but it's not done that yet
and there's some great fun new
frameworks out there like play these are
kind of the top three Java frameworks
for the web spring Grails play if I was
new when I was starting off and I was
going to learn one I would learn them in
the reverse order I would learn play
Grails spring Grails and player kind of
the newer
more modern takes on web development and
those are kind of duking it out for
who's going to be the fun new guy and
then there's just a lot of spring jobs
because spring has been around for a
while so that's kind of if you if you
you know have any kind of java
background you might want to look at
those and you'll want to learn how to do
again unit functional testing for your
chosen technology they're going to have
different frameworks if you're if you're
from JavaScript you can use mocha for
your node but you're it's just going to
be different based off the language you
have some cool upcoming languages which
they're not really upcoming they're
already here go or go lang is very very
cool I like go a lot it's a lot of fun
Scala Erlang also some cool languages
just to kind of throw on that list for
you there's probably a dozen more but
those are three that I figured I'd throw
on the list and then you're going to
want to learn in that language so you've
chosen your language and if you're still
daunted by which language to pick and
you say we'll just tell me one language
to pick I'm still going to say pick Ruby
on Rails this year although I wouldn't
be bummed out if you picked a layer vel
or Express Jas but those would kind of
be the three frameworks that I'd say to
pick from I would say Ruby on Rails
because I think you'd have the highest
chance of getting a decent job as a
junior developer with Ruby on Rails but
that's my guess I haven't done that in a
while so you're going to want to learn
some things then with that language of
choice you're going to want to learn how
to build an API for say jQuery to
consume how do I build a restful web
service that the jQuery the front-end
angular or whatever can consume can use
you're going to want to learn some
security and that's going to be
different based off of each framework so
you know you'll want to do some research
on it you know do some research on Ruby
on Rails security you know how to secure
Ruby on Rails application you're going
to want to learn authentication and
authorization so that's two things but
it's one concept authorization is how
you verify a user so they log in with
their username and password or they log
in with their Facebook which is called
OAuth 2 and then that's basically
authorization authentication then
basically says I'm sorry I flipped these
around
so that's authentication authorization
is whether or not they have access to
things so basically once the user has
authenticated can I allow them to post
on somebody else's Twitter feed well not
if they're not authenticated as that
user user can I allow them to view your
emails well only if you're authenticated
as you and not somebody else so off the
authorization kind of is a way of
locking down your data so people can't
see information delete information they
shouldn't see and delete so then you're
going to want to learn kind of maybe
some architecture micro-services or a
service-oriented architecture is kind of
ways of getting around building one
gigantic monolithic application so lots
of companies start off with their one
big application and then as they grow
that becomes more and more of a pain
because now they have 12 developers
working in this one big application and
so they have to break it up into
services or even smaller into dozens of
micro services so uh kind of gets a bad
rap because there's this old-school Sowa
which is not kind of what I'm talking
about I'm talking about just the concept
of breaking your application up into
smaller applications that deploy
separately you're also going to want to
learn of course how to deploy your
server or you're going to want to learn
how to deploy this to a place can you
deploy your application to they're all
appear on these web platforms we'll get
into those in a little bit I think you
want to learn about caching caching is
basically a way to store stuff so say
you've tied that is you want to tie it
into some databases so let's make a Ruby
on Rails application that connects to my
sequel database and then let's make a
Ruby on Rails application that connects
to a MongoDB database and then let's use
Redis for sessions or for some caching
and then other two other cool databases
to look into our Postgres and cassandra
and there are many many many other ones
out there but these are you know some
pretty popular ones my sequel and Mongo
if you're just going to pick two and
then Redis is also a very kind of very
simplistic database that's good for
certain things like sessions and caching
as I mentioned so
deeper into caching you're going to want
to learn how to put nginx in front of
your application you or app Apache if
you're on you know say something like
PHP Apache might make more sense I'm a
big fan of nginx and then you'll want to
possibly do some in-memory caching and
with memcache is what it used to be
anyway so you want to learn how to add
some caching layers so you don't always
have to hit the database every time you
know a certain email is looked at maybe
we can cache that email for a while so
next time the user looks for it boom we
can just pull it right away out of Redis
or out of memory so that's kind of some
thoughts on caching and if you're still
with me right now and you're not bored
and you're a back-end developer you want
to take this thing kick it up to a
higher level then you're going to want
to look at what's called dev ops and dev
Ops is this whole world of bridging the
server administration world with the
developer world and so it kind of
bridges dev and operations ah I lost my
connection no oh well well we'll see
what happens anyway so dev ops is
basically this combination of several
things we're going to automatically spin
up servers and then we're going to
automatically provision those servers
and what provisioning means is we're
getting them configured say we have a
node.js application to deploy it we
don't have to want to log in through SSH
manually copy our files over that's a
terrible idea there's so much human
interaction developer number 13 who's a
newbie is going to blow up your web site
every time so you want to try to take a
lot of that risk out there and a lot of
that manpower out of there and DevOps is
basically the practice of building
awesome workflows into all the things
developers do every day so let's take
that note application we want to add it
to a server so from the command line we
can provision a server boom digitalocean
just spun up a new server and it
installed nodejs and the correct version
we have and all the stuff that it needs
and then from the command line we can
actually deploy that thing straight out
and then we can also monitor that thing
so we know when that server might be
getting overloaded so we can add another
server and have it load balance between
the two maybe have an nginx
balance the load between both the
server's so that's kind of the concept
the world that DevOps lives in you want
to learn some web platforms so many out
there know right web platform out there
digital ocean is great for really small
projects Heroku is great for really
small projects but can grow more
expensive significantly more expensive
as applications grow that's about all I
have on that Rackspace is very good
amazon has of course all the services in
the world my goodness so many to choose
from these days no right or wrong you
got to just kind of look into tons of
them you're going to want to learn
server management that's kind of what I
talked about before server management or
configuration management cm is actually
kind of what it's referred to as is is
the way of allowing servers to
automatically get provision salt puppet
chef and zap ansible Linux is well
you're going to probably be configuring
Linux servers so Linux isn't really a
language or a utility it's you know just
got to get a little bit more comfortable
with how the Linux operating system
works docker is a very very very cool
thing for doing that I'm going to
actually get into some docker stuff over
here but looking to docker that's a huge
thing that's changed this year docker is
is really revolutionising a lot of both
development and ops and in by
containerized applications very very
cool so you're going to want to learn
some workflows there's continuous
integration continuous integration is
basically code is always having tests
unit tests run through github or Travis
CI Jenkins lots of continuous
integration tools code ship is another
one that's kind of if you're starting
with DevOps this is the first place I
would start let's start with continuous
integration and deployment those are
kind of like your first big deals these
are some things for DevOps workflows
that are important vagrants is a great
tool to learn because vagrant will help
you set up a local development
environment that is not your machine it
runs on your machine but it's the exact
same environment as your Amazon server
or your Rackspace Linux server is so
that's a very smart I got a video I have
a video on vagrant I will add that
capistrano fabric flightplan these are
deployment tools they're all great you
can use any of them for most any
application so you don't have to use
Capistrano for Ruby I've deployed lots
of nodejs applications with Capistrano
fabric is a very simple NPM based one
it's very very lightweight probably the
easiest to learn I mean you want to
learn some deployment strategies and
then lastly let's just kind of talk
about some doctor doctors a super fun
cool new thing out here it's changing
about every three days there's a new
player out there for so who really knows
where docker is going to end up but you
do want to basically the concept of
docker is is let's take this application
we built let's turn it into a container
and some let's build let's kind of spin
up fifteen different servers from say
digitalocean and make them act as one
giant computer that we can now run 30
copies of our containers in so if we
basically need more power to our website
we just run for more web server
containers if you need more database
power you add three more database
containers and that's kind of how that
works in a nutshell chorus and mezzos
these are kind of some great operating
systems that are working very well with
docker containers docker itself gives us
three really cool utilities docker
machine for spinning up things doctor
machine allows you to just spin up a
digital ocean or an Amazon docker server
docker swarm is very cool now it's not
ready yet
but it's very very close to being ready
for production dr. swarm will allow
without installing chorus or mezzos will
allow you to create ten different
servers and talk to them as if they were
one so that's very cool docker compose
is also very cool kubernetes or
kubernetes or however you do pronounce
that mesosphere Panamax these are very
interesting ways of managing docker
containers I'm going to leave that at
that because there's still a lot to be
said about docker that I'm not going to
get into in this video there you go
that's web development 2015 if you're
new and I just freaked you out just just
take a deep breath learn these learn
these little things on this list here
and
pickup gosh what is going on and pick
either a framework on front-end or
back-end I mean that's really what it
comes down to and so it doesn't have to
be all that confusing these are just all
the little steps along the way that
