in WordPress world see this guy he's
stuck and this is for developers that
are stuck in a CMS rut now there's a few
things I should point out right away
first of all you can substitute any CMS
for WordPress whenever I say WordPress
here so that could be Drupal Kraft CMS
and so on this video is really for
developers who find themselves stuck in
the dead zone of being proficient in a
CMS but they feel much less capable
outside of one I personally was stuck
here for at least five years earlier on
in my career as a developer and I
personally know many many dozens of
developers who are stuck here right now
so it is a very real place and secondly
I have to mention that I'm not hating on
WordPress Drupal or any CMS they are a
very real technology they serve an
important purpose
many top-notch companies need and use
CMS's the problem is many developers
have the experience where they're
learning web development and a CMS helps
them get very far very fast through
templates and plugins but after a while
developing in a templates and plugins
world they find themselves at a dead end
there's something mentally about the way
you approach a templates and plugins
world that is different from the whole
rest of the world of web development and
they've been shielded from many aspects
of that development world and they
cannot break out of CMS world so that's
who this video is for it's designed to
help you break into development arenas
that CMS's may have been shielding you
from so how do I know if this is me you
know this is you if any or all of these
apply to you one if you're comfortable
creating sites in a CMS but you're
uncomfortable creating sites outside of
WordPress or the CMS of your choice
then this videos for you also and or if
you think in terms of hacking and
tweaking instead of building so if you
hack and tweak things as normal instead
of build new things for an example hey
you would need a calendar so instant
thought let's look for a calendar
plug-in I can tweak to fit my needs or
instant thought let me find a template
that looks like the website I need to
build and tweak it to fit my needs so if
you think in terms of hacking tweaking
instead of building then this is for you
also if you mostly or only know how to
work with plugins you don't really know
how to code stuff by yourself and that
leads into if I asked you to build an
application like Pinterest Facebook
Twitter without a CMS you'd have no clue
where to begin and lastly I guess if you
don't actually know how a CMS works
behind the scenes and you really
couldn't begin to build the CMS that you
use all the time then this is for you so
if this is you do not feel bad just be
aware that there is so much of the
development world out there to know an
experience that you haven't known and
experienced yet and it's gonna be very
good for you to break out of exclusively
CMS world and then the one exception I'd
say is if you're consider yourself if
you consider yourself to be a designer a
graphic designer who can also implement
that into the web if your true passion
is look and feel and you have no desire
to learn development then intentionally
stop at HTML CSS and and maybe
lightweight JavaScript like jQuery but
that being said when I was stuck in CMS
world for those five years I would tell
myself that it was because I was a
designer but the truth was all I knew
how to be was a designer I didn't know
that I absolutely loved development
because it kind of intimidated me and I
had never learned it I was in a box and
I never knew that I was and lots of
developers are in this place as well so
ah if you determine this is me you're
talking about me and one of those things
what do I do
first of all you need to make a mindset
change you are a builder not a repurpose
er it's kind of like the difference
between people who go buy old dressers
on Craigslist and refinish them to make
them look all trendy but they can never
build a trendy dresser from scratch from
raw materials and so that's kind of the
mental difference is you need to learn
how to work with the raw materials the
raw lumber so to speak in the
development world
instead of wood it's pieces of
Technology ATS frameworks and servers
and utilities and stuff like that it's
not as intimidating as it might sound
and it is far more fulfilling to build
something from raw materials than to
repurpose something else that somebody
else built they're both fun but building
is definitely in my opinion drastically
more fun so you're gonna change your
mindset and then the big pieces is
you're going to learn an application
development skill set now there's a few
different skill sets that you can choose
from so you get to pick one pick a road
any road as you can see from the picture
here they all lead to the beach you're
they're all gonna take you forward so
don't sweat this decision too much but
pick a skill set you can befriend and
developer full-stack developer or back
end specialty developer and like I said
all roads kind of lead to advancing
yourself in technology there's overlap
there's blend you're not gonna get
pigeonholed into one thing you can
easily cross between these as you move
forward as a developer so keep that in
mind
have fun pick the one that seems like
the most fun to you in general if you're
left brained you know you like intense
data and math go more back-end in in
general if you're more right brained
creative go more front-end or full stack
but those are general generalizations
very broad sweeping brushes you don't
have to hold yourself to those rules so
if you're going the front-end developer
skill set these are kind of the list of
what you need to do first you need to
learn how to build a responsive HTML CSS
layout in page from scratch now this is
kind of a core competency of a front-end
web developer and it's funny lots of
people can actually build sites in
WordPress for a decade and not know how
to do this so if that's your the first
core competency you have to develop is
how to build HTML CSS layouts and pages
from scratch lots of people do know how
to do that that a wordpress developer's
but many many people don't as well
secondly you got to learn a JavaScript
framework you're gonna build client-side
applications not just little widgets not
just little jQuery
plugins you're going to build
applications with a framework I'd
recommend just go for react
I think react is something you cannot go
wrong with these days if you're not
going to go with react go with angular
or view view is the simplest of the
three so if you find react and angular
very intimidating and difficult kick it
off with view and then move into
something else
angular is also very popular but in
general I think react is the best for
the way it will make you think as a
developer I think it will teach you very
good habits very good mental approaches
towards how to build applications so
layouts learn a framework and then
pretty much learn how to consume
back-end API so you don't have to know
how to build backends but you do have to
know how to work with them how to get
data so you can use services like
back-end lists or firebase I have a very
stripped down free thing called rest
learn code Academy which is just a
server that resets its information every
day but you can kind of play around with
a fake back-end on there and it's again
completely free and then lastly you need
to learn how to set up which is a the
fancy word for that is provision a
static site web server and get your code
on there so you know how do you get a
static site web server you can Google
how to provision static site web server
with digitalocean or with your service
of choice so you get a choice there I'll
put a code in the description for some
free money on digitalocean $10 or $20
for free I forget exactly what the value
is but you can actually mess around with
servers for free
and again that's a referral link I get
free credit if you use that but I never
use that credit anyway so feel free not
to use it not so if you want to go full
stack developer skill set here's kind of
what that world looks like you actually
begin with everything from front end so
front end is kind of a good place to
start plus you're going to shoot - hey
can I install a database locally and on
a production server you can't go wrong
with my sequel and or MongoDB those are
two good players to go with these days
there are some trendy or newer databases
but my sequel and Mongo DB are
hands-down the most popular - so there's
a good choices to go with
and then you're going to learn how to
build a back-end application for your
front-end applications so full-stack
developers tend to build say a single
page react app and then the api that
that app consumes that tends to be where
a full stack developer stops so you're
you're building the database and you're
exposing an api to your front-end
application so that way your front-end
application can read and write to that
database and that's usually about where
full stack developers tend to stop and
then you know the ability to deploy that
application to production so how to
deploy nodejs application to production
is a good thing to search on Google and
then what technologies and languages if
you're saying just tell me a good one go
with nodejs
with a framework being expressed yes you
can't go wrong with that now if you're
really comfortable with PHP because
almost all these CMS is our PHP start
off with lumen and then go laravel since
lumen is is much simpler lightweight
it's much more like expressed yes Larry
Mel laravel is very full-featured but
honestly even if you know PHP and you're
up for a challenge go with nodejs it's
simple it's JavaScript and you really
cannot go wrong with it these days it's
an awesome piece of technology so
there's your second skill set and your
third skill set back and developer skill
set you will learn everything from full
stack but not the front-end portion so
you'll learn how to set up a database
you'll learn how to consume information
from that database you'll learn how to
expose an API that front-end
applications can use but you will never
build those front-end applications and
then you will learn how to scale an app
as traffic grows which sounds
complicated but it's not really that bad
you'll use a load balancer like nginx or
H a proxy either one of those are great
pics and you'll learn how to backup and
restore the database of your choice
that's not really too hard they're made
to be backed up and restored optionally
you can learn how to scale those
databases to handle large amounts of
traffic and then how do you continuously
test and deploy an application so when
you push to github
tests run on your code and when you
merge two master merge to a specific
branch then it automatically goes out
into production servers this is you
don't have to learn this to start
back-end but it's definitely a part of
the back-end developer skill set some
companies out there offering continuous
integration tools or code ships circle
CI Travis CI all very good companies and
they also want to learn how to deploy
with docker these days that's also
something that a developer should strive
to have in their skill set as a back-end
developer and then how do you provision
servers with code this is a little more
advanced back in developer skill set but
using what's called configuration
management tools how do you get server
setup using code that you wrote in
advance so you can essentially use that
code over and over again to create ten
identical servers in production you
don't have to do it manually that's a
very good thing it's worth doing it's
worth spending the time on
so there's your skill sets to go for I'm
gonna give you a quote you owe it to
yourself to know more than just to CMS
that's for me I'm giving you that quotes
hopefully this helps you out if you
found yourself stuck in that world that
I was stuck in hopefully this gives you
not just the motivation incentive but a
roadmap to get out of there and start
experiencing much more of this broad and
enjoyable world of web development and
that is all thank you so much have a
great day and keep on coding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
