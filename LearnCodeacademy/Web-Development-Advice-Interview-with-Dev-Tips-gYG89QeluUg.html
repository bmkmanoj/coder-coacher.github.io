for you today I have a guest here
Travis Nielsen with dev tips and we're
going to be talking about how to get
started in web development from the
perspective of somebody who's rockin it
in the industry
Travis has a great YouTube channel that
you have to check out called dev tips it
focuses on the whole world of web
development Travis why don't you
introduce yourself real quick and just
tell us about your channel real fast oh
great um thanks well first of all thanks
for having me on
on your channel I'm a big fan of
learning code Academy I've been watching
it for a while so so thanks for that uh
dev tips is is something that I've been
pouring my nights and weekends and into
lately and it's a YouTube channel
similar to yours it may be a little bit
more front-end II less JavaScript II uh
so you know the first the first videos I
made were like html5 basics like talking
about the history of html5 where did it
come from why do we need it and going
all the way up now we're talking about a
lot of like layout and CSS and we talked
about sass a lot but we also talked
about a lot of um like the human side of
the industry right so I go to meetups
and I interview people and I talk to
them about you know what do they do to
remain you know inspired or or you know
went to it a meet-up uh at Yahoo the
other day and I talked to Dan cedar home
who's the creator or the co-founder of
dribble and we talked about like like
giving back to the the community and why
had to do that okay so it it covers like
a wide spectrum of things it's mostly
just like whatever I feel interested in
it at the moment
um which is actually why we started
talking you know I I'm interested in
what you were doing and I wanted to
share that with my audience and now
you've invited me to come on your
channel which is really cool yeah so
just in case you point out a good thing
we're doing a two-part video actually
kind of covering two different sides of
this we've got a video where he's
interviewing me on his channel and we've
got so I've got some really questions
pointed for Travis that you're going to
want to give the answers to if you're
starting
off the web development process and
you're wanting to learn how to get into
that world we're really going to pick
his brain here for this video and so I
guess you just want to get into it yeah
yeah let's just get started okay sweet
okay so I guess my first question would
be let's say I'm somebody that I'm I'm
either just now starting off or a venn
learning web development because I've
already kind of I think this is a good
industry for me what's the first thing
you're going to do what's the first
thing you're going to learn and why um
just like technically like what you
should start learning or like yeah like
let's say oh boy so just start learning
ooh good question uh let's go both I
mean what would you start learning and
and how would you start learning it yeah
okay so so content wise or yeah but
learning the content wise I mean I'm I'm
very very front end when it comes to
like the work that I do professionally
and the stuff that I teach so my
inclination would be to learn HTML in
and out and learn CSS in and out and
learn how to have Java Script can
enhance these two components of a
standard web page I think like if you're
going to learn the stuff that that you
teach will is is very very cutting edge
in terms of like tooling and workflow
and stuff and to even understand those
things like like to even buy a ticket to
the amusement park of wills channel you
have to understand what hTML is and how
CSS properties will affect those HTML
elements so my inclination would be to
you know to start there to start at the
very basics yeah and that's a if you're
if you're kind of subscriber to this
channel and you're learning that process
you're really going to benefit from
watching the dev tips channel just just
to make sure I say it there's a reason
we're doing this because you'll love it
so so say so you learn an HTML CSS is it
better to stick to just HTML for a while
and then go CSS is it better to to learn
them all at the same time
I'm just a personality that's a hard
yeah that's a hard question for me to
answer because when I learned HTML there
was no CSS oh wow so I don't have you
know I don't have that experience I mean
somebody coming into the industry right
now is going to have a bigger book to
read and what I mean by that is they
have a lot more to learn initially than
I did when I came to it it was like just
this weird thing that I was doing in my
you know in my mom's computer and you
know I was learning what is a paragraph
tag and I had to figure that out and
that was kind of it you know like I read
I ran a chapter in a book and I kind of
understood the whole thing but like
today there's so much you know like that
like CSS is growing leaps and bounds
every year right yeah if you learn CSS
completely two years ago and then close
your eyes for two years and then looked
at it again it would be a different
beast altogether right now yeah now do
you see that as good or bad for a new
person or a mixed bag well I could see
how it would be difficult I mean it's
raising the bar for you know to it sorry
it's raising the entry level right what
am i what am I trying to say here yeah
that barrier of entries it's a little
tougher than very revenger that's the
word yeah it's raising the barrier to
entry right so it's harder to get
started but I think that it's more
exciting than it's ever been so the
payoff is going to be a lot greater so
when I first started I made this like
you know these horrible things that are
like a blight on the internet and yeah
they were just so pathetic and um you
know and and but but it wasn't because I
sucked and it was because I sucked okay
it was because I said but it was also
because the internet sucked yes like you
couldn't make awesome things back then
but now you can write the Internet is
awesome now and it can
continue to scale and get even more and
more awesome but the point is that like
it's it's possible for somebody in their
bedroom and you know to read a book or
read a few blogs or watch a few videos
on YouTube and learn some things that
are incredible and that that would make
me drool when I was first starting right
yeah so I think it is harder but the
payoff is greater mmm got you
so are there are there any resources out
there where there's some guys that are
giving tips on what this kind of like
more intermediate advanced CSS looks
like because from this I mean from from
the sound of things I mean just so you
guys know Travis is definitely like
super super awesome at CSS I tend to
specialize more in JavaScript and so is
there if I'm if I'm learning CSS what
resources are like these are the right
ones and looking at okay so CSS is very
broad in in what it can do and what it's
for but there are some very fundamental
principles to understand right and I
hope this is not to self you know pluggy
but I'll go I I did make a video series
it's like I think it's nine or seven or
nine videos about CSS basics and I'll
give the link you do you will so you can
put this in the show notes or the
comment or the whatever below the doodle
Ahdoot below and it's it's about like
we're starting at the very beginning
what is CSS how does it actually
interact with HTML and what is a block
level element what is an inline element
and in talking about like these very
basic concepts and then building from
there going all the way up to how do you
how do you install sass and use that oh
that's got to be great because even the
videos that I cover on CSS I'm focusing
on hey let's let's go zero to sixty like
right now so you can feel like you're
doing something but I do not cover the
detail that's very important to know
yeah those were some of the first things
I did and I felt that I needed
like explain them in order to do awesome
but not I mean not that they're not
awesome I think I think fundamentals are
really exciting personally and I felt
like I needed to go over them in order
to go into more like applicable skills
in the in the job market today but so
that so they're very useful for people
just starting out other resources that
are not of my own goodness I mean the
the the Mozilla uh the mdn rent the
Mozilla developer Network er what is it
called the yeah yeah and the mga
understands well there just don't know
the address of the dress yet well yeah
yeah so Mozilla whatever and find some
stuff and then um I would also say Stack
Overflow is a great place to just ask
questions and and they have a got a
really searchable database of other
people like you that have asked similar
questions to you and what the answers
have been so I mean this is stuff that
even though I am considered a
professional I've been working in the
industry for years I'm still visiting
these places I go to mdn and Stack
Overflow all the time all every day I'm
on Stack Overflow yeah yes yes and
there's also one website in particular
that's a blog that I would recommend to
anybody hand time over time and I have
recommended it on my channel this CSS -
trixx comm was ran by Chris coiour who's
the one of the cofounders of code pen
Geo and I've been following Chris for
years he's so good he's so good at
teaching he's like so smart and he talks
about the things that I am very
interested in which is front-end
development and he's branched out quite
a bit over the years so even though his
URL is CSS - trixx talks about you know
JavaScript HTML they talked about
tooling he talks about serving stuff he
talks a lot about WordPress if you guys
are interested in that talks about like
all these types of things and then if
you go to Chris's products code penny oh
that's a great place to you know just
see examples of things and see how like
if you want to see what the what the
internet is thinking about itself that's
where you should go you should go to
code pen to see what the
Internet thinks about itself in terms of
new tricks that can do it and and fancy
new clothes that it can wear right
notches yeah and then there's github so
always look at github because there you
are I got a trick question for you it's
something people ask me a lot in I don't
really know that I know how to answer
but you might is they say how long will
it take me uh let's say two hours a day
every night of the week five days a week
two hours a day to learn this stuff to
where I could get my first job is there
any kind of benchmark have you seen
people make that journey and do you have
any kind of guess it's okay if you don't
yeah I'm not super sure man I you know
what just I'm kind of it's hard for me
to like sit I feel like I'm giving you
bad questions or giving you bad answers
like you asked you know it should you
learn it all at once and and you know I
have a bad answer because I came into it
at a different time than it is right now
right so in this in a similar way like I
am a professional designer I'm a product
design I'm not even an engineer and I
learned how to develop stuff because I
wanted my designs to live and so my
first clients and my first the first
people who paid me to code
I've been coding a long time making and
publishing long before they were even
paying me to do it and and now I design
professionally and I code professionally
I do both at my current job so so but
your question is how long would it take
somebody if they studied two hours a
night every night and until they're
ready to get their first job I think
that that's the wrong question
I think it's not about how long will it
take me I think it's about how willing
am I to be uncomfortable right if your
question that's it that really is it
yeah I think and I know this just from
speaking with you for a while will be
you you like to dive in headfirst and to
be uncomfortable and that's when you I
mean I'm speaking for you but this is
what I gather that you that's kind of
like how you learn and thrive
you'll learn to love it I mean that's
kind of the joy of web development yes
and I can I can unequivocally say every
every job every employment that I've had
and I've been sitting in the meetings
I'm looking around the tables and I
think what am I doing here this is
across the board right I I couldn't I
didn't go to school I taught myself and
I sit at I sit at the table with mass
people with master's degrees double
masters and they've gone to Stanford and
like like people that are like seriously
legit doctors I've worked with like
people with double PhD in computer
human-computer interactions and science
and they do always really interesting
you know stuff I have no idea what
they're doing and they're asking me
questions about you know design or
simple CSS stuff that they leapt right
over right so it's not about when are
you ready
technically it's about when are you
ready emotionally to be afraid and to be
uncomfortable and um to just are when
are you ready to do it it's real is it
and great answer that question because
when the pressures on you got to know
that that at the end of the day if you
don't know what to do you're gonna go
find out what to do you're gonna ask a
question on Stack Overflow yes for two
hours you're gonna find the answer if
you don't have it and that's yes if you
if you ask me a question that you could
easily Google I'll be upset with you and
then that's just like what a web
development that's just the nature of
like I mean if you if you ask Mike if
you ask that in the comments on my
channel I'm actually presenting myself
as a learning source so that's perfectly
fine but professionally if you come over
to my desk and ask me something that you
can easily find now it'll I won't say it
to your face but don't think a little
less of you it doesn't for sure there's
you know for a living as a developer I
mean that's just what you do you do yes
yes Google is your very best friend as
and unlike in stress that you don't know
the answer when somebody asks you is
also your best friend so and there are
there are a few ways though to get ready
for that okay um I would surround your
surround myself with people who support
you right for me it was was my family my
wife she believed in me at a time when I
didn't believe in myself and and though
there was a moment in my life when I
when I transitioned from uh I used to be
a Salesman I sold electronic it's tell
her I sold televisions right on a sales
floor you'd go into a place and I would
be like hey let me tell you about some
stuff and I would go home and design and
I would love design and read about
design and think about design all day
but I would make money by doing
something I didn't love at all and I it
was because I was afraid and I didn't
believe in myself and meanwhile my my
wife is is always say hey you know take
your time and be comfortable but I
believe in you and I think that like
like that having somebody there to to
support me while I did really scary
things um was was pretty instrumental in
in making that transition
another thing is not just surrounding
yourself with people who support you
emotionally but who who will support you
technically and support you in your
skills right so I'm talking about a mess
yeah so finding a mentor is really
important to to have somebody who is
generally interested in your well-being
personally and that you can talk to and
express you know your your frustrations
or your excitements with professionally
and having this person to guide you
along the way it is really important I
never had that kind of one existential
person but in through through like
making deep relationships with people
that I've worked with or people that
I've known that that's kind of come
about in a roundabout way and now and
now
leading to the third one that I would
recommend in order to learn and grow in
this industry is to um this is gonna
sound really pretentious and dumb but I
would I would pack your bags and move I
would go to somewhere that respects this
industry no that's huge that actually
really is huge
um I now for me that was that was moving
to Oakland California and then across
the bay into San Francisco that was when
things went from from you know zero to
ninety and it was incredible as soon as
I could put San Francisco and this is
the weirdest thing and it's probably I'm
sorry to say this but this is also true
as soon as I put San Francisco on my
resume job offers every day like it's
it's it's it's not even fair to people
who are not here it's it's really not
and this is a this is a sad truth if you
don't feel comfortable with picking up
your your belongings and moving or if
you're stuck some someplace that but but
this is San Francisco is not the only
place of course right there are other
places that respect what we do yeah in
work Atlanta Boston Houston yes
strangely Orlando's Orlando yeah yeah
Chicago Austin Texas um they're there in
worldwide too right there's a lot of
places Brazil is really poppin off right
now Mexico is pretty big
Singapore huge of Philippines Austria
Australia Germany is really big in tech
um Netherlands a lot of huge I'm sorry
what's that
Netherlands huge yes yes that's
absolutely so there's a lot of places
where they were this kind of they're
coming into this understanding that the
things that we do are valid and
worthwhile and valuable yeah so if you
can surround yourself in a culture that
values what you do and what your
trying to do you're not only going to
learn and grow faster but you're going
to receive a remuneration you're going
to be paid well to do what you do and
it's going to increase your confidence
it's going to increase your desire to
learn and grow and and you're going to
get better projects to work on that are
more visible and that's going to
increase your status in the community so
I graded a lot of stuff great advice
that's huge yeah so before before I let
you go on this before we say goodbye to
Travis to whatever any any last words of
advice towards people that are starting
on this journey I really want to go for
it yeah okay yeah I do um now you may
have heard some version of this advice
before but it's but it's so important to
understand and so I just I'll just
reiterate it you're not going to be as
good as you want to be until you get all
of the crap out and what I mean by that
is you have to make and make and make
and make until the thing that you
finally make is good you're going to
make so much junk it's going to just be
ugly and not work right and be horrible
that nobody wants and you're going to
make that for a very long time until you
finally make something good so don't be
afraid to make crap then don't get
discouraged the right let's say you have
an exact amount of crap that you have to
wade through before you get to the good
stuff
and everybody has the same amount of
crap that they have to get through if
you work two hours a night every night
you're going to get through it pretty
fast that's just truth if you work three
hours a night you're going to get
through it
faster right and that that's really the
kind of recommendation that I have work
fast and work hard and just like realize
when you're new and you're learning that
the stuff that you make is worthless
it's worthless to other people but it's
not to you it's going to be the stepping
stones to making great things okay and
and then when you finally start making
those great things all the sudden people
are going to really want you and really
want you to make great things for them
and they're gonna pay you a lot of money
to do it which is nice but the main
point is that you'll be finally making
those things that you wanted to make the
whole time because right now you can see
it you have this vision of what you want
to be and what you want to do and you
know who you want to be like but you
can't do it because you suck you work so
hard and then you don't suck it's just
time it's ten thousand hours that's just
it mmm that's awesome
may it make great advice great great
input I've actually learned several
really cool things by listening to you
so mint Travis takes a time for joining
us today and home is always fun yeah his
channel where they just type in dev tips
and in search on YouTube yeah if you
search dev tips that will work well I'll
try to give you a link as well so you
can put it in your description of your
video awesome yeah well click my face
awesome what or click on my face or
click on the face will put will put an
annotation on the face so awesome thanks
so much Travis have a great day and
we'll catch you all around on the
Internet's
sticker that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
