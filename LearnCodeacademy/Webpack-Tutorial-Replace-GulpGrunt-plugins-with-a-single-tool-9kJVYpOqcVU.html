react videos which I'm very excited
about react has really gotten to a great
place throughout 2015 and now coming
into 2016 it's it's very usable and I
think people should be using it it's a
great technology well worth the effort
for both new developers which will have
a bigger learning curve and for seasoned
experienced developers there's still a
decent learning curve to it so but
before I do that for all the new
developers are the the ones that were
not used to module loaders I'm going to
do a video here on module loaders what
that's all about and webpack
specifically and webpack is definitely
kind of the module loader of choice for
the reax community so if your experience
with module loaders you probably don't
need to watch this video unless you're a
little bit you know concerned about you
know what does web pack look like so
let's get into what exactly is a module
loader now there's three kind of out
there earlier on back in the day
requires a SaaS came out a few years ago
browserify
can't talk and type browserify came out
and kind of competed for a while then
browserify kind of started winning out
and then web pack came out now it's kind
of web pack and browserify duking it out
so they're both great module loaders I'd
pick one of these two for any projects
if you're doing react I definitely pick
web pack it is more feature full and
react kind of requires you to be a
little more feature full in some ways so
let's get into it how do we do this I've
got a very very basic HTML page right
here kind of show you kind of how things
used to be will kind of turn back time a
little bit fucka turn back time then
this is how we used to code javascript
we'd have one scripts file that would
have all of our modules in its module 1
2 3 and then you'd load that right there
into your HTML page one script call if
you had a lot of stuff that you had to
start breaking it apart you had to put
module 1 in here boom let's put module 1
in there and let's put module 2 in there
and then you had to do two separate ones
you had insert module one and then you
had to insert a module to script tags
now you're making multiple requests
and then if you wanted to enhance that
you had to use some kind of build script
that would come catenate module 1j s a
module 2j s together and minify them
together and those things basically
involve evolved into module loading
systems so we really can now code all
our different modules separately and
then we can use kind of an entry point
which would be our scripts J s now to
start the requiring path and to start
the the dependency path if you will so
we know that our page right here has a
dependency on module 1 and module 2 and
they have to be loaded let's say in that
order module 1 has to fire first module
2 ask to fire second so in this case we
simply go require we're actually going
to a dot slash module 1j s so the dot
slash means we're starting in our
directory right now dot dot slash would
be going up a directory or let's go up
to directories or let's go up a
directory and then it ended the J s
folder which I'm already in which
doesn't make sense
so just dot slash module 1 J s so that's
going to actually import that file into
scripts J s at this point right here and
then we're going to require module 2 J s
for those of you guys of course you know
your browser JavaScript you know that
this will not run in the browser this is
no J S or common J s code is technically
the comma J s module system that node
uses so this will not work what we have
to actually do is use node.js to convert
this into a browser worthy format well
believe me for any kind of web
application where you have just tons and
tons of files it is well worth the
little effort putting into a putting
together a build system so for this we
install node.js if you don't know what
nodejs is at all you want to go check my
intro to node.js video or you can just
search youtube nodejs at the point of
this it's number one or number two if
you type nodejs tutorial so you'll
basically install nodejs I have no J's
installed right now let's go npm and
knit which this will be covered in that
node.js video so let's get a
package.json going and then let's go
install web pack
I'm not also going to install webpack
globally so I can just run the web pack
command once this is done
doo-doo-doo-doo
okay well it's going we'll come back to
our file here real quick so at this
point it's basically going to require
module 1j s completely run through
everything in module one then it's going
to move forward in a line so that's a
synchronous operation then it's going to
require module two J s and run through
everything in module two now these can
require their own stuff as well let's
see if that's done excellent that's done
I've also already run an NPM install G
web pack web pack so I can run the web
pack command so I've already done that
I'll save you guys the ten seconds of
having to watch it now all I need is I
need a web pack dot config dot JSON file
which will tell web pack where to look
and how to act so I'm going to touch
that real quick web pack config dot J
s-sorry not JSON and I've actually got a
gist here for you which I'll put the
link to of a sample kind of very very
basic start up web pack config these can
get extremely complicated if you want to
do a ton of stuff but here's basically
what we have we're saying our context is
currently the directory we're in you
know if you had say an app directory
that your app directory lived in then
you could do this if your app lived in a
directory called app or something like
that
but as far as the relationship from here
all of our stuff is just in this folder
there's no SRC folder or anything and
the right here I'm doing a quick
determination is our node environment
production if so we're going to run all
these minification things and we're not
going to do source mapping if it's not
production then we're going to consider
that debug mode so that I'm saying if
it's debug then we're going to inline
source maps that'll help out our console
logging and everything otherwise we're
going to have no dev tool at all our
entry point is scripts j/s so this is
kind of where we're grabbing our word
this is where we're starting off and
then here's our output we're going to
the J's folder we're going to build a
scripts Minjae
and then here's the plugins if we're in
debug mode no plugins at all an empty
array if we're in production then we're
going to D do so we're going to actually
strip out any duplicate code and then
we're going to also run the uglify j/s
which will get rid of source maps and
comments and all that stuff and
basically make it production ready so
there we go
let's save that let's go ahead and save
scripts save module one save module two
and run web pack there you go that was
fast enough and you see that we have a
script step Minjae s now clearly this is
not minified because I didn't run it
with node environment equals production
you can say I got all these great source
mappings here I'm defining some modules
and then I'm bringing the modules in it
did out a little bit of extra code in
here which seems like an awful lot for
two console logs but once you get a
whole application this actually makes
the code a lot simpler and cleaner so it
doesn't really add a lot of weight to
your overall application and so then if
I wanted to go node N equals production
webpack then it's going to run and you
can see now it's all minified and
everything's nice and teeny-tiny and in
one line and all that good stuff so
there we go that's done let's go and
just run web pack again and let's open
index all I need to change my index is
now referencing scripts Minjae s and
let's open index dot HTML there you go
I've got my web pack page if I open my
console.log they're both in there
excellent looking good you can see it
takes me I need to get the dev tool
working right because that's not exactly
how I want the dev tool to look but at
any rate that's working let's go back to
the console log and let's look at these
modules here so now a really great thing
is I can use node or NPM to install some
more stuff so let's say you're a jQuery
guy everybody's somewhat familiar with
jQuery still right let's see absolutely
have to have jQuery on the page for some
reason so there we go I've installed
jQuery and let's also install lodash
install and save load
- so let's say module 1 is a jQuery
module it does something that only
jQuery can do so now I can require
jQuery
let's go single quotes and then I can h1
h1 is going to get new HTML new text run
web pack and refresh my page now you can
see now it runs jQuery on my page
excellent a very cool thing is do I have
jQuery on here nope
jQuery does not exist in the global
scope of my page which is very cool
because jQuery now only exists where
jQuery needs to exist if another module
needed to require jQuery totally fine
the code does not get duplicated I'm not
going to double the size of my
javascript file by importing this twice
it's just going to create a module
called jQuery and make sure that that
has loaded in the proper order where it
needs to load so that's a great thing
about module loaders is they do a lot of
the smarts for you and let's say I
needed to use lodash here which is
basically underscore.js for those of you
guys who are not familiar with it
lodash let's require low - let's go and
get some data here I'm using maka Roo
let's make 20 rows of random data here
let's go ahead snatch that paste that in
there people equals there's all my
people and then let's alert so let's see
how many female people we have in here
filter people we're gender female length
so we're going to alert female counts
now let's run web pack again you need
use something like node Mon is a great
tool for handling all your web pack
there you go nine females huh and then
it's also running my jQuery module so
now my modules are completely broken up
into just units that do one thing
there's a little bit of jQuery code
happening here if I had a lot of jQuery
happening then I could easily make
another module you know say how did
jQuery for form validation I could make
a form validation j/s and simply require
my form validation j/s and then that cut
out that form validation j/s would also
require jQuery and do all of its jQuery
stuff and webpack will make sure that
jQuery exists where it has to and can be
referenced where it needs to be
referenced from so module loading super
awesome thing web pack super cool great
great great great utility it can do so
many things you just go to web packs
page and you'll get just a glimpse of
all the things that it can do but
there's web pack let's get into react
using this basic kind of web pack
configuration we have going on right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
