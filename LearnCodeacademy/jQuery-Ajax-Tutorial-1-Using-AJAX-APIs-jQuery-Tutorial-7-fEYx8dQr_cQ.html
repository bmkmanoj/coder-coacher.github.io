jquery lesson because we are going to be
doing what i think is the most fun part
of javascript programming and that is
doing ajax we're going to be taking this
flat page here which is a coffee orders
application and right now we have some
static content here that were just kind
of spitting out and we are going to be
taking this and making it dynamic we're
going to be when you load the page we're
going to load up the orders spit them
out on the page and we're going to give
you the ability to add a new order to
the database and it shows up here right
away without navigating yippee let's get
into it
and so the two technologies we're using
is ajax we're gonna be using ajax to
access our API that our back-end team
gave us ah what are these two words mean
well Ajax means asynchronous JavaScript
and XML which technically means you're
using javascript to get xml behind the
scenes it's funny we don't use xml
anymore we use JSON but a judge is a
terrible name and Ajax sounds cool so we
still call it Ajax so this basically
just means now we're using jQuery AJAX
and it's going to be talking to an API
that our back-end team built for us API
is our application programming interface
and so when the back-end team builds the
database and the structure to handle all
the orders they give us some methods for
accessing the orders and for posting new
orders and so that's basically what the
API is that's what the back-end team
builds is the API for us so let's kind
of get into this so here's our static
content we want our first step in what
we're going to be doing in this video is
covering how to do a get request to grab
the content and replace this static
content with quote/unquote dynamic
content so let's go ahead and do that
let's strike out this static content
here our ul is called orders and so now
when we refresh we have no orders right
because we have not gotten them yet
let's go ahead into our main j/s do a
document ready function probably don't
need it because our Java scripts at the
bottom of the page but oh well we'll do
it anyway and we're going to be doing
jQuery AJAX and we're giving it an
object of
options here and so the first thing we
need to do is we need to know what URL
are we gonna get and how are we gonna
get that information so let's look at
our note from the back-end team our
back-end team said here's the API we
built for you if you send a get request
to slash API orders you're going to get
this sample response of all the orders
awesome so let's go ahead and check that
out we can go slash API orders which
I've already done and you see awesome it
actually gives me all the JSON and I'm
going to show you just a little bit more
about what a get request is basically
whenever you type anything into the URL
it does a get request for it it gets
that URL you can see if I look at my
network tab I called slash API slash
orders and it did a get method for that
and here's my response it gave me that
JSON object of my orders yet also I have
these two get requests going on because
I have a plug-in that makes JSON look
pretty but technically the only get
request that happened is this guy right
here if I actually refresh this page let
me go to the network tab and refresh
this page you'll see that it does like
five get requests it starts off by
getting my local host here and my server
is programmed to respond to localhost
within HTML file so this is where the
HTML file comes in my browser starts
going through that HTML file finds out
that I need to load a stylesheet so it
does a get request for my CSS file and
there you go it responds with a CSS file
it doesn't get requests for my jQuery
file that's jQuery library and a get
request for my main CAS which is
currently just that so that's what's
going on let's go ahead now and do a get
request for API orders so we are also
grabbing this my type is going to be get
which is actually the default I don't
have to add that but I'm gonna add that
in the URL is slash API slash orders so
now let me go ahead and refresh my page
and you'll see now I hit API slash
orders it was a get request and my
response is the data that I need
excellent so now all I have to do is
take that data and spit it out onto our
page so how we do that is with a success
function
success and give it a function and then
they this will pass us our data right
there so if I go console.log data let me
it save it refresh you say it says
success and I have an array with two
items my array has the we'll drink and
the Laura drink awesome
that is our information so now we just
need to go through each item and spit
out an Li for it so we're going to use
the jQuery each function which is going
to go each the first thing is the the
array each is what each does with jQuery
as it goes through each item in an array
and allows you to run a function based
off of that item so data is an array and
so we're going to pass data as the first
one and then we're going to give it our
function that we want to run is our
second argument so for each item in data
we're going to run a function and the
two arguments that it passes is I which
is the index 0 1 2 3 4 and then the
actual item you can call this whatever
you want you can call it item and call
it order basically that's just what each
item is so for each I'll just call this
orders here make it a little clearer
with the naming so our success orders go
through each orders and give us an order
and so what I'm going to do then is
let's look at our UL this UL is where we
want to spit it out to which has an ID
of orders let's cash that up here cash
to the Dom so we only have to look at it
once orders dot append we're going to
put a new li in there
let's just make sure this works there
you go
yep so now it put in two new orders and
all we have to do is now populate the
information into those lis and so we can
do this just by fixing this string here
and then drink so under here I'm just
going to cut that out
order dot name there we go
and then drink is going to go order dot
drink so there we go I've added the name
in I've out of the drink in let's
refresh haha we have hit our back end
server and we have spit out an Li for
each of our items that's awesome
and this is where we're gonna end this
video in the next video we're going to
add in how to post things to the backend
and we're going to get into this is
messy right here so we're going to show
you how to use templating engines to
make that a lot cleaner so let's get
into the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
