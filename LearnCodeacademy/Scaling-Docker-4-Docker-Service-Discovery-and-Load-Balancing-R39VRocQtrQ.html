before our high availability production
docker solution is complete
so we've got everything running our apps
are registering so now we just need to
kind of pull that internal HDD registry
for changes and reload our engine X
configuration and this is actually a
decent bit easier than service
registration
I feel like service registration is
always the hardest part me telling you
that I exist service discovery there's
just some good solutions and tools for
that that make it a lot easier we're
going to be using compte for nginx CO
and FD and what conf DA's going to do is
it's going to run inside of this
container and then it's going to watch
the Etsy D registry keys that we tell it
to watch and whenever things change it's
going to reload the nginx configuration
template it's going to template it out
and change the configuration file and
then it's going to reload nginx and I
have made a docker image that makes this
very simple it's will our stern slash
nginx lb and all you do is you run it
you pass it to things you tell it the
service name that you're listening for
and that you're a load balancing for and
then you give it another environment
variable called Etsy D and this is
simply your IP address import that it
can access sed from so in this case
we're running this command right here to
get the internal sed IP address which is
always port to 379 so we're passing this
in this won't change the only thing
that'll change is what your service name
is called so in this case we're load
balancing some app and then I give it a
name some app lb so that's it let's go
ahead and run this and then I'll show
you kind of what's going on under the
hood so let's go ahead and submit this
service file submit what I call it some
app lb and then I can just start it
now ideally we would probably run two
copies of this so I'd make it a sum app
lb at file and then I'd launched two
versions of it because we do want
failover we want there to be in case
this nginx instance goes down we want
there to be another one that can get
picked up as well but for now we're just
doing one for this example let's look at
this fleet control list units so there's
my lb it is running on this guy oh it's
still activating so it's pulling the
image right now it'll probably take
about 30 seconds start post and it
should be done any second
there we go it's running so let's go
ahead and look at this guy
I guess I'll just SSH into here I don't
know what port it's running on so gosh
SSH all these commands can kind of get
to you sometimes
there you go docker PS so we go node
sample is exposing this port three to
seven seven zero and again that was on
this IP address so let's go to here
three two seven seven zero three two
seven seven zero some app one let's see
if it load balances am I looking at the
wrong one yes I am three two seven seven
one I was just going directly to some
app one there we go two one two four
three excellent so it's load balancing
between all four great that's very very
good to see so let's go ahead and show
you how that's doing what it's doing and
then we'll move on to our last problem
to solve so here's basically everything
it took to create that nginx lb image
that I made very very simple to recreate
on your own I'm doing it from a boon
from a bun to I'm installing conf D I'm
installing nginx
and then I'm just basically going to
remove a few things I'm gonna copy a
couple files over I'm going to expose
port 80 and then my entry command is
just to run comedy watch which is this
file right here so this is what gets
when you run that load balancer and I'm
doing two things I'm simply looking at
this Toma file and I'm looking this Toma
file is basically the configuration for
coffe tea and it's very very simple you
can see here's my template file here's
where I'm putting that template file and
here's the keys that I'm watching in @cd
and then here's my check command this is
important too because once you've
templated that out you want to make sure
that what got automatically generated is
actually actually valid so it's gonna
run this first it will not reload nginx
unless that template file is valid which
is a very good thing and we can probably
make that do a very loud and clear alert
if for some reason our our template file
blows up on us and so then it's going to
reload nginx when that templates out
here's all the template file is is we're
going to proxy to app we're gonna listen
on port 80 and we're gonna proxy appear
to all of our up streams so for
everything in services app name upstream
we're just going to spit out a new
server so we have to do two things for
this to work is we have to change app
name here here and here and then we have
to change the app name that we're
listening to so if you remember when I
started this I did one thing I gave it a
service name environment variable and
right now we're calling that some app so
when Comedy watch starts up we're going
to replace every instance of app name in
both our Toma file and our nginx
template with whatever service name we
gave it so it's going to automatically
replace all this stuff with some app and
it's gonna automatically replace all
this with some app all this all this
right here so there we go it's gonna
change those and then it's gonna start
up conf D which is going to watch at C D
and whenever it changes its gonna do its
thing
so that's what's happening and that's
running so whenever nodes arrive go away
all that nginx automatically reloads its
configuration and that's great and so we
can actually use this exact same nginx
elbe image for as many services as we
want
we just have to give it a different
service name and as long as we adhere to
this structure as long as we adhere to
this structure in sed services slash
service name slash upstream we can use
that same image for everything so now we
just have one problem left to solve and
that's the problem of we still don't
know which IP addresses imports all our
nginx load balancers will have so now we
have to register these somewhere else
and then we have a public-facing proxy
in front of them that automatically
points all of our subdomains to our
services so let's move on to that last
and final piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
