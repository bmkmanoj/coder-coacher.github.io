bootstrap CSS today to make a responsive
layout if you don't know what a
responsive layout is you're about to
find out and if you're brand new to HTML
CSS this is video number four and I'll
put a link to video number one over here
where you can check those out and get a
little familiar with HTML CSS first but
let's move right into it
what you're going to need to do to start
with bootstrap is you're going to need
to go to get bootstrap comm and then
click on the getting started link it's
been kind of having some server lag
today so I've had to refresh a lot of
times bootstrap is getting all popular
on this ok you'll scroll down and you'll
see bootstrap CDN if you just want to
use the files from CDN which is a great
way to do it copy these two links and
then add them right here into your
header there you go so now they're both
in there now bootstrap CSS is on my page
I'm also going to take the script and
I'm going at it at the very bottom of my
body tag and what that's going to do is
you always want to put scripts at the
bottom otherwise your page is going to
wait for all the scripts to load before
it shows your user the page and you want
that to be as fast as possible we are
keeping the style sheets up top because
as soon as the page shows up we want it
to have style we don't want it to show
up ugly and then catch style later on so
that's why style goes up top so as
things appear they have the correct
style and then the function goes down
here because we can show them a page and
not have all the function move yet it'll
load up a split second later but it
feels a lot faster kind of the
explanation on why we're putting it
there so now that bootstrap CSS is on
here let me show you I actually loaded
the Styles bootstrap CSS it is going to
create tons and tons of CSS rules that
help you do a lot of great stuff for you
and I'm not going to get into all of
what's going on there today but what I'm
just going to show you kind of how we
start using it so let's start by doing a
three column layout what we're going to
do is do with a class of row and then
I'm going to go do
call them small six kind of what we got
here so you see it doesn't look like too
much let me I did make a couple helper
classes here in my main CSS dark BG
darker BG darkest BG so I'll give you
dark BG okay it made something that
spans halfway across the screen
what bootstrap gives you is a twelve
column responsive layout which means it
goes twelve columns across and since I
made it be six columns across then no
matter what size my window gets here I'm
always going to see six columns across
until I get lower than small which is as
soon as I get extra small and then it's
going to fill the whole screen this is
called a responsive layout which means
it acts according to the size of the
users browser and device let's go ahead
and add another one you'll see more what
we're talking about let's make this one
darker BG so now we have two columns
here and you'll see that these are going
to do good as soon as my screen size
gets small boom like an iPhone or
something they bump down to the next
size let's go ahead and add another
column
let's go darkest BG and now it's going
to start looping around because we have
more than twelve columns we have six six
six column of the Beast so I'm going to
give each of these a for the reason they
went with twelve is you can do groups of
three if you divided by four if you can
do groups of four if you all give them a
width of three you have a lot of options
a lot of divisibility with the number
twelve so that's why they went with that
so now I have a three column layouts and
they each have the full background on it
there we go
what you can also do is you have widths
of small extra small medium large extra
large and those are all based off your
screen widths so say I want this one to
always when we burn when we merge down
say I want these two to still be half
width so what I can do here is start
adding some extra small rules so small
let's make you six you
you three you and three and when we go
extra small I want you to be full which
is 12 and then extra small you're going
to be six and you're going to be six
these helper classes they built for your
awesome so now we have 633 now when you
bounce down now this guy goes all the
way across and these guys both span it's
really good you notice there's some
problems going on here it's because I
did not wrap this in a container tag
forgot to do that that kind of gives you
a little bit of a kind of sets your deal
to your layout container there we go
that fixes that always want to be in a
container tag what a container does is
it kind of gives you your you're
centered look and feel so then I bounce
down to responsive layout and that's
excellent that's kind of how you do
column layouts now let's do a navbar
easiest way to do this is go to
components on bootstrap you're going to
be going to get bootstrap comm a lot
because you're just going to be doing a
lot of copy-paste I'm going to go to
navbar and there's an example of a
navbar I'm just going to copy the whole
dang thing there's no way you're going
to remember all this anytime quickly so
you just go with it I'm going to create
let me see what does this start with it
starts with a nav tag so I'm going to
create a header tag here now I'm going
to paste that big mess in there and I
don't know why my sublime always pastes
messy so there we go
navbar navbar default these are all
styling classes what I'm actually going
to do is I'm going to make the header
I'll see you out there there we go
there's my navbar it looks beautiful
I'm going to wrap all this in a
container tag again make sure keep the
indentations clean don't want nasty HTML
people and so now my container is
actually going to have the navbar class
giving it full width
you know I actually don't like my
decision to do that let's keep it
sometimes bootstrap you have a lot of
trial and error because you do have not
memorized what all these things do no
I'm taking it back I'm going to do it
change plan again like I just said a
little trial and error these are the
things you put together once a site so
it's usually like four months in between
implementation that's a class container
oh that's my problem I don't want that
to have I want the container to be
inside ha ha ha there we go
container to be here you're going to
have a class navbar which is kind of
what makes it do that full width page
thing the class of nav bar gives it that
full width thing and now I have bad HTML
okay so for those of you guys who just
got confused by what I did we have our
header with class of nav bar and then
inside we have a container which gives
us that centered look and then it goes
nav our default class which we can
actually take out and there we go what
I'm actually going to do is give this
container class now bar inverse there we
go actually I don't want it there one on
the header there we go got it so your
nav bar slash defaults gives you that
grayish I don't know if you can see but
it's a little bit gray I like nav bar
inverse because it gives me a black look
and then I put the container which is
going to keep all my stuff kind of in
this centered look here so my container
is inside of my navbar class and then I
have my navigation inside and I'll give
this a roll banner just since that's
technically correct HTML markup there we
go now I got all my stuff and I'm going
to delete some things I don't want I
don't care about this link drop down
here just going to get rid of you and I
not using search so you're gone it's a
lot easier to copy and delete later
there we go now I've kind of got my
header
and now I've got my three column layout
and now I can add links and you'll see
this drop-down is not working so we'll
have to work on that mmm there's kind of
how we pull in a lot of our bootstraps
stuff and you'll as you as you go you'll
find out there's a lot of times the
bootstrap documentation might not give
you the most clear example on what to do
things might not work exactly as you
hope the first time around we just got
to keep moving let me show you some more
bootstrap stuff that you can do you can
go components see it keeps keep having
to refresh bootstrap it is not doing so
good today
bootstrap will give you a button groups
like that with that code it'll give you
a button toolbars you can do all sorts
of great stuff under the CSS tab you get
your more basic stuff like buttons there
we go you can see it's either a button
or an a tag with the class of BTN let's
add some buttons here hey class button
button I don't have a href there so it's
not doing it
there we go you got to make sure you
give it a color so this is button
defaults you can go button primary which
is kind of like hey this is primary out
of all of them you can go secondary
actually I don't think secondary is
anything you can go danger which is
error you can go warn warning you can go
success which is green and so that's
kind of how you get your buttons they
have a panel which is a very useful
thing let me go back to components
reload again panels panels are super
awesome let me go here copy the panel so
instead of giving this row you'll notice
I mean this is pretty ugly I've just
used
the column or the classes to depict
what's going on with the grid I'm going
to remove these dark BG darker BG
darkest BG because clearly those don't
look very pretty and we're going to copy
and paste in our panel these are a lot
more often the kind of components you
would use for a an actual webpage widget
one there we go
that's looking much nicer I'm going to
copy and paste that into my next one
you see they automatically resize to
what you've chosen which is excellent
and then they automatically bounce down
when you minify to a smaller one another
great thing about this is look what
happened to my menu is it automatically
shrunk down which is great my menu
automatically gives me a menu button and
so let's go ahead and add some buttons
in here now do something there we go and
they even do the nifty little looks
another thing you can do on panel is you
see panel default up here we can change
these to panel primary we can change
them to panel success all the same
things apply to these panel danger you
can also do the same thing to text this
classes panel body I can go text danger
there you go now it has red text and I
can make this text success
I can also instead of that I can wrap
something in a span and give it a class
of text success and as the exact same
effect so I can go black text
and then success text that's kind of
your basic introduction to bootstrap
there's way too much to it to cover in
one video so I'm going to leave it there
just enough to give you a dive in I copy
and pasted a few components I've been
doing some responsive layout you can see
obviously I'd clearly have some stuff to
add in here some adjustments to make
things aren't working flawlessly there's
still some things to be figured out and
desired but that's pretty much your
intro to using bootstrap to create a
great responsive layout</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
