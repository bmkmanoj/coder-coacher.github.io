github branching merging and pull
requests today if you're new to get up
which I'm assuming you are because
you're learning this lesson definitely
check out video one in the description
if you haven't checked it out yet it's
really going to be of help let's get
into basically this is level 2 and it's
about it for what you need to know to
use github day in and day out one of the
common things that you use all the time
with github is branching and what that
is if you picture a tree
you've got the trunk and once you create
a branch a branch comes out you'd make
code changes on that branch and then you
can merge that branch back in with a
trunk it becomes part of the trunk and
everybody else's branches can inherit
from it but it's easier to show you than
to tell you so let's just get into it
fictitious example here we have an HTML
page with one module on it and you get a
work request to add module number two
there's other people on the team you're
not the only one so what you're going to
do is you're going to create a branch
for module two you're going to build it
on that and they're going to create a
pull request for other people to code
review it but you don't know what those
things are yet so let's just show you
first thing you're going to do is you're
going to do a git pull make sure you get
the most recent version of master we're
on the master branch right now I can see
that because I'm using what's called
bashatt I'm going to add that to the
description as well because you'll
really like using that but do this
command real quick and do get branch
you'll see I have one branch which is
master that's where all the code is
sitting right now so if I go get branch
feature one let's say I'm adding feature
1 and then I hit get branch again but
now I have feature 1 this is a complete
copy of all my code from the master
branch
so whatever branch you're on at the time
you type git branch it will create a
copy of that and call it whatever your
new one is so now I have a complete copy
of master called feature 1 and now I can
switch to it by going get check out
feature 1 so now you'll notice I'm on
feature 1 again you won't see this
unless you're using bash it
but now I can make code changes on
feature 1 and it's not going to affect
anything going on on master so what I'm
going to do is my work request just do
two things it's to delete these two
items and it's to add a new module and
so I'm just going to go do my awesome
new module about news sure there we go
module 2 is added bingo and so now I'm
going to get add I'll do get status so
yep that's all I changed get to add a to
add all my changes get to commit and say
added news module and ideally if I knew
in advance that it was called the news
module this would not have been called
feature 1 it would have been called news
module or news module edition branch so
that way it makes more sense if you see
the branches you don't just see feature
1 well who knows what feature 1 is the
branch 4 news module so now if I go get
branch there we go I'm ready to create a
pull request now which pull request
pushes your code up to github for other
people to see your changes and
peer-review them other people on the
team
possibly a team lead if you're new and
it's a very common practice for
companies to require appear on your team
to review every pull request that you
make so you guys are kind of keeping
each other accountable
one thing you want to do before you
create your pull request is you want to
go back to the master branch or whatever
branch you're merging this into because
you can have a branch of a branch of a
branch of a branch we're going to go get
get check out master and we're going to
do a poll to make sure that master has
not changed in the let's say 3 hours
that we've been working on this and yet
there were some changes it updated so
let's go back to our feature now check
out feature 1 and my brain is just not
typing right today happens sometimes I'm
going to get merged masse
or what this is going to do is it's
going to take all the changes and
updates to master and it's going to try
to merge them back into feature one
branch says there was a conflict on
their merge fail which means that
somewhere along the line somebody else
touched the same lines that we are
touching so I'm going to click on my
file and yep
you see that there's some conflicts here
head which is me ah you know what
happened it's sometimes is a little
tricky to figure out what's going on
here it says that I added this within
module two and they added this within
module two which means we both added
these exact same two lines but these
ones were different so they try to add a
module too and I try to add a module too
so let's do this now I actually have to
just kind of rewrite my code so there's
I'm going to call theirs module two
sometimes it's a little tricky to figure
out what happened in an actual I can't
do that
there you go module three sometimes a
little tricky to figure out what
actually happens when you see all those
merge conflicts I was able to just
determine that okay we both try to add a
module two so it's saying there's no
problems here that your lines are
identical these ones is what's not
making sense so there we go
got that done I'm going to go get status
again okay now it's both modified now I
hit get commits and if you'll remember
from my last video whenever it shows you
these big long commit messages you go
escape : WQ and that's going to save and
commit your commit I know that's weird
escape : WQ but that's what it is and
now I can do get push and depending on
what your push settings are on my mind
it warns me that it doesn't know where
to push it to so it gives me the command
push and set upstream to origin feature
one so now feature one has been pushed
up to github and if I go to github I can
see that there's actually and refresh I
can see there's actually two github
branches here master and feature one
feature one's got the new modules
and if I go to master master has the new
module that the other guy added that's
another way you can figure out what the
heck is going on if you actually go to
github look at the master branch and see
what they are expecting the code to look
like module two div my content that will
help you and whenever you're dealing
with merge conflicts I do that a lot if
a merge conflict just doesn't make sense
I'm going to look at master and see what
they committed to master before it
started causing problems so I'm on
feature one again you'll notice the
github gives you this nice thing your
recently pushed branch is feature one so
I'm going to you can either click there
or in this case I'll just go to feature
one and click this little green button
that says compare review or pull request
and so now it just shows in green the
things I've changed I can create a pull
request and you can add any comments
there
hey at somebody can you please check
this out you can do it just like Twitter
hey you can check this out send pull
requests and there you go now I've got a
pull request I can see what two commits
went in I did an ad and I did a merge
the merge counted is a commit and then
you can have some conversation back and
forth and then somebody can merge this
for you it's usually a bad idea to merge
your own pull requests but I can hit
merge and confirm and there you go now
it is in two master so now if I go to
master click on index I've got my
modules two and three there because my
feature was in and I should have when I
was on the pull request deleted the
branch because I don't know some people
like to delete branches so I can go into
leaf that branch so now if I go back to
master here and do a pull there you go
I've got all three modules and I'm on
the master branch so that's the whole
workflow you may have to watch this two
or three times to get a feel but this is
what you do day in and day out you get a
feature request
make a branch for it code in your
feature commit it and then put it back
up a merge master back into it and then
push that up and make a pull request
that pull request gets code reviewed
gets merges one more thing that might
not be bad to point out is is that if
you have a pull request out there you
can add more merges to it let me make
another branch here I'll just call this
one news okay let me make one change I
don't delete that stuff there you know
so I'm just basically just doing some
stuff here once again I like for
whatever reason I like this get setting
where it always makes me choose what
branch it's going to lots of people that
drives them nuts okay what I just did is
I made a new feature made some changes
committed those changes pushed them up I
did not bother merging master back in so
now if I go back to will stern dummy
test I can go to the news branch let's
make a pull request go on his news sure
let's say somebody else looks at it says
add there's some extra whitespace in
there that you also need to delete you
get an email that somebody wants you to
clean up the whitespace yeah I guess I
can clean up that white space so I saw
his email I'm going to clean this code
out save that
I'm going to do another push and you'll
see that I'm going to have a second
commit there you go go on as news remove
whitespace you can add commits to your
pull requests after you've made them so
that's kind of how the back-and-forth
dialogue goes you'll delete some stuff
you can also go to these commits the
files change you can actually it would
have been better if the guy would have
commented on the actual line and so
that's kind of how the dialogue takes
place back and forth and then the pull
requests are closed the branches are
gone and master keeps living on there's
the video hope you liked it and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
