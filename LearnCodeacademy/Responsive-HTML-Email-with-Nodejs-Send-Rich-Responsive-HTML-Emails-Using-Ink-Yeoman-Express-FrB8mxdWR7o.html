get email sending from your nodejs
application with SendGrid and it's
working great but in a real life
scenario you'll probably want to send
HTML emails rich HTML emails and that's
a little bit more involved one because
there's a lot of restrictions around
rich HTML emails because there's so many
mail clients out there and lots of them
especially like Outlook are going to
handle things really different so I'm
going to kind of give you my thoughts on
how I would approach rich HTML emails
first off with SendGrid the only thing
you've got to do is change text to HTML
and then you're done that's all SendGrid
cares about now I can send h1s and I can
send HTML tags of course there's several
issues with this one you do not want to
be coding HTML straight into a
JavaScript string terrible idea you're
going to hate your life it's also a
terrible workflow you can't code in here
you don't know what it's going to look
like on the other end unless you send
yourself a thousand emails while you're
developing so we need some kind of
workflow around here and then last we we
lastly there's some tooling you can use
to build responsive emails that are a
lot more should I say dependable on how
they'll display in different clients so
let's get into that workflow and then
into some tooling first thing I'm going
to do is I'm going to go I'm going to
make myself a preview routes router dot
get preview and I'm just going to send
myself an email template so res dot send
res dot render email and let's send it
say my first name so I want it to render
myself an email from the email template
now I don't have an email template yet
so let's go ahead and save I generated
this Express app with the express
generator and I use let's see here I
used Express and I use the Hogan flag
which is basically mustache
so Hogan we're using Hogan templates
here you can use Jade you can use
whatever you like but I'm showing you
Hogan for this example so email HJs so
now this is my email template here let's
get rid of
we don't need that and let's get rid of
this and let's just say I don't know you
signed up for something so thanks first
name Thanks
okay so now that's going to render let
me go start up my do it up again npm
start and i should be able to go to
slash preview not found okay
let's see what's up with that i didn't
save my file reboot my Express app there
you go
so that says thanks will let's say i
coded encoded encoded and this is
exactly what i wanted it to do so let's
get this instead of rendering to my
response let's get this rendering we
just want the string output so Express
comes with HJs which is hogan for
express so we actually want to do this
Hogan compiling manually so we're going
to go npm install flag s hogan j s and
so that's installing hogan j s so now we
can go there hogan equals require Hogan
Jess it's going to give me the Hogan J s
library and I also want to access the
file system because I want to grab that
file directly there FS equals require FS
which is the file system node.js module
that comes baked into note so we're
going to do is we're going to get the
file compile the template we're going to
do those outside of the route because we
want to do these once the once the
application boots up we don't want to
have to get the file and compile the
template every single request so we're
going to bump those up here and then
right here we are going to render the
template so let's go ahead and get file
very template equals FS dot read file
sync views email hjs and you also go
fullscreen here you also need to do
utf-8 which is what you want to do if
you ever want to get the
contents out of a file and pass it into
a variable so now we want to compile the
templates very compiled equals Hogan
compile there we go so now I've compiled
the template you don't really have to
know what that does you can look it up
and see and so now I can run my compiled
templates so I can go compiled templates
dot render that could be that could come
from query piramide de base whatever I'm
just going to print that object there so
now we should be good let me restart my
nodejs app nope not MPM install IBM
starts of course I did something wrong
what did I do I put a semicolon there
and p.m. starts and let's just go to
root so it should send me an HTML email
says woohoo let's see if I got one one
two three four about four or five
seconds thanks will yippee so that came
through it templated my name in and it
sent me an HTML email okay so that's a
basic HTML email example now how do I do
two things one how do i code this thing
for for all the email clients and then
how do I also tool this to make the
workflow a little better let's tackle
the coding issue I like using ink by
ZURB if you go to ZURB comm slash incas
herb is the people that make foundation
serve are the people that make
foundation which is kind of a bootstrap
competitor and they have ink which is
this cool email service for you so a
couple rules with email is one you
actually can't define styles like this
and have it be compliant across devices
you also can't do classes you can't
define a class like an H once a special
class assign that to here and have those
styles make it you have to inline all of
your styles which means you can't go
font-weight:bold you have to go style
font-weight:bold
so you have to inline them like that now
you don't want to have to do that
yourself you want to let an inline or do
it for you
so let's strike that let's say I did all
my coding just the way I did before I
can actually copy this out and what ink
is going to provide you is they're going
to provide you three things they're
going to give you some built in
templates they're going to give you
responsive classes and they're going to
give you an in liner that will convert
all that for you so I can actually paste
any old HTML in here and just use the in
liner if I want you can see it struck
out my style tag and now the style is
printed inline nice so that'll work that
will be a lot more cross client
compliant and so let's also look at
their email templates super nice let's
preview this sidebar here oh one this is
a nice responsive email template it's
also got responsive images which is
super cool so those images are going to
resize for me and so I want to use this
guy let's view the source and one other
terrible thing you're going to notice is
tables yes you have to code in tables if
you want a good-looking HTML email I'm
so sorry I didn't create it please
forgive whoever did so let's copy this
guy out real quick real quick and you
can also see here some of the here's
some of the classes that they give you
six columns twelve columns so it's
pretty similar if you're used to
bootstrap it feels a lot like that you
can read the docs and find out more I
suggest just starting off with a
template that you like and going from
there so I can actually use this guy do
the inliner let's paste my HTML there
let's convert it and look at this horrid
thing it made for me look how many
Styles you have to have in line on every
single tag just to make it work well so
that's that let's uh am I still running
here
yeah I'm still running let's go ahead
and resend this to myself and see what
that responsive template looks like in
my email client should come in any
second there we go
ah I forgot to reboot my app I always
forget to do that there you go reboot my
app send it again
a couple more seconds here and once
again this is not super fun to maintain
I still don't want to go this workflow
so I'll show you a great tool here in a
second there you go I got this nice
responsive images grow and shrink it's
lots of fun as I grow that out more
it'll all look nice so and by the way if
I did not run this through the inliner
this would not look good so what kind of
tooling can I do to help my workflow out
well once again ZURB has this great tool
and it's called generators herb Inc
which is for yeoman if you don't know
what yeoman is you're going to want to
stop right now watch my video on yeoman
I think a lot of you guys have probably
seen it so let's go ahead and install
that the command would be NPM install -
G generator generate or ZURB Inc so
that's going to install it I already
have it installed so I'm not going to
run that and then let's make a directory
CD Inc and now I can just go yo ZURB Inc
there we go and it lets you pick one of
the templates which are those ones we
saw so I had picked sidebar here let's
pick sidebar here oh this is going to
take I don't know about 20 seconds so
I'm going to let it run I'll be right
back okay I'm back that probably took
about 25 seconds and let's look what it
generated for me sublime let's open you
up so I have this whole index study
shemail here's the entire template that
I got in it pulled out all of Serbs Inc
styles into a file that I no longer need
and it also pulled styles into a style
CSS so now I can build like I would with
a normal web page you can add as many
styles in there as you want and you can
do your HTML and it feels a lot more
like good development only thing I have
to run before I use it this is important
is you've got to run Bower install
because for whatever reason the
generator doesn't run that for you so I
ran Bower install and now I can just do
gulp it uses gulp instead of grunt you
can see I'm listening on port 8080 so
let's go and grab that so now I have a
lot
reload workflow for my HTML email
designing there we go let's say I don't
want to welcome Daniel all of an I'll
welcome will there we go and so of
course I'm actually going to mustache
this into first name there you go so
let's say I tweaked it let's say I added
a bunch of great stuff I'm saving it now
that I'm done I just run gulp build and
that's going to do all the inlining for
me super fast and now I can look at
build index.html here's my fully in
lined mess of an email and it kept all
the mustache Inge let's see it kept all
the mustache insert points there and so
now I can just copy that out paste it
into my finished template and I'm done
so that is how I will do responsive
cross device cross email client rich
HTML emails gosh that's a mouthful I
could barely get it out hope that helped
you out have an excellent day and I'll
catch you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
