favorite video of the year every year
it's the video of where I really cover
what does it take to be a great web
developer this year and it covers the
basics for people getting into web
development what do you need to learn in
in what order do you need to learn it
and it also covers for people who are
currently front-end or back-end
engineers or DevOps engineers what do
you need to learn this year to keep your
skillset really current so I'm excited
about it there's three things I want to
cover real quick up front one the link
to this mind map right here on coggle is
in the description so that way
everything that's blue is a link to a
video that I have or a course that I
have or some great information on the
web so you want to click on that once
you watch this when you're actually
learning all these things because I have
a lot of videos covered already as you
can see also there's some links in the
description to the different areas so
you can jump straight to an area of your
expertise if you're already say a
front-end engineer and lastly all the
opinions on here are my own absolutely
none of them are bought and paid for I
do not recommend anything on here
because someone gives me money to do so
that's very very important to mention I
do have one link that's an affiliate
link but it's on there I've been
recommending them for a long time anyway
and I'll tell you what that link is so
let's begin you want to become a web
developer in 2018 what does this
landscape look like well you're gonna
learn basic front-end development and
then you're gonna become either a
front-end engineer which is this road up
here which I'll show you or you're gonna
become a back-end engineer and you can
actually learn both and become what's
called a full stack engineer if I were
to give you my recommendation I would
say learn basic front-end you have to do
this anyway you need to start with
learning basic front-end then become a
JavaScript slash front-end engineer and
then become a full-stack JavaScript
engineer and then learn other back-end
languages I'll go into more that detail
later on as we go along but that's my
recommended path in 2018 for what's
gonna be the best for you the best for
your job opportunities and all that so
if you're learning today you want to
become a web developer in 2018 this is
what you need to do start off by
clicking on this link and learning basic
HTML
it's really easy to learn you're gonna
learn HTML CSS and basic JavaScript so
HTML is content for a web page every web
page you go to is made in HTML it's
basic content without CSS which is style
cascading style sheets which is what
that stands for you're just gonna be
able to create ugly ugly ugly content so
then as soon as you learned the real
basics of HTML which you can get
comfortable in in just a few hours then
you're gonna start learning CSS you want
to start making that content look pretty
and beautiful so you're gonna start by
learning the basics of CSS then you're
gonna learn how to do layouts you're
gonna use grid mostly grid and flexbox
these days then you want to learn how to
do responsive design responsive means
that that same HTML will look different
and display different on an iPhone than
it will on a big old desktop computer
that's called responsive and then
responsive images and CSS animation you
honestly probably don't have to learn
too much in CSS animation for the basics
but that's kind of your basic CSS skill
set and so again you learn basic HTML
then learn CSS and the rest of HTML
together as you go so once you have
those down then you're gonna start
learning basic JavaScript now javascript
is the function to a web page so say on
Twitter you go and add a new tweet it
shows up in your timeline right away it
just appears on the page that's
JavaScript - doing all those smarts
let's say you reply to a tweet and then
it somehow goes and notifies everybody
else's phones well JavaScript is telling
that webpage hey send out this new tweet
that's the function JavaScript is also a
programming language so this is where
you start to learn basic programming and
here's kind of the things you'll want to
learn on here I won't go through really
what they are you can learn them as you
go jQuery is on here you don't really
need to learn jQuery anymore but I put
it on the list because the skill sets
there are jobs for just this skill set
here and they tend to know HTML CSS and
oftentimes those companies will use
jQuery so it's a decent thing to
familiarize yourself with while you're
at this stage I call this the website
developer stage you can create websites
but you can't necessarily create web
apps like you couldn't go create Twitter
but you do know how to create like a
brochure site you know it has flat
information maybe for a small business
or restaurant or something so this is a
skill set you can start getting work for
you can start making money maybe even
get a full-time job and then as you go
down one of these two paths and then you
can really become a career web developer
so that's basic front-end that's what it
takes to do basic front-end in 2018 so
then as you pick a path again I
recommend this path first and then back
end but as you pick a path you're gonna
want to learn this to-do list as you go
you don't have to learn it all overnight
but you do want to learn them as you're
going this is kind of just like a
learning list for you so by the time you
become a full front-end engineer you'll
kind of learn these things you want to
learn how to use the terminal you don't
have to master it but you do want to
feel comfortable there if you're not
comfortable in the terminal in the
console you will start being held back
as you go deeper so terminals something
you want to lose you'll want to learn
it's a little intimidating at first but
you pick it up really quickly then
you're gonna want to learn basic SSH and
then how to put files onto a web server
with SSH then you're gonna wanna learn
github github is how the world tends to
store their code as a standard
professional developers tend to use git
and they tend to use github with get
there you can learn how client which is
like a web page and the server's talk to
each other there's two videos I put on
this link that are really really helpful
for people getting into web development
it's things that are very difficult to
know what you don't know into that took
me years to kind of pick up on that I've
compiled into two pretty short videos
that I really wish someone would have
told me when I was starting out learn
what a restful web service is that's
kind of something that you'll need to
learn as you become a front-end or
back-end engineer how you can kind of
talk client to server and then you want
to learn domain name and DNS basics just
a little bit more about what an a record
is what a cname record is stuff like
that and then lastly I guess I failed to
mention it the first
you want to be able to publish your HTML
CSS in basic JavaScript to a website
that's really important
I recommend Hostgator for this I've been
recommending them for a long time so I
finally did get an affiliate coupon code
with them so if you do click this link
or use this code I may make a buck off
of it so that is the one link on here
that I will mention is an affiliate link
so don't use it if you don't want to
there's these drop 25% and drop 10 bucks
codes but let's make a deal I think can
give you somewhere around 30 to 40% lots
of the time so that is again that is my
coupon code use it to your own peril and
so you want to learn basically how to
set up a website that's the easiest
place to do it
when you don't know what you're doing is
Hostgator they're also one of the
cheapest out there and then you want to
learn how to put your HTML CSS and
JavaScript on that website so that's
basic front-end once you've got that and
you're becoming a front-end developer
here's kind of the things you want to
learn this looks intimidating this is
not very intimidating in reality just
give me about one minute to explain why
here so you basically want to learn four
things when you're becoming a front-end
developer also known as a front-end
engineer or a web developer or a
JavaScript engineer or a react developer
or view developer those are kind of the
job titles you'll be searching for when
you know these things you're going to
upgrade your CSS skills
you're gonna upgrade your JavaScript
skills become a little bit more
confident as a programmer you're gonna
learn some build tools and you're gonna
learn one or more JavaScript frameworks
things like this you can learn in more
or less a day and then master in a week
same with a lot of things up here you
can learn so many of these things on
this list in a day at the most a week
this is going to be where most of your
learning is going to take place and
learning one of these frameworks so it's
really not that big of a deal so CSS
tools and skills these have been around
for years nothing's really changed here
sass lesser stylists are the pre
compilers you want to use they just add
extra functionality to CSS when it comes
to a CSS framework if you know CSS grid
you might not need a framework any
or being that you do need a framework
bootstrap or materialize are kind of the
two coolest ones these days I've not
gotten a lot of chance with the
brand-new bootstrap for I need to learn
that and do a video on that because it
does it's based on CSS grid so it's kind
of cool and then CSS organization is
something that that's useful in a lot of
arenas basically the methodologies for
what you name classes and what you call
your CSS things when you're developing
them those are kind of the three popular
CSS organization methodologies that you
want to learn again super easy to learn
and then you'll want to learn a
front-end build tool you want to be able
to take all your CSS and compile it up
and build it up NPM scripts are a great
way to do that I cover those in my no
js' course web pack is the number one
tool to use there used to be grunt and
gulp and web pack but honestly you just
kind of want to learn web pack these
days if you're gonna learn one other one
you could learn Gulf but web pack is
really just the one to know and then
here's a really good document from I
believe Mozilla on front-end performance
and and how to learn the areas to make
sure your front-end web site is
performant and put together really smart
so then once you learn that let's go to
JavaScript frameworks this is really the
biggest thing you want to learn to
become a front-end engineer front-end
developer is you want to learn how to
program well using a framework now the
one to know in 2018 is react j/s if
you're gonna learn one learn react boom
that is it react in view are the two
that I would tell you to learn in 2018
angular ember are still out there with
some jobs but not a lot of new
applications are being built in angular
and ember so I would say honestly don't
even worry about those unless you have
some spare time and you want to maybe
familiarize yourself with angular
because there's a decent bit of angular
jobs still out there reacting view are
the two things to know and so if I was
going to build a brand new web app today
if it was small like a single module I'd
do it in view just view just drop you on
the page you'll have your module done
it's gonna be fast it's gonna be easy
view is really great
and then as the app grows I'm going to
use maybe view with view this writer
view or next if it's going to be a
larger view app but honestly personal
opinion once it starts getting into
larger apps I'm gonna absolutely use
reacts just because if nothing else the
community solutions and help content
available react is is awesome react or
view can handle big apps really well but
react is the one to pick these days so
what do you do with react if I was doing
react relay or Apollo if you're gonna
use graph QL graph QL is a really cool
alternative to rest that's definitely
something you want to familiarize
yourself with these days
Apollo is probably my favorite I prefer
Apollo over relay and then next jsr
after jsr if you want to do server-side
rendered apps those are really good to
look into and then managing CSS and
react glamorous emotion or styled
components are kind of duking it out for
who's the best honestly they're all
going to get the job done well each has
their advantages and disadvantages but
anyway no real preference there overall
just kind of take a quick glance at all
of them but that's how you're going to
manage your CSS inside of react and then
you also want to look into state
management so this applies to multiple
different frameworks so with react you
don't want to keep all your data in the
react application you want to keep all
your data in mob X or redux and my
preference would be used mob X for
smaller applications and if they get
bigger and complicated and start to to
get a little shaky with how complex
you're doing things with data use Redux
at that point but lots of people default
to redux these days and you shouldn't
you should default to mob x because it's
way simpler you're gonna get more work
done in the day and you're going to
enjoy your developer life more because
there's a lot of ceremony to building
applications with redux and if you don't
need that to solve complexity code with
mob X if you're in the react ecosystem
you'll know what I mean
flux is good to know because that's kind
of where these two came from but you
don't really need to use flux these days
and rxjs and bacon jsrf unn
or learning functional programming kind
of up here and you can actually use a
lot of those methodologies in your other
apps as well and then you want to learn
unit testing how do I test my react.js
application how do I write tests that
can run against that app just is
definitely the one to use these days
mocha is also really really good and
it's been around for quite a while but
just is the one I would definitely go to
right off the bat so that's kind of your
JavaScript framework ecosystem at 2018
not a lot has changed
there's just maturity coming and view is
getting a lot more popular some other
fun things you can learn the really the
only one that's required on here is es6
if you do not know es6 you're gonna
start feeling pretty out of date in 2018
it's definitely something you need to
know which is technically es2015 es 2016
es 2017 those are those are the ones you
want to know static type checkers are
good to know but you don't have to know
these they're really really easy to
implement and functional programming
javascript is definitely something you
should kind of walk yourself through at
some point as well you don't need to
learn it right away so that's the front
end skill set your JavaScript engineer
or JavaScript developer at this point
although if you see a job for JavaScript
engineer lots of times that can mean
back-end JavaScript as well so be aware
of that all these other jobs are for
sure you know this skill set that I laid
out here so you've learned basic HTML
your front-end developer front-end
engineer at this point I would say the
next step you should do in your learning
process is learn nodejs so your full
stack JavaScript developer so you're
going to go to back-end now and you're
gonna start really learning how to build
out the server side of those
applications you've been building in
JavaScript and absolutely if you're
gonna pick one back-end language these
days pick node j/s it's one of the
easiest and fastest to learn if you
already know JavaScript it's gonna feel
really really natural nodejs with
express j/s is totally the thing to do
these days you're not going to go wrong
with it also I have a node.js course
because I absolutely believe in it so
much compiled a lot of great knowledge
into not just no J's but what it means
to be a back-end engineer
so if you're new to back in engineering
if you've been in this world for a while
this nodejs course is going to be really
really good for you a lot of key
software engineering concepts for the
back end are in here the job titles that
you're gonna end up looking for on the
back end maybe back in engineer back in
developer they're the same thing full
stack engineer full stack developer full
stack usually means you know at least
react or view or angular or something
and then it might just be called a
software developer and but honestly most
often it's going to be the language you
know so you're looking for an ojs
developer job no js' engineer job a Ruby
job or a dotnet job they might also be
called a platform engineer or a DBA if
you're just databases what I clicked on
something what did that do okay but DBAs
are people who just love and live and
breathe databases and I don't quite
understand those people but they are
very valuable so DBA is something else
that's out there so these are all kind
of the popular languages and honestly
there's many many more so many back-end
languages so what I'd say is start with
nodejs don't learn these ones for now
don't learn any of the other scripting
languages if you know nodejs instead
learn a scripting language and then to
expand your horizons learn maybe a
functional language a high-performance
language notable others we'll get to
that in a second so if I were if I were
to say what language is plural should I
learn nodejs first from there I would do
golang and then from there I would do
closure if I'm just gonna give you my
opinion learn that first learn that
second learn that third if there's all
sorts of great stuff out there that's
that pays well that has lots of job
opportunity but these are going to be
the ones that I think are going to set
you up for success the best in 2018 Java
and c-sharp net are on here because
there's a lot of jobs for that but these
worlds are interesting job has been
around for a long time and I don't
recommend people to learn these at least
not early on because you might get bad
practices you might get a bad way of
doing things or you might get
way of doing things they're just a
really mixed bag in these two ecosystems
so I say don't learn those right off you
can look at them later on and then you
go maybe have more opinions there's
there's a lot of bad Java out there and
there's a lot of bad dotnet out there
and then there's a lot of good as well
so that's that's why I don't ever
recommend those to people who are
learning one cool thing to learn is
server lists and AWS lambda that's a
really really cool thing to learn these
days it's very very useful to know I
mean it's a lot of fun to look into
serverless architectures so what'd you
do I did it again a zoomed in or
something so what you do when you're
learning a new language is you're gonna
say I'm learning nodejs you're going to
learn basically these things with the
language you're going to look up what
are they used for package management
what are they used for unit functional
testing so and it's easy to find on
Google you know functional testing with
JavaScript functional testing with
golang unit testing with golang you know
unit functional testing with closure you
basically can Google all of these things
here you want to learn how do you build
a restful api how do you build a graph
QL API what are some security best
practices all these things these are the
things you will want to learn for each
language and honestly the most difficult
thing when you're learning a new
back-end programming language is not so
much the language itself it's oftentimes
the ecosystem it's knowing what is
considered standard so like what is the
most popular node.js package for working
with a my sequel database what's the
most popular one for working with
another database you know how do know
Jase engineers tend to set up their
projects these are things that just take
a while of getting involved in the
community to learn how that works so you
tend to feel like a fish out of water
for the first couple weeks learning a
new back-end language but once you kind
of learn the standard ways of of doing
things it really you really start to
feel at home quickly and then you also
want to learn these databases you want
to learn these databases how to connect
to them and interact with them for each
language you do you'll also want to know
how to set them up so start up here
learn my sequel that's totally the
easiest and best way to start Postgres
is in many ways very
very similar to my sequel so if you know
one you in many ways know the other so
you want to learn relational databases
and then you want to learn a no sequel
database that's kind of these two lines
here Redis you tend to use for caching
and for you know keeping track of users
sessions interacting with your
application Cassandra can also be used
for that Cassandra also finds its home
on this line down here document
databases search engine databases
elastic search and solar are the most
popular graph databases are a very cool
kind of newer thing they've been around
for a little while but they're getting
more popular these days neo4j orient DB
there's there's several others but those
are two very cool ones to look at and
then message brokers it's kind of a
different way that applications can
communicate with each other aside from
making either restful or graph QL API
requests they can communicate over
messaging bus this is especially useful
over really large and complex
applications so RabbitMQ 0 mq and Kafka
are three very popular message brokers
so if you know all those things in one
or two languages I mean you're doing
good if you know all these things in one
language you're doing good that's kind
of the backends developer skill set for
2018 so if you're really confident as a
back-end developer another area you can
look into is DevOps which I've covered
in the past as well this is kind of like
back-end developer 2.0 slash a really
niche area of being a back-end developer
where you're just really really good at
deploying and helping teams deploy
applications in a professional way so to
be a DevOps engineer you need to know
some intra infrastructure platforms AWS
is probably the best one to learn if
you're just gonna learn one learn AWS
it's going to put you in the most demand
and it's going to pay the best as your
Google Cloud really good digital ocean
is great for simpler smaller
infrastructure simpler smaller companies
and you can learn how to do server
management also called CM or
configuration management the number one
thing you got to learn these days is
docker and then ansible is a good thing
to learn as well there's salt puppet and
chef puppet and chef tend to be used on
more enterprise level size of things but
they're good to know but if you learn
docker and ansible you've got a
skill sets as well and those are those
are totally the ways to do it so doctors
basically going to help you package up
an application into a container that you
can just put all over the place you can
run that same container here or here or
here or here or on 20 servers on one
server docker is awesome you need to
know docker honestly even if you're back
in engineer you should know docker these
days it's very very important and then
CI pipelines continuous integration
continuous deployment making apps deploy
as you merge code to github really cool
solutions for that circle CI in code
ship those are ones that are hosted you
know you pay monthly and they take care
of it all for you or you can install
stuff on your own servers and
infrastructure Jenkins is probably the
most popular but the oldest drone CI is
a lot of fun but the least feature full
its docker native so it's it's really
lightweight and the way it runs I like
drone it's a lot of fun get lab is that
also a very cool solution that's that's
very all-encompassing so your whole tech
company either uses get lab or they
don't tends to be how it works and then
when you learn docker Dockers really
settled in the last couple years so
docker used to have all this change in
traction and stuff going on and it's
really settled into some stability here
one I have a course with O'Reilly on
docker and then if you're building out
something small-scale you want to use
docker swarm maybe docker cloud if
you're building out something medium
scale what would normally be what say
twelve servers if you weren't using
docker Rancher is a great easy solution
for running kubernetes without having to
worry about running kubernetes and then
dr. datacenter universal control plane
are good if you're more enterprise level
which is good and then if you're doing
stuff big scale kubernetes or mezzos are
really the two things to use with
kubernetes really being the one to use
so if you learn docker with kubernetes
that's that's a great skill set for
devops these days lots of demand at all
sorts of companies so huh there's deep
breath that's what it takes to be a
software engineer web developer these
days obviously so much more always you
could talk about this stuff for
but that's what you want to know that
you you learn these things you're going
to be in demand you're going to get jobs
and you're gonna have a lot of fun
working with fun high-tech solutions so
hope you enjoyed this video leave a
comment tell me what you any questions
you have on any of the stuff that I
covered and have yourselves a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
