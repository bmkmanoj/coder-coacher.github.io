how do I get my website online once I've
coded it here's a website I've got
here's the files for it and I can view
it in Chrome but I want to get this
thing online with its own domain name
we're going to cover that in this email
and it's a lot simpler than you might
think here's the steps one you got to
get a domain if you don't have one
that's going to be about twelve dollars
a month
twelve dollars a year I'm sorry and then
you got to get a web host
that's about roughly five dollars a
month we're going to do one that's six
dollars a month because you get
unlimited domain names with this one I
recommend for a web host going with
hostgator.com I have some codes for that
these guys tend to be the cheapest and
they have great customer support so
you're going to get a lot out of them I
mean you can also use drop 25 perk drop
25 percent coupon code to save 25
percent or you can do drop 10 bucks
and save 10 bucks on that so we're going
to go through that process of what all
that looks like so you're comfortable
before you start it you're going to
upload your files and they're going to
dance and rejoice because your web site
is alive that's pretty much it to upload
your files I recommend cyberduck I think
it's just a great simple free program
and that's it so let's get into
Hostgator and do step 1 alright so here
we are at hostgator.com and once again
after 15 years as a professional web
developer for starting off web sites
these are kind of the best company I
could ever recommend I've used well over
a dozen helped a lot of people that are
using other hosts and this just has the
best for the price if you go to web
hosting we're going to get our domain
and our web hosting at the same time you
have two choices you can go single
domain that's the cheapest but if you
bump it up like two dollars a month or I
guess three dollars if you're good at
math 350 you can get unlimited domains
which means you can have all the
websites you want as long as you pay for
the domain name and this is definitely
the one I'd recommend that way if you
want to add your brothers website
anybody else's website you can do it for
free they just have to buy the domain
let's go Will's awesome site Will's
awesome site is available so wills
awesome site calm I'm actually going to
buy this
and let it expire so here we go I'm
going to do a one month baby package if
you did the 36 months you can apply that
big drop 25% coupon on there and that's
going to save like $75 but I wouldn't do
that I'm not going to do that for this
example since this is a fake website I'm
never going to use I'm just going to do
one month and I'm just going to do drop
ten bucks to actually bring that down
and then I'm going to uncheck all these
add-ons you do not need these add-ons I
never ever recommend for anybody to do
these add-ons so there we go that brings
us down to a total of twelve dollars
which is basically the cost of our
domain name and the first month of
hosting is free I'm going to fill out
all my billing information and I'll be
right back alright we're successful I
was able to register for the hosting and
now I've gotten this email which you
will want to guard with your life
because this is all the server
information and this is what you want to
pass on to somebody else if the website
ever changes hands this is basically
server access here's kind of what it is
is this is our control panel where you
can edit a lot of stuff install
WordPress add email addresses for your
domain name you just got this is your
username and your password to login to
the website that's my domain which off I
click there it does not work yet because
the domain takes 1 to 24 hours to do
what's called propagation so it can
happen as fast as an hour but I'd give
it a full day and then your server IP
this is actually your server that this
domain name now points to and so we can
actually access the server with this IP
until our domain name propagates so
let's go ahead and copy the server IP
let's go ahead and crank open cyberduck
and hit open connection we're going to
connect to the server now in the future
we can use wills awesome site comm but
once again that's not propagated yet so
cyberduck won't be able to connect to it
either let's copy the username
let's copy the password and then we're
sometimes you if you run into any errors
here you may need to change your
necked mode to passive FTP so if you run
any problems do that so here we go I've
connected to my server and if I go to
www.hsn but my yes don't show again I
want to switch to secure so there you go
all the files are now copying over to my
webs my web host and that's pretty much
it
the way we can connect to it and see if
that worked is let's go and copy the
server IP here's kind of a quick
workaround is you can go to your
username which it made will stir it cut
off the end so I can now go to my IP
address slash tilde will stir and this
will be my website there we go I had hit
refresh because it was still in the
process of uploading there you go and
that's it my website is now online and
within 24 hours I can go to what is it
again Will's awesome site calm and hit
refresh website let me actually prove it
to you that this is what happened I'm
going to go change this learn code is
awesome let me change it what does that
learn code rocks really rocks there we
go
let's go ahead and read rag my new
index.html file up it's probably going
to ask me if I want to replace it yep I
do want to replace it let's hit refresh
and now learn code really rocks and that
is how you put your website online hope
you enjoyed the lesson and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
