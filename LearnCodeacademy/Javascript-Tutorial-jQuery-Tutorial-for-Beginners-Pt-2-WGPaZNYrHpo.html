about learning JavaScript if you missed
lesson number one you might want to
watch it the links in the footer or I'll
put an annotation on here somewhere
we're just going to keep moving forward
so we are now into a super basic website
have it up over here and it's going to
automatically reload as I enter stuff
you might have to tab over and hit
reload what I'm going to do here is I'm
just going to create a script tag and
whenever I add a script tag by default
that's going to be JavaScript straight
in my page and so I'm going to go alert
you'll notice the blind gives me cool
nice new colors that's very nice so now
if I hit save up my page reloads and hit
hi there every time I reload my page
it's going to say hi there so we're
using the exact same code that you can
use here in the console and we're now
just putting it in the page I can also
do console.log hi there so that's kind
of the use of console.log because it's a
way to kind of debug when stuffs
breaking and you don't know what's going
on you can spit stuff out to your
console and your normal user doesn't see
it but you can open your console and see
there your notes to yourself as to what
kind of stuff is going on so that's kind
of how you do JavaScript right there on
your page and let's go ahead and load up
what's called jQuery if you go to jQuery
comm jQuery is what's called a library
and it gives you some great ways to do
stuff very very easily actually we're
going to go to code jQuery comm because
we just want to get the actual code and
you can click on minified and there we
go
I just want the link right there I'm
going to copy the link and right down
here and the bottom of my page now we'll
just go and add scripts and source
equals and then paste that link you got
there awesome so now jQuery is going to
load in onto my page hit refresh you
don't notice anything because jQuery
doesn't actually do anything it just
gives you a bunch of predefined
variables remember
about variables and commands kind of
gives you a bunch of predefined things
that you can use so here I'm going to
make my own script after jQuery because
we want to make sure we're doing this
after jQuery otherwise jQuery won't be
loaded yet and now you can do some
things like jQuery sign is the dollar
sign this is basically the main function
you get I can go jQuery da I can go
jQuery and I'm going to look for the tag
of header and these are just like CSS
selectors that's the beauty of jQuery
I'm going to go header h1 dot HTML and
I'm going to change the HTML of header
h1 1 once again this looks just like CSS
doesn't it that's why everybody loves
jQuery I'm going to go my awesome site
I'm going to save you notice it starts
off at my site and it instantly goes
blip my awesome site so now we are real
time changing stuff in jQuery which is
our using javascript let's go ahead and
do this I'm going to go ul Li I'm going
to go same thing milk eggs and I'll just
leave that there
so ul I made that a UI denied whoops ul
Li let's try doing something else let's
go
ul that'll just find an element just
like CSS again and I'm going to do
append a pen means we're going to add
another thing in there veggies and I'm
just going to put some straight HTML
code in there so you l it's now going to
add an li to my UL with veggies so there
you go milk eggs and now veggies is in
there even though it's not in the code
I'm going to copy and paste this now we
got a lot of veggies so you can add a
whole lot of things this is kind of
where the web like said really starts
getting fun because now you're changing
your web page real time I can also come
over here this will be a lot more fun
let's do it like this
let's do in the console nice and so then
I can go I'm going to go let's clean
this thing out ul HTML let's just give
it a single li when you hit HTML it's
going to completely it's going to
completely wipe out what's in there and
it's going to give it all new stuff so
there we go now I completely wiped out
my HTML or you can and I added it li in
there so now we're real-time starting to
mess with our stuff instead of a pen
let's say I wanted to add something
before milk then you can do this ul
prepend now eggs showed up before milk
because a prepend is basically going to
do it at the very beginning of my
element upend is going to go at the very
end gosh there's some other things and
the other great thing about jQuery is it
just all makes sense if I go ul Li then
and just hit enter down here then you'll
notice it gives me an array of all my
elements I can go ul Li EQ and this is
going to get and it's going to get an
index so EQ 0 so I'm just getting the
zero index of that if you guys remember
from doing JavaScript EQ one is milk so
I can go li EQ one remove and it's gone
then I can go Li eq0 remove and it's
gone so that's going to be super basics
of how you can use jQuery to start
changing all sorts of stuff in your
website let's uh let's add a link and
let's make a link do something smart I'm
going to make this href equal pound
because we're not going to go anywhere
with this this is just going to be a
link actually I'll just do a button
this button will be ID add one so
there's a button that says add one it
does absolutely nothing so now what you
can do with jQuery though is you can go
let's grab add one I'm going to go click
and this is the one thing you'll have to
remember here function and then this
syntax just feels really weird so you're
doing click and then you're typing
function open closed brackets this is
probably one of the weirder things if
you're brand new it's like oh man this
looks crazy and confusing you just
memorize it and then you're done with it
so type it out ten times in a row to
force yourself to memorize it and you're
going to be okay now whatever you add in
here is going to happen whenever the
function whenever it gets clicked so
whenever I click on add one it's going
to do all this fun stuff so if that
makes sense
and then I'm going to space it so it's
clear so now when I click this it's
actually going to add a whole lot of hit
geez let me just do it where it does it
once so now every time I do this it's
going to add a row of veggies don't know
why did that sound let's make this get
even smarter if I'm not going too fast
for you I'd rather go too fast so you
feel like you're drowning and then all
of a sudden you wake up and realize wow
I know quite a bit of JavaScript already
you can always rewatch the video so I'm
going to do an input which is a let me
give this one an ID you'll see what an
input is here soon
name I'll just call it ID equals name so
that's what an input is it's you've seen
them in forms all over the place they
allow you to input stuff we didn't talk
about them before because we didn't have
JavaScript to do anything smart with
them so I had an input named name with
an ID of name and the button add 1 so
when add one clicks let's do this
let's go we're going to go
their vowel U equals not Val and dot
vowel gets the value of name it'll give
the value of any input so here let me do
this watch and delete this and then I'm
going to go alert value so now let me
type in whatever here ah alert test so
now I've grabbed my value out of name
remember because my ID is name here so
whenever I click on add one then it's
going to say value equals names value
I'm going to alert it or if you want you
can console.log it now it's going to
pair my console so that's kind of how
that's going to work so I've I've
grabbed my value out and now I'm going
to go ul append and here's where where
I'm going to do a string let me show you
real quick about so I want to go Li and
I want the value to be in here and this
will not work this will just say value
value value great it's actually putting
a string of value I want it to get that
in there let me come over here and show
you how you insert different strings
together if I go name plus value well
now it says name value so I can actually
go name space plus value and that's kind
of how you can add two strings together
into one what happens if I go name plus
20 so now I'm adding a string plus a
number JavaScript is smart enough to say
okay treat the number as a string
because clearly you can't add name to 20
so that's kind of how you add stuff
together so I'm going to do Li and then
I'm going to go plus
I'm going to go and ending Li so I've
got a string we're going to add in the
string we're gonna add it to our other
string so now let's give this guy a try
so now I go veggies I get add one ha
boom I feel like we're doing real
programming here this is awesome and
let's pick up some friends at the store
because who wants to go shopping with
friends I do I do
that's kind of your very very very very
basics of using jQuery alright if you
can see but jQuery kind of makes it
pretty easy this is the most complicated
bit of jargon we had to memorize it
actually feels like code function open
close what the heck does that do and now
get into functions here before I let you
go for today let's go back to our
console real quick let's say jQuery is
all good and all let's describe this so
you understand what that means I'm gonna
actually we know that we can describe we
can do variable name equals 30 age
equals 30 and now names defined so I can
a name equals will so I want to do a
function that alerts both of these or I
want to do something that's reusable
those are called functions when we do
alert that's just a function that does
something so I can go function alert
name remember I told you there's about
six types in JavaScript well here's your
next type it's called function alert
name and that's you notice that looks
pretty similar function alert name and
this is going to go alert name so now I
just go alert name there you go and it's
always going to alert the name let's say
I want it to do something a little
smarter than that plus let's call this
an alert name plus age let me add a
space there there you go now this is
going to alert name plus age so now I go
alert oh it already knows that it exists
will 30 so now I'm kind of defining this
thing that does something for me and so
that's what's going on here is when you
the actual official JavaScript click is
that but then it needs to know what do I
do when you click I need to do something
so we're creating what's called an
anonymous function we're creating a
function right now with no name to it I
mean you can give it a name add value
you can use the exact same thing we're
using here function alert name add value
and that's what we're doing we're just
creating a function we're saying do this
stuff right now this name is completely
pointless because you're never going to
call it again but this works there you
go and then this works and so that's
kind of a little explanation of why we
added that we're creating a function and
we're giving it some functionality a one
other thing and this is the last thing
since you've got a lot to learn and you
probably want to go have some fun last
thing with functions that you can do is
you can give them arguments remember if
you do alert let's just going to do a
blank alerts and then you can get it
something to alert you can give it your
argument of 30 or I can say nay age
equals 30 now I can give it an argument
how do we do that will you just go
function I'll just go alert this plus 10
and then I'll say I'm giving it a
variable name here I want you to give me
I'm just going to call it the thing and
then we're just going to go alert the
thing plus 10 so now whatever we pass it
is going to be referenced as the thing
whenever we're inside the function this
is going to kind of be what Ben's your
brain a little bit show you how this
works
alert this plus 10 and I'm going to just
say 10
r20 it's going to alert 30 why is it
doing that because I said alert this +10
and I gave it 20 so now the function
fires the function alert this +10 fires
and it calls the thing equals 20 it kind
of creates that variable for us so that
it's going to alert 20 plus 10 because
we gave it 20 and called it the thing
you can call that whatever you want I'll
call it Val for value that was kind of
something developers will say a lot so I
can go val plus 10 now I say alert this
plus 10 20 exact same thing it doesn't
care what you call this it just knows
that whatever the first thing you give
it is going to be called Val you can
actually do several things together add
these together Val 1 Val to alert val 1
plus val to that's what it's going to do
and what did I type wrong oh I didn't
spell function right there we go
version ok so now if I go add these
together there we go I still get 30 10
30 now I got 40 because it doesn't it
doesn't care what those two things are
this function just goes take Val 1 take
Val to add them together and alert up so
that's kind of functions and I'm
definitely going to leave you there
because I hit you with way too much this
should have been two lessons but oh well
please forgive me have some fun with
jQuery write a couple functions annoy
your friends with a million alerts and
have an awesome day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
