detour from the coding videos to show
you guys a intro to github Adam text
editor which I just got my beta invite
to a few days ago so this isn't even
publicly released yet but I wanted to
kind of give you guys some insight on
how great this editor is I am thoroughly
impressed after the last few days and
honestly once a couple little bugs get
fixed that are already in the works on
getting fixed I will be switching to
this as my primary editor because it is
awesome you guys probably know I'm
historically a huge sublime text guy I
swear by it and if you like sublime text
you're just going to fall in love with
Adam is my my guess so we'll just kind
of show you around
so you'll notice right away feels really
at home with sublime text the tabbing
even just feels really really sublime II
which is great to me I feel right at
home one of the great things right out
of the box you'll notice is some colors
here it's automatically built in with a
git differ so you're going to notice
these are orange because I made a change
to my main J s so it's really great and
you'll also notice that any folders that
are get ignored are grayed out anything
that's in the get ignore file is applied
to the colors and the themes can make
use of that information so those are two
big wins for me right off because those
are really nice to have I can do Apple
shift P and do all commands just like
you can and sublime love that they give
you the hotkeys there I can do Apple P
and I can automatically search for any
file and that's super nice and then
Apple P just like sublime text will give
you your most recent history at the top
as well or any open files so you can use
Apple pita hot switch back and forth
between your most recent files if you
just hit Apple P and then enter so
that's really cool what are some other
great features most of the hotkeys that
you're going to be using its sublime are
going to work like apple d to
automatically do multiple cursors so
I've got some multiple cursor selected
here by hitting Apple D a few times
probably can't see that let me see if I
can get you a better
let's see padding will probably work
padding Apple D a couple times and now I
can go margin so that's nice for
multiple cursors really most anything so
far you'll notice the dips are right
there flagged super nice most anything
that you can do in sublime you can do
with Adam let's look at the preferences
real quick automatically has package
manager built-in really great the
packages are built in CoffeeScript Adams
built on nodes so this is going to be a
really easy text editor to hack and
build packages for I can't wait to start
building some packages for this also
your themes here a really cool feature
is you can theme the UI so if you guys
are weird and like your light UI you can
do that and feel all cool and then you
can also do dark if you for whatever
reason you're like me so let's install a
Dracula theme Dracula there we go
Dracula theme let's get that guy
installed H installed and now we're
rockin with Dracula so super easy to
work with let's look at one of the
coolest features of the atom is that it
gives you some command-line tools so any
folder you're in I'll go ahead and close
this out don't save anything I can just
go at them and it's going to
automatically open up the folder that I
was in one of the bugs there in the
process of fixing is that when you do it
this way you're not going to see your
get dipping but that is already a bug
request and they're working on that you
can also go Adam grunt file that's just
going to open the file you're in super
cool you can give it several different
Flags you can tell it to open in the
foreground if you go Adam help you can
see that you can open it in a new window
you can log output you can run
development mode super cool another
thing that give you is the APM command
which is your atom package package
managers I can go a p.m. list I can see
all the default packages and I can also
see any user packages which is my
Dracula theme so I can uninstall that
Dracula theme
I can probably do a p.m. search mano kai
- yep there you go so I can install this
theme from here so really gives you some
cool features out of the box you can add
the atom command for sublime I use sub-4
the exact same features so it's not
stuff that you absolutely can't get with
sublime these aren't features you can't
add into sublime but really out of the
box they just give them all to you which
I am loving so there's your first take
on atom editor I'm really liking it I
uninstalled my Dracula theme so that's
not working now but out of the box I'm
saying
way to go github this editor is cool and
I am hands-down a fan have a great day
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
