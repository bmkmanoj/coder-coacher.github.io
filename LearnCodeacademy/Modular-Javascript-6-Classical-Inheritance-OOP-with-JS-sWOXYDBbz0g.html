going to cover our patterns that allow
instantiation and inheritance now those
are some big words if you're not used to
them instantiation just means we want to
be able to make multiple copies of this
object we want to create a module once
and then make many copies of it you see
things like this say Pinterest every pin
as you scroll down is probably using the
same logic you don't have a billion
revealing modules all with different
names for each pin you've probably
created one module that's a pin module
and then you're creating multiple pins
from that same kind of thing if you're
scrolling through a list of friends on
Facebook you know you have a follow
button for each friend you have an
ignore or a you know block or an
unfriend button and so you write all
that functionality in one module and
then you can create a bunch of different
copies of that that's called
instantiation because you're making a
bunch of instances of one thing so
instantiate instances and then also with
this is inheritance and we'll cover that
a little bit later so there's several
patterns for instantiation and
inheritance we'll cover those there's
pretty much the two common ones are
classical and prototypal there
absolutely is the concept of classes in
JavaScript it just looks a little
different than you know class extends
some other class like you'd see in most
languages so that is in JavaScript and
that's basically what we're going to be
covering so lots of times people will
call something prototypal and they're
really meaning classical because this is
its own kind of slightly tweaked way of
doing classical inheritance but for this
video we'll be covering classical in the
next video I'll show you the difference
so basically to do inheritance you'll do
something like this let's say we'll take
the Facebook example let's go ver person
and you're going to want to make it an
uppercase you know it's going to be a
capitalized and the reason is it's a
constructor this is not a actual running
module this is the master module that
will create all of our modules so the
the absolutely normally standard usage
is that you're going to capitalize the
name of a
instructor so it's going to be a
function so this is basically our class
if you want to think of it as this this
is our class it's not an instance of a
class but this is our class and then
later on you can go there John equals
new person okay so there we go now we've
made a class it's a function and then
down here is a copy or a creation I can
also then go ver Bobby equals new person
so now I've created a John person and a
Bobby person with basically no
functionality so let's actually add some
features to this module now let's say
when we create a new person well we got
to give them a name so there's John and
there's Bobby and then this actually
receives a name and so within this
function so when you when you do new
basically this function is going to run
and then it's going to return an object
and so within function the work the
keyword this refers to the object that
you're creating right now so when I'm
doing new person this is equal to John
that I'm about to make and then new
person Bobby this is equal to Bobby so
basically if I say this name equals name
well now John name is John Bobby not
name is Bobby
so later down here are say alerts got
all of those alerts John name well
that's going to alert John so there we
go that's how that works
now let's go ahead and now add some
functionality to this so we go person so
when I did this real quick basically
when you create a constructor then it
has it creates what's called a prototype
for you so person dot prototype and this
is what always scared me this is this is
the pattern that I stayed away from when
I was learning JavaScript because there
were just words that kind of freaked me
out
things like prototype okay that sounds
really weird I'm going to stay away from
this pattern for a while I'm going to
stick to revealing modules for a while
because it feels comfortable if you get
over the weird word you'll actually find
that this is just as easy as any other
pattern so basically this got created
automatically an empty object person
prototype so
nothing is really on it but that
basically got created when you created a
person so we can actually add new things
to that now after we've created person I
can go person up prototype nope that
didn't fill in right person up
prototypes say name and let's make that
a function so this is basically like
it's a method so now say name let's say
we're just going to console.log this
name and that's all that is so now John
has access to say name and Bobby has
access to say name because they're on
the prototype if you think of it like
this here's the module up here this is
where I'm defining the actual module and
down here I'm creating all copies of the
module so now I can go John say name and
that's going to console.log John let's
actually do something like this I'm my
name is there you go so now it's going
to say hi my name is John and actually
can't say it like that so let's make
sure we out of space there we go and
then if I say Bobby say name then it's
going to say hi my name is Bobby and if
I were to change John's name name then I
could do John say name and it say hi my
name is Johnny
Bobby remains completely unchanged so
that now we basically created some
shared functionality now we can do let's
do shout name hi my name is and then
let's add an exclamation at the end
there you go seven Bobby can shout his
name if he wants that's going to say hi
my name is body so that's basically how
you create your module so now let's go
ahead and look at inheritance with this
pattern so what does inheritance look
like we've done instantiation this is
how you create instances let's say we
want to create a certain type of person
now and that certain type of person we
can create multiple kinds of those so
say there's people on Facebook but then
there's also friends on Facebook
so let's say let's make a ver friend
and that friend will have functionality
that the person doesn't so once again
upper case because friend is the module
friend is not the actual instance this
is the module this is the constructor so
now we're going to make friend and now
we need some sort of inheritance
function and I like to use to snatch
nodes one if you were to look at I'll
give you this link in the description no
js' gives you one called inherits and so
I just usually snatch this function
right here let's go and steal out and so
I'm going to or should I put this I'll
just put it all the way at the top
function inherits and you give it the
child and they give it the parent
and you can look in this and see if you
understand it later on that's basically
just going to allow our child to inherit
all of the functionality from the parent
so this is our very generic person
module they can all say their name and
shout their name and a friend can maybe
I don't know unfriend you or something
like you can unfriend them so we've
created our friend function that's our
first step and now we want to inherit
all the people methods so I'm just going
to go inherits and then which one was
first okay there we have constructed so
friend is going to inherit from person
there we go so now any friend can say
name and shout name as well so if I were
to say ver Julia then Julia has say name
she has that functionality however her
name is not being saved right now so
here's the other thing that kept me away
as soon as the concept of inheritance
came in that's where I really started
avoiding the prototypal pattern for a
while or the classical pattern any kind
of in stanchion heritable patterns I
didn't like those at this point because
it just seemed kind of freaky to me
basically what we want to do is we want
to run this on our friend object that
we're creating so we want to be able to
you know usually a constructor does a
little bit more than just a sign name we
could easily just say
you know friend gets a name and then
this name is name but then what if you
change what if you start doing something
like this like name to lowercase we're
going to make sure name is always
lowercase well now we have to remember
everybody now we have to change that
here too that's a bad pattern we don't
want to have to do that especially if
there's a lot of logic happening up here
in this constructor we don't want to
have to duplicate that anywhere that's a
bad pattern so we want to run this
person function against the new friend
object that we are creating so how you
do that is very simple you simply say
person dot because remember person is a
function we go person call this which is
what we're building now and we pass in
the name so that's going to now run this
exact person thing but instead of
running it against a new person object
we're going to run it against our new
friend object so there we go that runs
our super so now name is associated and
if you look it inherits it actually is
going to add this super pointer right
here so this is friend this is person so
friend dot super underscore is actually
person so I can run friend dot super
call this so that's a little cleaner
just so we don't have to remember that
our you know we don't have to remember
that we inherited from person so there
we go and then we are going to also
let's say a friend also gets let's
change friend a musician let's forget
the whole friend module musician will be
a little easy musician gets an
instrument and Julia will play trombone
so there you go we're now allowing our
super class our inherited class
constructor to set the name and then
we're setting the instrumenting and then
we inherit and now we can go ahead and
add some own methods some own some new
functionality for our musician class so
the musician class we want to be able to
get the instrument musician dot get
instruments equals and we'll just
console.log again this dot instrument
keep it simple so there we go now Julia
can say her name that's going to do
Julia Julia can get instrument and then
what we can also do is we can actually
override the same functionality say a
musician we want to be able to say the
name but we want to shout differently
because musicians after all shout just a
little more unusually so shouts name
equals a prototypes are there you go
this will actually be dude my name is
this name and then way too many
exclamations there you go so now when I
say shout name it's going to basically
do what happens with scoping is it's
going to look first of all in my own
object which is musician that's the
module Julie is right now so it's going
to say hey do I have a shout name like
when Julia says say name it looks first
in Julia for say name do we have a say
name no we don't okay let's look up to
the parent module do we have a say name
yes okay let's run this one instead so
that's what's happening there
so when you say shout name exact same
thing let's look for shout name okay we
have it basically I will never access
person dot shout name as long as
musician shout name exists so when I say
this julia is going to go do
dude Yaya she's going to shout it so now
later on in my program you usually don't
want to do this but I could go musician
I could go delete shout name I'm going
to delete that function going to delete
that method all together and now Julia
can shout name and instead of being
undefined this is now gone poof it's
going to look up the chain and see oh
shout name and it's just going to do a
normal shout name so that's kind of how
inheritance works with JavaScript that's
what you're going to do really all you
need code wise is to either quickly
learn how to type one of these yourself
or just go copy paste one it's not that
big of a deal it's very easy to get
yourself I'm just showing you where this
node one is so you can go grab it in
case you forget what's going on here so
that's classical inheritance in this
next video let's look at prototypal
inheritance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
