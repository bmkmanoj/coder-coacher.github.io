today I'm gonna kind of give you a fun
video we're basically gonna take two
minutes out of our workday and we're
going to convert our icon theme on our
computer to be this slick looking icon
theme where they all kind of match they
have this congruent feel because they
came from the same designer so you
basically just go to flat icons com flat
icns com download the zip file which is
automatically going to go to your if
you're using Chrome or whatever it's
probably gonna go to your downloads
folder so let's just go ahead and then
go to downloads there you go and then
we're going to go to flat and I'm just
gonna Auto tab so flat dot icns - master
is the zip file or the folder that
uncompressed so you can see if I list
that there's an install shell script for
me so I just have to go sudo you got to
have your your master password for this
dot slash installed Sh so we're gonna
run that file it'll ask for my password
it didn't ask for mine cuz I did sudo
just recently and then it's basically
just going to find every application it
has a cool new icon for and it's going
to replace it so there you go all you
have to do is restart your computer and
your dock and your tab switcher is gonna
look sweet or if you're you know don't
want to have to restart right away any
program you open this you'll see this
icon automatically flip to the new one
finder did not reload and you'll notice
like the trashcan didn't reload because
I've not rebooted my machine yet but on
reboot this will all look slick it'll
all look fun and now I have really fun
theme going on for my machine and in
other news Adam is now my favorite text
editor for Mac sublime text is still my
favorite for Linux but Adam has made
just great improvements and I'm using
Adam pretty much every day now so
there's your fun stuff for today have
yourself a great week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
