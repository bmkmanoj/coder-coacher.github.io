previous tutorial we covered basic HTML
of how to put together an HTML page we
learned how to do tags opening and
closing tags we learned kind of what
some of those popular tag names are and
honestly there's only 10 or 15 you
actually need to know anyway so
hopefully by now you've taken that
course and you're comfortable with kind
of writing out basic HTML tags this
should look decently familiar to you if
not go back through the last video and
get comfortable I promise it won't take
very long there's only a few tags you
have to learn and it really feels weird
at first if you're not used to writing
anything that feels like code but I
promise it comes very quickly you won't
be confused for long so what I've done
here is I've taken and modified my
example from the last video and now I
have my HTML with a header and a body
and in that body I have a header one
which says my website I've got an
unordered list with a link to three
different pages and I've got also a
little bit of fake content you'll notice
this tag up here I left this out in the
last example because it didn't really
apply to learning basic HTML tags but
we're going to add this at the top of
every HTML page and this just declares
that the document type is HTML and
putting it like this actually means
html5 so all you need to know is that it
needs to be there at this point it
basically tells your browser hey we're
working with an html5 page what I did
then is I created a new page called page
- dot HTML and I saved it in the same
folder then I created another page
called page 3 dot HTML it's also in the
same folder and you can see here I
didn't include a full HTTP colon slash
slash www website com all I did is put a
it's called a relative link if you don't
put that full thing it looks starting in
the same folder that you're in now and
the reason we called our first page
index is because index is what it's
automatically going to look look at when
you load a website if you go to
google.com you know there can be some
configuration changed to make it
different but by default a website is
going to look for index
dot html' so one thing I changed here is
the first Li if it's on the page that
you're on now there's not going to be an
a tag it's because if we're on home we
don't have to go to home we're already
there so as you can see on home this is
not a linked page two and three are
linked and I can go to page two and it
loads up page two and now home and page
three are linked because home is going
to index and three is going to page
three so I can now navigate between all
three pages of my website see it's not
too bad I basically have a website
that's up and running it's just ugly
because there's no style so let's get
into how to add style to your webpage
I've saved a file called main CSS and a
CSS style sheet is how we do styling and
basically works like this is you have a
selector which is where we pick
something we're going to add style to
and then you have a rule the selector
basically as brackets anything within
those brackets gets applied to the
selector so the rule you have the
property that you want to change and
then the value you want to give it and
then you've got a colon and it ends with
a semicolon this will probably be the
weirdest part about CSS is getting
comfortable going selector open some
brackets go back go property colon value
semicolon probably looks weird feels
like it's a lot to memorize it's gonna
come really fast type your selector open
some brackets pick a property pick a
value for it you're done so in this case
we've picked body so anything within the
body is now going to get a background of
nine nine nine we'll get into this a
little bit later but for now that just
means a background of gray tell you what
we'll make it black we'll make it red
for now that's a little easier to
understand so the body now gets a
background of red you notice when i
refresh nothing happens because this
stylesheet is not attached at all
to my page so there's two ways you can
get style to your page you can start by
just going style and add a style tag and
we'll make sure we had this attribute
type
equals text / CSS because we're doing
CSS style and now I can go body
background oh not bottom read hit save
hey check it out there you go so you're
thinking why would I not clearly do it
this way this is much easier but what if
we want to type in 150 different rules
and we want them to be shared between
all our pages
well now you either have to copy paste
or you put them in a separate file which
is what we're going to do here we put
background red in here and now we can
link to it we're going to do a link and
this href is going to be I'm going to
link to styles
main dot CSS and I need to do rel equals
stylesheet and basically what that tells
it is I'm giving you a link to a
stylesheet and we can also add type
equals text slash CSS most new browsers
don't need that but some old browsers
are going to so now what we've done is
we've added this link and now all I have
to do is add this link to each page and
each page is now going to get all the
styles that I put in main dot CSS so now
you see as I navigate every page
background is hideous red I'm going to
change that to a slightly more pleasant
color 999 which is kind of a grayish
color that's now we can add some more
styles let's say we want to make our
headers a better font actually let's
make the whole body at different fonts
font family Arial there we go that's a
little bit cleaner looking now the font
family is Arial now CSS is where you get
into a decent bit more memorization
there's only about 10 or 15 HTML tags
you use there's a lot of CSS properties
that you can adjust because as you can
imagine every ounce of style that the
whole page has is coming from
these CSS properties so it's just gonna
take you a little while you'll want to
start off with some things that are more
comfortable and work your way up there's
not it's not an endless black box
there's an end to it it probably will
only take you a few weeks and I'll sing
you realize wow there are no more CSS
properties that I don't know it's just a
long few weeks of learning so definitely
give yourselves a little bit of time
have patience and it will come very
quickly but at first you're gonna feel
like you're just completely drowning in
the ability to not do anything that you
want it to do we're going to show you a
little bit more about selectors here
real quick so here's a that you've I've
shown you how to grab things by tag name
that's what we did here we just created
a tag name body usually you don't do
that too often you'll do it for body
you'll do it for h1 so I'll go h1
I'm gonna go color and this will be like
a 3 3 3 color and now you notice my h1
got just a little bit lighter let's
change that a little bit more to 666 all
the mark of the beast' jokes yep coming
out basically if you go all the way to 0
0 0 you're at black if you go all the
way up to 999 you're at a gray and
anything in between is kind of well in
between so I'm gonna make that 5 5 5 but
I also want this to apply to any h2s so
I'm going to do H 1 comma h2 and now
you'll notice my h2 also has a gray
color I could also make this P I want
any of my paragraphs to have this I can
make this any Li so I want my eyes to
have this I could make this any A's I
want my age to have this and now I've
styled everything with the color of 5 5
5 I don't want my A's to do that though
so maybe I'll make my eyes a different
color later on let's make my eyes a
little different color blue there you go
ha green everything's green there we go
everything's blue I want to change it up
a little bit so now we have every page
is inheriting
these styles so it's starting to look
just a little bit better so let's go
ahead and add maybe a couple more styles
here
let's give paragraphs a background color
let's make our paragraphs color white
yeah
that's feeling nice I'm going to go
ahead and take P out of this because I
don't want to target my P's anymore and
so now we want to add just a little bit
of padding to it see how this is like
completely cramped we want that
paragraph to have a little bit more
padding so that's called padding and
here you get to define let's say five
pixels so now you notice to put five
pixel padding on all sides let's make it
a little bit more 10 pixel padding there
we go and say you just want it to be on
the top and the bottom which you can
actually do is if you do one value it
gets applied to all sides if you do two
values then it goes top bottom left
right so now if I say 10 pixels zero
pixels top bottom have 10 left right
have none
well the right goes all the way because
it's filling out the page that's
something we can address later if you do
four values then you're doing one for
each side so I'm going it goes like this
if I go one value then it does all if I
do two and it's going top bottom left
right if I do four then it kind of goes
around clockwise just like a clock
starts at the top top right bottom left
so I can actually add four things here
and go 10 pixels 10 pixels zero pixels
on the bottom and zero pixels on the
left so now I have padding here padding
here which you can't quite see because
once my text gets over there you'd be
able to see it and then I got some there
for now we're just gonna go with 10
pixels on all sides and call it a day so
now any paragraph I add on any of my
pages is going to get a gray background
white text and a nice little padding
there here let's experiment just to find
out yep there's some more page to
contents it's nice everything I get
throughout my entire site every
paragraph is gonna have a lovely little
look let's say my h2 I'm gonna leave
that right where it is so this is kind
of basically how we're gonna style some
things let's say we want just this one
paragraph to have a different color to
it what do we do then we want to give it
what's considered a class yes I know
we're not supposed to have upper and
lower class and the classes are bad but
in this case it's just what we're gonna
call it class secondary let's do that
class secondary right now nothing
changed but now I can add a rule
targeting class of secondary and I'm
going to add a dot the dot means I'm
looking for a class so anything I put in
here will now override what I put in
there
I'm gonna go background:none and this
color is gonna be let's make this a
little bit of a more greyed out color
let's see if that happens five five five
there we go let's actually make it even
more grayed out some some sudden there
we go so now we have any paragraph gets
this and anything with a class secondary
gets that and because we specified a
class a class is now more specific if
you'll notice even if I put secondary
before usually what happens by the way
with CSS rules is what comes after is
going to override it so if I add another
P rule here and this background is red
now this is overriding this because it
happened after that's why it's called
cascading stylesheets it kind of
cascades it can get defined up here but
you can override it as you move on so
what we've done though is you'll notice
class does not get overridden because
class is considered more
specific it's an issue of specificity
so now secondaries get no background and
they get a color of 777 another way that
you can target things oh yes and a nice
thing about classes is it can apply to
multiple things it can apply to this I
can also make this paragraph have a
class secondary as well so now they both
have secondary I can also make this Li
right here I have a class secondary and
it gets grayed out as well it applies to
anything that you add the class to
another way that you can make a very
specific issue in targeting is by ID ID
equals special the difference between ID
and class is you can only have one ID
per page so I can only have one thing
that's called special on the page I
cannot create two things with an ID of
special you're breaking the rules so I
can say secondary has that copy pasted
here and now there's something with an
ID of special and this background will
be red because after all it's special
and now there you go so each page can
have one thing called special but they
can have as many things called secondary
as they want usually you know you'll
want to class things more than you want
to ID things ID is only something very
specific and you know for sure there's
only going to be one a common occurrence
of that is ID equals navigation there's
usually only one primary navigation on
the page so in this case I could make my
UL have an idea of nav and that's the
kind of thing that you usually use an ID
for IDs are a little bit faster as far
as if you have a thousand rules IDs are
gonna be a little bit faster for your
webpage to appear but classes are going
to be a little bit slower you usually
really are not going to notice though
unless you get tons and tons and tons
and tons of CSS classes so here's kind
of how we basically style out a web page
and in our next video we're going to
cover some more advanced CSS rules</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
