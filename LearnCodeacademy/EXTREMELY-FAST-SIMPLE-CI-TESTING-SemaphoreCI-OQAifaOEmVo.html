continuous testing for a node.js project
using semaphore CI now semaphore is one
of my favorite continuous testing
platforms of all time because they
really excel at speed which is one of my
number one concerns when it comes to
continuous testing I want it to test
fast and from the moment you push code
to github to the moment your tests run
and complete in my experience semaphore
CI is by far the fastest continuous
integration platform out there so here's
my project it's the simple react plus
mob X app that I've been using for my
last two videos and I've since added
some tests to it that I can now run
using the jest command and the tests run
and pass so if I run just here then
there's my three test suites they run
and they pass now if you want to see
what I did to get the tests up and
running you can look at the source code
or even better I wrote an article on it
on some force community tutorials and so
it basically covers everything I did and
why so those are up and running the only
thing I want to do at this point is I
want to add that jest command to my npm
test script so when i run npm test it
also runs just there this isn't
something you have to do but it does
make your life ever so slightly easier
so this is pushed to github and now I
just want to get this thing continuously
testing so when I create a pull request
it adds those pretty little badges that
testing is underway and testing is
complete and whenever I make changes to
master or any branch it's going to test
those so let's go over to semaphore CI I
have a brand new account here and I'm
gonna go ahead and add a new project I'm
gonna pick my account and I'm going to
connect it to github this is an
extremely simple process you can choose
public or private since this is a public
project I'm just going to do public I'm
never gonna test private projects here
and I've gone ahead and I've authorized
that application so now I can go back to
my account and I can see all my github
projects so I can see this sem test
semaphore test there we go Sam tests and
I can start building off the master
branch let's go ahead do that and it's
gonna kind of analyze my project and
determine hey this is a node.js project
let's kind of pull in some sane defaults
for you and get things started
so I should have that here in just a
moment okay there we go
language is JavaScript hey you're right
on that let's go ahead pick my node.js
version I'm using the latest and then is
the set up NPM install yes it is is the
job NPM test yep that's my job I could
change that to jest but I'll leave it
npm test just in case i switch to mocha
later on one day let's go ahead and
build with these settings so there we go
and it's starting my build now for
context if our to run npm install on my
local macbook pro npm install and then
run npm test with this project it takes
about 45 seconds so let's see what
semaphore does
okay check that out I skipped ahead in
one minute on the dot which if you've
used continuous testing before one
minute is really fast for it to set up a
testing environment with no jeaious
installed the correct version do an npm
install and run the test if it takes me
45 seconds on my machine to run that a
minute is really really fast but prepare
to have your mind blown because it
actually gets better let's go ahead and
change our repo and see this thing a
retest so I'm gonna go ahead and get
this badge here for my read me that
seems nice let's go ahead and add that
so now this cool build status and let's
add our readme and push that so and push
is complete let's go back to sim tests
oh it already noticed it and queued it
and it already started running the build
so that was pretty much instantaneous
which is really nice and let's see how
long it takes to build this time around
I'll give you a hint it's a lot faster
there you go sixteen seconds I cut a
couple seconds of blank space out there
for you but most likely due to NPM
caching that they've done on their side
this thing created an environment for my
tests to run it did npm install it ran
the tests in 16 seconds which is just
incredibly fast continuous integration
incredibly fast test cases happening now
obviously my tests happened really fast
i'm doing them in nodejs nodejs is
blazing fast for unit tests and even
functional tests so I've got my act
together with my project and semaphore
has their act together it's a great
combination tests are just flying
through before we wrap things up let's
go ahead and check out a pull request
let's go back over to my repo you see
there we our build status passed awesome
let's go ahead make a new branch and
pull request that a new branch and then
let's go ahead make some kind of change
to something let's say I'll just change
the readme again tests will do the same
thing get out readme we'll commit that
and we'll get push
that's going up there there's my new
branch let's go ahead hole request this
let's go create that pull request and we
can see that semaphore is now testing
that okay semaphore CI is running the
build and we're gonna get to see how
long it takes of that to show up again
to the pull request and it's gonna
happen really fast so there we go
I cut out eight seconds and the tests
have passed so again 15 seconds later I
can see that this pull request is good
to go let's go ahead and merge it
confirm that merge and we are done I can
go back to master you can see that it
says it's pending because it's running
tests against the master branch now if I
were to refresh then I will see this to
be passed here any second
there we are my tests have passed on
master again so I can see that the pr
worked fine and master obviously worked
fine so there you have it that is
semaphore CI and an extremely fast
nutshell it is a great platform and just
darn fast and a huge thanks to semaphore
CI I reached out and told him I'd be
doing a video and they were willing to
sponsor this as well which I was going
to bring you guys this content
regardless because I think they're a
great platform but huge shot out of
thanks to semaphore for being willing to
sponsor it as well hope this helped you
out and have an excellent day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
