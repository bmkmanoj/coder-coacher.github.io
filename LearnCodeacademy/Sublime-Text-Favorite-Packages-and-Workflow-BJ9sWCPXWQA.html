me to do a quick video just kind of
showing my sublime text settings and any
packages that I find useful and I keep a
pretty simple layout but I'll go ahead
and show you what I have right now the
first thing you'll notice is my theme
the theme is pre-dawn and I love it
because it also themes the UI because it
a really nice look and feel when I'm not
using pre-dawn I'm probably using
flatland or Dracula for an actual theme
but I love the UI theme that predawn
gives you another thing that I use is
get gutter
get gutter is done it there is a package
that I love because it kind of as you
can see over here in the gutter it's
going to show you your github changes if
you've added some lines or if I've made
changes to this it shows up is blue for
changed or red for removed super super
cool so you can see the diff real time
with your github stuff definitely love
get Gutter I also use Emmet's for code
completion that's probably the one that
some of you guys have seen and wondered
what that is that just basically allows
me to go div class special yeah sure
whatever special and then it's all and
hit tab and it's automatically going to
complete some stuff some other stuff you
can do with Emmet I'll put a cheat sheet
URL in the description but you can go
disel and then I don't know put an h4
inside of it you can also do plus for a
sibling to that h4 super cool and then
you can tab through and automatically
fill it out so when you get good with
Emmet HTML is a breeze some more complex
stuff you can do is you can have it
number stuff I can go Li times five I'll
actually have a go li ID
sorry panel and then number which will
actually do the number of it times five
so now I got panel one two three four
five super cool if I didn't like that I
could do dollar dollar and it would do
two digits numbers there so then be
panel o 1 o 2 o 3 o 4 o 5 take me a long
time to realize that Emmet could do that
I really like them it does that you can
also wraps
stuff in parentheses so I can go a div
with a ul Li times five and I can do
times five of those so now I've got five
u Elle's with five allies in it
sometimes with sublime text you'll get
this weird quirk where you hit tab and
nothing happens on that when you're
doing the wraps and you'll see down
under here a number keeps clicking you
have to tab like ten times it's just a
quirk that happens sometimes most of the
time it works and haven't quite figured
out when it doesn't work but just in
case you run into that another cool
thing with Emmett is there's a lot of
cool shortcuts with Emmett that I don't
have memorized but if you hit control D
on a Mac it's going to automatically
select everything within your current
tag so you can easily condense stuff or
delete stuff so that's Emmett's and then
honestly let's see we get Gutter my
theme I do have like a custom tiny
little bash script or we can go sub and
then open a file in sublime text as you
can see I use it all the time even as I
was preparing for this video so I could
go sub index.html and it's going to open
index.html or sub main is yeah not that
I use all the time once again I'll put
the video link to that in the
description for how to put that bash
script together very very useful I end
up using that thing all day long and
then I just use honestly some sublime
text hotkeys you know like Apple D for
multiple cursors you know to be able to
change stuff you know you can easily do
Apple D Apple D also has this thing
Apple K where you can skip a selection
if you want which is very useful what
other sublime text ones I took me a
while to realize control Apple
up-and-down is going to move any line up
and down through your stuff super cool
I'm sure that's probably different on PC
I do have a cool cheat sheet that'll
also add to the description for that but
once again that's Apple control up and
down I use that all the time it just
moves your line up and down you can also
use Apple brackets to change your
indentation instead of Apple instead of
tab and shift tab which tab and shift
tab work great when you're on multiple
lines selected but if you just want to
indent your one line Apple and then your
your brackets there you go your left and
right brackets will indent whatever line
you're on use that one all the time as
well and honestly that's about as
complex as I do with sublime I mean it's
got kind of its basic things a lot of
times I won't use the side bar and I'll
just use Apple p2 hotkey back through my
recent files I'll use Apple Pete and
ENTER to go back and forth between two
files this is kind of basic sublime text
stuff I don't know if you guys know that
or don't know it or not an apple R will
take you through all the symbols in your
file so Apple R can take me to the init
function into the method function that's
about it that's pretty much as
complicated as my sublime setup is hope
it helps you a little bit and honestly
if you have great stuff I'm all ears I'd
love to see it comment below I'd love to
hear any great tips you guys have found
as well have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
