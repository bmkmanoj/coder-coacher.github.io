our core OS cluster and if these are
pretty big machines we can actually run
a lot of applications we have a decent
bit of computing power I did the smaller
machines a your your choice on whether
you want to do a lot of smaller machines
or less large machines it's really up to
you but we've got four machines running
so the next thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna run some instances of web
apps now we don't want more than one web
app running on each machine at least not
at first
depends on how powerful those machines
are we might be able to run four of each
web app on there and load balance
between them but for redundancy sake you
at least want different copies of web
app running on different machines that
way if they're all running on this
machine and this machine goes down well
that's a bad idea we want some running
on different machines so let's go ahead
and get to how to run fleet services now
if you remember from my diagram here's
kind of here's the Holy Grail this is
what we're going for this whole core OS
cluster is hidden behind our private
network nobody can access this from the
outside world at all and then you want
to have your one public facing your one
public facing server that the outside
world does have access to and he's also
on the network and can proxy into all
the IP addresses within your core OS
cluster now in digitalocean
you don't have true private networking
because every one of these has a public
IP address but you can set up IP tables
to block pretty much all access so
that's if you want to research that it's
very simple to do just look up you know
core OS IP tables digitalocean
and you'll you'll have all the
information on that Amazon AWS Rackspace
lots of these places will give you true
private networking so we are SSH in
that's excellent let's go ahead and exit
out of that core OS machine and so now
we just need to get fleet control
installed on our on our machine so we
can actually talk to fleet the fleet
cluster of the core OS cluster from our
computer so I'm on my computer now and
you can just if you have homebrew you
can just go brew install fleet control
so that's going to get fleet control
installed and then you just have to do
one thing you have to snatch any one of
these IP addresses and you need to
create
a fleet tunnel environment key so
exports fleets CTL tunnel equals well
did that not copy okay
let's copy and paste there we go so
export fleet control tunnel equals and
then one of those IP addresses they're
all gonna work and now I can go fleet
control fleet control list machines just
like I did when I was on the core OS
cluster there we go so there's all four
of my machines
so what fleet's gonna do for us is I
don't want to have to think about which
machine to run a service on I just want
to say hey run three services and be
done with it
so fleets gonna all handle that so I'm
gonna say hey run three web services
it's gonna go one two three and then it
fleets also gonna mail it manage
failover so if this if this machine goes
down fleet's gonna notice hey web threes
machine went down let's rerun web three
over here and if there is other things
running on this machine it's also gonna
rerun them on different machines
so if fleets gonna handle both
scheduling and failover for us which is
great let me show you what a fleet
service file actually looks like let's
go some app ampersand dot service that's
the name of my file and the ampersand
means that I can run copies of it any
service that you want to run multiple
copies of you're gonna want to put an
ampersand at the end I know that's
really small on my screen so you might
not be able to see it well and so
basically here you got your description
and because it's an ampersand service I
can run copies so every percentage eye
is going to get a number so when I want
to run this service I'll say hey run
some app web two one two three four and
five and they're all gonna run this
exact same file and then this will turn
into one two three four or five so
that's kind of what that % eye is there
so it has a description it's running
after docker and this is pretty much my
docker command I'm going to do docker
run and then here's the name of my
docker command my docker image so this
should look pretty familiar if you're
familiar with docker before we start the
service we want to kill any existing
version of some app one
and then we want to remove some app 1
and we want to pull my image the latest
of will stern node sample this is a
basic node.js application and then we
want to go ahead and run it and we want
to inject the app name in there and
stuff like that so and then also we want
to stop our app whenever the service
stops we're gonna go ahead and stop our
docker container so that's a service
file it's very simple I'm in the folder
with this service right now I can go LS
you can see there's my some app at
service so I want to actually push this
up to fleet right now so I just go fleet
control submits some app at or I could
do at dot service it's smart enough to
know that dot service is the default so
there we go now it's in there so if I go
fleet control list unit files so I have
a unit called some app that it's now
aware of so now I can run this so I can
go fleet control run or start some app
at one sorry mr. t in their fleet
control starts some app at one so there
we go now it's running some app one
somewhere on one of my core OS nodes
awesome let's go ahead and run two more
let's go some app to actually let's do
this to dot dot four so I'm gonna run
between two and four so now we're gonna
actually boot up two three and four
that's a way to do multiple things I can
also go I mean every once in a while
fleet gives you this air I need to look
into what exactly that is let's go ahead
and clear this out fleet control you can
also right do starts some app at once um
app at to some app you can do it like
that as well so let's do list units now
so you see that it's activating all four
of them so when it activating means is
that it's allocating the resources it's
kind of figuring out mmm shall I put it
here here here okay let's do one two
three and four there and then it's gonna
start running there you go
running start pre is where it's at so
start pre
that it's killing that it's removing and
then it's pulling that's probably what
it's doing right now is doing that
initial docker poll which you remember
that first docker poll takes some time
could it's get because it's getting all
the base images like your docker images
built on so this will probably run for
about I'd say 30 seconds total then
you're gonna start noticing that some
services have started I will keep doing
this in an impatient way and also shows
you the IP addresses that it's going to
be starting them on come on
still activating still activating come
on there we go got one active so I can
actually SSH into this now I can either
grab this IP address address and SSH in
or I can use fleet control and let it
SSH you in for me
fleet control SSH into some App fours
box so now I'm actually into the box
some app is on I can run docker PS and
see there we go I've got some app for
running so I could actually take that IP
address what is it 3 2 7 6 8 and which
one are we on there's my IP address so
let's go take this what is that again 3
2 7 6 8 let's go to 3 2 7 6 8 there you
go I'm now viewing some app for ok
another cool thing I can do is I can
actually journal the logs of that so I
can go fleet control journal some app at
4 that's gonna give me some of that log
output so you can see there we are I've
there's my log output from my web app
let's go ahead and hit up a few more I
just refreshed it a couple more times
and you can see there's all my latest
log information I can change how much
you know log how many entries I want to
see here but that's really nice so I can
get logs from any service real time so
that's basically how fleet works and
then in the next video let's go ahead
and look into
you flannel and how these things are
going to talk to each other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
