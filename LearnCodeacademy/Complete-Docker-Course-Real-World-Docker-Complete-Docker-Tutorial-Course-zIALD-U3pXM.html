see that rocket ship going to Saturn
yeah that's how big this news really is
docker is seriously awesome it's my
favorite most preferred way to package
and deploy applications of any kind if
you've been following me on Twitter you
know that I really really like docker
and you're like dude I've been hearing
that I'm like yeah you have because it's
right it's really true so I've been
working on a way to help you get past
the docker basics there are so many
hello world application tutorials out
there with docker but it's hard to find
good information to get you past those
basics so I've been making a course
called real world docker see how that
flew in that was really cool so I'm
going to do it twice awesome and that
guy there with the pen in the paper that
illustrates that I've been working
really hard on this course because I
have it's a lot more work to put
together a full course than to throw
together a couple HelloWorld tutorials
so I've been doing it with O'Reilly
Media
they're awesome they put out great stuff
they're those animal book people yeah
they really like animals I think that's
a goat or maybe it's a yak I'm not
really sure it might be a male sheep but
anyway they love their animals and they
put out great web content if you're
familiar with them again the course is
called real world docker we've recently
released it and it's going to be super
cool it's going to take you from feeling
scared confused and alone from only
knowing those docker basics that you see
on those HelloWorld tutorials to not
feeling so scared so confused and so
alone to get that confidence to actually
deploy a docker application into
production and then it's going to get
you to the point of wow bring on the
millions of users because I just scaled
this application to handle massive
traffic load and you get lots of code
that's right lots of code any code that
we use in any of the examples you get to
take home and copy and paste and mess
with and hack it's all yours so what
will you actually learn well you're
going to learn docker deployments
everything from really simple single
monolithic applications with continuous
deployment that means you merge it to
the master branch and it goes out to
production merge it to the staging
branch and it's on staging you're also
going to learn how to break that app up
into micro services which can scale much
better in a large scenario and you're
going to learn some of the deployment
jeez that huge companies like Netflix
use when they're deploying services
across a large infrastructure you're
also going to learn networking and
service discovery so you can swarm
multiple servers together to act like
one deployment platform then you can run
apps on any one of those servers and
everything just talks together just fine
and you'll also learn immutable and
disposable infrastructure which
basically means you don't fix servers
and apps when things go wrong you just
destroy them and replace them and with
continuous deployment you actually do it
all the time it's a great way of
deploying your application
infrastructure you're thinking wow
that's cool you're right
that's actually my next slide it's so
cool thank you for bringing that up so
again it's called real-world docker the
link is in the description and also you
can go to O'Reilly comm and search for
real-world docker it's also available on
Safari Books if your company provides
you with the Safari Books membership and
so go check it out you're going to love
the course it's going to help you out a
ton and I give you information on how to
contact me so I'm available to help you
out if you have any issues with that
course enjoy and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
