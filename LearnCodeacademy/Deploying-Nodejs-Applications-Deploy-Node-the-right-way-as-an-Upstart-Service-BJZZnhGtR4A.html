last video to the point where we can now
run an automated deployment for our
nodejs app so let's make this better
there's there's kind of a problem with
forever even though most people that I
know use forever for deployments forever
has this problem and that for the word
forever does not include if your server
has to reboot for some reason if your
server if digitalocean or or Rackspace
tends to do this whenever they have
problems your servers all get rebooted
and now your websites down because
forever did not restart your service and
so what we're going to actually do is
run our node J app nodejs app as its own
system service as its own upstart
service and this is kind of like a
higher or a mid-level a Linux thing that
we're going to be doing and so this way
it'll automatically run whenever it
starts so the first thing we're going to
do is we're going to SSH in as root so
let me exit and let me SSH into my
server as root actually before I do that
I'm going to SSH NS deploy and I'm going
to stop my current if I go forever list
I've got it running so I'm going to go
forever stop all stop my existing
forever service now I'm going to log in
as root okay so I'm logged in as root
and now I'm going to create this file
let's see init node app let me actually
go into Etsy net see you see it okay so
if I do a file list these are all the
services that are starting on boot-up so
basically if I create a new comm file a
new configuration file then that service
will also start so I'm going to copy and
paste this code right here and I'm going
to actually run this command first I
will edit this file with Nano I prefer
them basically Nano and vim are text
editors for your terminal since we don't
really have a graphical user interface
we have to use a terminal text editor
them is better but Nano is easier so
we'll be using nano for this example if
you're new to that and so now I'm in a
file to edit I'm going to copy this code
and
paste it in there we go so this is going
to be my configuration file when do we
start when file system and networking
are started that's when we start our
service and then we're going to change
directory into home deploy node app
that's where we are automatically that's
where flight plan is pushing all our
stuff to and then we're going to set
some environment variables that our node
app can listen to so if this is a
staging server we would change that to
staging and then our port whatever our
node port is and this is the actual
command to run our service we're finding
node and then we're running bin www so
that should make perfect sense to you
I'm going to control X say Y hit enter
and there we go now we have a service so
I can go start node app and it's running
so let me go back over here hit refresh
and you remember I stopped to the
forever service and it's still running
because I've started this so I can go
stop node app and I can hit refresh and
it's dead dead service so start node app
again and once again that's because it's
called node app con whatever you call
the file is what the service name will
be so now my service has been created my
next step is going to be give my deploy
user the password or the ability to run
that command that's really a root level
command controlling services and so
since my know since my deploy user is a
part of the sudo group I can run sudo
restart node app but it's going to ask
for a password and I don't want to do
that because I want this to be automated
so I'm going to copy this command and
I'm going to paste this command in and
that will what did I do I guess I didn't
copy it did I ah ruining everything
there we go so now it is I have added
that command in I've added that ability
in and what that did is if you type VI
sudo this is all these pseudo
permissions and what I did is I just
appended that to the end of my file so
I'm deploy a deploy now has the ability
to run restart node app if you also want
to give your deploy script the ability
to run start node app and stop node app
you can run a spin
start no tap and then s been stopped no
tap or if you wanted to give the ability
to run all any services stop start any
services just leave no tap off so I'm
not going to save this no don't save I
only want my deploy user to be able to
pass wordlessly restart the app that's
as little permissions as I need so now I
can exit out let's get out of there and
now I have to do is go adjust my flight
plan file my flight plan J s I'm going
to remove these two lines where I'm
using forever
don't use forever anymore let's use this
sudo restart no tap there we go so it's
going to exec sudo restart no tap let's
test deploy this fly production and it's
moving there you go finish just fine it
was actually slightly faster it felt
like and my service is still running
let's just triple check this and we'll
be done for sure let me go to my views
index jade welcome to title let's shout
title yay let's run a deployment fly to
production I kind of like the fly
command it feels very successful there
we go welcome to Express and that is
deploying with nodejs as a service oh
yes let's do the real test let's login
and reboot our server reboot there you
go system is going down for reboot now
and then let's go and try this it's not
working because my server is down server
should be up in about five there we go
and now it's back and my service is
running and I've deployed as a service
so hope this helps you out and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
