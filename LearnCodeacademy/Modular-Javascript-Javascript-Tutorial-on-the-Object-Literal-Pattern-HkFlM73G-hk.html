Jas so I made this really tiny little
thing it's like a people named adder I
can go will and then I can add jack and
then I can add I don't know Frank and
then I can also delete these people from
my module so that's really all this
thing does so we're going to be getting
into kind of how you code modular j/s
let me show you what I wrote out now I
call this spaghetti code so we're going
to use jQuery as an example because you
know many many JavaScript developers
know jQuery and so this is what I call
spaghetti code it basically plops out
the function required to make the thing
work we have two core actions going on
when I click on the button then it's
going to add the person to the list and
then when I click on the delete button
it's going to delete the person from the
list but it's really it's really a mess
for a lot of reasons so I'm going to
kind of get into some concepts of what
modular JavaScript looks like why you
want to do it and really the people that
need to learn modular programming are
kind of those developers that are
sitting at this breaking point of I can
make jQuery work I can code this but I
don't you don't necessarily think like a
software developer so as soon as you
start getting into large applications
what what I'm looking for when I'm
hiring a developer to work on a large
application is someone who knows how to
break up their code into logical
components components that do one thing
to it well how to have the components
work together and then because that's
really what working with a framework
like backbone or angular is is all your
pieces of code are in their own
components doing their own things so I'm
going to show you today is kind of an
in-between step between just plunking
out jQuery and using a framework like
backbone or angular to start getting you
thinking in terms of components separate
pieces of functionality so let me go
over some ground rules real quick on
what a modular or what ojs module should
be for one it's a self-contained module
so everything to do with my module is in
my module so in this case my module will
be this part of a web page if a web page
has 20 different things on it this
people adder will be my module there's
going to be no global variables see
there's a problem with this javascript
right here is
that I've air people in their template
so if any other module on the page also
has a template they can't call it
template because their code will break
this code that's terrible terrible and
it also if you have a huge JavaScript
application you can't have a bunch of
global things it's actually going to
slow down your performance so no global
variables that's just kind of a given
you really should never have any global
variables maybe one for your whole
application that you share but that's
about it
and then if a module manages more than
one thing it should be split up right
now we have a module that manages people
so there's this people outer thing once
again and then that's about it so I can
keep this all in one module now if each
person had more functionality like if I
could edit this name or maybe I don't
know send it this a person and email
from here then this each individual
person should also be its own module but
for now I can just do one module for
this I'll explain a little bit more that
later on separation of concerns in our
code one terrible thing about this is
every piece of code is doing every kind
of task we're searching the Dom here
we're binding a function to that we're
binding a listener to that element and
then we're searching here for another
element and we're binding another
listener in here we are updating our
HTML with you know a new person and then
down here we're actually removing
something from our HTML there's just
stuff all over the place it's just not
very separated code at first this looks
kind of simple but it the more you get
into it you're more it's really
frustrating I can't exactly just quickly
glance at this and know what's going on
and I'll show you why once we modular
eyes it dry code don't repeat yourself
you should never there's a lot of
repeating going on here I'm searching
the Dom for people module a lot for one
that's not very efficient I shouldn't
have to search my HTML file for ID of
people module but one time and I'm doing
it here I'm doing it every time there's
a click this function runs and I search
for people module again and again and
again that's terrible terrible it's very
slow JavaScript you're not going to
notice it when it's just one thing on
your pay
when you don't have a JavaScript
application but as your application
grows that is terrible practice and so
we're going to want to do what's called
Dom caching which brings us to efficient
Dom usage we want very few of these
dollar selections we want very few of
those we want to see some more find
action going on but we ideally just want
one of these per module the Dom element
which we can totally do this is my
module which I'll get into the HTML a
little later I should be able to snatch
this whole piece of code out by ID and
then I don't ever have to search my Dom
again for this ID I can look within this
for all the HTML I need so I just want
to see kind of maybe one of those per
module maybe a second one if you have a
good reason for it but really just one
of them
very few dollar selections and I want no
memory leaks
I want all events which this is an event
right here a click event we're binding
this function to that event I want that
to be able to be unbound so what happens
if we're on a single page module a
single page application this is really
where it comes into play is if you're on
a single page application you can
navigate to four or five different pages
without ever actually navigating up here
it's called a single page app and this
people thing actually has to go away for
a time and then it has to come back it
has to go away and it kind of to come
back and whenever it goes away
I want all these events to go away with
it otherwise I'm going to end up with a
memory leak as long as there's an event
bound to this people module even if the
people module disappears it's not going
to take it out of memory because it says
hey you still have something listening
to it so I'm not going to take it out of
memory and that's where you'll get a
memory leak so the more someone uses
your application say it's something like
Gmail where you never navigate away but
you might go to an email and then back
to an email list and then to another
email back to an email list if you have
a memory leak even something as simple
as one event listener that never goes
away then it can keep piling up on top
of itself for every email you've seen
and eventually your browser runs out of
memory and crashes or gets very slow or
your whole computer starts running slow
so that's kind of what a memory leak is
we'll get into that in a little
as well so these are some ground rules
let's just actually start covering what
is actual modular programming look like
so let me just kind of comment out this
code real quick the basis of modular
programming we're going to be using a an
object literal for this one it's an
object literal pattern I'm gonna
actually put a link to an e-book from
addy Osmani that's really good that
covers a lot of design patterns lots of
times it's just an object literal
pattern and all that is that's just
you're using an object so we could call
this my module equals and there's my
object and then you can add values to
this so I could go name my name is will
age 34 and then I could put say name and
this would be a function so it's called
a method a function that lives on an
object is called a method so this is the
same method and I could just go alert
this name and this refers to my module
since this is the object that it's
sitting on so that will alert will so
now I have to do is go my module dot say
name there you go and so now if I save
and refresh it shouts will excellent so
I could do another thing to here I could
go set name and then that would go this
dot name equals let's see new name so I
could say set name give it a new name
now this name equals new name so that's
kind of how a module works and so now
you can see this whole will thing is now
living on one object so I could go my
module set name let's set it to Willis
and then I'll say my name so it's just
going to say Willis and so I have my
I've access to my module here dot set
name me oops I actually changed my frame
on accident let's go back to that top
frame I have adblock Pro running so
let's go my module set name me my module
say name and now it's going to say me so
that's kind of how a module works and
the methods that you expose to other
modules the things that allow
modules to do actions are called your
API so currently my API has two methods
it has say name and it has set name so
that's kind of what I have here I'm
using say name I'm using set name now
with the object literal pattern
everything is accessible so I could
actually hack this and just go my module
dot name equals me I guess I could
change it back to will and then I could
say name and it's going to say will
that's really not the way you should
interact with the module you should use
methods that are provided for you and in
another pattern the revealing module
pattern we're actually going to be able
to hide some of these things away to
where nobody else can access them only
the module itself can access them so
that's kind of the modular pattern and
so we'll end this video for now because
you might need to re-watch it kind of
get some of the concepts kind of
understand what I'm talking about and
then in the next video we're going to
actually convert this spaghetti code
into a beautiful little module</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
