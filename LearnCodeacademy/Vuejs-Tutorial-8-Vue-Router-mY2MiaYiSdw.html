router which is going to allow us to
navigate from different states in the
application and still stay on the same
HTML page if you're new to single page
applications this will probably be the
strangest concept to you so I'll give a
couple explanations along the way for
people where this is maybe the first
JavaScript application you're building
you can see I've what I've done is I've
generated another view application the
only difference between the last video
and this one is I said yes install view
router so if you look at the app view
components there's really only one
difference were adding the router view
here and we're not doing anything else
main J s imports view router and then it
adds this little thing right here router
and that's basically how you configure
view router to be on your application
import the router and then add the
router that's pretty much it you port
the router add the router and the router
that it's actually importing is this
right here this file so we'll get back
to that file in a little bit so even
ported the file added it to our top
level component and now let's actually
look at that template we get to choose
where the router components print out
and you'll also notice that our app now
has this little hash slash at the top of
it this is gonna be one of my tiny
little side trails for newer people so
if you ever add hash and then some word
here HTML will look for an ID on the
page called some word and it will scroll
to it so you can actually make a URL any
any link on the page could link to hash
tag some word and that would actually
scroll to the some word ID when you
click on it but then developers learned
along the way hey since it doesn't
navigate to a different page we can kind
of hack HTML and add all this
information here and then we can listen
for when that changes and tell a
JavaScript application to go to entirely
different pages and States and stuff so
that's basically what the concept of
routing is is we're gonna add
information up to that hash tag route
and there's an html5 way to do it too
but we won't cover that in this video
but as we add stuff to that route
JavaScript can pick up
that and we can make the whole page
change without navigating away so there
you go that's routing for beginners so
here's what that router view covers is
we can define a set of routes and when
you go to those routes it will actually
load a different set of components so
you can see here when you're on the
slash route just the homepage route
we're giving it a name or saying hey
that's the hello world component so
that's the hello world component right
there so if you go to just slash it
grabs the hello world component and it
spits it out in place of a router view
so that's kind of how routing works
let's go ahead define maybe another
route here let's say let's let's show
you one thing here so if I go to a fake
fake path then all you're getting is the
top-level application at this point
you're getting apt view which is the div
and the image and this is returning
nothing because there is no router view
for this this is basically returning no
component at all and then anytime you go
to something that the router view
recognizes it's gonna return that
component in which case this is the
hello world so you use the app level
view for a shell for your application
whatever is gonna apply to your entire
application goes in here every single
view state and from there you break down
different things into views that router
view can then return so let's go and
maybe uh you know let's say we were
making that friends list let's do a
contact
we'll go friends so that's our friends
path and then we could also makes a
contact path and then maybe we can make
an account path where you can manage
your account or something like that
contacts accounts just be the contact
components and this will be the account
components and you can get more complex
than this there we are let's go ahead
now just make some new components here
contact view let's go ahead and make
this and we'll just leave that as that
let's go ahead save this also as the
accounts and let's say this is friends
so change a couple h1cr so now if we go
back to that router file we can import
those files we just made we can import
accounts I'm gonna for contact and we
can import friends everything should be
working now so now if we go to accounts
we get the account component there's our
account h1 and we can go to friends
whoops looks like friends is the wrong
component
yes we're importing friends from hello
world let's change that there you go now
hash friends hash slash friends goes to
the friends components and contacts so
there we go that's that's all of our
pages now let's go ahead and create some
links here so we can actually link
around to these different pages if I go
over to my app view now I can go ahead
and create some links by using the
router link tag router link and this is
basically an a tag so I can go to the
friends and all I have to do is add a
two and then I can basically give it the
path I want to go to I can go to friends
and let's also do accounts and contact
and I'm assigning these to the top-level
application so that way every view I go
to will have this main level navigation
so now I can go to friends account or
contact excellent that works well I can
also add extra details in here so I
could go friends slash 1/2/3 let's go
and save that so if I go to friends now
you can see it goes friends slash 1/2/3
but there is no route that matches that
what I can do is I can come over to my
router index and I can go friends / ID
age I don't know wait let's say the wait
is particularly important so now this
would be the ID the age and the weight
that makes absolutely no sense that you
would load a friend by ID and pass in an
agent awaits but what
ever at any at any rate we are passing
this in and then we can then access
those in the friends view we can come in
here and we can do route params dot ID
and you see there's ID one gets spit out
and we can also access route params age
and weight that is a very light
two-year-old and there's another way you
can do it if you want to validate that
by adding props in here then I can
actually require those this way instead
I can add ID age and weight and you can
also add validation to those so you can
require those to be certain types which
is pretty cool
and then I can come over here to my
routes and all I have to do is say props
true and now those get passed in as
props so those get passed in as props
and now I can just call these age weight
and ID you see this will render out
exactly the same let's refresh yep so
now if I go to a weight of five age of
25 maybe a weight of 150 something
slightly more realistic all that
information comes in from the route and
gets passed automatically to the
component so there's kind of the two
ways that you can pull in those props
and using view router you can pretty
quickly again notice the common theme
with view is fast fast fast if you need
something fast and easy and the level of
complexity is not super high choose view
it makes it really easy you can just
crank stuff out quickly and easily with
low level of coding complexity so that's
how you use view router in the basics
it's a lot of fun to get an app going
and and moving along and that's about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
