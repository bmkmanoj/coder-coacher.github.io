want to point out again that's pretty
much everything you've learned so far is
programming in general almost every
computer programming language is gonna
have variables if-else statements
comparison operators functions and what
we're about to learn which is arrays and
loops and I've got one more lesson for
you here we're gonna cover arrays and
loops and then you're going to be able
to do some fun stuff in the browser to
change your webpage so let's just get
into it once again I'm using the main
J's file which I've added onto my
index.html and we're going to be doing
our coding in here so an array is simply
a list of items I can go vary my list
equals and then I do open and close of
square brackets now whatever I put in
here is a part of my array so I can go
apples oranges bananas and so now I've
got my console open over here again
because I want to interact with this
list so if I go my list not defined let
me go ahead and save this oh I didn't
turn on live reload for this lesson I
apologize save refresh my list there you
go you can see we've got apples oranges
and bananas now if I want to access a
specific item on this list I can go my
list zero to get these zero entry one of
the things you learn in computer science
is that web developers and just
developers in general pretty much count
from zero zero one two and that's kind
of a long explanation as to why so I'm
not going to explain it but the zero
index would be apples the one index or
the first index would be oranges and the
number two index would be bananas so if
I want to access my list one that's
oranges and bananas would be my list too
if I go my list three that's undefined
because it hasn't been defined yet so
let's go ahead and add that in my lists
three which you can add after you've
created the list equals pineapples
let's go ahead save it's gonna refresh
my list three now equals pineapples
let's say I want to change index zero to
be something else my list 0 equals
watermelon so there you go so now if I
were to go my list I've added index 3
and I've changed index 1 that's
basically how you're going to change
values and it's important to note that
these values don't have to be strings
arrays can hold any type in JavaScript
they can hold strings numbers functions
even other arrays so I can go my list
equals apples the number 12 and let's
create a function up here go alerts hi
that's the one I've been using might as
well stick to it I'm just gonna add go
in there you notice go is a variable
name because functions are actually
variables as far as JavaScript is
concerned so now if I look at my list in
the console apples 12 and the function
go so that's pretty much an example of
the fact that arrays can hold anything
and if I actually want to access this
function and call its well I can either
call go which is going to alert or go is
in my array so I can go my list 2 and
then I can run it just like I can a
function and that's exactly the same as
changing these letters to geo so I'm
accessing it and then I'm calling it so
that's kind of you know it's a little
quirky you really wouldn't do that
but once again arrays can hold anything
or I can make this array hold a new
array of will Laura there we go so now
if I look at my list
it's got apples 12 and an array of names
will as the zero index Laura is the one
index great now arrays have what's
called what are called methods or better
yet actions that you can run on a race
let's go back to apples oranges bananas
let's save that let's get rid of you so
I can go my list dot shift and that will
give me the first entry off of my list
and it will actually pull it out of the
list so now the list has one less entry
if I look at my list now apples has been
pulled out and oranges and bananas are
all that remain so now I can go my list
shift again so I could say their current
fruits equals my list shift there we go
now current fruit will equal oranges
because that was at the front of the
stack in my list only has one item left
so once again shift pulls your first
item out actually removes it from your
list and passes it to whatever your
function passes it to whatever variable
is on the other side of your function
let's go back let's refresh my page my
list is now back to normal there's also
a pop method pop is going to pull the
last value off of the list and it's
going to actually remove it so now my
list has two entries the first and the
second and bananas is gone now there's
also a very cool method called for each
and for each you pass it a function and
it's automatically going to put two
arguments into this function for you
it's going to give you a value and an
index for each item it's going to loop
through this and it's going to run my
function then it's going to run this
value run the function and then it's
going to take this value and run the
function so I can console.log Value
Index and I should see three console
logs apples zero oranges one bananas two
or a more useful way of doing it would
be alerts I have plus value plus in my
shopping bag
I have apples in my shopping bag I have
oranges in my shopping bag I have
bananas in my shopping bag
now one quirk with JavaScript is older
browsers are not going to have all the
newer methods for each is a newer method
and not every browser has it so if
you're running this on an older browser
you might get an error message that says
for each is not defined and so what
you're actually gonna have to do is
you're gonna have to use an older way of
looping through or iterating through
this list so let's get into now the
second part of this lesson which is
loops loops are well they're just what
they sound like they're ways of looping
through things over and over again and
there's three kinds of loops in
JavaScript
there's the while loop a do loop and a
for loop let's look at each one of these
what's it doing who knows so let's do
the while loop they're all very similar
by the way they just have a little bit
different way of going about it as long
as what's in here is true Y will execute
whatever's in this block whatever's
between these curly braces so what I
could do is I could say ver x equals
zero and while x is less than ten lets
console.log tried it
let's also spit out x just so we can see
and let's say x equals x plus one so now
it's going to make it if it's zero it's
going to bump it up one if it's one it's
going to bump it up to two let's see
what happens we tried it when x was zero
and then we bumped it up now we tried it
in x was 1 try it when x was two we
tried it all the way up till x was nine
and when x was ten we didn't try it any
more the while stopped it did what's
called a break and so as long as this is
true again it's going to run this block
of code another way we can simplify this
is we can just go x plus plus which is
code for and bump it up one more if it's
zero make it one if it's one make it two
another thing you can do it is javis in
JavaScript is you can do - - which
basically -
one from whatever it is so x + + there
we go that's going to do the exact same
thing so that's a while loop there's
also a do-while loop or I do loop you
don't see this one is often and that's
basically the same thing so I'm going to
go console.log tried it times and then
I'm going to do same thing x + + and I'm
going to go wild x is less than 10 exact
same thing and you'll notice it does the
exact same thing try it at 0 tried it 1
tried it to try it 3 the difference
pretty much the only difference between
do and while is do is going to always
run at least one time and then it's
going to do a check to see if this is
true or false so you're guaranteed one
execution and it might stop after that
whereas while is going to run the check
first and if that's false then it's not
ever going to run if it's true it's
going to run over and over and over
again until it's false so that's doing
while they're very very similar so the
last loop is the for loop and the for
loop is the most common one you're gonna
see in JavaScript but unfortunately it's
the most complicated one if you're just
starting out it's not really hard per se
it's just not quite as simple as the
while loop and the do-while loop so what
you have in the for loop is you have 3
arguments you have your setup you have
your comparison and then you have your
change this is what's going to happen
every time it goes through the loop so
here's kind of the common for loop that
you're going to see you're gonna see ver
I equals 0 and then you're gonna go I
less than 10 so as long as I is less
than 10 that's our comparison that's
what would be in our while and then
we're gonna do I plus plus every time so
we're starting off we're gonna run this
once we're gonna check is I less than 10
yes it is we're going to run our loop
and every time we run our loop we're
going to bump I up one more time and so
let's console.log this I
is and then let's do I let's run this
and see what happens you see that I is
currently zero we started off I is zero
and then it's gonna run my block and
then it's gonna bump I up one more time
then it's gonna run it again
hey is I less than 10 nope I mean guess
it is run the block bump I up one more
time is I still less than 10 yep
run the block bump it up that keeps
happening until I is no longer less than
10 and then it breaks so this is useful
because we can actually make I the
length of our array I'll kind of show
you what we mean here let's make my list
and then we're almost done with our
lesson book and I'm using capital
letters now nice these are proper proper
nouns there we go so I have apples
oranges and bananas so I'm gonna say I
equals 0 and as long as I is less than
my list dot length GTH there you go then
I'm going to do that so now it's going
to run three times let me show you what
my list dot length is my list dot length
is three because I have three items in
my list now that seems a little strange
because I have a zero index one index
two index you would think length would
be two but length is three because when
it comes to dot length we're counting
like a normal human would count three
items in my list so three items a 0 a 1
and a 2 index I know that's confusing
but whatever that's JavaScript so as
long as I is less than the length of my
array I'm going to loop through and so
what I can do now is I can go
console.log my list I so the first time
around that'll be 0 second time around
it'll be 1 second time around it'll be 2
and there is no next time around I think
I said first second second first second
third you can see apples oranges bananas
and then I'm done so I can do the exact
same thing alerts you have
my list dot I or brackets I in your
basket so there we go you have apples in
your basket you have oranges in your
baskets and you have bananas in your
basket so that's a for loop now you can
pretty much copy and paste this code and
that's something that you can use
anytime you want to iterate an array
that's the most common for loop I'll
usually when I started off I copied and
I pasted this away and I saved it
because I just couldn't quite remember
the order in the syntax where these
commas were these semicolons it's
something you just have to use several
times to really get comfortable with
save this somewhere as a snippet of code
that you reuse later
that's arrays that's loops and the next
list lesson we're going to use functions
arrays and loops to do some fun stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
