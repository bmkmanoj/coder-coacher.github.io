great nodejs application on your machine
and lots of people are saying how do I
deploy this thing to production and how
do I do it the right way so we're going
to cover this in three videos this video
right here is just kind of a
prerequisite for people who don't know
about digital ocean and then in the next
video we're going to cover how to
provision that server and do an
automated deployment strategy and then
in our next video we're going to show
you how to make that deployment just a
little bit more stable so let's get into
it the first thing we need to do is spin
up a server just for our app my favorite
for this is digital ocean there's Amazon
Web Services they're totally fine Heroku
is great Heroku starts off actually a
little easier but it gets more expensive
much more expensive over time and let's
see there's Rackspace although Rackspace
is given my company a lot of problems
over the years so I don't super
recommend Rackspace just based off of my
personal experience I love digitalocean
oh I have not had any problems with
digitalocean so I will show you this
basically they call their servers
droplets so I can just create a server
and let's name it something test node
app and then you select a size I'm going
to pick the one that's only $5 a month
or less than a penny an hour so I'm
going to destroy this once I'm done with
our tutorials and it will only have cost
me one penny to show you and you can see
it's there's the stats on what kind of
machine I'm getting I'm going to base it
out of San Francisco I'm going to pick a
bun too which is what I like to use for
Linux although I'm actually going to go
to applications and I'm going to come
get a bun to image that has node
pre-installed so that way I don't have
to install node.js hit create droplet
and within 60 seconds it will make it
for me I should get an email now hey
there you go there's my email it is just
spun up it's actually actually a virtual
machine that has all the processing
power in reality to me it might as well
be a real machine on the internet that's
plugged in and so now I can SSH into it
and I have full access this is a
dedicated IP address to my machine so I
can get a domain name and I can go to
their DNS and I can have my domain name
point to this machine and that will act
as my website so kind of for those of
you guys are not
familiar with what's the difference
between digitalocean and a web host like
say hostgator I have a website there
which is what I tell people to use for
web sites the difference is is you're
managing your own servers
start-to-finish you own it you can
destroy it
you can blow it up you can install
anything you want on it you cannot run
nodejs on most web web hosts they are
set up usually for PHP and what they'll
allow you to do is own a portion of a
machine but they maintain the machine
for you and you have a limited set of
you have a limited set of privileges and
what's great about that is they've
installed the machine set it up to do
email you can host your own email there
you can spin up WordPress sites really
quickly you can add web sites really
quickly so that's really great for web
sites and PHP applications when you're
getting into nodejs applications things
we have to customize the server that's
really kind of when you need to learn
your own server administration skills
it's not that hard it's not an
impossible world but you do need to
learn it at some point so there you go
it's been created and digitalocean is
running this promo where if you click on
my link you get $10 off and I get $25
off so if you're going to use
digitalocean use it I you'll get money
I'll get money we all are happy with
each other but no worries if you don't
I'm using it regardless and let's get
into the next video where we provision
this server and set up automated
deployment for our nodejs
app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
