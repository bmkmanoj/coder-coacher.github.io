learning JavaScript run into a block in
their learning curve when they want to
start developing Ajax applications but
they're not on a team that has Ajax
back-end ap is that they can use or
maybe they learned you're learning at
home and you don't have access to
anything that gives you the ability to
start doing that I thought about that
over the weekend a lot so I put together
a free restful api that you guys can
learn use to learn ajax on your own so
yay for you guys you get to do that now
I had a lot of people who went through
the jQuery tutorial where we do cover
how to build a single page app and you
guys asked me hey what can I do I don't
have access to an API so here you go no
excuses now you have access to an API
this should give you all the code you
need to do it anyway but I'll give you
the miniature like two minute walk
through basically the data resets every
night so it's not going to last forever
that's kind of my way of making sure I
don't have this gigantic server full of
pointless data and it's not secure
anybody can guess your user name and
access all the data you post so it's
just for learning and then here's kind
of how you use it if you just go rest
learn code Academy go API and then pick
a username in this case we'll and then
friends you have access to all the
friends that you've created of course if
it's the first time you did it say
Willis then that front that collection
will be empty it will be created the
second you try to access or post to
username Willis collection friends so I
can have Willis friends I can have
Willis tweets and there you go empty
collections so then you can just snatch
the code and post to that collection let
me snatch this open the console or you
guys can do it from your web application
let's post to Willis friends I'm going
to add my friend let's go ahead and
reload that there you go now I have a
friend called Billy Bob let's go and run
that a few more times of course I don't
have jQuery on this page so I can't do
that
let's where am i there you go let's post
that exact same thing like three more
times I just ran it and just kind of
reran it so now if i refresh Willis
friends I have three friends with
different IDs so
now I can modify those with a put
request I can delete those with a delete
request let's do this
delete Willis friends ID 1 let's go and
delete you let's go check again now I
have three friends let's refresh and I
have two friends now ID two and ID three
so you be there you guys go
that is your API enjoy it let me know if
you run into any problems and also if
you build anything cool with it
comment below I'd love to see what you
guys are building as you're learning
Ajax have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
