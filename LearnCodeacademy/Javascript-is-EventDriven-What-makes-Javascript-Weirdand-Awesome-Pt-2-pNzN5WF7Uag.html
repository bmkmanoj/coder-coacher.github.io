that makes JavaScript weird and awesome
if you just caught this video I'm in the
middle of five you'll want to start from
video one there will be a link in the
description but the second thing that
makes JavaScript weird and awesome this
is the one that honestly makes it really
really awesome especially if you're
doing nodejs
is the event-driven environment let's
kind of get into what that means
especially I'll give you an example of
how it's different versus PHP if we have
a PHP script here and you're load say
let's load tweets page to the PHP script
is going to start doing some things
maybe get your username and then go to
the database get your tweets put
together your HTML page spit out the
page and then your script exits and it's
done so your PHP script is finished and
you're good to go
and so at that point PHP is dead it's
done it's not doing anything unless you
reload the page or load a different page
it runs it loads all of its stuff and it
dies and if you rerun it it's going to
rerun it again javascript is completely
different JavaScript loads up your page
and then it stays in memory waiting it
waits for events because javascript is
not just information it's user events it
is click events it's drag events it's
typing it's scrolling and so let's just
look at code to give you some more
examples this is really common jQuery
code right here it's a document ready
function that says when a button is
clicked alert yay I'll show you what
this does let me save and refresh click
yay click another button yay all right
so what the what JavaScript is doing
when it runs this is nothing actually
it's running this and remember those
first-class functions that I showed you
in the last video here's one right here
we're basically giving the document
ready function 1 argument which is this
so whenever the documents ready run this
function so JavaScript is not actually
this script that we have right here is
not doing
anything until the document is ready
then it fires this function which sets
up a listener on button so whenever the
button is clicked now it's going to fire
this function as argument number two so
once again JavaScript hasn't done
anything again we have a listener for
the button click and that's it it's
event-driven it's listening for a click
event on the button and so the implement
case the implementations the
implementations what this means is huge
and so it means that there's this entire
ecosystem that has to be built around
event-driven programming all these other
things we're going to get into in the
next videos are a result of the
event-driven environment it means a
couple things it means that this script
will fire once and it will not fire
again just like PHP it doesn't have to
refire the script every time something
happens it only runs the little piece
that has to run because it stays in
memory let me show you what I mean here
let me say ver a equals 1 in on click
we're going to alert one
and so and actually I'll do that and
also go console.log setting this up
that's a lot of T's setting this up so
we're running some setup script here and
then whenever it's clicked we're going
to alert not 1 we're going to learn a so
here you go console.log setting this up
and when I click I don't get another
setting this up console.log because my
whole script didn't run again my whole
application did not rerun all this kind
of is stayed up in memory the only thing
that actually ran is this little
function this one line of the function
that's all that ran on my click event so
when people say javascript is fast
that's what they're talking about
javascript as a language is not actually
really really fast but javascript has
the ability to stay in memory and only
fire what it has to fire and that's
what's fast about JavaScript especially
nodejs
on in nodejs your application runs it's
sitting in memory and when a page
request comes through it only fires the
code that
to do with that little bitty page
request everything else is already
loaded in memory and so that's kind of
what it means to have an event-driven
environment is we can take this argument
function which in this case is a
callback to the click event and we can
just kind of remember that callback
event we can remember that callback
function and fire whenever we need to
fire it and that's all we have to do so
that's kind of how the event-driven
environment of JavaScript works and that
actually creates some problems that have
to be solved with complex things like
closures scope and context let's go
ahead and get into those and this is
some of the real mean potatoes
intermediate level JavaScript that we're
about to be getting into here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
