about github and we're also gonna be
learning about source control if you
guys I'm pretty sure you're sitting in
one of probably three boats right now
one you have no idea what github is no
one's talked about it you've not heard
about it and I'm here to talk about it
because it's really important and pretty
much any professional company is going
to be using github or something like it
and will expect you to know it or you're
sitting in boat number two you've heard
about it you know about it but you
haven't learned it yet it's kind of been
a black box we're gonna make that an
easy thing to learn today in step three
you person number three you've maybe
used sub subversion or CVS you know what
source control is you just want to learn
github this might not be the tutorial
for you because I'll be getting a little
bit more ground-level stuff here but
you'll learn it all it just might be a
little bit slower paced for you so let's
get into real quick what is source
control why is it important why is every
employer value it let's say there's two
people right here pretend my screen is
divided here and these are two guys up
here we have John and down here we have
Bobby so let's say this is the exact
same file open on John's computer open
on Bobby's computer and John edits this
thing and he adds an item in here he
adds an Li and he adds sand now how does
Bobby get that change if Bobby's already
made five changes he's added his own
stuff down here now you've got to get
together and get in a room you've got to
open up both copies of the file it gets
messy as you can imagine in a company of
ten people it gets messy almost
instantly what do you do another common
problem is people overriding people's
stuff deleting people's stuff having to
check out files there's really no clean
way to do it people have to be able to
work on the same files at the same time
without hours and hours of wasted work
and unnecessary communication that's
where source control came in what github
will do or git will do for you is you
open a git project and that keeps track
of all the changes that
you make so when I make this change it
knows that I've made this change and
then I can at any time connect and find
out anyone else's changes so let's say
Bobby's added I forget what it is rope I
don't know why use rope if you're
building a brick wall at any time I can
sync up to the repository and it will
pull in the fact that Bobby made and
saved this change and so then I won't
lose any work it'll just automatically
boom boom boom throw in everyone else's
changes and at the same time he can do
the same thing he can sync up to the
repository and get my changes everyone
smile you'll get what's called a merge
conflict and that's when both I have
edited this line I'm gonna call it good
mortar and he's gonna call this more
mortar and if he saves that and then I
sync up to the repository it's not going
to know who's right it's just going to
know I changed it and Bobby change it so
I'll get something like this depending
on what kind of source control I'm using
I'll get your version something that
looks an output like this and it'll say
it's a conflict and also I have to go
okay hmm
one of these is the right one which
one's the right one Bobby change this I
change this oh I know what I'll do I'll
go more good mortar there we go and then
I'll get rid of all this junk and I'll
save my file and now I had to manually
merge changes that will still happen
sometimes but github will flag for you
everything that both people have done
the way to minimize having to do that
because that is kind of a pain in the
rear and there's really no way around it
is to make sure you have good
communication on generally who's working
on what tasks and that shouldn't happen
very often
and when it does it shouldn't be much
bigger than what I just kind of showed
you right there so let's get into github
let's get into an actual project and how
we're going to set this up and manage
this first thing you'll need to do is
you'll need to get github installed on
your computer and
to sign up for a github account so go to
github.com and sign up for an account
it's free and then also go to Mac
github.com or Windows github.com and
install the github application that will
take care of everything else you need
for you right there and it will give you
a visual application which I will tell
you not to use so this is the visual
application it will give you it's super
easy really easy to get started but a
lot of employers look down on it because
lots of people use this as a crutch
instead of actually learning the command
line the command line is not hard it's
about five commands a lot of people just
avoid it like the plague is seeing a
black screen freaks them out but we're
gonna get past that fear today and have
a great time with it
so I'm going to go ahead now and create
a new repository think of repository
equals project whatever I already did
one called git tutorial as a test so new
get tests so I'm making a repository
called new get test and the only thing
I'm gonna check here is initialize this
repository with a readme and that allows
me to clone it right away I'll show you
what that means so you see it made a new
repository for me called nougat test I
already have my first file which is
called readme and all the readme has is
this what the readme is is it's kind of
any instructions
you're gonna give to people who use this
repository it's automatically displayed
when you open up the repository so all
I'm going to do here is I'm going to
copy this clone URL this is what I will
use to get it on my machine okay that's
all I need to do for github so now I'm
going to use yes the dreaded command
line lots of you guys have been avoiding
this because you're terrified of it you
don't know what to do with it and we're
going to get into this today so if
you're on Mac you only need to know like
three commands to actually use this
thing and then get hubs five commands
and if you're on Windows same thing to
open it with Mac you go to utilities
applications utilities terminal and then
to open it on Windows you're going to
run and type CMD and hit enter so
basically CD is your change directory
command so if I go CD dot dot I'm gonna
go up a directory I just went from
documents into wheels so now I can go CD
back into documents there we go I can
also go CD dot dot Nam and users I can
go CD we'll documents and I that's
basically CD that's your first command
and the other one is gonna be LS and
that'll show you a listing of all the
files in your directory if you're on
Windows that's going to be dir unless
you have fake Linux Mac commands
installed so you can see I have a few
files in My Documents thing not much
what I'm going to do is I want to put
the repository in documents so I'm going
to go get clone and I'm going to paste
that URL that I copied clone is your
first git command well that does is it
takes that repository and it copies the
whole thing down and puts it in a folder
called its name by its name so now if I
hit LS you can see that I have a folder
called nougat tests so CD nougat test
and LS I've got readme dot md that's my
only file okay that's about all I'm
gonna do for now let me go ahead and add
that folder to my project here and
nougat test there we go
so now I've got my folder and I can do
away with you you're not necessary
anymore actually and what I'm gonna do
down here is let's say John Bob does the
same thing he's going to go get clone
not readme MD this URL John is also
working on our project so he also is
going to clone it you notice I've cloned
it into a different folder so you can
actually have the same folder on your
computer in 20 different places and this
one's in my github folder there we go so
now we both have the repository here and
I'm going to go ahead over here on the
top and I'm going to make a new file I'm
going to save it as you get tests we'll
call it index.html
and let's make something here real quick
let's make our first I list here we'll
just kind of recreate what we had bricks
bricks and more girl let's just make it
a list of two items I'll save it and you
notice I got index.html there and John
still doesn't have anything because he's
not he's just working on his own let me
go ahead and I'll make a new file here
for John and we'll call it index two dot
HTML well just make it we'll just do
this you oh let's leave it like that so
John's got index two I've got index and
we're both working on the project and
that's all the progress we've made so
here are you ready here's we've got our
first git command which is get clone
that's going to pull er any repository
in using its URL
our next git command is get status so
this is going to show us what's
different between us and github up in
the sky right now so all that's
different now is there's an untracked
file we have created a file called
index.html github has no clue that this
file exists so what I'm gonna do right
now is I'm going to do get add which
means we're going to add any changes or
any new files or whatever by name so add
index.html so now we've said okay put
this guy into our project if I do get
status again you'll notice that it's now
a change to be committed we have a new
file index.html so now all I have to do
is I've added it I can go get to commits
which means I'm locking it in to the
repository git commit dash M means I'm
giving it a message and the message is
going to be in quotes added index dot
HTML there we go so now it's committed
but it's still on my
it's locked into the repository but it's
not synced up to github.com yet so all
we have to do to get it to do a sync is
get push that's going to take anything
on our machine and push it up to
github.com so now if i go to github.com
and i refresh you'll notice I have index
dot HTML so there we go now it's up
there I'm going to hide this and so now
if this guy here goes get to pull which
is so push pushes up to github.com and
pull is going to pull down from
github.com whoops I'm not in the right
directory CD space new get tests get
pull these commands will only work when
you're in the directory of your github
repository because you can have a
hundred different repositories on your
computer so I did a get pull and you see
it pulled in index.html now I've got
them both so now what John's gonna do is
John's got this guy and I'm also going
to add an item to my list here sand so
now if I do get status I see two things
I've modified index.html and I have an
untracked file myself so I can you get
add index.html and you'll see that now
if I do get status the changes for
commit are that I've modified this guy
up sorry wrong one changes to be
committed that I've modified this and I
still have an untracked file that's not
ready to be committed so I can do get
add index to another thing you can do is
you can do get add dot which is going to
do everything in your directory or you
can you get hat add dash capital a which
is going to do get at all so I'm gonna
do get add a and now if I do get status
you see that I've got two files ready to
go one that's modified one that's brand
new and I'm going to do a terribly
generic get commit which is a bad idea
made changes
that's not useful to anyone but oh well
so I've added committed I'm going to
push and now over here I'm going to pull
get to pull but before yes I get pull
there we go
and sitting now I've noticed I've got
index two and my index one automatically
has all the updated changes if five
different people were working on these
files and I did a poll it get
everybody's changes as long as they push
them up so that's kind of how it works
you'll notice the commands aren't too
bad so far we've got get status get add
get commit get push get pull that's kind
of your basics into github there's about
ten commands in total if I just type git
it'll show me kind of all the commands
that I can use and kind of what they do
and that's pretty much the beginning of
github so let's talk about a little bit
about workflow how do you actually do
this
so one thing I'll do is when I come in
at the beginning of each day I'm going
to start off by doing a git pull want to
make sure I get everybody's updates from
all you know last night the rest of the
day hey already up today great I'm gonna
make my changes dot thought that uh this
isn't water anymore it's now called I
don't know something else quikrete
I think it's a spell it made that
changed edit that uh and so now I'm
ready to push my changes up I'm going to
add everything made mortar more specific
got it got all my changes done I'm ready
to sync up all my work to the repository
I'll do this with every kind of
incremental piece of work I do I will
probably add commits all throughout the
day and then every few hours in the day
I'm gonna make sure I'm in sync to make
sure I don't get way far off of stuff
let's create what's called a merge
conflict here instead of Mordor I'm
gonna put
I'm gonna change us to more mortar I
think we already went through that
example so get add a git commit let's
say down here on the bottom what's this
guy's name again Bobby Bobby just made a
change on a line that I made a change on
and so now when I do a git pull I it
says conflict merge conflict in
index.html you have to fix the conflicts
and then commit the result basically
you've both changed these lines and
at--look first this looks like crazy
freaking out ah what the heck do I do
with this all it's telling me is his
head which is what I'm on we made this
change to this line and somebody else
made this change so what do we do about
it I'm not smart enough to know you've
got to figure this out it's not too bad
I just look at the two lines and say
okay he was adding more which is our
company's way of saying we need to get
more than one so I'm just going to do
more quikrete I'm going to kind of
manually merge those lines together or
I'm going to just say no quikrete is the
right line he didn't really know what he
was talking about we don't ever say more
anyway I manually make the decision I
delete all the helper things that it
gave me save my file and now I just hit
get commits with nothing in there whoops
get add a get to commit forgot to add it
you notice it said okay now it's
continuing my merged branch of master
and by the way if you ever accidentally
hit commit without a message or anything
you'll get this screen you won't figure
out how to get out of it
you hit escape : WQ to save it escape :
WQ there you go
merge branch master yes escape : WQ is
the most complicated part of everything
we're going to learn today just write
that one down it takes a long time and
I'm always forgetting escape : WQ is how
you get out of a full blown commit
I'll show you real quick just what that
was so let's say I made a change now I
can modify the index get add egg its
commits if you ever just hit commit
without the dash M it's gonna open up
this same thing it's for a full-blown
message is what it is it's for a
multi-line message there you go so
that's kind of what that was it was like
a multi-line commit message once again
escape : WQ enter and there you go get
push and now he can do a git pull you
can find out that I deleted that line
there you go and that is your intro to
github once again get commits get add a
get push get pull that's about it have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
