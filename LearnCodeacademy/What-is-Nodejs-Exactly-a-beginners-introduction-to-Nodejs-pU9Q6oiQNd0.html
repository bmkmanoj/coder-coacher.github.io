videos coming up I've already recorded
some videos on how to do deployments
with nodejs automated deployments fun
stuff but first I wanted to answer the
question with an introductory video of
what is no js' I've had a lot of people
ask me this
people are saying stuff like hey I've
been doing PHP for a lot of years but I
don't exactly get what nodejs it sounds
confusing seems like it means a lot of
different things and it kind of does to
some people so we're going to answer
that the simple question is the simple
answer is is the makers of nodejs took
JavaScript which is normally confined to
a browser and they allowed it to run on
your computer so normally you know
JavaScript runs in the browser it can
only access your web page but when you
allow it to run when you give it a an
environment to run on the machine they
took Google Chrome's v8 engine which is
an awesome JavaScript engine and now v8
runs on your machine and so this whole
new world opens up now you can access
the files on your computer which you
normally can't do with JavaScript you
can listen to network traffic on your
computer you can listen to HTTP requests
your machine gets and send back a file
you can access databases directly all
sorts of great stuff basically anything
you could do with PHP or Ruby on Rails
you can now do with JavaScript in nodejs
and so there's basically two categories
of what people are doing with node
they're building utilities on the
machine which is like utilities for your
day in day out development that would be
gulp grunt yeoman you know you know
things that you'll concatenate and build
javascript files with or it'll listen to
file system changes and it'll do live
reload or you know whenever you save a
SAS file it will automatically convert a
CSS file utilities on your machine if
you say a job description if you see a
job description that says you know
front-end developer nodejs is in there
somewhere
they're probably referring to this kind
of nodejs if you see a job description
that says no js' engineer nodejs
developer they're probably talking to
the other use case which is let's build
a web server a web application with node
instead of using a ruby
rales PHP Python we're going to use
Express framework for nodejs or koa
framework for nodejs or whatever and
we're going to build our web application
in this and so that's kind of what the
other use case is so let's do some super
basics on how this nodejs thing works
well for one if you go to node.js org
you can install it on your machine then
you can type node dash V there you go
I've got a version I can actually just
type node right now and now I'm running
a process a process you know kind of a
program that's running on your computer
I've now created a new process I can
type JavaScript very I equals one and
type a a equals one just like I would
normally do on a console but what's
different about this is this process
right here runs within window so if I go
ver a equals one then window dot a
equals 1 because window is my global
scope there is no window object on a
node.js process because there's no
window what there is is a global object
global a equals one and then there's
also no document object javascript has a
global document object which is my HTML
document that this thing's built upon
well this isn't tied to an HTML document
it's tied to a process which is the
actual program process that's running
right now so I have a process object and
that's kind of two differences I'm going
to ctrl C twice to get out of that and
you can also I have my module one j/s
right here you can also run node module
one and I don't have to put j/s but I
can and so it runs this and exits
because nothing's happening so I can go
console.log high and then I can run that
again high you know you can do very
equals one console.log a and then run
that again says hi it says one so that's
kind of how you'll actually execute
files just like you would execute PHP
files or something like that on your
machine and how they let's get into
modules real quick how modules work
within node because this is going to
apply either way
and I'm probably I'm pretty much only
going to get into modules NPM and a
basic web server and then we're done and
that's kind of going to give you the
overall scope of how you program in
nodejs so in modules are how you
basically load one file into another if
you've used two required JSU already get
the concept let's go there to m2 equals
require module two so that's saying
before I do any more code I need to load
in module two so here's my module two I
actually have to do this which means I'm
looking for a file in the same directory
or I could go you know if there's other
folders going on here I could go folder
two slash module two it basically
assumes dot J s is added just like you
know if you were running a file over
here so in this case it's in the same
directory I'm just going to require dot
module two and let's console.log this M
to run it and module two is a function
let's actually delete that that's from
earlier stuff that I was testing the
video module two is an empty object
because module two is not exporting
anything at all I can go there a equals
one run it still nothing
I've defined ver a in here but I'm not
exporting that to get this from module
two into module one it's whatever is
exporting from module two is what will
get passed into this M two variable so
if I go module exports a equals a so now
I'm signing a to module exports a there
you go now the value of a is one I can
go module exports B equals two and now
you see I'm just basically building a
whole object you can also shorthand this
and you just go exports exports a equals
that same thing works just fine
or you can override the entire module
exports object and make it a function
so module 2 so now I can actually go m2
equals require module 2 and I can run m2
because it's a function now there you go
when I run function module 2 it's going
to console.log it so that's kind of how
modules work that's kind of how your
separation of files works in nodejs
and what they've also built is this node
package manager which is NPM it comes
with node and that allows you to
actually download and manage packages
which is really cool so I can go npm
install underscore it's pretty popular
module so now it made a node modules
folder and it added underscore in there
and so now I can actually go there
equals a require underscore node no file
path no dot slash just underscore and so
that's going to look in my node modules
folder for the underscore module and the
underscore package will tell me what
file that loads and that is by default
just gonna load underscore so now I can
go see a console log my underscore
character now when I run module one you
see that's the whole underscore library
awesome super cool so NPM is a super
easy way of installing common things and
then the other piece to NPM is ideally
you want to save them in a package if
you're working on a project and you have
15 different node modules you don't want
to have you don't have to run NPM
install every time somebody downloads
your you know github repository and
needs these dependencies you want to be
able to save the 20 dependencies you
have so you'll actually run NPM in it
and we're actually going to start an NPM
package here real quick name what is
known sure sure sure sure sure sure sure
and so I just said ok to everything and
it made a package.json file for me
and so it's called what is node has a
version blah blah blah and you see it
already added underscore as a dependency
for me because I've already installed
that so now I can do NPM install
backbone if I run NPM install backbone
it added to my node modules as well but
it did not add to my package JSON
because I didn't do the flash S or / - s
flag so now if I do - s that's for save
you can see that it now added backbone
in here into my package JSON as well and
so now I've got the two going on let's
say I delete this node modules folder
altogether bye bye go away you don't
want to keep the node modules in so now
my my whole node project consists of
this one package JSON file and all I
have to do is go NPM install NPM install
is going to look through all the
dependencies and it's going to get them
all there you go now I've got all my
node modules and now everything's going
to work I can require understood
underscore again so that's kind of if
that made sense that's how NPM works NPM
allows you to maintain all your
dependencies one of the awesome things
about node is there's thousands and
thousands of dependencies that people
are building all the time that allow you
to do cool things like you know access
web services or login to Google with
your Google email address there's
packages out there for all this stuff
so in node you can just load in a
package real time the package will do
the dirty work for you and you can focus
on building your application let's look
at the HTTP package which is what we use
to make a basic web server we don't have
to install this with NPM because it
comes built into node HTTP and we can go
HTTP create server and let's give that a
function whoops then we'll go ver server
equals that returns a server and that
server can listen to port
3
to normally run notes stuff on port 3000
actually so we'll do port 3000 makes us
a little bigger here so now I'm going to
create a web server and that web server
will get request response and so
whenever I get an incoming request on
port 3000 this function will fire and I
get to access what they're requesting
and I get to actually make a little
response so I'm gonna do is I'm going to
console.log got a requests and I'm going
to do a response dots right hi and I'm
going to response dot end there we go
and now let's run this
so you notice it runs and it keeps
running it doesn't stop because there is
an open server running that's listening
to any requests on port 3000 so if I go
to port 3000 it says hi and it says hey
I got a request let's do it again nice
got another request it sent back hi if I
keep doing this it's going to keep
saying hey I got a request I got a
request let's send hi back every time
super cool it's super awesome and so
that's kind of how you build a basic web
server you could listen to if I want
localhost 3000 slash give me a file then
it's still just gonna say hey because
there's no smart code in here listening
to what the path is and what we're going
to do with that path and so on but we
could listen to the path and if the path
is image/jpeg we could go get image JPEG
and respond back with that so that's
kind of what nodejs is from here on out
you get to mess around with it if you
want to learn how to build an express
web app then I have a video on that
already I'm gonna put that video in the
description and that's an introduction
