basically have our whole app working the
way we want to within the core OS
cluster these guys are you can we can
run as many web instances as we want
dynamic load balancing is taking place
we have one problem left to solve and
that's that
just like our app instances we don't
know the IP addresses and the port
numbers of our nginx load balancers
because they're going to change all the
time
if we need to run three of them or if
this one dies and gets scheduled over
here it's gonna have a new IP address in
a new port number so we need to add two
other things to complete the picture
we need something static we need a fixed
IP address that we can run DNS to so
let's say we're doing my site comm I
added a host entry for subdomains on my
site comm to point to this IP address
right here which is this IP address this
is going to be a DNS so in digital ocean
my DNS for my site com is going to point
to this IP address and then this guy
port 80 which is HTTP and port 443 for
us for SSL are going to automatically
load balance between all of our nginx
instances we're going to create
subdomains so say some app can be
accessible by some app mysite.com and if
we add I don't know say forms app then
forms dot mice then we all our forms
load balancers will be accessible by
forms dot mysite.com or maybe there will
be a path so mysite.com slash forms will
automatically point to our forms load
balancers so that's what's going to
happen up here and we're going to
basically do the same fix we did for our
app service discovery is we're gonna
have our nginx load balancers register
themselves to a net CD registry that
this guy can watch with conf d and
reload himself so the exact same thing
just a slightly different take on it
what we're doing is we're going to
create our own at CD registry a new one
because it's a bad practice for anything
outside of this core OS cluster to
reference the internal at CD registry
that's a bad practice so we don't want
to use this one we want to use one
that's outside of our core OS cluster
that our nginx load balance
can watch so we're gonna create ideally
you'd create a cluster of them so
there's failover you know three five or
seven in this case I'm just going to do
one and then also ideally you don't want
one copy of nginx being your gateway to
your whole app because if that goes down
your whole app goes down the ways around
that is you'll share the same IP address
with keepalive so you actually run two
copies of this and one guy gets the IP
traffic and if he goes down that IP
address points to the failover one on
AWS on Amazon that's called I believe a
elastic IP because everything to Amazon
is elastic they call it a what do they
call it for digital ocean a flexible IP
or something like that so they've got
different names for all the services
almost everybody except for Rackspace
has that virtual IP that you can share
and you can look up how to do it on each
of those services for this example to
make it really easy I'm going to create
this registry and I'm gonna make it
public so we can actually look at it
with our web browser you do not want
this publicly accessible though because
you don't want anybody to be able to
write files to your Etsy D registry and
have your application load balancer try
to reconfigure itself that's a really
terrible idea
but I'm gonna actually make it public so
we can watch it so what I did is I spun
up a core OS machine that's kind of act
as our Etsy D and our nginx for this
example we'll just make it really quick
and dirty
let's go SSH in core at docker PS I ran
at CD I just kind of ran the the docker
at CD image and so that automatically is
publicly exposed to port to 3:79 so I
can go to this IP address port 2 3 7 9
that's my IP address and then v2 keys
and you see I've got a subdomains kind
of key folder set up right there so many
subdomains that show up in there I want
to create an engine X that load balances
between them we've kind of already
solved that problem with conf D for
nginx load balancer docker image that
we've created so we're going to copy
this
we're just gonna make a couple little
changes to it one and our and our nginx
Tomo we're gonna watch a different key
structure because we're talking to a
different Etsy D registry we're not
talking to this registry now we're gonna
talk to this registry so we're going to
instead of looking at services some app
upstream we're just gonna watch
subdomains and that's it and for our
example and your next template looks a
little different whereas before we
always just proxied into app which was
an upstream of multiple servers which is
what you should be doing we're just
always going to in this case just proxy
pass to one fixed server because again
for my example here I'm assuming you
never have one more than one load
balancer for each app for this example
so there we go
do a docker build do a docker push in
this case I did a docker build and
doctor docker push I called it will our
stern slash nginx DNS there we go and so
that's going to get one thing all I need
to do is I just need to give it my at CD
let me show you coffee watch only only
variable I need is where how do I access
that CD as long as I know how to access
at CD everything else is kind of
configured in the Tamil here I'm
watching the subdomains key so let's go
ahead and run this container and we
should be good so docker run we're gonna
run it as a daemon in the background
we're gonna expose port 80 internal to a
fixed port 80 external because it's
getting HTTP traffic and then we can
also do port 443 if we're doing
supporting SSL I'm giving it at CD and
sed is running in this case on my same
machine IP address which is this guy
here so that would be a cluster
somewhere else
but two three seven nine a name is DNS
and we're just gonna run we'll our Stern
if I could spell my own name nginx DNS
there you go so that's running its
configuring itself right now
and now all we need to do is we just
need to now have our load balancer
register itself because remember this
guy's got a register itself to the STD
registry so to do that is very simple I
just added an exec start post we can
really do two things we can either add a
sidekick service that does this for us
just like we did with our sum app
service or you can do it this way which
is the sidekick service would be a
better way of doing it but to show you
the other way I can just do an exec
start post so after my load balancer
starts up I'm going to do a put two that
there's my IP address again I'm going to
put two Etsy D I'm gonna register myself
as some app and I'm going to give it my
public IP address and my public docker
port and these are kind of those clunky
commands to sniff out my IP address and
to sniff out my docker port there might
be cleaner ways of doing these I'm not
the most awesome person in the world at
grepping stuff out but these two
commands are basically going to send my
port number and my IP address
I'm not registering you remember from
flannel everybody has this internal IP
address that's not going to work because
that's going to be internal to the core
OS cluster what I've got to do is I've
got to do an IP address that is internal
- that is my publicly accessible IP
address so I'm going to do this IP
address here and then I'm also going to
do the docker port that that's exposed
to now if this is on the same subnet
that I might be able to do that flannel
IP address and automatically do port 80
but in this instance I'm just going to
do the IP address of the core OS node
I'm on and then the automatically
created docker port gosh that's a
mouthful I'm registering myself that's
all it is people I'm registering myself
and here's the command look into it more
if you want so I've actually already
submitted this new service definition to
Fleet and I've restarted that so if I
actually go Kees recursive true you can
see there's my submission and what I
used 15 sentences to tell you is I
submitted the IPA
in the port number so I could go
straight to this if I wanted to and you
can see its load balancing between one
two three and four
excellent so that's the direct IP
address and port number to this guy and
then he should have picked up on that by
now and created a sub domain called I
think I called it some app yep you
should have created a subdomain called
some app some app dots mysite.com there
we go
that is now automatically generated dns
again i have a host entry on my computer
i added so every sub domain for my side
comm comes to this IP address so there
you go that's it we've wrapped it up we
have completed the circle and that's it
so this is the only guy that actually
has any kind of public IP address
everything else is hidden we don't need
to access at CD in the browser like I
just did and there you go hopefully this
series helped you out love to hear any
feedback on it there are services that
you can use in place of lots of these
things you don't have to use core OS you
can use Apache mezzos you don't have to
use Etsy D you can use gosh what's hash
e corpse got console there's many other
ways to do that there's other ways to do
the DNS portion but this is a way to do
it so have a great day and enjoy docker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
