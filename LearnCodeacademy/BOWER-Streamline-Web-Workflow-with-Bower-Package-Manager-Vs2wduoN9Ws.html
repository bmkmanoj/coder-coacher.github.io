guys have heard about Bauer it is a
package manager for the web if you know
what package managers are you're like
yes this is great that it's here if you
don't know what package managers are
you're going to learn what that is and
what the value of that is and why
everybody's buzzing about it so let's do
Pat let's just get into it I'll show you
what this is about
first off you'll need nodejs installed
on your machine if that's not installed
here's how you know is you type node - V
I have version 10 0 point 10.2 - if
that's if you don't see that then go
ahead - node j s org get it installed
once that's there then you can go npm
install - G Bower so there's going to
globally install Bower for me so now it
is an executable anywhere on my system
there you go Bower is now installed and
ready to be used so go to the folder
where your project is which is in
sandbox test for me and let's just go
ahead and say we want to add jQuery to
our page we go Bower install jQuery and
that's going to go grab the latest
greatest version - jQuery and you can
see I got it in finder here you can see
it added a bower components folder add a
jQuery and added distribution version
for that right there as well as the full
source and this is sublime same package
up here so now if I go Bower list it
says that it jQuery is installed in the
Bower components folder if I go Bower
list paths with double dashes then it
will show me the path to the one I'm
going to want to use by default so now I
can just go here
there you go jQuery is on my page Bower
is super great for that let's say I also
want to add backbone bower install
backbone it's going to automatically
grab backbone backbone has a dependency
of underscore so it's also going to grab
underscore j/s for me and now if I do
Bower list paths I've got my 1 for
underscore got my one for backbone and I
could just add those all here so that's
the first awesome thing about Bower is
it just gives you a
really easy way to install dependencies
I'm this wouldn't have been a complete
pain in the rear but I've had to
download the zip file unzip the zip file
put it where I want it to go and this is
just way better and so that's step one
is using it just to install stuff just
using it to download stuff on your page
if you want to get by the way a let me
uninstall jQuery if you want to install
a specific version you know lots of
people don't want to use jQuery 2.0 if
you're supporting legacy browsers jQuery
just did pound what is that one point
nine point two I could probably grab
that there you go
jQuery 1.9 point to grab that specific
version let's make sure that's what's in
there and up we got an error there
available versions one point nine point
one okay there we go and see it was even
nice enough to no dummy there is no one
point nine point two out there right now
it's so same thing let's go list paths
and sometimes it doesn't have the path
in there our component slash jQuery got
a pick-your-own yourself here so there
you go jQuery slash jQuery and there's
just no dist path so sometimes it
doesn't have the path in there for you
depending on how they added bower so
that's step one of bower use it to
download and install JavaScript files
let's go to step two this is honestly
where I think Bower becomes even more
useful is let's say we're working on
this project and we're not the only ones
working on this project it's kind of a
bad idea a bad pattern to check in this
code into your git repository as the web
keeps growing and growing and everything
becomes interdependent on it's shut on
each other
a good pattern is to only check in code
that has to do with your project
specifically so we don't want this to be
in the repo we just want a package file
that says hey install these things for
us so we're going to go Bower in it
and start making that package file by
default it's going to start throwing in
these things I'm just going to say yes
to everything there we go just keep
saying yes yes yes I'm just going to I'm
just going to do all the defaults and
say yes it's going to make a bower.json
file for me here's all the values I put
in I can change them now if I want and
here's the dependencies that were
currently installed at the point of me
creating this init file and so now what
I can do is I can actually all have a
git ignore line for the bower components
folder so Bower components will not be
included in my git repository just these
two files and so now whenever anybody
else it pulls the repo down they just go
Bower install and that's going to grab
all their dependencies so it's kind of
like a common thing you download the
folder your run Bower install and now
your folders your project is good to be
used and so we've we've cleaned it out
we've kept all these dependencies out we
know it's going to automatically load
the specific version that our our
product is built for as the versions
keep incrementing we're only going to
get a new version if we intentionally
choose to go to point O two point O and
so that's kind of where the package
management concept comes in for Bower
another thing you can do is you can
install say you have a large network and
you have internal company repos of
projects and pieces of code you can
install those using Bower
you can go Bower install and then a
github repo URL say if you have a local
installation of github Enterprise or if
you just have private github repos as
long as you have access it will use your
github SSH keys and you can install any
github URL as long as everyone else on
your project will have access to that
repo add it in here as well so it gives
you a way to break up your project into
meaningful chunks and components and
each one just can use a bower package to
do it all and this doesn't just go for
JavaScript I can go Bower install
bootstrap and this will give me all the
CSS files
and actually now that we have a
bower.json file you notice I added
bootstrap but it didn't get added to the
bower.json that's a mistake that people
commonly make a lot is you have to hit
flag capital S if you want it to save to
your actual bower.json file and seen now
you'll notice that it reloaded bootstrap
is saved if I go by our list paths
it gives me multiple paths for bootstrap
because much trap has the JavaScript
file it's got the CSS file and it's also
got with a glyph icon fonts so yay there
we are that's Bower hope you enjoyed
learning about it have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
