try to shortcut you through how to
connect to a MongoDB database with
nodejs
using Express J s and Mongoose which are
two of the most popular frameworks for
doing this thing so that's what we're
going to do if you missed my intro to
node J s and Express J s I'll put that
in the description and so what I've done
is I've generated an Express J s app
here pretty much straight up just has
one route so far which says okay so
let's go ahead and install Mongoose so
npm install s because we want to save it
to our package Mongoose there we go and
Mongoose is kind of like your most
popular ORM for Mongo so that's good
Mongoose is installed i'm going to go no
daman app j s so now it's going to be
rebooting my app j s and should be good
yep great okay so no Mongoose is
installed in node modules saving it to
the package awesome okay let's go ahead
and then require Mongoose goals require
there we go so now Mongoose is in the
first thing we're going to do is create
our connection I'm going to do this in
development only since I'm just
connecting to my development server here
because you'll probably have a different
database for different environments if
not then just you know do it you don't
have to do it in development here so
Mongoose connects very simple and my
server is running locally at 55.5 5.5
5.5 and my DB is called Mongo probably
could come up with a better DB name but
oh well I decided my test DB would be
called Mongo so let's save that and I'm
running no issues nothing broke
excellent let's go ahead and move on now
and actually create our first thing
we're going to do is we're going to
create models kind of like you would
with backbone J s if you're from a
front-end background you create a model
and then you use that model the model
also kind of doubles as a collection in
a lot of ways so we're going to go
Mongoose we're defining a model right
now is what we're doing so users and
then
here's where you give it your schema you
can either give it an object right here
you can actually create a new user
schema for right now we're just going to
go object so basically all we have is
name and that's a string there you go
and so now I've defined a model called
users and with the Excel actually going
to do is look for the users collection
so if I go app docket users this kind of
makes a little more sense here then I
can go Mongoose
model I can now access that model so
even if this was defined in a different
file I can access it find and then my
function is going to have error and
users if the users indeed are correct so
once that's found them that I can res
dot send users let's see if that works
whoops because we're not going to users
there you go
and now I've got my three users me my
wife and John Travolta so let's go ahead
and make one for posts I have two
schemas going on right now to
collections I have a user's and it posts
which has completely basic posts going
on so let's go ahead and define our
second model here which would be posts
and this one has contents and content is
also a string so there we go and this
will be Mongoose model posts now it's
basically the exact same thing as you
can see so now if I do get posts I'm
going to access the model posts which I
define up there and on successful find
we are going to send the posts so here
we go let's check it out and I didn't
save my file there you go so now I've
got my two posts oh I also have a user
on there so user
well let's before we go any further with
the schema we'll go ahead and look at
how to redo our app you'll notice I'm
doing all these routes right here in the
app GIS I'm just doing that for the
simplicity of the tutorial it's
definitely a better idea to have your
routes in their own routes file slash
routes files same thing with models we
do not want to be doing all this logic
here in the app Jas file so let's go
ahead and make a new folder will call
this models
everybody wants to work with models for
a living
let's see okay so this will be called
users nope well we just save it users
j/s there we go so let's go ahead and
take this out of here and let's go there
we go and we're also going to go schema
which we already loaded in with mongoose
there you go that'll help us generate a
new schema so now we can do this we can
go users schema but the new schema and
then we just do the object exactly like
we would have done and we go
Mongoose top model we're going to define
this and we're going to give it user
schema so that's all we're going to do
in the users model now and so the schema
will be named string and then it's
pretty much all we got for now name ha
there you go so that's the users one and
let's go ahead and copy and paste this
create a new file and this one will be
called what was that other one posts
posts and then we'll call this post
schema and so we have content which is a
string and then we also in our posts we
have a user field which is the user ID
so this is going to go and we actually
this type is not a string it's a object
ID but you can't do object ID because
JavaScript doesn't have that as a type
but schema object has it as a type so
we're going to go schema dot and that's
how we can access that so this is our
schema for our content right now
literally all we have is the body and
the user that wrote it so there we go
that's our posts file and now these
aren't getting required anywhere I can
dump those so now we're going to want to
do is we're going to want to write some
sort of basic little file thing that
helps us require in everything in the
models folder so we're going to load in
the FS which is the file system library
and we're just going to go down here F s
dot read d RR sync it's okay to do sync
because this is happening you know on
the startup of our app it's only gonna
happen once during aim is our current
directory and then so that's loading the
directory and then we're going to go
loop through it and that's going to grab
our final name and so we're going to go
if if it's a J s file probably overkill
but oh well we'll do it anyway F capital
ok and there you go
so that's loaded in and then so that
should go through our entire directory
and load them all up let's make sure we
don't have any errors here everything's
still working awesome great so what
we're going to do is if I flew through
that too fast we're going to load up
every model that's in our models
directory when we load up our app and
now we can just access them because
they're already registered in Mongoose
so we can go posts and get our posts so
we can go users and get our users and so
another thing you can do is you can
access posts by ID I'm not going to go
too much into how to use Mongo because
that's definitely its own tutorial well
let's say user ID here post by user ID
we can do this instead user is user ID
so let's see what's a user ID here there
we go I can grab my user ID and then
let's make sure I save this so now I can
go posts by that ID and so I only have
one post
I can't let me go back to users and grab
Laura Stern's ID I think I made a fake
post for her didn't make any post for
John Travolta though did I miss an out
on that one okay another cool thing that
we can do is we can actually attach with
Mongoose the entire user object here if
we want to so say we're grabbing the
posts and you know let's just trim it
down let's also grab the user object on
there well that's easily done we can
grab the user object by just going I
will keep the post by user ID there we
go and so what I will do here is once
we're done getting the posts okay so
we've gotten the posts I'm going to get
this model again and I'm going to Dopp
do a dot populate and I'm going to give
it the post I'm populating which it
comes from here I'm going to go full
screen here for a second so you can see
it so once my post finds once my posts
are all found
they're called posts right here then I'm
going to actually populate my posts and
the path I want to populate is called
user and there we go and then same thing
this is going to get into another
callback you guys are probably noticing
that there's a lot of callbacks starting
to happen to levels of callbacks is
about as far as I want to go because
then you start getting what they call
callback hell and there's ways around
that I'll probably do that in the next
video here so now I'm grabbing posts and
once I've grabbed the posts I'm going to
populate the user path as well let's
save that see if it worked see if I made
any mistakes and it says the user is
null probably because I did not handle
that schema correctly user is schema
object ID yeah I want to figure out
what's up with that oh yeah I know what
I know I did wrong here user is actually
an object sorry about that
schemas aren't the things you write
every day so every once in a while you
forget what to do so the type is an
object ID when you're doing an actual
object and the ref you have to give it a
ref there we go
that should work there we are so I'll
make sure I put the
code on something and put it in the
description so you guys can actually get
a link to this so you can't forget it so
there we go I've now grabbed my related
user and that's about it so that's
pretty much how you connect to a MongoDB
database with Mongoose and thanks for
