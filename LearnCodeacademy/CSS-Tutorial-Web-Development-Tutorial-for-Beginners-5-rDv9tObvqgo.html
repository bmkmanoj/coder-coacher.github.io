off with an introduction to bootstrap
Twitter bootstrap I would highly
encourage you to use bootstrap from now
on start getting comfortable with it
because you will write very few CSS
rules and you'll be able to create very
great stable stuff websites all over the
world huge scale websites are using
Twitter bootstrap and check the link if
you did not catch that tutorial one
thing you'll notice is this is not
working yet that is because I
accidentally forgot jQuery you'll notice
I grabbed on bootstraps website I
grabbed these three things to CSS and
one JavaScript but what I forgot is that
bootstrap uses jQuery so if you scroll
down to basic template you'll see that
they include jQuery here so I'm going to
copy that and put the jQuery script in
my thing as well now you notice
everything is working beautifully my
drop-down works so that's what it looks
like on a mobile and if you expand it
out here's what it looks like on a
regular website looks very nice and
there we go so now I'm going to go ahead
and move forward a little bit more CSS
stuff so back to basic CSS maybe for one
more lesson and then we'll move on and
be done say we wanted to create one of
these ourselves because one even when
you're using bootstrap everyone smile
you've got to make something custom and
it's really good to know some CSS moving
forward so let's say I want to recreate
one of these kind of widgets here let's
say instead of calling it panel I'm
going to call it my panel
let's go div let's go header and we'll
call it class body we'll add a single
paragraph in here
so right now completely unstyled seems
to be normal
let's go and open my main CSS I've
already created three rules here my
panel and heading so let's go ahead and
give my panel a margin you can see I did
a little bit of my homework
beforehand 3% so that way it's always
going to be within 3% of either edge and
let's give the heading a color this is
some of this is going to be a little bit
repeat for you so give it we'll give it
black for now just so we can see where
we're sitting did I call it header yep
called it header heading and one thing
you'll notice is is I did my panel space
heading one thing that people do
accidentally all the time is they'll do
my panel dot heading and what that is
going to look for is something that has
the class my panel and the class heading
this is the same as that because it's
looking for something with both classes
so you'll notice right now this selector
is not selecting anything if I did my
panel and add it a class of heading now
I've added two classes you'll notice it
starts picking up on the entire panel
now just in case you run into that and
wonder what's going on and why your
codes not working you probably forgot a
space there any time you add a space it
goes to the next level and is looking
for a child of this guy
so obviously don't want black so let's
look into kind of doing the color picker
to pick a color we want I'm just going
to go to Google and I'm going to type in
online color picker there you go there
we go
online color picker let's pick a color
let's say a nice greenish sure that
works I'm going to copy that and you'll
notice it gave me the pound hex value so
I'm going to do that paste it in hey we
have kind of a normal looking color
there that's kind of where you're going
to do a lot of your color picking from
if you don't use Photoshop let's go
ahead you'll notice this is snug up
against the edges so I'm going to add
some padding to this I'm noticing my
padding here is a little bit less on the
top and bottom and more on the left so
I'm going to try maybe 10 pixels top
bottom 20 pixels left right yep looks
pretty good and then I'm noticing
there's actually kind of a darker color
for the text
so I'm going to go back to my color
picker I'm going to try to darken this
guy up a little bit and see if that
could be a good text color for me yeah
looks kind of good a little bit lighter
but no worries I'm also going to make
the border that same color one pixel
solid when you're defining borders you
go with your width first then your style
and then your color I could go I believe
I can go dotted pretty much solid is
what you're going to use all the time
you know there's dotted I think I can go
dashed
there's a bunch of them out there you'll
need to search for them yeah dashed
usually you're just going to use solid
one pixel solid there you go that's
looking nice and then I'm also going to
add a border radius which is a different
rule and that's going to be the curved
corners let's try ten pixels that's a
little too much go five pixels border
radius works like everything else I can
give it five pixels five pixels zero
zero and now give me five pixels top
bottom zero on the left in the right if
I just kind of want that one corner I
can go zero pixels you'll notice it'll
op off this guy so I just kind of have
that one corner right there and I'll
just go five pixels for all of them one
thing you'll notice a lot of times too
is you'll notice - WebKit border radius
and what it is is older browsers used to
not officially support this border
radius tag because it's pretty new so
these this is called a vendor prefix
this is any browser using WebKit which
would be Chrome or Safari or pretty much
any mobile phone older phones we'll need
to add that Mozilla Firefox uses the
Mo's five pixels and so lots of times if
you want to make it fully compliant with
older browsers you'll do these things
you'll do these three you'll go
border-radius WebKit border-radius
Moe's border-radius and then if you
happen to be sporting older opera Oh
border-radius
it's kind of annoying we're pretty much
on the verge of being out of these
things but it's still not a bad idea to
add in the vendor prefixes for now I'll
just keep them out just for cleanness
you also notice I'm trying to kind of
keep it in alphabetical order here it's
not a rule that you have to do that but
it's a good idea keeps things clean one
thing I'm noticing is I do not want a
border radius on the bottom of my header
so I'm going to go five pics zero
actually I think I might need to go yep
that is not going to do I want it to do
five pixels five pixels zero zero so
that way it's on the top and the bottom
and I want this border to actually apply
what want this border to apply to the
entire panel which is what's going on up
here
there we go that's looking a little
better and I want this border radius you
notice my this as a border radius but I
want the panel to have a border radius
as well there we go
looking better now this has the border
radius you see if I take this off then
it's square and then the border below it
is square and you'll get a couple weird
little pixels there so I'm keeping the
border radius on both of them let's move
on to the body if I can type my panel
body let's give it up adding let's try
the same 10 pixels 20 pixels there you
go looking good and I actually want this
to have a five pixel border radius
everywhere there we go we basically
recreated this panel let's look into a
couple other things you know what I'm
noticing is it looks like there might be
an ever so slight shadow on these panels
so I'm going to go ahead and add this
it's called box shadow and box shadow
has four values it has your offset your
X offset Y offset your blur
and then your color it's kind of how
that works is let's start with a 10
pixel 10 pixel 0 pixel blur and just
black to make it clear what's going on
you'll notice it's 10 pixels this way 10
pixels down and it's not blurred at all
and it's black so if I make this blur 10
pixels you notice it starts getting
fuzzy now and so if these guys it looks
like they don't have any offset at all
just kind of like just a all-inclusive
shadow this is probably a lot smaller
like 4 pixels and this is not black it's
a very light color maybe like a 999 yeah
you can barely see it now looks like
that might be maybe even lighter si si
si is a lighter color I have a few of
these colors memorized there you go so
it's got that ever so slight gray shadow
that these other ones seem to have so
that's kind of how we're going to do a
box shadow on this entire panel let's
say we wanted to give this I'm going to
copy and paste this a few times let's
say we wanted to create three of these
and whenever we hovered over one we
wanted a delete button to appear what
I'm going to do here is I'm going to add
a div and this class will be show on
hover and then in here I'm going to add
a bootstrap button this button danger is
a red one delete there we go so that's
there it'll always be there for now let
me go and add that to my other two yeah
it's actually a little big I want to be
button XS button extra small there you
go let's go ahead and add this to each
one of these so now that each have a
delete button and I'm going to go I'll
make it show whenever you hover over my
panel so here's how I'm going to do that
my panel show on hover is going to be
display
none so they are not going to appear at
all and then what I'm going to do is my
panel hover so now these rules will only
apply whenever you're hovering over my
panel my panel showing hover display
back to inline block which is what it
was before so now whenever I hover over
a panel that appears nice so now it
feels like your page is doing some
really smart stuff really all we're
doing is we're hiding it and we're
showing it whenever you hover over this
panel at all that kind of nifty you know
what else I could do is I could go my
panel hover I could make this box shadow
get a little bigger when you hover over
it it's kind of just some ideas of
things that you can do maybe I'll make
it like eight pixels and I will make it
a more apparent shadow there you go now
whenever you hover over it see that
shadow is just a little bit more just to
show you what I mean I'll make it full
black a little too much for designs sake
but whenever you hover over kind of
gives it a little pop now I can even
make the border a little bit larger
maybe like a two pixel border there you
go now it really kind of has some pop
whenever you hover over it see it jumps
a little bit because the border is now
made it a few pixels larger now it's got
an extra pixel on top because that
borders two pixels extra pixel on the
bottom so you notice it kind of the guys
below it do this little jump down thing
so ideally I'd probably adjust some
margins there on this hover thing sella
me see maybe that'd be 1% 3% see if I
can a compensate for that oh you know
what is that delete button showing up
okay so that's automatically going to be
larger that's supposed to be happening
that's what's going on there
we'll leave it so that's kind of a
little bit more intermediate CSS before
I wrap up this
lesson I'll get in to kind of a few more
selectors and I'll talk a little bit
about specificity and cascading stuff so
let's go and just clear all this out
save that clear all this out and I'm
just you know I'll just create a
complete blank slate here before we wrap
up this lesson on CSS I'm going to go
ahead and create an h1 hello world so
I'm going to in my stylesheet I'm going
to go h1 color red now H ones are going
to be red H ones should be red exactly
sure what's going on there
Oh probably cuz bootstrap has an h1
let's make it a class h1 bootstrap has a
whole bunch of rules in it and so that's
where all my colors are coming from from
bootstrap already
oh no what's going on here let's just
make it a paragraph one of the things
you run into sometimes with using
something like bootstrap is it's doing a
whole bunch of stuff and you don't
exactly know what it's doing and so
sometimes you can get frustrated trying
to do things so definitely there's some
downsides let me make it really large
400% okay there we go kind of ran into
an issue that I'm actually going to
demonstrate here so now paragraphs have
a color of red anything that comes after
will overwrite if it's the same level of
specificity so if it's as specific so
I'm going to know color blue now you'll
notice even though I've defined a color
red peas will have color blue because it
came after the fact now if I went P
class primary and this had a class of
primary now it became right again
because this is a more specific rule
than this this just applies to
paragraphs this applies to paragraphs
with a class of primary now if I went P
ID of main green so now if I have an ID
on here ID just got even more specific
and now it's green so you'll see that
that's kind of even though they came
before IDs are more specific than
classes and classes are more specific
than just elements and so that's kind of
how that works you'll notice even if I
take away the P an ID is more specific
than both of these however if I go
primary matching by ID are matching by
tag name and by class name is considered
more specific than matching by class
name so this sets it to green this
overrides it to red and then this
doesn't do anything this makes it all
paragraph tags are now would be blue for
any just standard paragraph tags so
that's kind of how specificity works is
if I were to also go primary other if
this said P dot primary is red I'll do
it like this P dot primary is red P dot
primary dot other is green now so if I
make it class primary and other
well now that's considered even more
specific it matches on three levels it
matches on a tag level on a class level
and on a secondary class level or an
additional class level so this is now
the most specific rule that applies to
my paragraph tag here so it will be
green so that's kind of how that goes if
you're including it all in a style sheet
now let's look into doing something else
let me copy main CSS and let me save
this as other CSS and I'm going to
include other CSS after main CSS here
other main.css other CSS so now we have
two things we're including in let's make
main CSS just have P's be a color of
blue
let's have other CSS VPS with a color of
red now my paragraph is red kind of what
happens is is it goes main loads up all
the main rules and then loads up all the
other rules and it's no different than
if they were stacked on top of each
other so main color blue then it loads
in other color red that's no different
than if you did this blue red what we've
done is we've split them up into
separate style sheets which sometimes
makes sense if you start getting a
really big style sheet makes a lot of
sense to split them up into groupings so
it's a lot easier to find out where your
file where your rules go let's move on
and so now let's add a style here this
is a page level style sheet I'm just
adding a style tag straight in here I'm
going to go P color green now paragraphs
have a color of green you'll notice if I
put this be for my link the paragraphs
now have a color of red because this
happens before loads up these Styles
then it goes to here then it goes to
here so they get overwritten by what's
here on the page page page level
stylesheet not really that great of an
idea
I wouldn't recommend doing it because
then you have to copy and paste rules
all over the place another third way you
can do it is you can actually add inline
style here on any tag can I do pink I
think I can do pink I don't know let's
try purple I don't think I can
style color.3 oh I didn't spell it right
style color green there you go now it's
green this will always override anything
that has been passed up and above in
here so element level style is
considered more specific than something
coming from a style sheet this is a
really bad idea unless you're doing it
dynamically with JavaScript on the fly
as they're doing things the only way to
really change an element real-time with
JavaScript is by adding things to the
elements itself but in general it's a
really bad idea to add styling straight
to a tag anyway that probably concludes
for this lesson about all you need to
know I'd say go out there have fun
Google stuff if you want to know how to
make something say look italics I'm not
going to tell you because one thing you
have to learn as a web developer is to
get really good at googling just type
CSS italics and you'll find it
type CSS underline you'll find it type
CSS pretty much anything and you'll find
it online but this is enough to get you
going
hope it helps and have an excellent day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
