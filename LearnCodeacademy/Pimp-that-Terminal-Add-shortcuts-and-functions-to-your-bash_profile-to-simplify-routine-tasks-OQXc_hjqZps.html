things that you do in the terminal
everyday like switch to a very long and
complex folder path that you normally
have to go CD space CD space or maybe
open a file or a folder directly in
sublime text today we learn in this very
quick video how to do that it will only
apply to Mac and Linux and UNIX users it
will not apply to win it to Windows
users I'm sorry there are ways to do it
but that's just it's completely
different from this video so what you're
going to do is you're gonna go to
sublime text or your favorite text
editor and you're gonna open a new
document and we're going to save what's
called the bash profile folder I can't
type and talk at the same time if you
guys wonder why I do that okay so the
file in your user directory called dot
bash profile is the file we're going to
update and what that is is that runs
every time you open a new terminal
session so let's go ahead and make an
alias an alias just is a shortcut
basically for a command alias let's go
and now let's make it super simple I'll
just call it nginx for an engine X
project that I'm working on I go engine
X then the commit then I basically do
quotes and anything in the quotes is the
actual command it runs when I type
engine X so I'm going to a code sandbox
engine X engine so that's a long folder
name that I hate typing I'm always
having to type it and I'm going to echo
which will tell me this will basically
just echo whatever I put in here and
this is just my reference to remember
that I have this command okay
let me go ahead and it save I'm going to
go to my user folder dot bash profile
there we go it warns me that dot is only
for system files and then I'm gonna
replace it I say yep okay so now if I
create a new terminal session you'll
notice that it echos this that's why I
type the echo here so whenever I open a
new window of any kind I'm always going
to echo that and so now I can just type
nginx there we go and it automatically
took me all the way up to my nginx
folder which is my user slash code slash
sandbox slash and genetic slash nginx
awesome let's here's another very useful
one and that's I call it sub which is
for sublime tech
I'm gonna go open this is actually a
function a Bosch function looks like
JavaScript in a lot of ways number one
it or dollar one is my first argument
that I pass it I'll show you in a second
how to use that and then - a is my
application names and I'm going to go
sublime text so there we go
and then I'm gonna echo my you know
remember reminder open file in sublime
there we go let's save that and let's go
ahead and I have to open a new session
always have to open a new terminal for
these things to activate just so you
know if I type sub here nothing happens
says command not found
I open a new terminal window and I'm
gonna be fine
so now I can go let me see what I got
here I can go sub music and voila it
opened the music folder as if it were a
project in sublime text super cool let
me go to my nginx folder now and let me
see what I got let me go sub vagrant
file nice so now I can easily open a
file I can easily open a project if you
want to open the folder you're in you
just do dot and there you go now I got
my whole nginx file and that's a super
fun little trick that lots of people
don't know about that less yet allows
you to automate a lot of things in
terminal create your own shortcuts and
generally enjoy life more have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
