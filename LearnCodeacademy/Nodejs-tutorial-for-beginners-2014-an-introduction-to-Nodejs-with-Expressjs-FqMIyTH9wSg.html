short cutting you into building a web
application with no js' and we're going
to be using the Express J's framework
which is kind of the most popular
framework and one of the easiest to
learn it's really a tremendous
combination and so we're going to be
getting into it
I've done a video on this before and a
lot of people have done some great
videos on this but Express really here
mid-2014 made some changes
it's where to be really difficult to
follow along to previous videos because
there's just a few key things that are
different so we're going to be getting
into those right now in this 2014
updated video on how to get started with
nodejs if it's not on your machine your
we're going to want to go to node.js org
and install it and you'll know that that
is working if you go no dash V and
you've got a version I'm running zero
point ten point two two looks like
they're up to ten point two six so I
need to upgrade and then you should also
be able to go NPM - V and have a version
of node package manager
NPM comes with node and that's basically
how you install dependencies and you
know do package management all that
stuff it's really really truly great so
let's go ahead we have those both there
so let's get into it let's install our
first package we're going to go NPM
install - g4 global Express generator
this is going to get us building Express
apps right really quick it's going to
generate the scaffolding for us and we
have to do dash G because it's got to be
a global because we want to be able to
execute it and it's G because it has
nothing to do with our project we're
installing this globally and you may get
an error there that you don't have
read/write permissions so you might have
to do sudo on that NPM install G and
then enter your password but the way
I've installed it I don't have to do
that so I can actually now run Express
as a command and then give myself an app
name I'll just call this XP 2014 so
there we go I've actually generated an
app now and expressjs application and
you see all I have to do is go CD space
xox 2014 and do npm install before I do
n pm
install though I want to show you what's
actually taking place here let me open
this in sublime text show you what
they've done for us they've built out
the whole application but they haven't
loaded all the dependencies yet instead
they've just put a package.json file
which is all that we're going to check
into our github repo anyway and then
it's just a list of the dependencies
that we need you can see it's running
Jade for templates which I'm not
actually a huge fan of Jade templates so
I'm going to redo this and then once we
run NPM install you'll see that it
starts adding all the dependencies into
the node modules folder and now we're
good to go it's installed Express for
our application locally its installed
Jade it's installed all the stuff that
we need so I'm going to actually go up a
level and go ahead and remove that and
let's generate one again and this will
be exp 2014 and I'm also going to go - -
Hogan because I want to use Hogan
templating which is basically mustache
and then I also want to go see for CSS
and do less they support less and they
also support stylus why they don't
support sass I have no idea but they
support less and stylus so there we go
now I can actually do it again CD space
Express 2014 do NPM install let's go
ahead and do that
and so now you can see that my package
includes Hogan Jas and less middleware
yippee so now I'm going to scroll back
up before I did that and it said if you
want to run your app just run this
command here debug my application and
then you're going to run the bin www
file you can run that and it says it's
listening on port 3000 so now I can go
localhost colon 3000 and there you go
there's my Express and you can see as
I'm refreshing it keeps loading up stuff
so now I'm running a webserver and I'm
running a very very basic web
application on my machine one of the
cool things about Express is it runs as
the webserver itself so it's really
different from PHP or any of these other
technologies in that
loads your whole application in memory
and then it sits as the server waiting
for HTTP HTTP requests to come through
and then it responds to those it never
touches your file system again unless
you have to access new images or write
images it sits in memory the whole time
which is why it's so blazingly fast I'm
going to cancel this out real quick and
show you this bin www file you can see
that the my application it comes from
right there so I'm actually going to
simplify that I'm going to call it debug
equals app now which is a lot easier to
remember bun there you go and so now I
can well I forgot to it save didn't I
it runs just fine but you won't see any
debugging because it's looking for a
different debugging name so I've saved
this file and now I can run that command
again there we go I'm seeing app I'm
debugging excellent good to go so it
runs the debugger and then it also
requires my app dot J's file and then it
starts up the web server listening on
port 3,000 if I wanted to run multiple
express applications at once I could
simply change this to port 9000 let me
cancel this start it up again and now I
can go port 9000 and there we go we're
running on port 9000
you'll also notice whenever I make a
change I have to cancel and reboot this
application that's pretty annoying and
it's going to get old really quick so
there's this great utility called node
Mon that we can use
you can go npm install g node Mon which
is going to monitor your folder
structure for changes and as you make
file changes it's automatically going to
cancel and reload your app which is
great so now I can go node Mon and then
bin www there you go I'm going to listen
any file changes if I hit save let me go
ahead hit save here and you'll notice it
restarted my server save save so if I
had a console log here
then it now is going to log when our hit
file save so that's kind of node montt
is really great for that so now we're
running node Mon as we hit save it's
going to automatically restart our app
and that's going to be a lot nicer for
us so let's get into building out our
Express app it scaffold it in it's
working great let's actually look at
this app j/s once again WW this is just
the server has nothing to do with our
application all it does is load the
debugger and load in our app and now
we're good to go so let's look at App
Daisy and see what all is going on the
first thing we're doing is we're
requiring some dependencies into our
file and then we're requiring some
routes but we're not using those
routings yet we're just kind of
requiring them and then we're creating
our app here by running Express so this
is where our app actually gets started
and then we're setting our default views
to the views directory there we go views
directory and so all our views are in
here you can see they look pretty much
like HTML we're just using that Hogan
templating and then we're setting our
view engine to use HJs so then we also
load our debugger and some other stuff
and then we use our routes right here
this is how we tell our routes to get
used and then it also make also gives us
our 404 handling and stuff like that so
let's get into building our first routes
I'm going to go ahead and mix the users
for now and I'm going to kill this users
one for now as well so we've required
routes index which is this file and then
we are using it for all our request
paths this slash just means we're going
to use it on everything so let's look at
this index file right now and so I don't
confuse you I'll actually kill that and
we're just going to start a new one
we've required Express and then we've
actually created our router file and
then we've exported this file module
exports is what the return value of this
whole file is going to be so when I hit
require route slash index I'm actually
going to pass the module exports from
this file into this variable so that's
kind of what this module exports
is the router here gets adjusted by all
our routes and then I'm returning it as
module exports if that makes sense if
not you might want to just look into it
a little bit more but here's what we're
going to do you're going to go router
dot git because we're going to be
responding to a get request and then I'm
going to do my my actual route which is
just the index the route and then I'm
going to give it a function with my
request object my response object and
then the function that I want to do when
a user hits that that default pathway
and I have two options here I can go res
which is my response object I can go res
dot send which is just going to send
text or you can send a JSON object or
you can send a number for an HTTP code
that's just a 200 response let's
actually start messing with res send or
I can go res render which is going to
actually do a templating I can find the
file which this is going to look for my
index file and then I pass as my second
argument a JSON object of all the values
that I want to send to that templating
object so let's start with res send here
let's pretend I'm making an API let's
just say okay so now I can hit there and
I've got okay and let me go and refresh
it you'll notice that I'm getting an
automatically it made my type text HTML
and then my status is automatically
going to be a 200 code for the first
time I save it and then a 3 or 4 if it's
not modified so automatically it's set
my type to text HTML so let's go ahead
and make a 200 here now it's going to
always give me a 200 status or I can go
a 400 and that's going to give me a 400
status so that's always going to get a
400 there once again 404 for 500 if you
just give it a first argument and it's a
number then that's going to be your HTTP
status if I want to start giving it a
JSON object
there you go so now I can just do that
and automatically I'm going to get JSON
and my type on my response is going to
be application slash JSON which is super
great so it's as you can see it's really
nimble really light for doing an API and
then I can also do res dot render and
let's look at our index file here and
see we're getting a title looks like
title is the only argument it's
expecting or the only piece of data I'm
expecting so there we go that will now
render my index file with the my app
let's go ahead and add a second value
whoop not sure what key I hit age 33 and
let's put in here oh I can't type when I
do these things man I'm the worst at it
so there you go my app 33 years old so
I'm passing a title and age and you guys
can figure out the rest as you go along
so that's pretty much how you're going
to render your templates and how you're
going to send your responses and so what
we've done is we've kind of built our
router we've added a get request let's
say we wanted to respond to an API post
I can do post right there and then I can
access all the post variables by going
rec query dot name let's say their name
came in or anything like that query will
be the all the params that came through
here let me actually do a get here so
there we go let me a console log see
there is my query object is showing age
of 33
name equals will so that's how I access
my req query object another thing that I
can do is I can go get users and so that
will be users not found because I didn't
save my file and if you don't do a
response send of any kind then it's just
going to spin forever there is no
response taking place so there we go 200
okay let me go ahead and so that's
responding to my users let's say I
wanted to be able to get an ID off of
here I can go ID and that's going to be
request params so now whatever my second
program is going to be is going to show
up as params ID so let me go users 33
and you can see that ID 33 is coming in
right there I'll just send so I'm going
to send a 200 requests so it doesn't
confuse it with my number there you go
so now it's going to say 33 34 and
that's how we're going to do that
routing and so then that gets passed
through nothing happens and now I'm
using that on any and all routes on my
page you can also namespace that and
just go users and then if I'm
namespacing this to users then I don't
have to add users I can just go slash ID
and it will be the exact same thing so
if I actually did slash users here it
would not work because it'd be looking
for users slash users and that would be
what happens if I namespace it to a
particular routing so that's pretty much
your introduction to node J s if I flew
through too quickly then you might just
want to re-watch the video I try to be
as quick as possible I do have another
video that I will link to in the
description on how to implement a
MongoDB database using Mongoose and I'll
also add an annotation for that
somewhere around here if you're not on
mobile you'll see that and have yourself
a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
