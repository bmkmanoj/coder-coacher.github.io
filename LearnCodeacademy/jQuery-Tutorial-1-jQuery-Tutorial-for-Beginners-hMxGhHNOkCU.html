development if you know HTML CSS or
you're learning those the next step for
you is going to be look to learn jQuery
jQuery is the easiest and most popular
JavaScript library so if you want to
start learning JavaScript learn jQuery
every employer I've ever worked for uses
jQuery no matter how big or how small
they were so it's very popular there are
companies that don't use it but most of
them do so here's how you add jQuery on
your page you download it from jQuery
com put it in your project folder and
then what you're going to do is you're
going to just add a script tag and
you'll add the source to it so in this
case it's in a bower components folder a
jQuery folder inside of there and then
there's my file jQuery j/s so when I put
that on my page nothing changes because
jQuery doesn't actually do anything it
gives you a library of commands that you
can use to do things so it's on the page
now and I'm going to go add my own
script tag and inside of it I'm going to
write my own JavaScript so what you're
going to have to remember to start
jQuery is one thing and this is the
memorization part for you once you get
through this you get to actually have
tons of fun with jQuery so here we go
it's document before I mention that this
dollar sign is the value that's given to
the jQuery library when it loads up so
anytime you you want to reference jQuery
you hit dollar so we go document and
then we go dot ready and you just got to
memorize this you'll later on understand
what it's about and then you do this
function thing function open and close
parentheses open and close curly braces
and then close your first parenthesis
honestly what I did when I started off
as I copied and pasted this and saved it
somewhere because it just didn't make
sense to me and you don't want to have
to think about it just paste this in
your jQuery code always goes inside of a
document ready function you can have
multiple document ready functions
there's really no need to if you just
have a few lines of code but they're not
going to conflict what this does is this
says hey wait for my whole document to
load up before I try running any
JavaScript otherwise you're going to try
to talk to panel one with JavaScript and
panel one hasn't loaded yet so the Java
scripts going to run it's not going to
find panel one it won't do anything
and then panel want to load and it's not
going to do what you're expecting it to
do and you probably won't even get any
errors about it it just says nothing
happens
so the document.ready function says hey
wait for my document to fully load then
let's start running stuff so your jquery
goes in here there's also a short way of
doing it and that's just dollar function
so that's what I use that's the most
people use but you can do document ready
function they're the same thing so now
that we've done that and now that I've
probably confused you from the start
that's the only complicated part the
rest of its let's just have fun you're
going to go dollar command and open your
parenthesis and then you have two parts
to each jQuery action you have the
selector which works just like CSS you
see over here I showed you what they are
so there's panel one and that's because
it's ID one exactly as if you were doing
ID is panel one just like if you were
doing CSS so I've selected it you can
use single quotes or you can use double
quotes but don't know what sublime is
doing to me there you can use double
quotes either one work and then you give
it dot and give it your method so in
this case I'm going to go hide I'm gonna
hit save it's going to reload for me so
there you go it loads up the page and
then it hides panel one I can tell it to
hide 300 which will hide over the course
of three hundred milliseconds you'll see
it kind of does a little animation there
for me and then it's chainable jquery is
awesome and that you can keep chaining
it as long as it's not the semicolon yet
so i can hide it and then I can show it
over the course of one second so it
hides fast and then it shows slowly you
can just keep going you can do hi Joe hi
Joe there you go hide show hi Joe
it's fun jQuery is tons of fun another
thing you can do is slide up and just as
you'd expect it slides up and then it
hides and then you can have it slide
down
up and then back down you can also add a
delay in their delay so we're going to
delay for one second which is a thousand
milliseconds wait a little bit and then
we'll do it again
jQuery it's fun this is super awesome so
I can have it slide up delay you can do
fade in fade out there goes and gone and
then it's going to slide down another
thing you can do is you can do fade
toggle you can do toggle for pretty much
anything so if I do fade toggle twice
then it'll fade out since it's currently
in and then it will fade in because it's
currently out toggle will well it'll
toggle you can slide toggle it's going
to slide up it's going to slide back
down and then you can just do toggle if
you just want it to do a hide a show
hide so that's kind of the showing and
hiding parts of jQuery super super fun
you can go dot CSS this is where it gets
a little bit more tricky and then you
give it a pair of curly braces which are
options and I'm actually you can go
color red and then Oh red is not fine
you have to do it in quotes sorry about
that
there you go and now my color became red
this one has something else overriding
it but there you go the panel one gets a
color of red and then I can do a comma
here and I can go font-weight the one
thing you can't do I'll show you in a
second font-weight:bold there we go
font-weight:bold the one thing you can't
do is you can't do font - wait because
in JavaScript this means font - weight
which it looks for math and doesn't make
sense and will throw an error now that
doesn't make sense what you can do is
you can wrap that in quotes if you want
to do it that way
single or double quotes and that works
or jQuery is smart enough to where you
can go font weight so there you go I can
change the CSS and it's a little
confusing this is kind of a cleaner way
of doing it we're making what's called a
JavaScript object if you want to Google
that so anytime you do curly braces in
JavaScript
making an object unless you have
function before it which is really
that's for a JavaScript lesson so now I
can go color red and add a comma
font-weight:bold now it's starting to
feel a little bit more like CSS and I
can go display:none and just in case I
didn't want to see it anymore which is
basically what a jQuery show/hide does
so there we go
panel 1 so let's make panel 1 hide and
then let's make panel to CSS opacity 0.5
so now when I boot up that's gone and
that's halfway hidden and from this
point we'll call this a lesson and what
will the next step will be in the next
lesson is to listen to events the real
fun of JavaScript happens when you start
interacting with what the user does
those are called JavaScript events when
they click do this when they hover do
this and when they mouse up do that so
that's really where jQuery gets even
more fun we'll stop right here so you
can watch it over if I've done too much
too fast if you've kept up with a pretty
fast pace here let's go on to lesson
number two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
