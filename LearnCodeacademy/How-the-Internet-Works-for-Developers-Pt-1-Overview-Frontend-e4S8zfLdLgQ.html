cover the concept of how does the
internet work from a web development
perspective what do you need to know
about how the internet works what I'm
going to be covering in this is really
stuff that took I'd say it took me at
least five years if not more it's kind
of figure out along the way because you
don't know what you don't know you don't
know what to Google for it'd be easy to
learn if you knew what to Google for but
it takes five or sometimes ten or more
years some people never pick up on stuff
just because you're not exposed to it
you don't know and so I'm going to kind
of compile years worth of stuff and
hopefully make it all really simple for
you how does the internet work from a
web development point of view this video
is going to focus mostly on what the
front end guys need to know and it's
going to cover just minimal knowledge
about servers and the next video is
really going to cover server
configurations that's really a kind of
scary world to people that have lived in
HTML CSS JavaScript and it doesn't have
to be scary it's really simple it can be
a million things just like the front end
can and so hopefully we'll just kind of
cover some basic configurations and give
you a peek into what that server world
is like for those of you who want to
learn in that direction so let's get
into it front end point of view at the
bottom level at the end of the day
really what the internet is is your
browser your machine is making a request
to a server and it's getting responses
back the server is just another machine
on the internet it's just another
machine connected to the internet and
kind of the browser can be your iPhone
it could be Chrome whatever and so that
servers a machine and whenever a machine
connects to the internet it gets what's
called an IP address some tons of you
guys probably know lots of these things
so if your intelligence gets insulted
just keep with me we're going to cover a
lot of depth here but when you plug into
the internet when you connect you get an
IP address so a server is a box with an
IP address the reason your computer's
not a server is you have an IP address
you go to google and type what's my IP
address it's going to show you your IP
address you have it right now so if
anyone types in your IP address it can
access your computer just like a server
but you don't have server software
running and installed we'll get into
that in the next video but if you type
in say my site
um it doesn't know your server's IP
address so what that's going to do is
your internet service provider charter
se is going to do a DNS lookup a domain
name service lookup it's going to say
hey my site comm what IP address is that
configured ah that's configured to this
guy right here
well let's send you to that box so your
request for my site comm goes to this
box so say google.com your ISP takes
that and it routes you to whatever IP
address google.com has configured and
they probably have thousands of servers
and stuff running which I'll cover a
little bit of that in the next video as
well so you connect to the server it
gives you a response that's the Internet
you get requests you make requests you
get responses so when I request the site
mysite.com I expect I'm going to get
back the browser doesn't know what it's
going to get back I'm saying my site
calm as it as a piece of text I could
get back an image I could get a CSS
stylesheet I could get back in HTML file
I can get back anything the server can
give me anything at once my browser
knows what it's giving me by the content
type so I'm going to get a response back
that is both the file and the content
type so when I say my site comm server
gives me the index.html file and it sets
a Content type of text slash HTML now my
browser knows what to do with it ah
let's treat it like HTML and so it
begins parsing your HTML document what
that parsing process process looks like
for the most part it goes head to toe
start to finish and it pauses when it
finds a request for an asset an asset is
another request that we have to make
like it's another file we need so that
be a CSS file would be an asset an image
would be an asset a JavaScript file
would be an asset so we're going through
dot dot HTML head we need another asset
a CSS file so let's tell our browser go
give me a request for main dot CSS does
that request the server report replies
with that CSS file sets the content type
to text slash CSS now we know that
that's a CSS file and it keeps going
through and now anything that appears it
will
that style sheet before presenting it to
make sure it comes out styled correctly
one of the reasons we put the styles in
the header is because if we were to put
the style here you'd get what's called
an F oh you see flash of unstyled
content I know if you've ever loaded a
cheap Lea made web page and you see it
flash really ugly real quick and then
flicker too beautiful what that is is
it's loading your your body it's loading
through your h1s and your tags and your
paragraphs and your divs and then it's
loading your CSS after the fact so it
goes top to bottom it's already spinning
this out for the user to see and then it
pauses up let's get the style sheet get
the style sheet did it it all happens in
a couple milliseconds and then that
style sheet gets applied that's why we
put the style sheets up front we do want
to load those before we start presenting
the user with information now the reason
we used to put our scripts up in the
head too some people still do but you
can for in almost all cases put your
scripts at the footer before the last
body tag before the closing body tag and
what that's going to do is that's going
to start presenting your page to the
user and then it's going to load your
scripts and activate the thing so you'll
see your content slider and then it will
load the jQuery to make it start sliding
which is totally acceptable your users
going to feel like the web page is
loading a lot faster than it really is
another wise thing is you want to
concatenate you want to add all your
scripts files together as much as
possible so instead of loading ten
different JavaScript files it's really
going to speed things up if you can put
those all into one javascript file and
then you only have to make one request
talk to the server one time give me
scripts j/s that gets added in and now
you've not made near as many requests
you've not paused your page near is
often same thing with CSS files it keep
them broken up while you're developing
but then when you deploy to production
you want to concatenate them all
together put them all together into one
file so then your browser starts loading
the HTML HTML says oh give me this one
CSS file boom got a one CSS file we can
move on get a one javascript file we're
done and there are use cases where you
need to make more than one but for the
most part
that's really going to speed up your
page a lot and also if these are
minified if these are minified which if
you don't know what minified is just
look up you know what is a minified CSS
file minified javascript file it's a way
that you could actually get those files
even smaller and even faster so that's
kind of the whole asset the whole page
rendering that's kind of the front end
of things the other way you can make
asset requests is through JavaScript
JavaScript can do what's called an xhr
request or an ajax request they're often
called and so javascript can say you
know real time when you click on a link
javascript doesn't take you anywhere
instead it says ah let's go make a
request for the most recent 5 tweets
that response comes back and instead of
going to the HTML page it goes into
JavaScript JavaScript does something
smart with those JavaScript can also
make requests for images it can make
requests for CSS files it can make
requests for pretty much anything
because after all a request is just a
request to the server the server
determines what you get back by its
content type so that's kind of the
browser world of things before I close
out this video let's look at some sample
requests let's look at what's going on
and so a request contains two things it
contains headers and it may or may not
contain a post body so let's look at
when I request I loaded google.com here
Google com
so my first request if you open your
developer console and go to network and
refresh your page I can see right here
my first request was
www.google.com/mapmaker cookies is one
giant long string and that's information
that the website has stored on your
machine so as you can see Google stores
a lot of cookies and the user agent
string this is information about my web
browser so my browser
you can see right here is chrome 37 and
that's what the user-agent string is so
there's my request and I did not pass a
body I just want this page now if I was
doing a login say I had sent my username
and password the method would be a post
and I would have a post body that sent
in the username and a password so here's
kind of request will include these
headers the host the method that's
either get post put or delete the path
which is say google.com slash images
slash logo dot jpg cookies user agent
and the content type as well if I'm
including a post body so right here my
post body is a JSON post and so in that
case my posts my content type would be
application slash JSON so that's a
request responses also have headers and
a response body so let's look again at
that Google if I scroll down here my
response headers it said my content type
is text slash HTML and it said let's see
we're going to get a content we're going
to get basically the two headers that
are important to you if you're learning
the content type and the status your
status code so here I got a status of
200 that means okay and I got a content
type of text slash HTML my response
itself
hey look it's an HTML page so I say give
me google.com it gave me the HTML page
for google comm and it said the content
type is text HTML status is 200 ok
status doesn't really matter if you're
doing HTML stuff status matters a lot if
you're doing JavaScript stuff so the
status code we can give you a status of
anything in the 200s means it's okay
anything in 300s means you got
redirected anything in the 400s means
there was an error or the it's not found
or you're not logged in so you can't
access it anything in the 500s says the
server broke it blew up you either
gave it something it wasn't expecting or
there's a problem on there and that's
what a 500 error level error is so
that's kind of what a status code is
javascript will look for that sometimes
JavaScript to make a request and a 400 a
404 or 403 those are all considered air
500 is considered an error so JavaScript
will say that wasn't successful and so
that's kind of requests and responses
you'll get a response body let's look at
some more requests here the next request
we made was google.com let's Google com
in the path with images sprepper logo so
I am looking for a PNG and then my
response here is the content type is
image PNG and the response was well they
can't really show you because it was an
image so they sent me an image and with
a 200 okay yep
we accepted your request here's that
image content type blah blah blah so
that's kind of how that works we then
requested a lots of data that's from the
CSS file requested some other stuff
here's another get request and this was
a text JavaScript file that we were
requesting so the response is JavaScript
and it replied with text JavaScript and
further on and further on and that's
just how that goes so there's all the
requests that I made just to load
google.com a lot of stuff going on let's
look at a couple sample requests in
writing and then we'll be done with this
video we'll move on to the backend the
server stuff so you make your homepage
request to Google com you're going to do
a get request I probably haven't covered
it yet I'll give you a brief
demonstration my jQuery tutorial covers
a lot of what the different methods are
get just says give me a resource I'm not
passing anything with that usually a get
request a post request is for when
you're usually creating something new or
when you're doing something basic like a
login so let's say I'm log in to Twitter
that's going to be a post request let's
say I create a new tweet that's going to
be a post request I'm sending a post and
I'm passing it the information of my
tweets and any mentions a put request is
when you want to edit something if I
edit a tweet so let's say if I did a
post real quick I would post tweets
slash I don't know my tweet ID would be
something huge like that I would do a
post to that and I would have a post
body of the new tweet content oh
actually if I'm if
I'm posting to tweets if I'm doing a
post I'm doing a new tweet so the other
posts to tweets are opposed to tweet
slash new and then the server knows that
if I'm posting to that that's a new one
if I'm doing a put request I'll have the
ID of what I'm editing so if I'm doing a
put request I'm putting to this ID that
was the new ID of the new post I just
made and it's going to update that with
what's going on and then there's also a
delete request so if I do a delete
method to this path it will probably
delete that tweet so on Twitter if you
click delete JavaScript is sending off a
delete request to that tweet ID and it
will go away so that's kind of what
those methods are get something create
something update something delete
something and so that's what your method
is the paths are we already covered path
path is the path
there's your user agent the back end
will sometimes if you have a massive
website sometimes the back end will look
at this and say either on on iPhone
they're on a mobile device let's send
them to a completely different web site
that's just for mobile so that's kind of
why that user agent is important and
then here's a sample post request say I
was doing a login I would do a post
method to slash login my content type
would be application JSON and my request
body would be you know a JSON object
user name this password this my response
would be 200 okay
and if I did a say this is a JavaScript
thing and it was expecting a JavaScript
response and it would give me a response
that was probably JSON my response body
would say hey here's your full profile
Magic Man 11 and then the content type
would be application JSON for that so
that's kind of requests that's kind of
your whole front-end world of thing
things in the next video we're going to
really cover the server world and how
the internet works from the server side
of things and that's going to be really
fun especially if if you're completely
clueless as to what the server world
looks like I'll leave you for now have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
