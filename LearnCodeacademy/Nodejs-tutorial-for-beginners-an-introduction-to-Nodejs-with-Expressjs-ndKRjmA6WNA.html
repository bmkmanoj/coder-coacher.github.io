get started on nodejs
I'm going to assume that you know little
to nothing about no js' already if you
already do no worries it's still going
to be a really quick
straight-to-the-point tutorial so I'm
going to assume you do not have no js'
installed if you don't have no Jes
installed and you have homebrew on your
Mac then you need to go brew install
node that's simple I already have node
installed so I'm not going to run that
it's my preferred way of installing node
if that's not if you don't have brew
then you can go to node
what is node.js is no J's orga believe
yeah you can go and download it there
that also works I have had more success
using homebrew to install it it does
install on Windows just fine I've used
node on Windows for years as well I do
prefer using it on Mac and Linux
environments though ok once that is
installed we're going to use Express Jas
framework which is the the most popular
hands down framework for node oftentimes
people say node and they mean Express
because Express just gets used that much
and it's really quick and easy to use so
we're going to install that with node
package manager or NPM node comes
pre-installed with NPM anymore so we're
going to go npm install g which means
global which i'll make it an executable
available everywhere or if it's an
executable it has to be installed global
if you run into errors here it's
probably because you installed it with a
method that requires administrator
access for global things so you'll have
to run sudo npm install g express and do
a password I've often found they may
have changed it but when I install node
with the package from node.js org it
tends to require sudo every time you're
installing a global I prefer homebrew
for installing because it just works
better
okay so we have node installed and we
have Express installed and now Express
gives us a great app so you can just go
Express and I'm just going to go Express
test and that will generate an app Oh
I already have something called Express
test let me go Express test Express
there we go there we go now it ran now
you're telling me all it has to do is I
might need to go see D test Express and
NPM install NPM install we'll take the
package file that it created for me and
install all the dependencies that it
needs right away let's look at that
package file real quick I'm going to add
the folder to my project
let's go sandbox what was that called
test Express I'm going to add this to my
project when you generated your node app
with Express it created this package
JSON file which you can also manually do
yourself but I really prefer having
Express generated for mates it's instant
you can see we have two dependencies
here Express which is the local one not
the global one that we already installed
and Jade which by default it's going to
use Jade templates for the views I'm not
the biggest fan of Jade maybe I've just
developed in HTML too long to feel more
comfortable and more quick with that but
if you like Jade by default it's going
to do Jade and it's going to give your
public resources as CSS another thing
you can do is you can do Express and I
prefer Hogan as my templating so I'm
going to go - - Hogan and I'm going to -
C for CSS and I'm going to go less there
we go
so now I'm going to get into Express
Hogan let me drop that folder from my
projects and get into my Express Hogan
project ah ha much better so here we go
now my views are Hogan which I just feel
more comfortable Hogan's basically
mustache for those of you guys who are
not familiar with it and in our public
stylish seats we have less going on so
that's it and all you have to do at this
point to run the app is go node app j/s
and it's running on port 3000 so I can
go localhost port 3000 there you go
welcome to Express so let's start diving
into what actually you do actually let
me just kind of recap that so you're
going to install node with either brew
install node or go to node.js and
install it there you can install Express
globally either going npm install g
express doesn't matter where you are in
your file system to install it or sudo
npm install g express if there's a
problem with that and then you're going
to go generate an app which is Express
and then app name see you can also do a
stylus less you can't do sass because I
think it considers less and sass to be
about the same thing there might be s
CSS or there might be a key for sass I'm
not aware of it Hogan you can do ejs for
that you can do those as optional for
the templating languages so that's kind
of how you generate an app and then you
do npm install and that will grab all
your dependencies which is only two or
if you did in this case we have less
going on and we have HGS we're using
Hogan now it will install all your
dependencies so the whole things there
in the package
which is really nice and then you just
run it run app node app gasps there you
go
and our app is running so let's look
into this actual app.js file and see
what's going on it's loading express its
loading routes which is just our routes
file it's loading the index by default
and it's also loading a routes user
they're just kind of these are kind of
boilerplate things for you on HTTP and
path of the things that actually use it
so i'm going to comment on all the
boilerplate stuff it's setting the port
to 3,000 you can change that if you want
it's setting the default directory for
our views so it knows where all the
views come from and it's setting our
view engine to hogan this all happened
in the generation process using a
favicon we've turned on our lager since
we're in the development environments
i'm actually going to change that down
here so only if we're in development
environment use the logger it's using a
lot of other things spread JSON code
URLs so that it's going to use app dot
router this tells it to initialize the
router it's using less middleware so
it'll automatically compile less as you
go it can use it real time and then it's
creating a static file to our public
directory so we can actually grab public
slash images JavaScript style sheets so
if I go 3,000 slash style sheets style
that less well browser doesn't know what
to do with it but I just downloaded that
file so if that was a JavaScript file I
can real-time access those you know
through my HTML pages so that's kind of
what it's set up there you really don't
need to touch this ever unless you're
going to add more things in different
order now say I want to add something
else in this order that's pretty much it
here's your development environment so
you can do different things if you're in
a production environment and then here
it's doing app get slash this is kind of
the routes enabling
so we've loaded in our routes we've
loaded our user and that's where it's
using this here we're defining the
routes so our local are our default base
route goes to routes index and our users
goes to users dot list and then it spins
up the server and it tells it to the
console you're listening on port 3000 so
that's pretty much our whole application
at this point let's take a look at the
routes index file all it does is it does
exports index kind of the deal with
nodejs
is it uses the common JS format so
whatever a module exports you can either
do module module exports and we can add
a whole object here and that will be
what happens when you require it that's
will be that will be what the required
gets so when we require routes we're
getting whatever exports is so basically
we require routes it's going to
automatically look for the index file
and it's going to look for whatever our
module exports object is and that's what
it gets so we have routes dot index this
is the other notation you can use is
just exports dot and we are doing only
this we are rendering the index file and
we're passing it the parameters of title
equals Express so let's go ahead and
look at what this table what's going on
right here
so what I'll actually go back into the
app so it remains simple in our minds
let's if you're feeling confused at this
point I'm going to kill that code and
I'm going to kill this code we're going
to do everything in this file for right
now so what you can do is you can do app
get that's going to look for a get
request on this address just slash and
we're going to go function req res next
these are the three things that get
passed to any get put delete post
they're going to ought to always get req
which is your request response which is
what our response is going to be and
next which is you can actually chain
things if you hit next then it's going
to look for the next thing that matches
is our current URL we're not going to
use next right now so basically I can go
really quickly I can just go res dot
send which if we use send then it's
going to send whatever we put in there
straight to the browser if it use res
dot render then it's going to use our
current templating library and look for
a template to output so that's kind of
the two things you'll use to spit stuff
back out to the browser we go res dot
send here's some text and say done I
need to go ahead and Reese pin up my
server there you go here's some text and
if I look here at my network you'll
notice by default my type is text HTML
it automatically set the text correctly
so if I put it I can also put a JSON
object in here I got to cancel my server
spin it up again there you go you'll
notice now my type is application JSON
so it is really really easy to generate
web services and restful services with
express it is just lightning fast very
very little code to be done I can do a
res dot render and then the path of my
file index let me cancel that spin up
again if you'll notice it's getting
really old really fast to cancel and
spin up my server I'll show you how to
address that in just a second so that
looked for index because if you'll
remember up here we have set our views
is right there app set views and by
default are we're going to be using
views as our engine our view engine
looks for views so it's pulling up this
it's looking for a title pretty much
just looking for a title so let's go
back to app KS and make sure we're
passing a object to our file here give
it a title of my app
now it's called my app the title gets my
app and my app is everywhere I awesome
app if I could spell my awesome app so
that's pretty much Express right there
it's not much more complicated than that
let's go app get API let's say we're
making an API let's just make up some
data once again name I'm not 33 I'm 23
now let's be honest be honest with
ourselves here so now I can close it
spin it up and go localhost 3000 API
there we go and now I've got my API
response so it's quick and very very
very easy now let's look into what's
going on here it's pretty bad
development wise to define your routes
in your actual app file so what they've
done here is they've broken out a routes
require routes and they've actually put
some stuff in here I usually won't
define any routes in the app unless it's
a very small app like what their demo is
giving you here so usually what I will
do is something a little more along the
lines of this
I'll just go require routes
and I'll put that at the bottom because
I want to make sure the app gets fully
booted we've already initialized the
router before I start doing any routing
action let's go to the routes index and
then I will define them here I will also
go up to app and I will make sure I'll
make sure that MOT that exports is
getting out what I'll do is I'll make
sure that my app which is the
initialized Express is getting passed to
the exports so now down here I can
require this app file even before it's
all the way executed and I'll get the
exports will be app basically I'll show
you what that means here is I can go app
equals so now I have app here and I can
do app get
oh no method get' I forgot I need to do
module exports there we go there you go
and so now all I have to do is hit
require routes and so now all my out
routes are abstracted out to this index
file I can do all my home stuff here and
then if I want to require stuff from my
other I can go require user and that'll
load in any routes that I've defined in
this user file so that's kind of how all
should break out a larger app I won't do
anything in the app KS file as far as
routes concern I'll just kind of load my
routes index and I'll have that do
everything if it starts getting to be a
really big file with lots of routes then
I'll start breaking it out and just
require different files and you're good
to go so let's go and look into how can
I make this workflow a lot better
because this is getting really annoying
to automatically be canceling and
restarting it kind of the reason we have
to do that on node just in case you guys
aren't familiar kind of with why node
works the way it does is if you're
working on something else when you make
a request for the file your web servers
are running it's going to go grab those
files real time run through them run
through the compilation process every
single time with node the big difference
is is when you spin up node it grabs all
the dependencies loads everything and
sits there waiting for callbacks on
routes so we've defined these it's going
to load up every file every dependency
at load up and then it's just going to
sit there and wait and as a requests
come in handles them all asynchronously
without grabbing any dependencies
without grabbing any file system stuff
and that's kind of the beauty of node
the only difference is is for
development you don't want to be
canceling and re running your Express
app every single time you change a
single line of code just to be able to
see it so we're going to use something
called node mod which is great for no
monitor node monitoring and somehow I'm
running it updates so we're just going
to go npm install g4 global node mod
once again you might have to use sudo on
that
alright that's installed we're still on
our deal so I can go node Mon F KS and
now it's automatically going to listen
to any changes I have so if I go to my
home
it automatically restarts my server
noticed a file changed and now
everything's good ah the workflow has
been resolved if you're doing anything
other than back end and you want to add
front-end stuff there's a great tool
called yeoman dot IO which will also do
generators for apps and it'll also do
live reload for you once again that's
yeoman dot IO maybe I'll do a tutorial
on that sometime this is your
boilerplate intro to Express Jas and
node let me know if you have any
questions any further things that you'd
like to see on this have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
