off this single page angular app that
used molten to build a storefront and so
I kind of wrapped that together it's not
beautiful but all the key components are
working and so I kind of wanted to
showcase this to you real quick I also
threw all the code up on github it's not
necessarily all gorgeous code because I
did it really pretty quickly but if you
want to kind of get some ideas on how
you could build an app I'll kind of show
you some things that I ended up doing
over here in inventory they have this
cool thing called collections so I made
a collection I added some products to my
collection called home page features I
think ideally what that does is then
when you go to store these are kind of
the featured items these all exist in
other categories but you can add them
also to this collection I think ideally
it also callate and creates a collection
called homepage slider which would have
you know big images for all the truly
featured items up there another thing I
did is I added strike check out here
under advanced gateways I added stripe
out of my stripe comma count which is
super easy to use all you have to do is
add your API key which I just added at
my API test key and then that's good to
go so stripe is now kind of my default
checkout system and let's kind of show
you the rest of the store here so I can
go to this here killer iPad add it to my
cart I've kind of got this global cart
icon here that keeps track of all the
items that are in my cart let's go back
to the store let's find some sale items
this test product is sale item let's go
ahead add that you know I think ideally
I'd have a quantity thing here also a
drop down for you know if there's sizes
or colors but that's easy to add a
little later we can go to our checkout
here's kind of my pretty janky little
cart that I threw together but
everything is functioning you know it'd
be nice to have some updating of
quantities here and the ability to
remove items let's go ahead and check
out here's kind of our checkout I went
ahead and actually just copied and
pasted all the fields from Moulton's
check out their angular template that
I'd going on so that made it quick and
easy I'll put a link to their angular
template they have as well
in the description I'm just gonna go
ahead and send it all to one address do
autofill here okay there you go I threw
in some dummy information autofill
grabbed a few things but you're not
gonna know where I live and you're not
gonna know my home phone so there's my
basic deal added a few shipping methods
or should I say I added one shipping
method which is free shipping and then I
can pay with my credit card which is
going to go through stripe and then
stripe for testing has all these kind of
credit cards that you can use this one's
always going to authorize and then you
can have some different ones you know
some of these will automatically fail
some of these will give you a fail where
the address doesn't match yada yada yada
so we're just going to do that and then
any expiration date is going to pass
with this credit card number so date in
year 12 2017 sure and 5x5 so let's go
ahead and pay now if you look real quick
at orders I've already paid for it dang
it if you go to this before you pay
you're gonna see that you have an unpaid
order and then after the customer has
paid then it's going to convert over to
a paid order and that's kind of nice so
that way you can kind of keep you know
keep contact with customers who start an
order I know if you've ever gotten an
email from a from a company where you
start an order and then you kind of
abandon the process you can get an email
later that day or later that week that
says hey did you forget about your order
here so that's nice you kind of get the
idea you get the ability to query by
orders that have not been paid yet
and there we go there's my paid order
and I got this really completely
pointless little thank you for your
order page and I could send off an email
at that point or do whatever I wanted to
do but there's my kind of really quick
storefront all in all it did not take
very long to put together and once again
the full source code is learn code
Academy slash Moulton - angular I'll get
you that link and I'll also get you a
link to Moulton's angular app that they
kind of threw together with CoffeeScript
they probably put a little bit more
tender loving care into it than I did so
check those out as well and have a great
day and I hope you enjoy using molten</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
