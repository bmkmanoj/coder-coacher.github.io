going to be talking to you about
mechanical organ ama keyboards now
mechanical keyboards for those you guys
who are not in the know are basically
really premium-grade keyboards most
keyboards these days cheap out on the
key switches and give you rubber dome
key switches now what's different about
that is you don't feel the key press
until you've maxed out all the way and
hit the bottom just picture a rubber
dome and when you press you eventually
get enough force to pop it down and so
when you've hit all the way to the
bottom that's when the key is pressed
and you also feel that pressure of
bottoming out well mechanical key
switches take cues from the olden days
and they actually have a key switch that
activates before you bottomed out and
you feel it usually with a tactile force
there's a lot of options and they give
you this old kind of keyboard feel but
they also give you this really premium
kind of keyboard feel so today I'm going
to be talking about a really cool one I
kind of custom selected two of them and
I really do mean a custom selected two
keyboards to bring to you guys one of
them is the matias / gopro keyboard i
have the mac version here they also have
a pc version but this is the matias a
gopro and it is very cool for one as you
can clearly see it can split into two
which i love a keyboard that can now
allow me to split out as my hands
naturally rest which is something like
this it also gives you the ability to
keep your coffee in the middle which is
actually surprisingly addictive and very
useful to have in the middle of the day
your coffee close you can also keep
papers and notes and stuff in the middle
you can also just make adjustments as
your day goes on which is very cool and
so this is also it feels much better on
the wrists much more natural as you go
this keyboard again it's Mattias
ergo Pro keyboard I'll just kind of go
through some of the specs and and why
you might actually be interested in this
besides the wow factor the fact that it
splits apart for one there's just not a
lot of great keyboards that are
ergonomically dynamic but not a lot of
great ones this one is definitely right
away what I would classify as a great
keyboard
for several reasons one it's a
mechanical keyboard as I mentioned
before
so the key switches are phenomenal and
these ones are actually the Mattias
quiet click which are arguably some of
the best mechanical key switches in the
business and they're amazing for two
reasons one they give you a very very
tactile response you feel that key press
before you bottom out so as you get
better and better on the keyboard you
actually type lighter and lighter but
you still get actually more response
than if you were typing on a normal
keyboard so that's very very cool and
then it's also a very quiet tense the
quiet click the Mattias quiet click key
but it's also one of the best keys for
office use which is one of the reasons I
selected this as a great keyboard to
demo to you guys because a lot of y'all
are in an office setting and if you'd be
interested in a mechanical keyboard they
have a reputation for being loud and
clicky which of course if your work from
home err one of those guys whose beard
is down to your knees and you've never
showered or seen humanity for weeks
that's awesome go with the clicky it
feels incredible to have like a cherry
MX blue where every key press gives you
this satisfying click but that's just
not a keyboard for most of us we really
we work around coworkers and we're
generally nice people and so we need
something that's a little quieter so the
Mattias quiet click Keys are one of the
best choices of all time for a great
office friendly mechanical key switch
mechanical quick key switches are also
rated to just millions and millions and
millions a minute like 15 million clicks
or something like that this thing is
gonna last forever some other really
great features about it are these palm
rests these things are really nice they
are stable and so the second you feel
you feel like you have your own desk
space that is attached to your keyboard
and they also get several tinting
options you can tent them a little bit
of an angle which I personally love
feels really nice
you can also tint front down and both
backs for kind of a negative forward
angle I think that's a four and a half
degree and if memory serves this is a
nine degree tinting angle and so you can
kind of have some options throughout the
day as time goes on and then if your
mother comes to her
in your house or your grandmother's
visiting it needs to update or Twitter
and doesn't know how to use a split
keyboard it does come straight together
like that so very good very useful it's
kind of a normal keyboard with the
option of a great split keyboard now I
will have to mention that they do have
to plug together so in the spirit of
clicky keyboards you get this nice
clicky connector which connects them
right there and then it connects with
one USB some notable changes that they
made to the normal keyboard layout aside
from being split is that they gave you
these dedicated undo cut copy paste
buttons and they really reworked the
navigation portion as a code or
something use all the time as navigating
with keys around the screen especially
when you're in the terminal and mouse is
just not very useful and this is very
nice you have your home end page up page
down right next to your arrow keys which
makes for a very very nice experience as
you're often needing to navigate around
the screen so that's the Mattias
ergo kirgo pro keyboard it's just a
great keyboard some other cool features
about it as laser-etched keys so these
are never ever ever going to wear off
they're laser etched they don't wear off
and it also has n key rollover which any
really fast typist will appreciate
because you probably noticed that when
you're typing really really fast there's
a problem with modern keyboards and that
they'll actually drop key presses when
too many keys are pressed at the same
time well n key rollover does defeat
that that quirk and so as fast as you
want to go this keyboard will have no
problems keeping up with you let's wrap
this review up with a great sound test
so you can hear exactly how cool these
keys are and hopefully give you a sense
of just how good they feel but before I
get to that I'll just kind of give you
my personal experience on it
I've been coding on this keyboard all
week straight since I got my hands on it
for review and it feels so good I mean I
have for years was just a longtime fan
of just a good old Apple what they call
chiclet keyboards you know just nice
quiet easy to do but I'll tell you what
when you get when you get your hands on
a mechanical keyboard and use it for a
while you find yourself never wanting to
go back day 1 day 2 you're fine
day three you start to really kind of
get addicted to that tactile a nice
tactile feeling day four day five day
six you find yourself getting very
frustrated on a chiclet keyboard so
let's get into some sound clips
there's my review retailing I said right
around 200 bucks it's not this massive
dent to your wallet compared to a
computer and you get to take it with you
to every computer you own from here on
out it's a great keyboard and I am NOT
just saying that it is a phenomenal
keyboard I'm not getting paid to tell
you guys that the Mattias ergo Pro let's
listen to some sound clips</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
