to be talking about es6 yes that's
javascript harmony the next incarnation
of javascript i've been using it for the
better part of a year just day in day
out on projects and I'm loving it I'm
absolutely never going back I'm using it
both in node on back-end and also in
react and angular stuff on the front end
and whatnot so it's it's tremendous and
I would highly recommend anyone get into
it so going to kind of cover first of
all the features and also along the way
just what I think the most useful
aspects and maybe some patterns of using
those features are if I feel like this
video is getting long winded we'll just
break it up into two so let's go and get
started here first of all if you're
wondering how do i transpile or actually
how do I write es6 and have es5 safely
in the browser's you're going to want to
use babel JSI oh definitely is my
favorite transpiler and its really
seamless if you already have any kind of
build system going on that's compiling
SAS or minifying javascript it's pretty
much effortless to add in babel and then
go es6 down to five or es7 down to five
that'll even supports Samiha seven
features which are great the other big
players to google trace or trace schwa
whatever the French would say with that
word and that's also a big I feel like
babel is you know really kind of become
the main guy with transpiling javascript
es6 so babel jess is my recommendation
go for it you'll like it
let's get into it so kind of some great
es6 features here my favorite the one
that i hands-down use day in day out is
d structuring I actually added D
structuring to my Mac dictionary because
it didn't know what that word means and
so basically let's say you've got an
object called foo and we've got bar is
one Baz is two and then you can
basically just D structure those outs so
instead of going there bar equals foo
bar and ver Baz equals foo
I can just go there bar Baz equals foo
and that's basically the same thing so
now I have two variables that have been
created on my pay
eh I can do you know alert bar alerts
who uses alert anymore and so that's
very very cool I could just snatch out
bar you know leave Baz for later this is
very useful for when you have large
objects you just want to snatch a value
or two out of it
or if you have objects with very large
names very large name and you just do
not want to call that all the time you
can just snatch a value out of it create
a local variable or something so very
very nice you can also do this with
arrays tents is a but we're doing arrays
here
let's do first person second person
third person tenses and so then I could
go there first person equals what I call
that tenses so then it's just basically
going to snatch out the first argument
of my array and when I'm destructuring I
usually put a space on either side to
kind of visually give you that cue that
I'm not creating an array I'm D
structuring in a ray that's kind of one
thing I found helpful whether you're
destructuring objects or destructuring
arrays it's helpful to have that space
on either side because it kind of gives
you a brain this visual cue already
structuring something here so this would
automatically grab number one and this
will automatically grab number two so
first person is me second person is you
and where this is really helpful is
maybe if you're doing a promise dot all
so I'm giving it several promises
promise one
you know so that's going to give me some
responses that I can do it then so I
have all my results in an array so that
I can go there results one actually
destructure that equals results and
there's a better way of doing that which
I'll get into later on because I can
actually D structure these arguments as
well which is very cool I can actually
go I'll just do it now I can actually go
results one results two and then I
actually have results one and results
two available here so it's going to be
structure that array out straight into
the variable names I desire to be so it
really saves a lot of code what you'll
find out is most es6 features are not so
much new features the most useful parts
of es6 are not so much that they're new
functionality they just really improve
the day to day coding experience they
really make javascript a lot of what the
language has been lacking for a long
time and so it's just much more
enjoyable
it's what CoffeeScript tried to do a
while back but became too much of its
own language to take complete mainstream
adoptions so I won't get into that
argument there but let's say you can
also destruct your objects this is
actually very useful so let's say foo
equals two I can actually go I'm
building an object let's say bar equals
one and I could go foo equals two I
don't have to do that if I want it to
have the same name and the same value as
foo I just type in foo and that's
basically the same as going foo two so
it's going to say oh does the food
variable exist it does exist let's print
it out and print it's valuable and value
so that's really nice if you're calling
functions let's say I'm calling some
method and want to give it an object of
say I've got name
and got my name in my age and I'm have
to pass those in I can just go name age
and that's going to pass in that object
will I basically just made that object
so it's much cleaner syntax for spitting
out the exact same thing again just very
helpful and you can also go you can also
generate your own keys so I could say
name equals will I could go name plus
with plus name I don't find this one
very useful I think I've used it once or
twice is some value so that's basically
the same as going name we'll which you
really can't do it's just it's really
just one of those use cases you couldn't
do it unless you wanted to just create
an object first it's kind of how you'd
have to do it before es6 and then you
have to go object name so you have to
kind of do the second step equals some
value so now you can actually define
that when you're defining the object up
here you can do that exact same bracket
notation so that's very helpful as well
so you can do structure stuff let's look
at destruction arguments because this is
a very very useful feature let's say I
have a function for let's calculate BMI
here we need weight to do that we need
height all right so there's my function
and then BMI what is that weight divided
by I think the square of your height and
this all has to be metric or something
like that but I'll just pretend it's
metric already so there we go so that's
my BMI and some guy down here calls it
calc BMI they it already exists
somewhere okay so that's going on let's
say now we're going to add a callback
feature so I can also call that back if
callback
yeah my so that's going to pass in and
then this guy is going to do the exact
same thing but he's also going to give
it a callback function that does
something with that value and then let's
say at some point well now we want to
enter in a max here so you can also
enter in a max and some of you guys are
seeing where I'm going this guy needs to
enter in a max of 25 so if it's over the
max if BMI is over max then we're going
to console.log that your weight is too
high you're overweight so that of course
then creates this problem because we're
not passing in a max here so we have to
pass in null and you basically end up
with these arguments that are these
functions that are hard coupled to the
order of your arguments which can make
for some really frustrating situations
sometimes so what we could do instead is
we could pass in an object once again
we're going to do that exact D
structuring we've done we're basically
going to create a new object we're just
doing the object as a one thing which
would commonly be called something like
ops right so then all throughout your
BMI you're going to say if ops dot call
back you know and stuff like that you're
going to ops dot height ops dot weight
well now you don't have to do that you
can just kind of D structure them coming
in which my syntax is looking weird on
this but that is correct we can totally
do this we're actually pulling in weight
height max call back and I'm just going
to say max has a default of 25 I can do
default arguments which is very nice
so this max is going to be 25 if it's
undefined and so then callback is going
to be there so this is very nice and
then I can do this exact same thing here
I don't have to worry about max anymore
I'm passing in max as undefined and I'm
passing in a callback right there so
that's really nice basically it doesn't
the order doesn't matter anymore
I could totally move these orders around
here weight height it doesn't matter I'm
going to pull them all in correctly
another thing that I can do is I can
also kind of
the naming of these so I'll wait to come
in as Deb you on height to come in as H
so now you're going to come in as Debbie
you're going to come in as H Monica and
then there's max so that's fine so
that's another cool thing is you can D
structure them you can D structure them
with default values this also works when
you're just destructuring objects
somewhere else more and more I find
myself converting interfaces to D
structuring objects when there's
multiple arguments I feel like it's just
cleaner it's less error-prone it's just
really nice it makes for a nice code so
that's good let me show you one more
thing and then we'll go ahead and stop
this video and get into another one so
you can kind of learn spend some time
get comfortable with these and move on
and that's template strings love
template strings so something you find
yourself doing all the time is my name
is will and then you have to say greets
hi my name is and then plus name + and I
like to party then you're like oh well
now party has to be something else so
thing equals party now you have to do I
like to and then you have to do thing
and they have to do plus and they have
to add your period it's really mess and
then of course you find out ah I left my
space out I got it had my space and so
that's the kind of thing that is really
annoying in that of course multi-line
let's not even get into multi-line
because then I have to add that and if I
want it to feel like multi-line then I
got to do all these tabs yuck so that's
something we don't like to do and of
course template strings really fixes
that I can just go create equals you do
a back tic instead which of course looks
and feels very strange at first and my
syntax highlighting is not picked this
up let me see if I can let's see if
JavaScript picks it
yeah my syntax highlighting is and how
this atom has much better es6
highlighting I usually use atom what I'm
doing ESA
but oh well let's see so hi my name is
and then I can go name which kind of
CoffeeScript dish if some of you guys
have used CoffeeScript to be for dollar
sign in those brackets basically means
look for that variable pop that variable
in and I like to thing there we go it's
done add your exclamations do whatever
oh yeah I guess what you can also do
multiple lines and I like to party so
there you go that's awesome template
strings are tremendous let's get into a
few more features but I'll give you a
breather so you can recap this section
if you want and we'll get into some more
extremely useful features in the next
