use the view j/s framework it's one of
the top three frameworks you should know
these days and it's really simple to
learn and fun to use
it's a lot like angular in many ways but
it's simple nature makes it a lot more
enjoyable especially for newer coders as
a first framework so let's go ahead and
get into it I have a HTML file here and
that's gonna reload onto this page here
as I type and save so let's go ahead
start by using Emmet to just get a basic
HTML document set up let's say h1 my app
and then let's actually make the app
here so div with an ID of app I give it
an idea of ID let's change that to app
so there we go that's my actual HTML
document everything else will happen
through view j/s in this ID app here so
let's go ahead get view on the page we
can do that by adding a single script
tag unpackage comm slash view and then
let's add a javascript file here for us
we'll add main j/s let's make that main
J's file and there we go so view is on
the page and then it's loading our main
j/s and the rest of the app can happen
in here since view is already on the
page we can get started by going const
app equals new view and we're just going
to give it an empty object for now so
now we have gone ahead and we have
created our application but it's not
mounting on the page anywhere so we want
to tell it to mount to ID app which is
this div element here so let's go yell
and give it a string app so it's
basically going to find that and then it
will be mounted onto the page now let's
go ahead and actually tell this
application to create some HTML for us
we can do that by specifying a template
value and this can just be a string so
we can say h1 hi and now our application
will rerender and we will see that our
app has boom said hello to us I'm gonna
actually change this to an es 6 template
string so I can go multi-line and it'll
be a lot easier so now I can go H
like this I what I cannot do is I cannot
add two different elements without a
rapping tag you need to return one
top-level tag I'll show you what this
means so hi and then this will fail
hello you see I'm gonna get an error
here in the console that says whoops
seeing two tags here you can only return
one root element so what you do in this
case is you just return a div that has
multiple elements inside of it as many
as you want basically as long as you
return one top-level element you'll be
good with your view template so let's do
a little bit more before we end this
video let's go ahead and create some
data values and get those realtime
injecting into our application so if you
create a data object this object can be
as big or as small as you want it to be
let's start real simple here let's just
say name Bobby
age 25 there we go we've created that
object here and instead of saying hi
hello let's say name and then you can
use mustache syntax the template
automatically gets these data values put
in in a mustache type of syntax so I can
say give me the name value and I can say
give me the age value so now those will
spin out right now we'll see named Bobby
aged 25 you can also make this as deep
as you want it to be so I could say
Bobby let's make a whole object just for
him Bobby Boone and then let's say
there's John here
I don't know why I always use hillbilly
names it just seems fun I guess and so
then we can actually say John dot name
let me say John age so now will spit out
John's name in John's age let's change
this one down here to be Bobby named
Bobby age so you can basically do as
many dots as you want and keep going
deeper and deeper into that data there
we go so now we have John and Bobby and
we're spinning out their names and ages
so I'll leave you at that for now for
this video that's how you get started
with your very first view app get it
connected to the dom spit out some data
in the next video we're going to look at
how to use this data in a more complex
way loop through items and interact with
user events</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
