talking about how to scale of UJS
application into a full scale
application now there are several pain
points we would run into if we started
taking those manual components that we
were just creating inside of a main dot
JS file it would be very frustrating so
obviously we want to go towards a web
pack build system and we also want to
start defining our view components in a
single file component structure I'll
show you what that is and to help us get
started let's go ahead and install the
view CLI which we can do by installing
NPM globally view CLI I've already done
that so I will not run that install so
now we have the view command and if you
do view list you'll see that there's a
set of templates that we can pick and
webpack is going to be the one that we
want to start off with so we're going to
want to go view in its web pack then you
could also give it a folder if you
wanted it to create it into a different
folder but we're going to say do it in
the folder where now and we're just
gonna say yes to almost all these
defaults runtime plus compiler yes we do
on that and let's say no to all the
add-ons so no view router we will get to
that in the next video
no to all the other additions so now we
can just run npm install and npm run dev
also open this in code so this will get
us all going here
so well this is not installing it's
going to open up my project in Visual
Studio code and then start NPM run dev
and we will be rolling
all right so about a minute later and
here's our application that we've
created and we're just going to go ahead
and you can see the index file is pretty
much what we've been working with we
just have an ID of app in our entire
application renders into there and then
the rest is gonna happen in the source
if you want to look more at what's going
on in the build you can see there's
quite a few build files that you can
kind of sort through but the short of it
is is we're running webpack now and we
are having wet pack compiled down what
are called view files dot view files now
you'll want to on your editor also
install an extension that allows you to
work with dot view files on visual
studio code that's called vitor the ETU
are I don't know why it's not called
something more straightforward but ve tu
R is the extension you want for Visual
Studio code and this is basically the
anatomy of a single file component you
break out your template your script and
your style into three separate tag based
structures syntax highlighting works
great this way for both your HTML and
your JavaScript while also for your CSS
so that's a lot cleaner and also things
are broken out you can see here that we
can import a hello world component
register that component and then we can
spit it out in our template and you can
arrange these however you want if you
like your template down lower which is
actually what I prefer or however you
like it you can arrange it so let's go
ahead look at this hello world component
let's work with these single file
components a little bit more here let's
click in this hello world component you
can see we're inserting all these links
that we have here well that's just erase
some stuff and clean this up so here's
our hello world component all we have to
do is export default and object and
that's our component configuration one
important thing to note here in view is
whenever you're using a child component
the data cannot return just in objects
like you can do on the top level
component on the top level component you
say data you give it an object and
that's all your values child components
cannot do that there are some problems
with pointers that you'll run into so if
you don't really understand what those
problems would be just know
as a practice any child component
anything that is not your very top level
component when you define data run a
function that returns an object of your
data that's very very important so
that's the pattern we're going to be
using going forward so let's say we want
to create two more components to add to
this page I'm gonna go ahead safe here
cleaned it out a little bit let's go
ahead add two component files let's say
new file we'll just call it module one
dot view and let's do a template and
let's do a script tag and let's also do
a style so our template is just gonna
spit out h1 module one and then here's
my script tag you can see when I have
that feature set up then it
automatically did the export default for
me I'm gonna leave that there that's all
I need I'm not going to do anything
smart with data for right now so there's
my module one and let's save this as
module two as well so now we have module
1 and module 2 we'll call it module 2 so
now we want to in our hello world import
those components let's go ahead import
and now I can register those components
components are going to be module 1
which is the same as doing module 1
since we're using es6 here make sure I
add my comma so now I've registered
module 1 and I can now use module 1 and
I get that h1 that appears right there I
can also pull in module 2 just the same
it's pulling module 2 it's important
module 2 and now we're scaling out our
components pretty quickly and easily now
we have to do is spit it out on the page
so I can go module 2 now module 1 and
module 2 are on our page nothing really
magical happening there let's take a
look at how the style works now so I can
now define a style that has to do with
my module I can go h1 color red and this
is going to break I'm going to show you
in a minute why so h1 is red for module
1 and h1 is
pink for module two and you'll notice
that module two just overwrote module
one and our app level module and that's
because if you don't tell this to be
scoped style it's going to be global
style let's go and inspect this real
quick you'll see what I mean you can see
that we have h1 pink and h1 red they're
overriding each other they're just
standard styles so we do not want that
instead what we want to do is want to
actually do a scoped style that's just
for our component and all you do is add
the scoped HTML attribute and so we're
gonna have that scope there scope two
there and now everything works exactly
as we've expected so let's go ahead and
look what's different now you can see
that that rule is actually h1 for our
object for just our module this module
right here let's inspect this HTML you
can see we have this date of E and then
some hash attribute which is being added
so only H ones on our components get
this style it's a really great rule so
you can scope style very very easily and
that's really really nice so don't
forget about that scoped attribute and
then again the other gotcha is you
always want to make sure if you're
defining data that you define data as a
function that returns an object that's
kind of your introduction to single file
components one more thing to add and we
can really start scaling out our
application and that is how we handle
routing with view router we'll do that
