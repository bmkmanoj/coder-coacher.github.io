that make JavaScript weird and awesome
we're going to be doing scope and
context which are clearly some of the
most complicated things to understand
especially when you're new to JavaScript
and a lot of people have pointed out
after watching some of the first videos
they're saying hey these things exist in
a lot of languages you don't know what
you're talking about
absolutely they exist it's the the
unique event driven environment of
JavaScript that just means they're going
to show up a lot more often as problems
and they're going to be a lot more
unique sometimes in the way that they
show up that's what I mean by that let's
get into scope and a lot of developers
mistakenly think that scope and context
are the same thing
and they are not scope means variable
access variable ah access which is when
a piece of code is running what
variables do I have access to that's the
scope context is the value of this
whenever a piece of code is running the
value of this is the context and so you
can remember that because context has a
T and this has a T so context means this
scope does not mean this it doesn't have
a T so let's get into scope real quick
I'm going to define ver a equals 1 and
so by default when you're coding in
JavaScript you're in what's called the
root scope the the base scope which is
the window object when I just created
ver a it actually made window dot a I
can go window dot a and that equals 1 I
can also go a and a equals 1 I can also
go window dot a is exactly the same as a
yes it says true so I'm on the window
object right now the root scope and I
made a variable called a let's make a
function here and let's run it right
away so now what I've done is I've
created what's called a child scope I
can now create variables B equals 2 and
after I run foo I'm going to try to
console dot log B and it's going to say
that's undefined because B was created
in the scope of this function it wasn't
created in the root scope up here let me
kind of show you how that works
we got the parent scope up here and
we've got the child scope in here
and it works just like parents and
children when you're talking about
cookies if I go parents if I'm a parent
and I go out and buy a box of cookies by
default my child gets access to the
cookies because they're in the pantry
and they're my child
now if my child saves up his hard-earned
money and buys his own cookies there is
no way on heaven or hell that he is
going to allow me access to his cookies
there his cookies he's the child but if
I put him in the pantry lord knows that
he gets access to them because I'm the
parents and he's the child that is
exactly how variable access how scope
works in JavaScript and in most
programming languages maybe if not all
programming languages and so when I
create a child variable the parent does
not have access to it but I have access
to a in here I can go console.log a and
it will work so it's going to
console.log a which is one then I'm
going to try to console log B and it's
going to say B is not defined I have
access to a but the parent scope does
not have access to B let me go ahead and
now show you
let's go variable a equals two so now
when I console dot log a it's going to
console log to what I've just done is
I've created what's called a name
conflict or a scope conflict I have
defined a variable in my child scope
that is the exact same name as a
variable in my parent scope it's not
illegal but all that's happened is is
now I have two a variables in existence
I have window a and I have a within this
child scope so now I have broken the
connection I have no way of accessing a
outside of I've no way of accessing this
a anymore unless I happen to know how to
get to its parent object which is window
dot a so I can console.log window dot a
because this is defined on window and
then I can go console.log a so it's
going to console.log one which is window
a and that's going to console.log two
which is my current scope a so it's
created what's called a naming conflict
let me go ahead and do one more thing
here and after I run foo I'm going to
console.log the value of a so I am
console logging a
from the root scope and it's going to
consult log 1 which is the value of a in
my scope Iran foo it created a new
variable called a but it did not touch
the a in my scope a is still the value
of 1
I can console.log a and here and it
would be too but console logging a out
here is one it's very interesting
something you definitely need to keep
note of if you're using the same words
over and over again like my element or
my name or my value if I take off the
var here's what Java scripts going to do
it's going to first look in the scope
that I'm in in say has a variable a been
created yet so if I do variable a equals
one up here
AE equals two down here means first
thing I'm going to do is look in my
scope and see if a has been created okay
it has been created so now this a
changes this a or points to this a so
now this a will be changed to a value of
two console.log a will still console.log
one down here if i remove if this never
took place
AE equals two it's going to look in my
scope find out the day has not been
defined so it's going to look in my
parents scope and say ah there's an a a
now points to this a so now if i save
and refresh at console logs to and if I
do var and save and refresh it console
logs one because this one has not been
touched so I can actually modify the
contents of a in my parent scope if I
don't do var if this a had not been
created then it would keep looking up to
the parent scope and look up to another
parent scope another parent scope till
it got all the way to the window object
and if there was no window dot a what my
battery's about to die there's no window
a then it would create it for you right
there and give it a value of two so now
if i console.log a a equals two and
window a has been created and equals two
if you hear about polluting the root
scope or trying to keep the root scope
clean that's what that means if you
forget to do var you just created a root
scope variable that every everything
across your application has access to
and you do not want to pollute the root
scope it just creates for a messy
one way around it which I will not defy
I will not describe in detail is if you
use the use strict then it prevents you
from cluttering the root scope it now
says a is not defined because I never
did their a on the root scope
console.log a a does not exist so you
can look up more on what you strict
actually does
so that is scoping in JavaScript that's
variable access I guess I'll just give
you one more example ver a equals one
function foo says ver a equals two and
console logs a not console dir console
logs a and let's make another function
and this will go a equals three console
log a so now what I'm going to do if I
run foo and if I run bar and then I
console log a it's going to run foo foo
is going to create an a and console log
it so that's going to console log two
then if I run bar a equals three it's
going to look up in my parent scope it's
going to look in this scope know a
exists going to look up in the parent
scope which is my root scope and it's
going to find that a equals one it's
going to change that to three and then
it's going to console log a so this will
console log three and then we will just
run a console log in a and this will
look in the scope that I'm in find this
guy which has now been changed to three
oh my goodness I feel like I'm even
confusing myself it's going to console
log two three three so there you go that
is scope and JavaScript let's get into
context the real kicker the real thing
where people blow up their code all the
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
