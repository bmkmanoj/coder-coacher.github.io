to see on job descriptions all over the
place or on job postings is Dom
traversal you're going to see things
like able to traverse the Dom with ease
able to bend the Dom to your will
skilled at Dom interaction and what that
means is you kind of know your way
around the document object model which
is what the Dom stands for and when the
document object model is is when your
browser reads your HTML file it actually
turns each one of these elements you've
made into an element in the in the
browser that JavaScript can talk to that
CSS Styles can be applied to and so kind
of when the browser reads all three
technologies it creates the Dom and then
it can render it for the viewer to see
and so when you interact with JavaScript
you're not actually interacting with
your HTML code you're interacting with
what the browser built from your HTML
code you're interacting with the Dom so
when you see things like that in job
descriptions they're looking for can you
easily find specific and sometimes
complicated things out of the Dom and
work with them and that's where jQuery
really shines it is actually primarily a
Dom traversal library it's made to do
things that would normally be very
complex with JavaScript alone it's make
that it makes them very easy so let's
get into Dom traversal with jQuery I'm
actually going to start over here with
the console because it makes it a little
easier we know that you can go Li and
find all the Li elements there you go
that found all my li elements on the
page a cool thing you can do is you can
go first and that's going to find your
first one on the page and then you can
go last and that's going to find the
last one on the page which is not
actually the last one in my list it's
the last one on the entire page which is
this Li which is inside of another Li so
let's say I can actually go first and I
can hide it there you go the first one's
hidden I can show it again I can go EQ
which will actually get me an index so
if I go EQ zero that's going to get me
the first index which is actually the
same as first but I can actually go EQ
one which will give me the
second one so the EQs would go 0 1 2 3
which is the Li right here 3 then 4 5 6
so I have 7 7 l eyes on the page EQ 0
through 6 so that would kind of be how
I'd access those let's look at
children's so let's say I wanted to get
ul first here's another way you can do
it if you want to do it in the selector
same thing children will get me all the
lis that are direct children of my
element so if I look back over here at
my HTML code
I have a child li child li child alike
these allies down here will not show up
in that list because it's only getting
my first children so that's kind of a
way to help narrow that selection down
if I only wanted to hide the children of
list that would be how I do that
another one is siblings so if I want to
go Li first siblings then that's going
to give me all the siblings of this guy
but this guy will not be in the list
because it's just my siblings so that's
those three elements there
so let's actually let's see there's
another one then that would be parent Li
first a dot parent and that's going to
give me the UL that is my parent and you
can actually keep chaining that up so
let me go Li EQ 4 which will be this guy
EQ 4 that's him right there
and then EQ 4 dot parents is going to
give me the sub list which is UL and if
I go dot parents parents then that's
going to give me the Li that that's a
part of and you can just keep going up
the chain and that's going to give me
the list another thing I can do is go
parents parents previs Li and I'm going
parent which is the whole UL they're
going parent again which is this Li and
I go pre if that's going to go the
previous sibling now so that should give
me this 3 right here and there you go
yep you have it so now if I go pre pre
Eve now I'm going up to 2 so I'm going
all the way up
Chane I'm going to the previous to the
previous and now if I go preview I'll
preview next which makes absolutely no
sense why would I go back only to go
forward I'm back up to three probably an
easier way to do this would go Li first
dot next which is going to give me the
same as EQ one so that's kind of how you
start moving around things let me show
you a couple use cases of how you could
do stuff like this I'm going to go Li on
click and I'm going to go this dot next
dot hi so whenever I click I'm just
going to hide the next li so I'm going
to click on you and number two is gone
and now I'm going to click on you and
number four is gone if I click on you
nothing happens because number two still
exists it's just hidden so if I were to
actually go next out remove I could
actually keep doing this over and over
again there you go so that's kind of how
that works another thing that I could do
is I could hide all the siblings I'll
just remove them why not well I make
them go away and you can make them gone
forever so now whichever one you click
on is the one that's going to say you
notice this one's blue it's because it
has a class of special I made this
simple rule that anything with special
gets blue so what I could actually do is
I can make all my siblings have a class
of special whenever you click on
something whenever you click on
something which so now I didn't become
special but all my siblings became
special and we know I could actually do
is make sure that my class special gets
removed if I do have it so that way
there you go now whatever I click on all
my siblings will get this special class
but I won't have the special class what
it's another thing you could do I could
actually go parent and add the special
class to my parent so now when I click
on this the parent gets a special class
so everybody within it gets it so that's
kind of another thing that you can do
I can also go closest I don't think I
did closest yet
and then closest you have to give it
something so I'm going to go down list
so it's going to go up the chain till it
find something with a class of lists so
basically no matter what Li I click on
it's going to go all the way up the
chain are you a list are you a list up
your list and so then I'm going to add
the class to that so now I can click
here and it goes all the way up adds
special to the entire thing let's see
I'll give you a couple more examples
before I leave you guys for now you
could do filter so let's say whenever I
click on list I'm going to go you dot
list
I'm going to go filter filters actually
yes I'll go find I'm going to go find
all VL eyes within my element so
whenever I click anywhere on this list
I'm going to find all the you all the L
eyes within list and I'm going to remove
I'll do add the class special same thing
as I've been doing so this should do
just what we've been doing there we go
but let's say I only actually want to
add the class to the first Li of each
one I can do that guy so only the first
elements are going to get it now the
first element I could also go filter
special and I'll actually do a remove
here hope I'm not going too fast for you
at this point so whenever I click on
anything inside of list this is going to
be list because that's what my selector
was here I'm going to find any Li in it
filtered by special so I'm going to
slightly I'm going to find all the eyes
I'm going to filter them down to where
only special exists and I'm going to
remove special so now I'm clicking and
specials gone of course an easier way to
do this would just go find special but
then I couldn't teach you about the
filter method now could I
there you go exact same thing so find is
awesome another great thing about find
is it's really really fast because it's
only looking in this element it's not
having to look at my whole page I could
get around this by doing this exact same
thing here whenever I click remove
special right that's easy exact same
thing but now I had to search my entire
page to find one item with a class of
special that's not very efficient
JavaScript so I'm going to stay within
the element that we're working with I'm
going to find special inside of it and
then I'm going to remove it another
thing that I can do is I can do an
action only if let me do another thing
so any L I click on I can do an if and
alerts special so if it's a special one
that I clicked on I want to alert
special so of course we can do this I
mean that's easy you know anytime you
click on special alert special of course
should do that oh this if is empty haha
so now whenever I click on special it
alert special awesome okay let's say I
want to do other stuff to every other L
I say in here other stuff happens
oh like let's say I want to hide it and
if I'm hiding a special one I also want
to alert special so I can go if this is
special if this is special alert special
so now whenever I click on any a lot
it's going to hide it and that's going
to hide it and say aha special so
another thing I can do if this is not
special alerts not special not special
and not special so that's kind of how
you can do those things while I'm on
this I'm hiding every li that gets
clicked on and look at this when I click
on one of these sub allies over here
it hides the entire menu that's because
when I click I'm clicking on you and I'm
clicking on you because I'm inside of
you at the same time so there's a
listener for both of these lis a couple
ways you could get around this I could
just target sub list I can only hide
ones when I click on the sub list sorry
sub list ul or Li so now I'm only going
to I'm only listening to Allies on the
sub list these aren't doing anything
okay that's one way around it but say I
still wanted to do a bunch of other
stuff to all lis so I want to do other
stuff to all allies and I only want to
hide the Li if it's on the sub list so I
could go if this dot parent is sub list
so if the parent is a sub list then I'm
going to hide it and if it's not I'm not
going to do anything else so now I'm
doing other stuff like here let me say I
want to console.log
so now whenever I click on any Li it's
going to log down here that I did fix
this there we go
when I click on any Li it's going to say
clicked on Li as you notice down there
that number keeps going up and when I
click on you it's going to also log and
it's going to hide so that's kind of how
we can do some smarter things like that
I think that just about covers it
I tried to go fast for those of you guys
that are a little more comfortable you
can get it and be done and some of you
guys may want to rewatch this video but
that's about it
I hope you enjoyed learning about Dom
traversal with jQuery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
