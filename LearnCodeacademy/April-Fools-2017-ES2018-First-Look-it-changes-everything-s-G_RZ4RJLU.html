new Atmos script 2018 or ES Super next
as some people have been calling it so
let's get into these awesome new
features the first new feature is global
variables or always global variables so
there's this thing that can happen
called scope conflicts if I would go
const AAA equals 1 and then a function
sum function and const equals 2 here
this creates what's called a named
conflict which means i cannot access
this value of a because i've already
defined a here and the issue here is it
doesn't throw an error no error is
thrown i just no longer have access to
this a which i might find out later on
my programming so to get around this
javascript has defined everything in its
2018 as a global variable so this is
global this is global this is global and
now this will throw an error so a has
already been declared so whether it's
been declared here or in another
third-party library or any other part of
my application i'm going to get an error
here and so there's basically no more
guesswork when we're coming up with
variable names we're going to know if
they've been created anywhere else in
the application
another thing is common keyword
shortcuts common keyword shortcuts so
Const function things that you type all
the time constant
there let's math anything that's really
common they've come up with single
letter shortcuts for it so you can just
go C for Const so Const a equals 1 and
then function same thing F some function
and that really shortens up the code and
to go along with the keyword shortcuts
all the baked in libraries like math
have also given you the shortcut of just
m and so instead of math you can do M
instead of math dot round you could do m
dot R so that really shortens up the
syntax you have to type and that brings
us to the third point so let's just go
to race that and that's dot syntax dot
syntax does have this cult following for
years now and people then pushing to get
it into JavaScript
think it's going to be a lot better for
beginners some just argue that it's
better to read and what it is is the
methodology behind dot syntax is is
let's take a lot of those common
characters that you type every day that
the interpreter translates anyway and
let's actually just replace those all
with the dots you don't have to worry
about what character you're typing so
all those characters right there equal
parens curly braces brackets and
semicolons those can all be replaced
with the dots so we could go Const a dot
one and then you could add the semicolon
or not that's up to you that's still
arguable same thing for a function so
function sum function dot give it an
argument say name dot age of the comma
can be replaced with a dot as well age
and you're calling do a curly braces and
then you can actually come in here and
do something console.log dot hi and then
a semicolon at the end and then wrap
that with another closing curly brace
and so the dot functions as you can see
what it does is dot syntax really cleans
everything up you read the words and you
don't have to get messed up with the
jargon and the semicolons and the curly
braces and all that and what it
basically does it makes it really really
readable and so for you to actually
combine this with our keyword shortcuts
then this could be F name age and
console.log also has C so CL that really
cleans things up you're able to see hey
we have a function getting name an age
and we're console logging hi or I guess
in this case we get also console.log
name so that's really really clean
really really easy to read only thing
that's a little quirky with it is if you
use dot syntax to define objects like
let's say B is an object B equals we'd
normally do what C 1 D 2 then you can
replace all those obviously with a dot
syntax dot dot dot dot and the
whitespace becomes a little bit more
involved and then at this point if we're
to console.log something let's say we're
going to console.log B dot C then you
know if you
know what the program is doing you
wouldn't know that this is console
logging BC but again if you know what
the application is doing this is super
simple syntax and it's so readable
that's the best thing about it
lastly flow and typescript support are
coming native to JavaScript that's going
to be out in Firefox 54 I don't know the
chrome version of that what it is is if
you're on OSX or Linux if you're on Mac
or Linux you're going to get flow if
you're on a PC you're getting a
typescript support and I think they've
kind of taken more of the divergent
mentality of that if you've seen the
movie divergent as people have been
saying by creating segregated groups of
developers will ultimately be able to
find the divergent quote/unquote
developer there's kind of the
methodology behind that and so by
dividing the community up we're actually
going to be able to figure out where the
community needs to be going in the
future
so that makes a lot of sense and that's
going to be baked in as well so there's
your xmas script 2018 new additions I
hope you're enjoying your April Fool's
Day and have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
