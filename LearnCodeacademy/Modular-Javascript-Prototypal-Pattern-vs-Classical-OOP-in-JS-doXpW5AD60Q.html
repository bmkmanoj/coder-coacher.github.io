second pattern for handling
instantiation of modules and inheritance
of modules in the last video we looked
at the classical pattern for inheritance
and instantiation and in this one we're
going to look at the newer pattern which
is prototypal some people actually say
prototypal and they mean classical
because they've not yet learned of this
newer one I say newer it's been used for
about the last three to five years and
it there's there's a few advantages
there's not as many advantages as some
people may say you still encounter
classical inheritance a lot you see it
used a lot just because it was it was
the way things were done for a long time
but I personally think this is the
better pattern so let's go ahead look at
prototypal inheritance so in the last
example you would create a constructor
function and you'd instantiate it with
new so you go function person and then
you create a new person very well equals
new person okay so that's classical
inheritance there's a video on that I'll
put in the description if you missed it
and so prototypal inheritance does all
the same things in a different way so
let's go ahead and now let's create will
will go human then we'll do musician and
then we'll create people so in this case
you simply make objects human equals
boom and you make an object and then use
object.create
to create a new type of thing so you can
make a musician equals object creates
human and so what that's going to do is
that's going to make a new object and
inherits all of the properties of human
and so let's go ahead and fill in a few
of these so let's say this has a species
and that's human human and then we've
got let's say say species and this will
console.log this dot species so you
still use the this keyword when you're
referencing values that are on the
object and let's also do say name
there we go so if it has a name you can
say the name so now we've created a
musician and so adding new properties is
or adding new methods is pretty simple
you just simply do musician dot and then
you add on to it so musician dot let's
say play instruments this will be a
function that's console logs plays plus
your instrument there we go
and so now to actually create a musician
we simply do what we've done before with
object create very will equals objects
dot creates and we're going to create a
musician and then we'll can have a name
and we'll can have an instrument let's
play drums today I'm not very good at
drums and now I have all the methods
from the human and I have all the
methods from the musician because the
musician inherited from the human so I
can do things like will dot say species
so let's actually pull this into the
console at this point I'm going to copy
and I'm going to paste there we go so
I've pasted it all in so now let's go
ahead and look at just the will object
so you see here's my will object and
I've added two values to it and then I
can also see my prototype this is the
musician object I can play an instrument
and in that prototype I can say name say
species and I have a species so we'll
dot species is human will dots a species
works and then we'll dot play
instruments all the way up to my level
works so then if I were to go human dot
species let's say we change that
so then we'll dot say species it's
inherited I now say homo sapiens I
didn't change anything about will I
change something about human and it's
inherited down because it's all
prototype so that's basically what
prototypal inheritance looks like
it's a lot simpler I think it's a lot
cleaner for newer JavaScript developers
because they don't have to worry about
actually working with the prototype
objects I know newer developers tend to
have a simpler time grasping how
inheritance works with this because it
just looks like code we're going to
create a musician object from human and
then we're going to add some methods to
it it's very straightforward and simple
now if you don't like having to add all
of these here which I don't like having
to do a lot of people will add a create
method here and so there's a create
function and then you can give it a name
say human can create and so what we're
going to is we're going to create an
instance right in here we're going to
create this right there
and then we're going to go instance name
equals name and then we're going to
return that instance and I make sure
that my comma there so this would
basically go ahead and get rid of the
inheritance for now now there will would
do human dot creates and then I'll just
say we'll so let's pull this in my
console here there you go so now let's
look at will I have a name of will and
then I have all the same methods and I
can go over Bob equals human create Bob
so now Bob's another guy with his own
name so that also works and if you want
to make this even cooler you can
actually just allow any object here so I
could call this values so I pass in an
object of values any amount of values
and then I'm going to get all the keys
out what that does is here if you do
object keys on any object a1 b2 then
it's just going to give me the list of
keys so I'm going to say okay what are
all the values that got passed in I'm
going to for each those that and then
key so I'm going to go through each key
and then I'm going to assign the value
of that key to my instance so no matter
how many values I give it I just give it
an object
no matter what I give it it's going to
assign that so instant key equals values
key so I'm basically just taking all
these values putting them all on and
what this is going to do is this is
going to allow me to always have a
create method let me go ahead and copy
this so now all my children will have
this create method so I'm going to
create that human and that human has
this create method up top so now I can
go there musician equals human create
and then I can just give this all my
stuff right here musicians going to
let's say type of musician actually
musicians think they're their own
species and then function not function
play instrument I'll just say plays
there we go so now I've created a
musician type musicians got his own
species he's got a method on there and
then he's got all that other stuff so
now I can do musician dot create to
create will because I'm inheriting that
create method all the way up there from
human and that create method will
automatically apply anything that I add
in now so I can go name is will
instrument let's play guitar I'm
actually pretty good at guitar so now
will can go play instruments that's
going to play guitar whoops forgot my
space there we'll say name let's say
species and again let's look at that
wheel object so I've got the wheel
object who doesn't really have any
methods and then I've got the musician
object that can play instrument and also
has his own species and then I also have
that so if I were to do will not say
species it's going to be a musician
because species here over
rides species there so that's prototypal
inheritance for you basically you just
use object.create and then if you want
to extend this a little bit more then
you add a create method on to one of
your root objects at the very very top
level and then every other object can
use create create create to continue
creating their own objects the one
caveat to it is object create is only
ie8 newer so if you support really
really really old browsers you're not
going to want to do that so that's
prototypal inheritance again it's a lot
of fun it's really easy and enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
