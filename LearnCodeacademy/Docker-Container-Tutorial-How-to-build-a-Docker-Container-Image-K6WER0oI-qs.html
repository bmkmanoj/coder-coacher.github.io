lessons now if you have not seen my last
one on how to run a docker image as a
container you definitely want to catch
that or you will feel lost but if you've
watched that let's move on so if you're
going to be building and running docker
stuff on your machine and it's not Linux
you've got to install boot to docker the
reason is so head over to boot to docker
IO and you can install that it's very
simple and painless the reason is is
docker sits on top of Linux it's a Linux
tool it sits on top of the Linux kernel
and so all the docker containers you run
have access to that those resources and
so you really can't run it on Mac OS or
Windows what you can do is you can run
the docker command on your Mac terminal
and then you can run a virtual machine
which is a really lightweight Linux
machine if you remember from my little
graphic I made here we can run a virtual
machine and then when we type docker run
it's going to actually run stuff inside
of the virtual machine on Mac it's going
to build our images and run them there
so that's kind of what boot to docker is
that's how you use it go to install it
and you can also if you use homebrew you
can go brew install boot to docker and
that'll get you going so you know what's
going when if you can type boot to
docker and you get a list of commands ok
boot to docker is installed and so that
installed the docker command as well but
I can't go docker PS because I'm not
connected to a docker daemon I'm not
connected to a docker machine and it
knows my Mac is not a docker machine so
what you do is you have two commands you
go boot to docker up this is going to
boot the docker virtual machine the boot
to docker machine on my computer so
you'll have to do this once every time
you reboot your computer it's not really
a big deal it's very lightweight I don't
know what it takes just it doesn't take
up a whole lot of RAM so now that that's
running docker PS still doesn't work
because docker the docker command does
not know what VM that is so to get that
pointing to your doctor VM you go boot
to docker shell in it and that will you
wrap it in parens and the dollar sign
that's going to execute you know the
output of boot to docker shell in it
so there we go it's now pointing to my
boot to docker VM I can go docker PS and
I'm run
nothing excellent I'm good to go and so
you do have to run this for every new
terminal window you open so I just copy
this command and paste it at the end of
my users bash profile file I paste it at
the end of that so every terminal I open
it tries to connect to the boot to
docker VM if the boot to docker VM is
not running then it just you know errors
out it doesn't it's no big deal so I
kind of have that so it's automatic for
me
there you go boot - Dockers out of the
way let's look at actually building our
first docker image so for this I have a
really simple presentation I think the
easiest way to do or the easiest example
of building a docker image is serving up
static files with nginx so let's say
we've got this static website here which
I just downloaded html5 boilerplate it's
there index HTML Javascript CSS and I'm
just going to use nginx to serve this up
if you don't know what nginx is I have a
video on it I'll put that in the
description it's it's basically Apache
except for I like it better so I've got
this nginx configuration file and it
looks pretty complicated but here's all
you actually don't even need that this
is all the file has to be for my nginx
configuration we're going to look for
everything in the /ww folder and we're
going to serve that as a static website
now I added some other stuff I want to
do that Auto indexing so if I don't have
an index.html then it's going to you
know show a list of the files and then I
also from html5 boilerplate server
configs this URL here
I also copied a lot of caching so it'll
cache JPEGs and images and all this
stuff so it'll speed up the WAGs website
significantly so here's my nginx
configuration file so I want to actually
build a docker image that runs nginx and
serves up static files how do I do that
I create a docker file and I'm going to
say it's from nginx so nginx is
basically they take I think it's built
on a bun - it might not even be a bun -
it might be lighter operating system
than that so it's it basically has nginx
installed and it's exposing port 80 so
that's what this base box
this base configuration so I'm choosing
that as my base and I'm going to make a
few changes to that for my image I'm
going to add a few layers on top I'm
going to make a directory called Etsy
nginx logs and I'm going to touch an
empty file in their static log I have to
do this because my caching is going to
log to that file so if that file doesn't
exist my build will fail because nginx
well my build will work but nginx will
never run it will hang up because it's
looking for that log file the add
command I'm going to add nginx conf to
Etsy nginx this is the directory for all
the configuration files I'm just going
to call it default conf I'm going to
replace default conf with my new
configuration file and then I'm just
going to add everything from source into
/ww because if you remember my root is
slash www so that's it that's literally
all the lines you need I don't have to
do expose 80 because that's already
taken care of in my parent image I could
do it again it'd be no problem and I
also don't have to do command nginx
because that's already happening up in
my parent file so nginx is automatically
running I can get rid of both you lines
I could add the exposing command just
you know for redundancy sake but I don't
have to do it so let's go ahead now and
build this so now I'm in my folder the
command is just docker build and I'm
going to tag this this is basically what
my repository name is or what my image
name is learner code Academy slash
static nginx is what I'll call this
static nginx and then I need to show it
where's the path to my docker file my
docker files in the folder I'm in so I
just do space dot build no errors it's
successfully built now I can run it
docker run D I want to run this in the
background daemon and then P let's
expose port 80 out to port 80 and then
let's go
what's the name of that it's learn code
Academy man that's a long username sash
static nginx there we go it's running
and so I can go docker PS and it's
running so how do I get to it I can't go
to localhost because my docker VM has
its own IP so I actually have to go boot
to docker IP there you go that's the IP
address of my virtual machine I'm going
to add this to my hosts file because I
don't want to have to remember that
every time let's come down here let's
call this boot to docker me there we go
so now boot to dr. dot me is my virtual
machine I should be able to go to boot
to docker dot me and port 80 is default
so there you go hello world this is
html5 boilerplate awesome so kind of the
workflow for a redeploy on this guy is
let's say I tweet some changes hello
world this is me let's save it beautiful
love it let's go doc or build I can
actually just kind of tab up through my
commands docker build let's retag it it
built it and then let's go docker stop
static did I name it I thought I named
it yes docker stop what I didn't name it
so it's tender feynman stop you remove
you and then let's run go up to my
commands run that I knew I forgot a flag
there's always a flag we'll just call
this guy static there we go so I'm
running it again now for local workflow
you don't want to do that there you go
hello world this is me so my docker
container is working it's beautiful
I can deploy this guy I wouldn't want to
do that for a local workflow clearly
because you don't want to have to go
through all that every time you make a
change especially for static HTML I'm
just going to run something like live
server which is an NPM package I have a
quick video on that and then I got live
reloading and everything and only when I
like this one I'm happy with there you
go this is me also me
there we go that's live reloading much
faster much easier workflow
once I'm happy with my website that's
when I build it that's when I deploy it
so you're saying okay how do I deploy
this guy I liked what I did let's build
it again docker build let's build it
well then all you do at that point is
you just go docker push and assuming
you've done a login docker login
assuming you login with your credentials
on your machine just push learn code
Academy static nginx there you go and
that's going to send the image list in
this will take depending on how many how
big your image is and what all changes
you've made this might take 30 seconds
it might take a minute there you go it's
going pretty quickly and then once
that's pushed on any other machine I can
run it so I'm going to go ahead and log
into let's go and login to SSH root at
docker me which is my production server
if you'll remember let's go back over
here ok there we go it pushed I skipped
ahead about 20 seconds because I didn't
want to make you all wait in silence so
it has pushed and now I can go docker
run p 8080 d name static learn code
Academy like type static nginx man I
hope I typed everything right okay there
we go exact same things so it's going to
pull all the images it's going to do it
much faster because I'm not on my local
machine I'm on digital ocean right now
so it's going to pull these images
really quick and I should have my first
deployment running in just a matter of
moments I didn't have to install nginx
on my server didn't have to install
Apache on my web server absolutely
nothing is installed I'm just running my
image as a container ok there we go
let's see what dr. dot me looks like dr.
dot me and there you go there's my fully
deployed website I can run this image on
staging production anywhere and
everywhere and so that's kind of my
first docker build it's not too much
harder to build something for an ojs app
or for Ruby on Rails app it's it's all
in that docker file and the next video
will probably get into a node.js app or
something so hope you
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
