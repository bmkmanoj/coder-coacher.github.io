development tutorials if you have not
seen the first two videos you'll want to
watch those first check here for a link
to basic HTML and check over here for
lesson number two which is a link to
basic CSS
I'm not going to recover those things so
you'll want to check those out and if
you've already gotten those two and
you're kind of on the learning curve I
highly encourage you learning web
development is a skill you will be very
very glad you learned it's easy to find
work if you're half decent at web
development there's lots of
opportunities to work from home work
remote currently right now I'm in a
permanent position and my employer is on
the other side of the country
my whole team is on the other side of
the country it's just it's a really
great career in my opinion to be in lots
of flexibility lots of opportunity it's
worth the work that being said let's get
into building CSS layouts which is what
we're going to do on this one you know
how to do some basic CSS rules but now
we're going to say let's take this page
this blank page and really make it feel
like an actual real web page so let's
get into it one thing you'll notice as
I'm typing is I'm using a plugin for
sublime text called Emmet and what that
allows you to do is that allows you to
hit tab and auto create some things so
if I do header it gives me a header tag
if I do u L sub L I times five gives me
u L with five L eyes in it I can go
start tabbing through all the fields
it's really nice I'll put a little bit
of description for it in the description
down there about how to do it
but let's get into our layouts a few
html5 tags I'm gonna introduce to you
are called header nav and footer I don't
I can't remember if I covered div or not
so div is another one these are all
basically non styling tags by default
they're just container tags they're
called semantic tags and what they do is
they help you kind of give meaning to
the content within them just by looking
at the code clearly
I'm doing a header with an Ave you can
put anything you want in here but when I
see nav it helps the reader understand
or the Googlebot understand you know
when Google's looking at your page to
figure out what all the content is helps
you figure out what's inside of it so as
you see if I just put text
it appears and there's nothing special
going on so what we're going to do is
we're gonna start building out our page
using these semantic tags I'm gonna do
an unordered list with 5l eyes in it and
those lis are all gonna have a
hyperlinks in them so this is kind of
the way I do it in Emmet ul with an Li
and an a times five and there we go and
I'm just gonna put pound for the
hyperlinks in there since that kind of
tells it to do nothing I add in some
fake links here home blog about contact
links sure there we go and you're like
that does not look like a navigation it
will we've done it correctly with the
tags we've said ul unordered list with
line items and from there on out we're
going to style them to look the way we
want them to you know what else I'm
gonna do I'm gonna add an h1 a header I
page there we go website complete that's
going to be our header section let's
move on and let's build a three column
layouts
let's go div class equals row and let's
do three div class columns Dave call
times three there we go
Emmet is awesome once you get the swing
of it and then footer content
okay so this is the mark-up that we need
to make a pretty decent site so far
let's move over to CSS and show you how
this thing starts coming together let's
start by doing header and let's give the
header a background for now we're not
going to worry too much about design
let's just go zero zero zero which is
black you can also go black and color
white save that there you go that's
starting to come in
you know black is just a little too
depressing I'm gonna go nine nine nine
for a slight grayish color
let's go body let's give body I will
leave body where it is one thing you'll
notice too is by default the body has a
slight margin around it so we're going
to go ahead and drop body margin zero
and that'll take care of these two it
won't take care of that one though let's
go ahead and save keep moving on header
h1 this will be our title and it's old
and then we can move on to nav I'm just
creating some CSS selectors here for
what I'm gonna be doing nav UL we'll
give that no Marge and if you'll notice
by default the nav ul has margins on it
that took care of a lot header h1 let's
give you no margin and let's make sure
the header has no margin trying to
figure out where this extra little bitty
margin is coming from sometimes there's
some defaults on browsers that you're
not aware of all right we'll figure that
out in a little bit I'll show you how to
inspect that to find out where that
padding is coming from so it clearly
isn't that all right so what we'll do
now let's move on to the UL li
so we're gonna make a rule here you can
see I'm further selecting into things by
going nav ul the reason I'm putting nav
first is I don't want to style every ul
on my page with what I'm putting in here
I just want to style my nav ul right now
same with year I don't want to make
every Li for the rest of my entire
website look like a navigation so I'm
just specifying nav ute with a ul child
with an Li child so you see it's going
nav ul Li and it's going to style that
what I'm going to do is list-style-type
by default it's going to do bulleted and
now I'm going to change that to none and
you'll see now the bullets are gone
there we go and then I'm also going to
change the display to inline block
there's a few display choices by default
you can usually there's display inline
oh there's my problem body had a colon
in it and yes I knew I wasn't crazy see
margin:0 um you can see once I changed
it to inline block they all jumped in
line with each other and the reason I
made it in line is also an option which
will give me a similar look you can see
nothing changed the reason I did inline
block is when I did inline block I can
actually assign them fixed widths and I
can do a lot more things with inline
block than I can with inline let me give
them a background color let's give these
a background of black a color of white
and you'll notice they're still blue
because the hyperlinks the a tags
default have a color as well so
there you go that'll take care of those
and I'm also going to add a little bit
of margin let's try five pixels all
around I don't want to do margin okay
one thing you'll notice this is a when
you do margin
it adds spacing on the outside of your
element as you see here I have a black
background in margin added spacing here
which is what's giving me this funky
look if I add padding instead of margin
what padding is going to do is there you
go see now it's going to create padding
inside of my element so what I'm gonna
do is I like the five pixel top and
bottom padding but I wanted to have more
like ten pixel on the left and the right
so that looks a little better I'm
actually gonna go even more 15 pixels
once again with margin and padding you
can go it goes top bottom left right top
our top right it goes clockwise top
right bottom left and if you just do two
then it goes top bottom left right so
I'm going five pixels 15 pixels so that
goes top bottom five pixels left right
15 pixels if I want it to be more
detailed I could also go 5 pixels 15
pixels same thing there's that and then
I also do want to drop margins to zero
because notice how there's a little bit
of margin in between there I think
there's a little bit of margin there
we'll have to figure out where that
margin is coming from look at that in a
little bit so there's our buttons you
see it's starting to look like a webpage
I'm also going to add display:inline to
my h1 display:inline to my UL and that
should make them yep bounce around to
the same line which is very nice another
thing I'm going to do and start adding
some margins to my header now
or padding rather let's try a same 5
pixel 15 pixel padding that's starting
to feel good although I don't want any
padding on the bottom so I'm actually
going to go and extend this rule so what
I just did is 5 pixel top right bottom
left there we go kind of what these guys
stay on the bottom it's feeling a little
good let's maybe see what happens if I
do 15 pixel there yeah feeling decent
feeling decent so what's going to happen
here is because I made this display
inline and this whole ul display inline
by default they're automatically just
going to line up with each other and
depending on how the space goes they're
just going to automatically show up
where they show up you'll notice there's
a little bit extra padding coming on
here that's because you l's by default
have padding as well let me drop that
there you go and now I'm noticing ooh ok
I kind of like that default padding
there maybe what I'm going to do here is
give it a little bit of padding on the
left 0 0
let's try 15 pixels 0 top right bottom
lips wrong thing top right bottom left
that feels good so now whatever my title
does is gonna automatically bump these
out further and further along let's move
on to our three column layout so a
little bit of explanation since I flew
through this I'm using selectors to
obviously clearly grab everything header
header one I want to kind of keep them
grouped so it's easier to figure things
out a decent idea is start with very top
elements of your page move down the list
you can see I went body header what's
inside the header then I went nav I
didn't do anything specific to the nav
so that could stay there then I went
what's inside the nav and then I went
once inside the UL and so keeping with
that you'll notice we only have a few
actual
selector rules CSS rules that we've used
we've used a lot of margin and padding
you're gonna use those a ton you're
gonna use display a lot you can use
background and color and you know this
list-style-type you really only use that
one here and there your see we there's
not an infinite amount of CSS rules or
CSS yeah rules once you get to know them
get to know what they are
you start getting comfortable a lot
faster than it feels like at first so
let's move on to our div and you'll
notice we went div class row and then we
went div class column class column class
column all right let's create these
things in an actual three column layouts
div row so I want to do with a class of
row if I did this and out of that space
then it would look for a div with
something class row inside of it
I'll actually just go class row believe
you for now
class column and what we're going to do
is we're going to give you a float of
left and what that means is everything
with a column now floats left check it
out so they are all floating left we
have a problem here in that since
they're floating left our footer bumped
up and that's a tricky thing we have to
add here is we have to we are going to
do something sneaky is we can do one of
two things we can either make the footer
clear both clear both means forget about
the floats and a wraparound because lots
of times after your things are floating
left let's see if I can show you a
little more clearly what's happening
here let me get a background of nine
nine nine any padding of say 20 pixels
I'll give it a background of 333 so it
sticks out
so we've now got these three columns add
a little bit of margin to for effect
okay there we go that looks a little
better three columns now that they're
floating everything is kind of going to
be out of pocket and they're just gonna
start lining up on the left which means
that the footer by default is gonna bump
up lining on the left as well we don't
want that to happen we want it to do
what's called clearing the floats which
means okay forget all the floats that
are going on clear it come back down
here and so that's why I'm adding a
clear:both that means it's clearing left
and right floats
if you told this to float right then
they'd all start floating based off the
right side of the page so when you tell
it clear:both you're telling clear all
the float left seeing the float rights
if you can understand floats you've
basically understood 80% of CSS layouts
maybe not 80% maybe halfway through
floats are a little bit interesting to
wrap your head around at first but as
you can see it's it's not that
complicated so I'm actually going to do
now is I'm gonna actually go a
percentage size let's see we have three
so that would be 33% for the entire
thing so if each gets 33% we've
basically failed out our whole guy and
you see there no matter what my size of
my window is they're always going to
adjust what I'm actually gonna do now is
add a margin say 1% so that will now
cause them to bump around okay so what
happened here we have 1% margin plus 33%
if you add these three together 33%
you're getting 99% and now we add in a
margin of 1 1 1 1 we basically added 6%
to margins so now we're ending up at a
hundred and five percent that doesn't
work so when you float stuff they're
just going to keep a wrapping around
it's really nice let's say we added five
more divs you notice they just keep
wrapping around kind of like what
Pinterest does the things just keep
wrapping and coming down and wrapping
and coming down we're interested in an
even three column layout so I'm trying
to think of what the math would be here
I basically need to drop five percentage
off
let's go 31 there you go so now we've
got our three column layout you notice
that no matter how my browser window
changes it stays nice and nifty that's
really great so that's kind of a lot of
it when you can use a percentage layout
because but that's going to give you is
the ability for your page to look really
nice on all devices you can go with and
keep it fixed I want 200 pixels there
but you notice that depending on what
kind of screen size you get it's not
always going to look the same I'm gonna
leave this here because in future
lessons we're gonna cover Twitter
bootstrap which does a lot of these
smarts for you and does a lot of cool
things for making it look great on every
device I just kind of want you to get
the basics of how we do everything here
one one thing I'm going to add before
calling this layout done let's add
border radius 10 pixels and that's going
to add rounded corners ah doesn't look
too nice right now let me make it 5 and
let me add that padding back in so there
you go now we're calling whoops we got a
padding of 10 pixels so now what you
notice here is that bumped our margin
off against maybe going to go padding
there we go so what I did is I changed
our margin to 0.5% and our padding's got
0.5% on the left and right so maybe I'll
go 10 pixels top bottom 0.5% left right
and we definitely need a color there we
go we're getting a layout I don't like
that the footer is clearing both by
default I want it to be a little more
generic than that so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to do a row after and
this is kind of what's called a pseudo
element you see that now I get the exact
same effect row after creates a fake
element after the row that's invisible
and you get to style it however you want
so all that element does right now is
clear:both so anytime I add a row tag
it's going to clear both after it
meaning that any floats they're all
going to be checked out and the next guy
is going to appear exactly as you wish
it to so if I copy and paste this row
and I just have one column and Mike that
is did not do what I wanted it to do
oh why is it doing that okay there we go
make the road clear both and I'm not
sure why the afters we're doing what
it's doing so I'll look into that and
put it in the comments below so I don't
look like a fool here on on public
youtube so that's pretty much where
you're gonna go
Oh a bad ad my footer to clear both
again one things you learn about web
development is you never learn it all
even if you knew it six months ago you
might not have used that certain thing
for six months and once we get into
bootstrap in the next video you're gonna
see why I might not have remembered what
that was because I don't need to type it
anymore there's a library that types it
all for me so that's the basics of
creating an HTML layout and you already
know how to link these pages and there
you have it we'll catch you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
