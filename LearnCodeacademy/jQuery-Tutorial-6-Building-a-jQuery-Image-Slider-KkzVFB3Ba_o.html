building a basic jQuery slider an image
slider now there's a lot of great jQuery
plugins out for therefore this flex
slider
Royall slider all sorts of good ones
they have more features than we're going
to be able to build in a couple minutes
but we're learning jQuery so this is a
great example let's get into it I have a
slider here let me show you the HTML
behind it I have a wrapper div with the
ID of slider and then I have UL class
slides and then I have a bunch of allies
that I'll have a class of slide each one
of these has just an image that I've put
in there slider one two three four five
and then I finished it with my first one
as well they're going to be sliding to
the left and I want the first one to be
able to slide onto the screen at the
very end we'll see what that means in a
minute so here's the CSS driving it this
slider wrapper has a width of 720 and
any overflow is hidden and then all the
slides are going left to right all the
way out so the slides ul has a width of
6,000 pixels and then all the slides
float left so basically what you're
seeing here is I can show you is if I
were to make the margin left hundred
pixels there you go
so as the UL the data the UL slides to
the left with it a negative margin it's
going to move there until we run out of
slides and so basically our JavaScript
needs to do is move this ul back and
forth so that's the basics oh yeah and
then when it gets to the end here let me
go back up here when it gets to the end
we need to somehow know that we are on
the last slide and then BOOM go to
margin zero and the user won't even
notice it because it's the exact same
slide so we need to go back to margin
zero when we hit the last slide so let's
get into the code one piece of code
you'll need to know in JavaScript that
if you don't know how to do it yet is
set interval set interval takes two
things it takes a function and then it
takes a time frame like let's say a
thousand milliseconds which is one
second in every thousand milliseconds it
will fire this function so as an example
I can do this I can go
every thousand milliseconds we're going
to log the date new date there you go
and so you'll notice here in the console
it's going to log the new date going up
one second every time another thing you
can do is set interval is you can save
its value my interval equals that
interval so now if I say that it's going
to start over again and now I can go
clear interval my interval give it the
one you want to clear and it stops it so
that's kind of we don't want it to
automatically run forever we want to
have the ability to start it and stop it
so we're going to save our interval and
then we need to use jQuery to animate
this slider and how you do that is you
do I'll show you over here you do jQuery
selector dot animate and then you're
going to give it an object which is all
the CSS properties and what you want to
animate them to you can animate more
than one thing at a time but in our case
we're just doing margin left a time
frame again like how many milliseconds
and then it callback which is if you
want it to do something after the
animation is complete the callback
function will be there so we can just go
slider slides animate margin left -
let's make it negative 720 and then I'll
give it let's do that over the course of
one second there you go so now it just
went to my second slide I can also do
negative if I make it a string I can go
negative equals 720 and it's not going
to go to negative 720 it's going to keep
- thing 720 every time I run that so now
it's going to keep - thing 720 keep -
thing 720 or I can just actually go to -
720 which is slide number 2 if that made
sense so let's go ahead and build out
this thing here we're going to start by
wrapping it in a jQuery document.ready
function which is what we always do and
I also always like to start off with
comments to set the stage for what I'm
going to be building set interval is
what I'm going to build here
and in that interval I'm going to
animate Marge and left and then I'm also
going to if it's last slide go to
position one which is zero pixels and
then I also want to add another feature
I want to listen for mouse enter and
pause so if you hover over the slider I
want it to pause and you know while I'm
looking at that slide and then resume on
Mouse leave so when I leave I want it to
start sliding again so that's basically
what my sliders going to be let's start
building this out set interval and let's
make it run every three seconds and
every three seconds I'm going to go
slider slider slides animate just what I
showed you before margin left is going
to go negative seven note negative
equals 720 pixels because I don't just
want to go to negative 720 pixels I want
to keep subtracting 720 every time and
let's slide for about one second when we
do that there we go let's actually save
refresh and now we should be sliding
every three seconds yeah over the course
of a second feels good feels good but
this is just going to keep going forever
once we get to slide seven it doesn't
know you're there it just keeps sliding
so now we need to get a little bit
smarter if it's the last slide go to
position one one thing I'm going to do
here is I'm going to start I don't like
that all these configuration options are
kind of scattered throughout the code
that's kind of a bad idea so I'm going
to start moving things up here I'm going
to go width equals 720 which is the
width of our slides which is set in the
CSS it's 720 the slides are all 720 I'm
going to go there animation speed equals
a thousand and then ver pause equals
3000 so now I'm going to make this pause
there we go
animation speed and you I will just go
negative 720
us width so that basically is the same
as saying negative equals 720 X SEP 4
now I'm just storing my 720p R so if if
at any point time I want to change the
configuration it's all in one place
you'll notice the colors are starting to
look a little different now all my
yellows are up here and there's not very
many yellows down here that's a good
sign that means all my configuration all
the things of the same type tend to be
in the same place not all code ends up
looking this way but this is definitely
a good side another thing I want to do
to save configuration is I want to do
what's called caching the Dom I think
I've covered this in some other videos
but I don't want to have to look for
slider slides every time I want to be
able to look for it once and then just
reference it every time so I'm actually
going to go there slider there we go so
I searched the Dom and I found my slider
I'm using the dollar sign here so I know
it's a jQuery object you can call it
just slider but I want to know that
that's not a string or something I want
to remember that that's a jQuery search
so there we go slider equals that and
now I can reference it later on so now
every single time the interval fires I
don't have to look for my slider except
for I'm not actually animating the
slider I'm animating the slide container
so let's get that slide container equals
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
go slider dot find slides so I'm going
to I've already searched all my webpage
document I found this guy and I've kept
a track of it and now I just want to
find a guy inside of it so I'm going to
find slides inside that's a very fast
operation so now once again you'll
noticing I've only done my jQuery
selector once so this is going to be a
very fast in high-performance piece of
code and then I want to go let's go
slides as well
equals slide container but yeah that's
right find
slide so that's going to be the whole
list of my slide elements so this is
actually slide container I not spell
that right nope I didn't
tainer here you go I'm just going to
kind of pace that it's annoying to type
that while I'm talking okay so there we
go
so just again to cover what I did here
is I only searched my whole HTML webpage
once right there and from there on I'm
looking inside that piece that I found
to find some specific things I will
reference later so now every time it has
to do the animation it just goes boom I
already know where that is I'm going to
find it and animate it it's a much
faster piece of code so now what I need
to do is I need to start checking
afterwards to see if I'm on my car if
I'm on the last slide or not what I will
do here is I'm going to add a callback
remember I said the third thing you can
pass to animate is a callback
so once the animation is done I want to
check if I'm on the last slide if I am
on the last slide I go to the first
slide so if and I'm going to do this
plus I'm going to let's do this let's go
plus plus or current slide wait I didn't
save current slide here the current
slide equals one I always want to start
on slide one so I'm going to go current
slide plus plus so I'm boosting that up
so the first time it's going to turn it
to two then three then four every time I
plus plus that it's just going to go up
one number if current slide it equals
slides dot length so if current slide is
if we're on the last one current slide
will be one two three four five six and
then if that is the same as my length
which is the count so if I can show you
that there slide if I do slide length
then it's going to be six there are six
slide elements on my page so if current
slide is the same as slide length then
we want to make current slide equals one
we want to make sure that goes back to
one and then we're going to go slide
container just CSS we're not going to
animate this time we want it to happen
immediately and we want to happen behind
the scenes we want to make the margin
left zero okay so every time we animate
we bump up our number of our current
slide if it now equals our slides length
then we're going to go back to number
one that should work let's check it out
and I'm going to set our pause to one
second so this should happen faster
Oh slide contain cannot hear is not fine
right because I can't spell there go
slide container slide cannot you're
still not found what the heck
cannot type it there we go all right so
here we go we're sliding through every
one second and then we should know here
nice okay so once we got to the last one
we realize that we are on the last one
and we set this back to one and then we
went to margin left zero great and
that's going to get really annoying for
it to move that fast so now all we have
to do is add this we've taken these
three out check let's just do that mouse
enter in that pause part and we're done
with our slider this is actually going
to be a little trickier than we think so
let's go here slide container actually
we're going to do slider slider dot on
mouse enter we're going to pause slider
and then dot on Mouse leave we're going
to resume slider our start slider okay
now the thing is is we actually don't
have a way of pausing our slider right
now so we need to do is let's actually
make an interval this will be our thing
that we start and stop and let's make a
function for start slider and a function
for stop slider
so now I'm going to put this set
interval within my start slider function
interval equals set interval okay so now
all whenever I click start slider it's
going to store my interval in this guy I
had to define this outside of my
function because if I did vary interval
in here instead I can't access that
interval anywhere outside of the
function it's kind of within what's
called the scope interval only exists
within this function so now I can't talk
to it from outside so what I had to do
is I had to define interval here and now
I can reference interval is talking to
that guy so I can start slider and then
function stop slider is easy
stop slider is just going to clear the
interval and that's why I had to define
interval outside of my function because
I have to be able to clear it and I can
show you in a little bit why that
wouldn't work the other way so now we go
I have mice I called it pause slider
didn't it well we're going to call this
pause slider then let's call it stop so
now when I mouse enter over slider it's
going to stop it now my mouse leave it's
going to start it and guess what when I
hit when I stop it and it refreshes when
I save it and refreshes nothing happens
because start slider is never being
called so I need to hit the very end of
all things just start my slider now it
should work great so it's sliding
excellent now if I hover it should stop
sliding of course I'll probably need to
click on this okay if I hover there you
go it stopped
and now if I Mouse leave of course I
just called it mows leave okay let's try
this again it's paused let's pause it
make sure it's paused it is paused let's
hover and it should start up again
excellent so let's just once again cover
what we did to make sure it's not super
confusing
and I'm going to just I don't know what
I'm going to do with you I'm going to
just comment you out so that thing
doesn't slide all day alright so we made
a function start slider stop slider so
that way we could say on mouse enter
we're going to stop slider on Mouse
leave we're going to start slider and
then we define this interval thing here
let me go just for your learning about
JavaScript if we did interval here we
just made interval a new variable but
it's only going to stay within my
function so stop slider will not work
because when I hit clear interval it's
not going to know where to find interval
a function only has access to the
variables inside of it and the variables
up one level which are all these guys
it's not going to have AK it's not going
to have access to variables defined
inside of another function here let me
show you this in operation right here so
I'm going to save and I'm going to hover
interval is not defined it says because
it doesn't know what to do so when I try
to stop the slider it can't find
interval and so there's your problem so
we're just going to go there interval
we're just going to define it and not
give it any kind of value whatsoever and
now everybody else can talk to it we can
put values into it and we can mess with
the values that are there so there you
go that's how to build a jQuery slider I
hope it made sense feel free to watch it
again drop me some comments if there are
things that don't make sense have
yourself a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
