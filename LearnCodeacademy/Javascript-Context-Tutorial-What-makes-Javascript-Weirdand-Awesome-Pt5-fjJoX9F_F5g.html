breath in okay we are about to cover
context which is easily one of the most
complicated concepts to grasp with
JavaScript it's not actually a difficult
concept when you get it it makes sense
but grasping it and grasping how it
applies can be very difficult for
JavaScript developers especially if
you're starting off so I'm going to try
to get into it going to try to make it
as easy as possible but don't feel bad
if you've got to re-watch this video
multiple times it's just not that easy
to get the first time around
once again context is that is what the
value of this is for your code that is
running I'll just let the code do the
talking here let's go ahead and get this
console log nice and big here if I was
to console.log the value of this in my
root scope by default this is the window
object so if I was to console.log does
this equal window yes this equals window
so I could actually go very equals one
and console.log this dot a N equals one
I have no reason to do that in when I'm
working in the root scope I could go
window dot a equals one I could also
just go console.log a that also equals
one but that just shows you in the
default the root scope the context is
this I could also go function foo
console.log this and then let's run foo
and you'll see that that's also the
window object if you remember from the
scope video the scope has changed we now
have a child scope but the context is
still this now the reason why is because
by default a a function runs within the
scope of the object that it sits in so I
can also run it as window foo because if
you remember when you create something
in the root scope it's a part of the
window object whenever I run foo by
default it's going to run within the
context of the object that it sits on
that's why window is the default context
let me show you how that context
be different if I go vert off-screen an
object now and let's create a method or
a function on this foo is a function and
this will just console.log this so now
I'm going to run objects and now it's
console logging the object as the value
of this it's running AAB this equal
obtrusive alt and I keep saying by
default by default it runs with a
context of this value is the object that
that sits on now one of the tricky
things about context is that this value
can actually change depending on how you
call this foo function depending on who
runs it and by and how they're running
it the value of this can actually change
when the first that sounds stupid why
would you want the exact same code for
all the values to be different but the
next example I'll show you shows you
exactly why that's very useful real
quick I'll show you the three JavaScript
methods of changing context they are
call apply and bind I won't go too deep
into this but it's just important that
you know these are the three that do
that so basically I can go call foo call
window and now it's going to run object
foo but it's going to change the context
to window so now does this equal window
yes it does if I take that away and just
run foo does this equal window no it
does not so what I've done with call is
I've changed the context that this fires
in in the next if you give call more
than one argument say 1 2 3 then that's
the arguments that you're passing up
here so basically if I give it 1 one's
going to go up there 2 is going to go up
there 3 is going to go up there if I
need to pass arguments to the function
so you just go on and on and on with
call call and apply are basically the
exact same thing the only difference is
is apply only takes two arguments it
takes the new context and it takes an
array
a which are going to be all the
arguments up here so I give it an array
and now the first of the array goes
there the second of the array goes there
and the third of the array goes there so
call and apply are the exact same thing
bind is a little different takes the one
argument and what it does is it doesn't
actually execute your foo function like
call and apply do it returns a bound
function so I could go bare my bound foo
equals this and so now my bound foo is a
function that always executes foo with
the context of window so now every time
I run my bound foo it will console.log
this equals window true
so if I run my bound foo true if I go AB
foo then it's going to say false so true
when I run it here the context is window
false when I run it normally the context
is not window it's odd
so that's kind of how you change it
probably doesn't make sense as to why
you need to change it all that need all
that you need to know is that it can be
changed let me got let me show you now
how an actual real-world example of that
being a different value
let's go jQuery here your body on click
function o instead of doing a function
I'll just go aab jaao so now I'm going
to run Abdul when the body is clicked so
there you go and it says that the
context is not window when I run foo let
me see what is the context click on the
body and the context is the element that
was clicked on with JavaScript whenever
you set up an event listener on the
click element when I set up a click
listener on the body element and I run
that then it's going to run with the
context of the element that was clicked
that way I have access to it so now
whenever I run this I know which element
was clicked by the this object this
points to the body element in the Dom so
let me show you how this is actually
useful down here I have an L I let me
show you
the code I've ul with allies in it each
Li has been clicked zero times and we
want to increment this when you click on
the Li pretty simple so I'm going to go
Li on click function and now I'm going
to go let's so right now whenever I
click on an Li what I've done is I have
set up an Li listener so this listener
is on all lis and whenever I click on it
the this function that this value will
not be all L is that this value will
only be the element that was clicked so
there we go
I click and the first time you can see
that it's that Li if I were to click
this Li now this is the third Li if I
click here this is the second Li so what
I can do is I can go Li span HTML so let
me I'm going to actually go very current
times I'm going to grab the number of
times it's been clicked I actually have
to parse it has an integer because by
default in the HTML that zero is a zero
string it's not a zero number so I have
to parse it I have to get the HTML out
of that span parse it into a number and
then I'm going to go Li span again is
going to be current times plus one so if
I do this it's going to change all Li
spans that's not the desired effect I
want to only change the Li that got
clicked on so now I can actually use
this this points to the Li that got the
click let's find a span inside of that
Li which is where find is very useful
and let's give that HTML so I'm getting
the value when you click on this Li it's
going to find a span inside it's going
to grab that HTML value out of it parse
it into an integer and now same thing
right here and so then same thing I want
to find that same span and I want to
print the new incremented value in there
so that will now
only change the one I clicked on only
change the one I clicked on only change
the one I clicked on let me give you a
common problem that people run into now
that has to do with context let's go on
to my second example code my second
example code here is I've got a div with
a bunch of nasty HTML that I printed in
line I printed some Styles in line which
of course it's a terrible idea
idea this div is hidden it's got a
display:none on it and so I want to show
that div let's save that there we go
and so now what I'm going to do is on I
think that's called open div that's what
this button is called open div on click
I'm going to I'm going to do two things
here the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to grab this which is the
button that got the click open div and
I'm going to toggle the class to active
ah there you go there you go the class
active is going to toggle off and on so
then what I want to do is I want to find
what's the name of that div Oh div one
I'm now going to find div one and I'm
going to slide toggle that there we go
let's say some guy in the business
department said absolutely I cannot
toggle this class to green until it slid
out let's say there's something more
going on here there's ten different
animations and I had to wait until it
had slidden down to toggle this to green
so then what I have to do is I have to
slide it to toggle and I have to run a
callback and then after it slid then
this callback functional fire and then
I'm going to toggle this to active there
we go save the code run it slides out
fine but it doesn't toggle to active why
doesn't that toggle to active because
this is now pointing to div one this is
a callback to this event listener and
it's no longer firing in context to open
div it's
kind of like remember when we had that
scope naming conflict if I do vert a
equals 1 here and ver a equals 2 here
I've now created a name conflict now I
have no way of accessing this a that
just happened with this that just
happened with my context when this thing
calls this it's going to look and see
that my function already has a context
that context is div 1 so I have no way
of accessing at this there's there's two
ways to get around it you can get around
it with scope I do have access since
this was this function was created in
this scope here I have access to all the
parent scope variables so I can go very
self equals this I can create a variable
that variable all it does is point to
this and now I have access to self if I
look for self it's going to look in this
context ok self has not been created
let's look in my parent scope self has
been created it points to this which is
the open div and now it's going to work
there you go you can call this anything
you want some people call it underscore
self some people call it underscore this
some people will call it open div you
can really call it whatever you want as
long as it makes sense but that's kind
of how you get around it using scoping
creating a parent scope variable that
you have access to the other way around
it is you can actually bind this
function right here to always run within
the context of this so what you can do
is when I create this function I can go
bind this so that it creates the
function it runs bind on the function
and it returns that bound function to
the second argument of slide toggle so
now in this inside of this callback this
will always equal open div so that will
also work this that that this this that
hopefully you're not too confused by
that so that's the way you can do it
with bind the only disadvantage to using
bind is it's a lot less code
but I have no way of accessing this as
div one anymore because it has been
bound to where this always equals open
div you may have to watch this part
again to really get what just happened
but that's kind of your intro to context
I'm going to create one more video on
context where we get into the JavaScript
modular pattern it's kind of something
you'll want to know before you start
learning backbone j/s but let's go ahead
and close this up for now that's context
that's the weird and cool things about
javascript hope you enjoy the lesson
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
