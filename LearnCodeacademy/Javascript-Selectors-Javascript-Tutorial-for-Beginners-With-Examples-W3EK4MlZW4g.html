taking lots of that fun JavaScript code
we've been learning and we're going to
have more fun by actually applying it to
a real webpage I've got this kind of
really basic web page here and we're
going to be using javascript to real
time make some changes to it so here's
kind of some of the HTML elements that I
have going on I've got a couple
paragraph tags and h4 I have a UL with
some allies so let's use JavaScript to
real time change this page I'm going to
go to my console I've got it pretty big
and blown up because we're going to be
doing this whole lesson in the console
so the first thing to know about how you
interact with your HTML document here is
there's a document object on the page so
you can see this is an actual JavaScript
representation of my webpage it's called
the Dom the document object model and
that's basically how you access your
HTML and CSS through JavaScript and so
this document object model has an API
force it has some API methods we can
access I can go documents dot gets
elements by tag name so you notice I did
elements plural here because we can have
more than one element with the same tag
name and let's grab all of our
paragraphs P and I just need to enter
string in here can be single or double
quotes I'm going to look for anything
with a P tag and there you go I have an
array of two elements I have my first
paragraph tag in my second paragraph tag
how about we look for anything with an
h1 there you go there's my h1 so it
gives me an array and so then I can
actually do what we would do so let's
look at my P I can go array 0 which is
going to give me only the first one in
the array or I can actually save these
as a variable I can go there P tags
equals documents that gets elements by
tag name P there you go so now P tags
the variable equals these two awesome
and I can go first P tag equals P tags 0
so now my first P tag variable I can
pass these around just like I can any
other variables so now anytime I go
first P tag it's always going to point
to this pair
graff sweet let's look at some of these
other selector methods we got going on
here so I got documents document dot get
elements well you can actually just see
them if you type get right there you've
got get elements plural by class name
and that would be LM and by there you go
and that'll just be the class name you
want I have a class name done that's
this guy right here you see I have one
li we've done you can get element
singular by ID since there is only one
element allowed with each ID
I think this yeah this ul is called
checklist there you go so that's that
guy with ID of checklist and that's kind
of pretty much it now if you are using
anything ie 8 or newer definitely if
you're using IE 9 or newer there's a
great one called document dot query
selector which is awesome because then
you can just use any selector you want
just as you would with CSS so I can go
dot done anything with a class of done I
can do a hash tag and look for anything
with an ID hash tag checklist there we
go and document query selector will
always just give me the first thing that
comes up it will not search the entire
document oh just give me the first one
it finds if I want everything then I go
query selector all and then I'll just
search for P tags and that will just
give me any paragraph tags right there
in NR a so those two are cool and you
know I mentioned that you can't use this
in all browsers one of the quirks to
JavaScript
just like CSS is newer browsers support
newer features older browsers do not
support them so there's a great website
called can I use com you can see right
here I typed in query selector and I can
see what all browsers supports what I'm
wanting to use the only one that has
partial support here is IE 8 it's not
going to work with css3 selectors
because IE 8 does not support those and
also html5 tags you know tags like main
and footer you know might have some
trouble with that so you'll always want
to test your JavaScript code if you
don't get a full green light
on the browsers that you're supporting
stinks I know and it's always ie that's
a problem but hey what are you going to
do that's the internet things change so
there's basically your document
searching methods so let's do some fun
stuff here let's say I want to change
the HTML for this paragraph did I call
that first P tag yes so first P tag
still points to this paragraph so now I
can go first P tag dot enter HTML and I
can actually change the inner HTML
equals new paragraph now it's not really
a new paragraph but new paragraph
contents there you go if I could spell
content in new paragraph content there
goes so real time I just changed it
let's say I want to actually add a new
element inside of there a new paragraph
strong content I can actually type text
and it will turn it into HTML tags which
is pretty cool I can also do stuff with
classes so let's look at that li right
there that's got done so let's call that
very Li equals documents dots man I'm
not typing document very well tonight
you're just going to have to bear with
me on that one document query selector
I'm only going to do query selector
because I just want the first one with a
done class so there we go so Li now
equals that guy so I can go li dot class
name and there you go my class name is
done so let's go class name equals
nothing so now my class equals nothing
I have no classes assigned and the
strikethrough is gone so let's go li
class name let's add done back there we
go let's add a second class name to it
done also done let's say I have another
class called also done it didn't do
anything because that there's no CSS for
that let's say I want to set it back to
just done let's say I want to take I
have an amount of classes I don't know
how many classes I have let's say class
name is done also done also so let's say
Li dot class name has a lot of classes I
don't exactly know what all they are
I just want to add a new one to it I can
go Li class name let me go and clear
this out here li class name equals Li
dot class name so let's take let's say
it equals what it already is plus let's
add a space and add a new one special
there we go so now it's going to say hey
let's it now equals what we equaled
before plus this more stuff so now
that's my class list right there pretty
cool well add a class name equals
nothing all classes are gone again so
that's that's pretty nice it's kind of a
pain in the rear to do a lot of stuff
with classes beyond that if you want to
do a lot of adding removing classes like
let's say I wanted to just remove also
done let me actually copy and paste this
and add this back in Li dot class name
equals there you go let's say I just
want to remove also done well there's
kind of like some hacky ways you can do
it I can go li dot class name equals Li
class name dot replace let's say I want
to replace also done with which is the
second argument replace is kind of cool
you can do do replace on anything that's
text strings I'm going to replace this
with nothing so there we go so now I
have an extra space in there but that's
still going to work in browsers it's
kind of hacky and that it's not clean
because then if I added another class
and removed it ten times I get a whole
lot of spaces in there but that's going
to work and so if you want to do a lot
more besides just a little bit of adding
and changing you'll want to look into
jQuery I've got a full jQuery course
jQuery makes it really easy for you to
do a lot of this stuff and I'll leave it
at that
I'll put some links for jQuery out there
let's look at maybe one more thing let's
go ahead and look at okay so there's
this class loot there's this class class
list thing you can see if I do class
list I actually have a list of all my
classes one two three it's an actual
array now if I go to can I use and type
class list it's kind of depressing
it's not supported for ie8 or ie9 it's
not fully supported with IE 10 or even
IE 11 so that's coming classlist is
going to be really cool because you can
do stuff like classless add new so now i
can look at li class list and it's got
new super cool I can go class list
remove let's take new away and now if I
look at class list new is gone so better
support is coming to JavaScript natively
but if you want to do it in the meantime
you're going to want to use a library if
you're using jQuery it's super easy I
would just do something like this I'd
look up my class for done and I do add
class new and that's how jQuery works
I'll leave it for that I've got a whole
series on jQuery which you'll love um
and that's pretty much it there's you
know that's how you'll select stuff
that's how you'll add stuff you can also
navigate up all let's look at that li
again so I can go Li dot parent node
parent element and element and that's
going to be the UL that it's a part of
so let's say if I want ul Li dot parent
element dot parent element that's going
to be going up the tree some more so now
I'm at main and you can see main has the
UL in it and that you will has the Li in
it let's say I'm on this Li and I want
to find then this guy right here well
then I can go li dot parent element dot
children there you go dot children and
that's going to be all the children of
my parent element now once again
children's got a quirk to it it works
safely ie 9 plus ie 8 back can have some
quirks but that works really well so
then I can go li parent element children
zero and that's going to be that apples
guy so let's say I want to change u
equals what will you be Frank
there you go so now Frank oranges
bananas and watermelon so that's enough
on selectors for now then the next video
we're going to cover how you can
actually listen to what the user does
and change stuff real time so hope this
lesson helped you out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
