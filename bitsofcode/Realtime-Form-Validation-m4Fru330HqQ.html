you how I recreate this registration
form and it has real time validation so
as you can see when I hover over an
inputs all the requirements for that
inputs show up and as I start typing I
get feedback on whether I'm fulfilling
or not fulfilling the requirements so if
I start typing I can now get feedback on
it
and if I try and submit the form and one
of the requirements isn't completely
fulfilled I get this tooltip which shows
a list of all the things that are wrong
with that particular inputs so let's try
something that works so last week on my
blog I wrote about form validation and
all the different techniques that you
can use for it so if you want to look at
that article you can check it out here
so I'm going to be using a lot of the
techniques I discussed there so you
might want to check it out first
but so that's it let's get started
so this is the HTML behind the page as
you can see we've got this form and in
the form we've got three inputs so for
the username the password and then the
password repeats so the way it works is
that we just have the label and then
within the label we've got like this
band which is the actual label and then
the input itself and then this unordered
list of the input requirements so at the
moment the JavaScript's our own custom
JavaScript completely empty so it's just
the HTML and CSS and if I switch over
you can see how it works so if I hover
over or interact with any inputs the
input requirements show so I'm doing
that with just CSS I'll show you how it
works
so I go down here so I've just put a
transition on the max height so I'm just
changing it from zero to just any large
number that we'll be able to fit the
info requirements so um for some reason
it doesn't work with height only works
with max height so that's how I'm doing
that so if I go back here and I start
typing you can see that as soon as I hit
three characters it shows that it's
valid and the reason it's doing that is
because if we go back to the inputs I
put this minimum length here so that
means that the in bill the browser in
built is actually just checking to make
sure that it fits that requirement but
it doesn't it doesn't affect if I do
special characters so even though I'd
routes it here there's no way for the
browser to know that that's actually a
requirement yet so there's one way we
can do it putting in the HTML we can use
the pattern attribute and the way that
works is that we just put in a regular
expression here so to just tell the
browser what kind of characters should
match this particular input but we're
not gonna do that we're gonna actually
do it with JavaScript and there are two
reasons we're gonna do that so number
one is that if we use that pattern
attributes then we're gonna have to put
all the requirements and that just one
reg
expression and that means that if any of
the requirements fail the user is just
going to get that one error message so
they're not gonna know which particular
one so if you go down here to the import
requirements for the password we can use
one regular expression I think anyway to
do all of these requirements but then if
the user puts doesn't put a lowercase
letter for example they're just gonna
get the same error message saying that
it didn't match this particular pattern
that we needed so you can still use the
pattern attribute as a fallback if you
want but we're just going to do it with
JavaScript for now
okay so we're gonna create a custom
validation prototype which will handle
the validation for each input so what is
gonna do is four things it's going to
first keep track of what needs to be
checked for each particular inputs to
make sure it's valid so if we go back
here for the username we've got these
two requirements but for password we've
got these so each each input has its own
validation checks that we need to do so
it's gonna keep track of that first and
then second if we find any problems with
the inputs we want to be able to keep
track of all the error messages for that
particular input and then third we want
to create a function to be able to
easily add error messages to that
storage and then finally we want a
function to be able to retrieve those
error messages once we're done and then
display it in that browser tooltip we
saw at the beginning so I'm just gonna
get started
validation so I'm just gonna initialize
it with this empty array and this array
is where we're gonna keep all the error
messages so once we've had had this
function now we can create the prototype
so first of all we need that function to
add the invalidity then we need a
function to retrieve the in validities
and then finally a function to check the
validity of that particular input okay
so I'm just gonna go here so this
function we need to pass the message to
it and then what we're going to do is
push to the array
message simple and then to get the
mother disease this disease join so
seeing as it's an array but what we
needed to be is one simple string so I'm
going to add a full stop to each of them
and then add a line break and then we're
going to return it and then check
validity I'll come back to
so I'm gonna start with this username
input so a lot of things I'm gonna do at
first is gonna be very inefficient but
then afterwards I'm going to refine it
and make it more easily extendable to
the other inputs but first of all I'm
just gonna work with this username input
so if we look at this check validity
function what we want to do is make sure
that the these two requirements are
satisfied so we can do that by simply
checking the input value and matching it
against either a regular expression or
for the first one just checking if it's
3 character as long if we go back here
so what we're gonna do is pass it the
inputs so if we say if input value is
less than 3 then what we need to do is
two things so first of all add validity
so we're gonna say so that's one thing
but next what we want to do is add a
class to each of these elements so if
it's incorrect we want to add a class of
invalid to it and if it is correct or if
it is valid rather add a class of valid
to it so here we're doing the invalid
states so first of all we want to get
the element that we need to add that
other classes to so now we're selecting
that particular element and then what
we're gonna say is
and valid and then just in case it was
valid before let's remove the valid one
so let's go else let's copy this so
let's just switch that around right okay
that's cool so then we've done the first
one and then let's check for the second
one
so check to make sure that it only
contains letters and numbers and so to
do this we're going to do a regular
expression so what we want to do is
check to see if it matches anything that
does not that is not a letter or a
number 88
so this stop a divinity let's see
only letters and numbers out and then
let's copy that
and change it to this how did I miss
that
Oh
okay
so let's go down here so what we need to
do now is check so every time someone is
typing in that input we need to do this
perform these checks so first of all
what we're going to do is get using your
name input so username inputs so I'm
gonna add a sub property which is custom
validation and set equals to a new
instance of this custom validation and
prototype and then we're gonna add an
event listener so user name and put a so
we've added the event listener so
function so what we want to do next is
do a check validity on it so customer
validation check validity and then just
pass this particular input okay so let's
see if it works so if I'm typing that's
fine three characters and then if I do
that it goes off so great so it works
okay so that works but like I said
before there are many things here that
really need to be separated so that can
easily be extended to other inputs
because right now this doesn't really
work for it only works for this
particular inputs and it's not really
the best way for example this check
validity function that a lot of things
are being repeated here so adding the
class removing the class and all of
those things and really we should just
be able to this whole prototype should
really be agnostic of any particular
input so we're gonna change some things
so first of all here we can see that
we're doing the same sort of thing so
we're doing three things here we're
first checking if the input is valid and
then adding an error message or changing
classes on that particular element so we
can change this so what I'm gonna do
here is create a an array username T
checks
so I'm creating an array of all the
checks that we need to perform on the
username element so first we're gonna
have a function to say is invalid
function so first one we're checking if
the input the value the length is less
than three so what we want to do is
return its invalid if the input the
value that length is less than three so
this function is invalid would be true
if this is true as well so the next
thing we need is the error message if it
is so I'm gonna do T the message
so here I've just said this input needs
to be three characters long so let's cut
that and put that here and then finally
we need the element that we're going to
that we're going to change the class on
so here put that here so now I'm just
gonna do the same for the next one so
now what we can do is actually remove
this oops
and then just loop through this array so
so first of all let's see if it's
invalid so is invalid it's equals to
your the name validity checks I dot is
invalid checking against the influence
and then if it is invalid what we want
to do is add in validity message named
vanity checks I dot and validity message
to pass that message and then what we
want to do is do the classes so if it is
invalid then dot elements add class list
rather invalid else
okay so we've cleaned that up a little
bit let's just double check to see if it
all still works so refresh the page
start typing okay so there's something
wrong
so here
okay cool so now it's working again cool
so here we've now chained abstracted
this out here but we're still calling
username validity checks within this
custom validation function and like I
said this custom validation prototype
needs to be completely agnostic of which
particular input it is so what I'm gonna
do is actually here this entity checks
set it to an empty array so when we're
initializing this down here new custom
validation what we want to do is set
which array should be this but it's each
X here so if I copy this don't edit each
x equals two and then set it to that
array so that means here what we're
calling username validity checks what we
should actually be doing is calling this
dot validity checks so let's change that
okay so we've done that now let's just
double check everything still working
great
okay so the next thing we want to do is
change this event listener what we want
to do instead is just add an event
listener to all of the inputs so what we
can do is if it's equals all instead so
all inputs but not the ones that are
types of it okay so for inputs so let's
copy this the add event listener
Hyup and so instead of user name input
we want to do this so let's remove that
and I died event a snackie up and
there's no validation okay cool and then
what we want to do is do all the cost of
validation for the other ones so here
we've got the username input so let's
repeat this for the other two very
password in okay so what I've done here
is the three inputs here and then for
each of them we've got the we're
initializing this prototype so cost of
validation and then also adding validity
checks so we haven't actually added
these arrays yet so I'm gonna do that
right now okay so I've added the three
arrays and I'm just gonna talk you
through how I've done it so for the
password validity checks we need to
first check if the value the length of
the value is less than eight and or
greater than eight and less than 100 and
here we're checking that it contains at
least in numbers worth trying to see if
the input the value don't match matching
of a number is not doesn't exist and
we're doing the same for a lower case
than upper case and then we're checking
one of these special characters must be
present as well and then for the
password repeats the only check we're
doing is to make sure that the value has
to be equals to the password value
let's try so first of all that's done
see I'm adding a number or a special
character adding a number adding an
uppercase and then that works okay so
we're almost done we just need to make a
few changes so as you can see for this
password repeat validity check there's
no input requirement here so I just want
to make a slight modification to this
function so to first check if there is
actually an element that we want to add
or remove the classes to so I'm just
gonna quickly do that
so if requirement element does exist
then we do if is valid and if it's not
let's change that and then all we need
to do is check for that here okay so
that's better so we've got the banana
see checks here and then we've got that
so all this kind of works but what we
want to do is at the moment if things
don't work so if I do that and I press
submit we're still just getting we're
still just getting this one error
message we're not getting all the error
messages so we're never actually calling
this getting validities function and
passing it to set custom validity on
that input but what we want to do is
make sure that only happens when you
press submit so we have to do another
event list now so we're going to sort of
repeat here so what I'm going to do is
change this check validity and created
its own function so up here and it's
gonna be passed an input so let's move
this up here first
and then just go check for energy this
so on submit what we want to do is loop
through all the inputs and then to
perform this check validity on them okay
so this isn't going to totally work yet
but let's just try and see what happens
so okay I click Submit we're still not
we still haven't called that get in
validities function yet so first of all
we need to reset the invalidity stop
custom validation and then perform the
check policy again and then if we find
actual in validities doubling is or
equals to zero
and let's also make sure that it's not
empty not equals to empty right so so
this is if we don't find any invalidity
to just an empty re so this is I need to
function then you can call to set what
happens to set this tooltip here so else
so if there are still get the message so
now we're going to actually call the
custom with validation don't get invited
to T's I set it to the message and then
input top set custom value T to that
message message calls tune okay so let's
see I go back here refresh
I type that's fine if I do that but
that's not so now we are getting all the
error messages so first if it needs to
be between eight and hundred at least
one numbers required at least one upper
case that says required and special
characters so let's see if I do more all
right let's do something that will
actually pass but then here it doesn't
pass so if I press submit this password
needs to match the first one and if I go
back here
and I start adding special characters
submit only letters and numbers are
allowed okay so that's pretty much it so
just to go over everything again so
we're starting with this custom
validation prototype so it has the in
validities array which is all the error
messages then the validity checks is the
array of checks that we need to perform
on that input then we've got these three
functions so once you add an error
message to that array want to retrieve
all the messages in that array and
convert it to a string and then we have
the final one which is to loop through
all the validity checks for that
particular cost of validation and also
change the class on that element to see
whether it's valid or invalid
so here we've got the array of WG checks
for each of the inputs and then here
check this input so I think I'm gonna
change this to check input instead of
check validity because that probably
makes a bit more sense so if we go back
here check input okay so here we're
setting up custom validation and setting
up which array of validity check should
be for that particular input and then
finally whenever people interact with
each particular input we've got will do
performing the validity checks and then
also on submit performing the validity
checks and also setting the customer
editing so we're done thanks for
