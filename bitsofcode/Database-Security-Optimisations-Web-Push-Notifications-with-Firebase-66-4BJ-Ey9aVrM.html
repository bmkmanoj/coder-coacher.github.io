security and some optimizations on our
database so if you remember if we just
open up the console right here we're
getting this firebase warning which is
saying that we are trying to access the
database by indexing on a particular key
but we haven't told firebase stats so
they can actually perform some
optimizations for that so if we go back
to our main J's file this check
subscription function yeah so here we're
trying to get the reference to the user
subscriptions' so what we're doing is
taking all the list of tokens and then
ordering it by the UID and then just
checking to see if it's equal to the
current user ID so whenever we're using
this order by child thing we need to
tell firebase that were planning to
query the database based on this
particular key so they can perform some
optimizations on it and if we want we
can specify our rules here in our local
file the database room JSON but I'm
going to do it actually directly in the
firebase console so under the database
here if we just go to rules we can see
all the rules that apply to our
application at the moment so I'm just
doing it here because we'll be quicker
so these are the rules that are
specified by default and what this just
says is that nobody can read or writes
to are anything in the database without
being authenticated so without being
signed in and this is kind of fun
because at least it's not completely
open to everyone but we can make it a
lot better and a lot more secure so the
first thing we want to do is take care
of the optimizations part which is to
tell firebase to index on particular
keys so instead of just having this
global read and write I'm gonna separate
it based on the notes in our database so
that's actually how we structure the
firebase rules so we have a node that's
called tokens and then we have a node
that's called notifications
but now I'm just gonna paste this for
both of them but for tokens I want to
add the index on attributes so here we
just have an index on and then what you
want to do is specify an array of keys
that you wants to index data on and and
what we want is UID but we also want
token because in our admin like the part
where we're doing sending the push
notifications were also clearing by
token so I'm gonna add that as well so
let's just publish and hopefully when we
refresh we'll see that we're no longer
getting this error okay great so next we
want to do the security bits and because
of the way our data is organized and
because of the way that we are querying
the data what I can't do right now is
just say that users can only read the
node which has their own particular
token which is what I want to do ideally
and you can go and read up more about
how firebase security rules work you
want more detail about that but so the
best I can do right now is just
validates that whenever a new token is
being added to the database it has to be
the one that corresponds to the current
users ID so what I'm gonna do is create
another node here and this is my array
of token so what I want to do is target
a specific token so we can do that by
using this variable here and then what I
want to do is add a validate option so
instead of read and write so better they
just checks before anything is added to
the database it validates that it
matches this particular requirements so
what I want to say is that first of all
whenever something's added to the tokens
node it has to have both the token and
the UID
so I can do that by just saying new data
don't have children then you pass an
array of the keys that you wanted so I
wanted you ID and I want children and
I'm gonna add just like a third one that
just says rubbish so that we can
actually test to see that this works so
if I go back to the application say I
unsubscribe then I try and subscribe
again oh let me refresh first this
should fail hopefully yeah so it says
permission denied and this is because
it's not passing this third thing that I
said that needs to be passed so if I go
back and I remove that that should work
but it's not enough to just say you
should have these things I also want to
make sure that the UID is equals to the
current users ID and I can do that by
just saying so the new data but child
and then I pass you ID and then the
value of that must be equals to and if I
want to get the UID of the currently
authenticated user I just have to do off
dot new idea
so let's publish this and let's
subscribe again this should work this
time gap but what I'm gonna do to just
test to see if this doesn't work what
I'm gonna do is go back to my code and
just kind of change it to make sure that
the UID being saved is actually focus so
if I go back to here this is where I'm
saving the token instead of that I'm
just gonna write nonsense Oh
so if I go back here and I refresh again
and this time I try and subscribe I
should get another error because the UID
being passed is not equals to the
current users ID so just go back save
that okay so for the notifications what
I want to do is just validate that the
things that we need to exist actually
exist so I'm just gonna copy this
taste it here change this to
multiplication and all I need to do is
just check to see the things that I'm
looking for are actually existing so I
can just pass the user
I need a message and I think it was
profile image or user profile image yeah
so we can publish this and next time I
want to create a notification let's try
and let's delete this part and go back
to our application to just test to see
if this works and just type concerns
try and send and we get permission
denied because the things that need to
be passed aren't being passed like go
back at it again
save again refresh and you can see that
everything set we go back to our data
well we deleted of course so that's
pretty much it for firebase security
rules even though I wrote all the stuff
here just for ease I think it's still
best to have it locally on file so I'm
just gonna do this and then when we
deploy our application these rules will
override whatever was manually entered
in the console so that's pretty much it
we've created this really simple
notification app and we've done it
completely using firebase for our
back-end so we haven't had to create a
completely separate like server-side
application so hopefully this was useful
to you I hope you've learned a lot about
firebase and how the whole firebase
functions and everything works and
there's way more to fire these functions
than just what I've shown here so
definitely go and check out their
documentation and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
