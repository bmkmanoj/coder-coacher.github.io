JavaScript array methods so these are
methods that we can use with instances
of arrays so as you can see here there
are very many we can use these are all
the methods here so I'm going to break
them up into three groups and so in this
video I'm going to go over these mutator
methods so these are methods that will
modify their way as you can see here so
whenever these methods are used they're
going to actually modify the original
array so i have this directory which has
all these examples so these are the
mutator ones and the others will come
later so i'm going to have all these
examples we're going to be using this
array to test everything with so
everything is going to be on my github
so links will be below so let's get
started
so the first method we're going to cover
is pop and what this does is it removes
the last element from any array so for
example we've got this rappers array
which has a few rappers and at the
moment I'm just console logging all of
that but what we can do is right here we
can call a pers pub and as you can see
here Eminem is the last one but if i
refresh now it's gone and what it does
is it actually returns the element that
was removed so if I did something like
last rapper so then I copy this save and
then I refresh and then you can see that
that's what has been returned
so next we have shift and this is kind
of the opposite to pop so whereas pop
removes the last element from the array
shift removes the first element from the
array so if we go to shift as you can
see first which is console logging
everything so here we can just add
rockridge dog shift we refresh you can
see that Kanye was removed and then
similarly again we can go home first
rapper and then we can just lock that as
well and then you can see that that's
what's being logged
so the next method is push and into
something that you probably have used
before and what it does is that it adds
elements to the end of an array so we
had the wrappers away again and let's
say we want to add more so we can just
do rappers push and i'm andré 3000 so
one more console logging wrapper is now
you can see that it's been added and the
value that returns is the length of the
new erase what we can do is and you
refresh you can now see that we've got
six in the new array and besides just
adding a single value we could add more
value so you can also add mass or Vig
whoops and it will have it will do the
same thing but what we can also do is
combine it with the apply method and
actually push a new array into that
array so let's just give an example
let's say some Nigerian rappers just put
this could you do yeah so what we can do
here is do a raid put a time to push the
apply so two rappers we now want to add
the Nigerian rappers so now if we
consult or log rappers we're going to
get an array that includes this other
Nigerian rappers array so let's refresh
and here we go
so next we have on shift and how shift
is the opposite to pulp on shift is kind
of like the opposite to push so I'm just
going to show I'm going to copy what i
have here and go to ownership and what
it does is instead of pushing the new
elements to the end of the array is
going to push it to the beginning so I'm
just going to change push to unship here
push and we're going to see the
difference so just a channel so where
you can see now is that the new value so
this to the first ones and then
including this to the second one are
being added to the start of the array
instead of the end
so the reverse method is pretty simple
and what it does is just it reverses the
positions of elements in the array so
here we have obviously the rapid array
and all we can do is call rappers don't
you first so if i go to rewrite I HTML I
we can just see that we plot the same
array but just listed in the reverse
order and the value that this returns is
just the reversed array so we could
easily or simply just do the same thing
and say reversed upwards equals to rapid
start reverse and then go and we're just
going to get the same thing
so next we have the sort method and what
that does is it sorts the elements
within the rate according to some
function that we might pass to it first
we have we can have a default sort so
for example if I do short it will by
default sorted according to the unicode
code points so this will be
alphabetically so if we go to short we
can see that it's being sorted
alphabetically but what could make it
actually useful as first to sort it
according to some whatever parameter
that we want to so we can have a
function so what I'm going to do is
rewrite this as an object so I can have
multiple parameters for each rapper so
I'm just going to have their name and
then a rating that I want to pass to
them so out of a hundred I'm just going
to copy so I'm just going to give them a
rating according to how good they are so
Drake and jay-z mmm 90 maybe 70 and
Eminem is obviously the best we're not
here to argue about that but ok so now
we have this new array and what we want
to do is sort it according to rating so
what we do is call fav rapper stop sort
and then we pass it a function with two
parameters so the way this works is that
the function goes through each of these
and then it compares two pairs together
so for example this can be a and this
will be B and as it moves down this will
not be a and this will not be be so what
it does in this function is what we have
to do is tell them whether we want to
keep a in this position or switch it
with B and the way we do that is if we
want a to be as a lower index so if you
want to keep it in this
shin and make it technically higher in
the position um so closer to zero we say
we return a negative number whereas if
we want to say this should be here and
before it we return a positive number
and if we want everything to stay the
same we return 0 so it can be a couple
bit complicated to get your head around
but let's just show how so why when I
say is this age our preaching is going
to them be reaching so we want a to be
first so seeing us we're ordering a by
region we want a to be higher so we're
going to do the term minus one so I
should be first but if b dot reaching is
greater than a dot reaching then we want
to return a positive number so i'm going
to say one so what we're saying is these
should be first and then we should just
return 0 if everything should be the
same so let's try this console dot log
save rapid refresh so now we can see mmm
is first because he's obviously the best
then we've got Kanye Jay Z Drake and
designer so that's kind of the way it
works we can just sort according to
whatever whatever parameters that we
actually want to sort instead of just
simple alphabetical or like in America
so next we have the splice method and
what this does is it adds and or remove
elements from an array so the method
takes three arguments so first of all
the index of which we want to start
cutting so start index then the number
of items you want to actually remove
from beret remember to delete and then
finally um what we want to replace those
elements were so items to replace with
okay so let's say we want to replace
jay-z with some things so what we can do
those wrappers dots slice the index out
which you want to start so jay-z which
is the second so too and we only want to
replace one item so we're going to put
one and then what we want to replace it
with Andre 3000 so if i refresh now we
can see that that's been replaced so we
may not only want to replace one item we
want it might want to do more so let's
say we want to replace jay-z and
designer so we can say we're going to
place two and then let's add whiz kid
and then we've replaced that and this
method is going to return the items that
were deleted so we can say and then here
and then we have an array of the ones
that were removed so besides actually
replacing element within the array we
can just you also use supplies to insert
and the way we can do that is just by
having this number be 0 so this like I
said before these are the number of
items that we want to delete from the
array so what we can do is just have
that be 0 and then what it will do is
insert all these elements at this index
so let's say refresh again again and
here you can see that we've just added
these two new elements to the array
without deleting any of the original
elements
okay so for the last two these are new
es6 methods the first one is phil and
what this does is it fills elements
within an array with a value that we
choose so it has three arguments first
is what we want to fill with so weber
string however it is that we want to
fill with then we have the index at
which we want to start filling and then
the index at which we want to end
filling so for example um this starts on
ended decks are optional so let's try
something so if you want to just replace
everything in this array with eminem
because he's the best we've refreshed
that we can see everything has just been
replaced but let's say we only want to
we only want to start replacing from
jay-z so from to hear okay I need let's
say we only want to replace both Drake
and jay-z you say two and then we say
four because the end index is the point
at which it stops so it doesn't actually
include that so if we go here then we
can see all right we did jay-z and
designer but same thing basically and
the value that this returns is the new
modified array so will be essentially
the same as rappers but we can just say
new array
and oops will be the exact same thing
and finally another new es6 method is
copy within and what it does is kind of
complicated it copies a sequence of
elements within an array to another
position within the same array so for
example we might want to copy kanye
west's to jay-z so we want the new era
to be Kanye West drake kanye west again
designer mmm so the method takes three
arguments so first of all the index that
you want to copy 2 and X 2 then second
where you want to start copying from so
and then where you want to end so and so
for example like I said we want to copy
a can us to jay-z's what we would do is
rappers don't copy within and copy too
so we want to copy to jay-z and that's
index of 2 I mean want a copy from Kanye
West's o0 c ya so as you can see here we
now have that copy to their we can also
use negative numbers if you want to copy
if we want to start counting from the
end so for example if you want to say we
want to copy from mm to kanye west's so
where we want to copy to we want a copy
to kanye west which is 0 and where we
want to copy from is Eminem which will
be negative 1 and then you can see
and finally if we specify copy index we
can do something like let's say we want
a copy Kanye West and Drake to jay-z and
designer so the way we can do that is so
we're copying to jay-z like you said so
we're going to put a 2 is where we're
starting from and then we're starting
from Kanye West and then we're ending at
drink or we're ending at Drake so we
have to put two so if we go back here
where we can see now is that we've
copied Kanye West and we've copied Kanye
West and Drake to what was previously
jay-z and designer I don't really know
when we're going to be when you would
need to use this but it's handy to have
anyway so that's it for the mutator type
of JavaScript array methods like i said
i'm going to go over feature ones in
future videos you can find this
repository on my github I'm gonna put
links below but that's it so thanks for
watching so in this video I'm going to
show you how i recreate this
registration form and it has real time
validation so as you can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
