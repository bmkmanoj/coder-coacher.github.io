you how we can use firebase functions
which is this new feature that firebase
is introduced where you can write
server-side code basically in your
application and I'm gonna show how we
can use it to create this push
notifications app so all this does is
it's a really simple app and you can see
it's probably a bit useless as well all
you can do is type in the notification
you want and you can say tempers on the
type nonsense can send it and should get
some notification so you can see here
everyone has been subscribed gets a
notification if you want to follow along
as I'm making this application you can
go to the github repository at the URL
that's right here make sure you go to
the start branch and just clone that and
then you can get started and follow
along so here we have just the basic
standard repository just have some HTML
CSS images and let's just go through
what is here so as you can see it's just
a basic HTML page of course all we have
here is a header and this is where we're
gonna start actually adding content a
footer and I'll add links for that later
and you'll notice that we have included
the firebase SDK and we have included
using this weird notation here and
basically this just will include
firebase so when we use the firebase CLI
or automatically add it for us and when
it's hosted on fire face will be
automatically added so we don't have to
download anything the SDK will already
be there also included the main
JavaScript file so we can see what that
looks like here we haven't really done
anything here is just like the comments
I've just included the main things were
going to be using so firebase
authentication firebase messaging and
then the database so here you can see
the images and then I just have like a
basic we said and basic CSS you're
interested in that kind of stuff you can
go through that but we're not really
gonna discuss that right now so the
first thing we want to do is actually
create our firebase project so let's do
that real quick
can just go to your console if you
already signed up
and we just want to create a new project
so I'm just gonna call it simply a
device yes that's what it's all about
you guys at Nigeria because that's where
I am and create project so now I'm in
the brand new project and we don't
really need to do anything now I'm gonna
go back to the actual repository so I'm
just gonna open up the terminal and we
want to initialize this project as being
part of firebase and if you don't
already have firebase dev tools just do
NPM install manage the firebase tools
and I already have it installed so I'm
not gonna do that right now
but you can just do that real quick if
you don't already have it then what we
want to do is firebase in it so we want
to just set up this project as a
firebase project so I just press Enter
so I asked up a bunch of things to
actually set up the project so we're
just gonna go through that right now
could increase the phone just in case
you can't see okay there we go
so we asked of if we want to use all of
these things and we do you want to use
the database host functions I'm hosting
so just press Enter so now it's gonna
check all the projects that we have and
yeah I have a bunch of products but we
just want to go and pick what we already
chose so simply notifying there's gonna
ask us what rules what file you want to
use for these evasion rules I just do
the default there we'll create one for
us if it's also setting up functions and
yeah we want to start installing all the
dependencies for functions which we'll
get to later now so it's gonna do that
there's gonna ask us for money use for
public directory so we just want to use
the route so I'm gonna do that
configure as a single page app you know
and we already have index.html so make
sure you don't overwrite it so just
person n and that's pretty much it it's
work complete here so I'm gonna close
this and you can just see what has been
created for us so we already have
indexed H and a firebase JSON which just
has a bunch of the configuration what we
want for firebase so it says where we're
starting from hosting the database where
that is all of that it also created a
404 page for us and firebase RC file
there's a bunch of information about
this you can go on firebase
documentation to find outs but I'm just
gonna go through this real quick we have
the functions which we'll come to later
so this is where we're gonna write all
the code for the notification the
server-side part of it so now we can
just serve our application to see what
we have let's go to view interpreter
terminal and just run firebase server
and then it says we can go to localhost
5000 so let's do that
so here almost 5000 so here we can see
our lovely application well it just has
is like the headline tagline and that's
pretty much it we can see that
everything works and now we can actually
start building stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
