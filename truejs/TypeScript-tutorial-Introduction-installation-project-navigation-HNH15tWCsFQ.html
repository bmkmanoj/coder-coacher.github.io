fundamentals where you're going to learn
how to use typescript to bring your
JavaScript development to the next level
you would agree that your code can
easily become really messy as a
developers we of course want our code to
be maintainable and easily extendable
that's why typescript can become an
essential tool in our javascript tool
belt
what is typescript typescript is a type
superset of JavaScript that compiles to
plain JavaScript javascript is
dynamically typed language and of course
it brings both good and bad
we know that variables can hold any type
of object during the runtime of our
program which means that types are
determined on the fly sometimes we enjoy
implicit type coercion when a comparin
string to a number but another side to a
coin is that it becomes really difficult
to ensure that proper types are passed
without extensive number of tests for
enterprise scale applications which can
have thousands or tens of thousands
lines of code it becomes really hard to
maintain such a project taking into
consideration that multiple contributors
are involved before jumping into
typescript details let's make sure that
we have everything that is necessary to
work with typescript so the main part
will be no GS installation which you can
download for your specific platform from
node.js org another thing will be yarn
which is new dependency management
system don't be scared by this new tool
it is based on NPM which means our
workflow will not be very different
my editor of choice is Visual Studio
code the interesting part is that the
actual editor is written in typescript
and of course it has a great
support for this language let's make
sure that we have everything that is
necessary in order to start working with
typescript first of all we will check if
we have note installed on our machine in
terminal please type node - V to see the
current version if you are having
problems with this step please go back
to know jazz that org in order to
install version of no GS for your
platform from here now on we can use NPM
which is no package manager for
installation of modules on our machine
so we will install yarn which is going
to be our global modules we going to
have to use a sudo command here so sudo
npm install - g for global yarn from
here we are going to use yarn in order
to install packages and the reason for
that is it is the latest package manager
and it's definitely is optional but i
just want to introduce you to the latest
and greatest in javascript world so we
will do yarn global add typescript it
was pretty fast less than a second i
will tell you the truth that it is such
a little time because I have installed
no typescript before and the benefit of
yarn is that if it caches modules so you
don't have to download the whole thing
again so that's why each mod it is much
faster than NPM let's see what is the
version of our typescript compiler that
we just installed so we'll type
typescript compiler TSC
P to see the version of our typescript
which is to that 2.2 I will use Visual
Studio code for this course and let's
see if our if we can create our first
typescript file so I open this brand new
project and we'll create main dot TS and
we can see right away that Visual Studio
code recognizes this file as a
typescript so let's try type in
something we will do VAR a which is
equals ABC and right now it looks very
much like just any regular JavaScript
but if we hover over the variable name
we can see this VAR a semicolon string
which is showing us the type of this
variable so what we are going to do now
we will create couple more files to see
how easy it is to navigate typescript
project with visual studio support so
our first file will have name 1 dot d s
and second one as you would guess we'll
have name 2 dot d s second file will
export very simple class named animal
and all this class has is property legs
which is number ok it's enough for this
file and in file one will import class
that we have just created named animal
so of course we are important from file
file - it's better to put
forward-slash here so now we're going to
use this class that we have just
imported so we'll create another class
which is dog which extends animal and
dog of course has to have a name which
is the string okay cool we will come
back to class index a little later to
see details which benefits its bringing
to us but right now we will see how we
can navigate a typescript project so as
we remember we just imported the animal
class from another file and when we
hover over this import statement while
keeping the well pressing the command
key we can see the actual definition of
the class so it's like the quick way to
see what the actual class that we are
importing in yes if you want to navigate
to the file where this class is defined
we can well holding the command key just
click the imported class name and we
will get into the file even when the
file is closed we can still do the same
thing and it will open a file for us
cool yeah this is really nice especially
when we are dealing with the really big
projects of course to file project is
not the real world one but if we have a
project with hundreds of files it is
very handy to have this way to see the
definition of the stuff that we are
important in we can even we have even
more options we can pick a definition so
we don't switch the context of the file
that we are in so we will see just this
additional block that pops M which we
where we can see the definition of the
class and
we can close back when we don't need it
another benefit is that we can easily
refactor our code let's say we don't
like the name of the class animal so we
can change it to something different of
course we can do the global search and
replace all animal instances you can
find them and do the global replace but
let's imagine we have other places where
we used exact same name say in comments
or in other pieces of our code which we
don't want to replace then it becomes a
manual task to go and replace everything
let's say you want to replace animal
with pet so we would go everywhere and
we will replace it right now we're
getting those complaints here because we
cannot import the pet class because it
does not exist yet so you have to change
the name all over the place which is ok
if it's two files but let's see how we
can do that more efficiently so in order
to refactor some code in typescript we
can use rename symbol functionality so
we will rename it here and we will just
press the return key and what we see
both files were changed if we go in here
we can see that animal class was just
renamed to pet which is really cool
again for the big projects let's
summarize what we have learned during
this session we proved the fact that
JavaScript has types we also installed
our typescript compiler we have seen
some typescript syntax and how easy it
is to navigate and refactor our
typescript project see you soon in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
