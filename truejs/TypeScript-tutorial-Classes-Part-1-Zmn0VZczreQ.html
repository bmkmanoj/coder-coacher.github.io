from Silicon Valley California with
another episode of typescript on the
mantles and today we will start with
part one of our discussion about classes
today we will see how static and
instance properties work how we can
attach methods to our classes and later
on we will see the difference between
typescript classes and classes that are
provided to us by es2015 we came a long
way with rainbow application so far we
have AB dot ts file where we call our
main function
also we organized our code using utils
module that we developed so remember we
utilize yarn and backpack to serve our
files if you need a fresh copy of the
source code you can go to github.com
slash electronic and right now we'll be
working in classes branch let's go ahead
and create our first class our class
will have name of app we want to have
constructor function inside of our class
the Constructicons function will be
executed once app class gets
instantiated inside the constructor
function we might declare properties
with some values are going to be used
throughout our class so let's say we
remember that we have this rainbow
string which is the name of element
there that we are grabbing in our down
so let's say we have this ID to equal in
our case to rainbow we'll put the actual
string right now for simplicity and we
see that typescript is trying to help us
here saying that property ID does not
exist on type F and this is the example
of major difference between es2015 and
typescript because it is 2015 classes
this would be absolutely proper just to
declare property and assign value but in
typescript we have to put our property
name at the very beginning right here
this is actually enough we can put
semicolons if we want
right now it will be of type any which
is not what we want so we can specify
the value type right here in our case it
is string so this property definition is
not optional in typescript but it is
really helpful if someone comes later on
and will try to figure out what our
class is doing this self documentation
will be very helpful we will add the
rest of the values that we're going to
use in our application so it will give
this style name border color and we'll
also set timeout some number in our case
Visual Studio gives us option to use
this help at the declaration for a
missing property we will get our
properties defined for us automatically
so we don't have to do extra work now
what we're going to do we will reflector
our main function and we'll say that it
should take app component and inside we
will instantiate this class that's
actually just for clarity add class here
at the end of the name so there's going
to be our app equals new app component
class and we'll pass it further right
here here at the function call we have
to put actual app class that we declared
before obviously our application is
broken right now because our mutate
element function is not ready to accept
app object created by app class so what
we going to do we will go into our
utility s file and we will change mutate
element function so it looks like an
older version of our app so let's keep
this else section only
now this function should take app object
now let's rename this app component just
element now our app will replace the
options object that we had before so we
will rename the symbol to F now we'll
change this options or ID will change
app component to element we also can do
we can move this app class into utils
file we'll keep it here we have to
export it and import it here also will
tell mutate element function that it's
parameter has to be of type app and it
is complaining because we messed up our
property names so let's change it back
so it is consistent so we have element
ID element ID style instead of style
name and interval for time out because
it's not time out it's the interval that
we have he now everything looks okay so
we can see that our backpack compiled
successfully we will go ahead and see if
our web pages not broken
other things seems to be working fine
let's refresh the page again and see if
we don't have any errors there those two
or old errors from the browser plugin
that I have yeah so everything looks
okay let's go ahead and do some
refactoring and clean up our code so
this interface is not relevant anymore
in our situation but it is a great
candidate for us to make it an interface
we'll put it here on top a good practice
to keep our interfaces and table and
types at the top of our document now we
can tell that app implements I app
interface we remember that we have this
special type that we defined before so
we can use it here instead of a string
let's move this generate color function
all the way here because it's kind of
helper function if we don't care
about a lot also with Louise interface
to the type annotation for F parameter
and let's go ahead and change our main
function a little bit it looks like
they're trying to over complicate things
we will directly call AB class right
here now let's see the difference
between instance and static property of
our F class at this point all our
properties our instance properties since
they are getting a value inside of
constructor function so that means that
we have to instantiate our class and
create an add object but let's imagine
that there is a reason for us to keep
our property static what that means
let's start with the syntax just for the
convenience we will move this property
up here I will use static keyword and
important part is that we will assign
the value right here this point we can
remove this reference and we see that
our typescript compiler is complaining
and the reason for that is that right in
our interface we have mentioned element
ID as a string and the fact is that
interface describes the instance of a
class not the class itself so we can
remove this line from interface now
everything looks fine so let's see how
we can use static property in mutate
element function we in multiple places
have reference to app instance and we
are accessing properties as you can see
now with static property we can directly
call getter function on L ID so if we
replace app instance with app class
an access element ID property just like
this compilation went through fine
so let's go ahead and see if the actual
app is working okay I will refresh the
page color is getting changed which
means application is working let's try
to implement something similar with
regular JavaScript function just for
educational purpose let's call it var
underscore app it will be a constructor
function now to define instance
properties we will do this style we call
some string we will do the same for
interval at this moment we created app
constructor function which we can use
with new keyword to instantiate the
actual object but if you want to define
static property that all the way you
would assign a property on the function
itself so you would underscore app dot L
ID and we would give a value here so
this how it actually looks if we wanted
to implement the similar functionality
and all good is five-way yeah let's
remove those lines and let's see how our
class looks now the fact is that we
stopped still don't have a method on our
quest and what kind of class it is
without a good method so let's create
one the syntax is very intuitive and we
will define our method we will call it
start on in it it will not take any
parameters but it will have function
body just like any function but it
people not return anything and what it's
going to have inside will be stuff from
mutate element function okay now we can
remove this export completely the same
way at the same time remove this import
from our app that TC at that TS and
let's call this function on our App
instance so I'm going to work right now
because we are not trashing the app the
way we did it before but what we can do
we can use this context of our class
instance and we will use this reference
instead of app but we have one problem
here which will break our app since this
context inside of set interval will not
be what we expect because we use the
regular function here what we have to do
is to use an of function in order to
keep this value to what we expect
so compilation goes fine let's go ahead
and see how our application is doing
colors again getting changed with me
which means our app is working fine and
we just added a method on our class
which we call at the beginning to
initiate our app and start the process
of changing color every fifteen hundred
milliseconds they will learned quite a
few things about classes in typescript
we went through properties static versus
instance properties and also created our
first method of app class if you like
