episode of typescript fundamentals and
today we will talk about modules and how
we can load them with web pack let's
dive right in
once again we are back in our rainbow
application for those who are here for
the first time you can find the source
code of this app at github.com slash
electronic / rainbow so all our
application is doing is changing the
color of this half Dom which we consider
to be a rainbow with this piece of code
that lives in F dot TS and gets
transpiled with typescript compiler to F
GS which is es 5 JavaScript obviously
our application right now exists only in
this single file F dot es and started
growing step by step so it might be the
right time to do some refactoring let's
say we want to create a new file which
is going to be our u tells file which is
very common in pretty much any
application that has more than 50 lines
of code so don't create utils
dot TS and we'll try to figure out what
we can move out of our ab PS file in
order to make it more concise and those
methods more reusable in our application
overall so obviously the major action
happens right here in this main function
so what we going to do we'll try to move
all this logic and all those interfaces
and types into separate file utils that
es that we have just created probably
most of you guys have already seen
imports and exports keywords that es6 or
es2015 gives us so let's do some magic
here so we want to export our type we'll
do the same for interface for our
function generate color in case we have
to use it somewhere else in our
application and we'll export this one
and okay we are getting some problems
here so what it's saying to us that
overload signatures must all be exported
or not exported in our case we want to
export them so we will put export
keywords in front of all overloads if
you don't have a clue what overloads are
please see my previous video about
function overloads now in our main app
dot es file we'll go ahead and import
stuff that we need and all we need here
is mutate element function but let's do
this fancy way so we'll say that we want
to import something to import this
object and behind this import stage the
so-called object destructuring you will
see that just in a second so import from
that slash utils as you can see we have
relative paths here with the name of the
file we don't have to specify that yes
just like in most of the cases when we
use requires in no GS but now if we do
it this way we have Auto completion so
you want to import mutate element or
let's say we need a valid style name for
our type alias we get those hints but in
our case all we need is mutate element
itself our function that has major
functionality baked in so at this point
we feel really cool we have our auto
completion we can jump to the definition
of our function we can even see that the
proper line was picked up for us since
this particular overload was used so
we'll just save our files compiler went
through fine without any errors so we'll
go to our page and we'll just refresh it
so our browser tells us that we are
missing something we cannot find
variable exports for those who have
worked with nodejs
you will figure out that export is
something that is coming from nodejs
so let's try to figure out why this is
happening we'll go into our distribution
folder and we will see what is going on
here at the very top our type suit
compiler is doing its own thing it's
trying to figure out how to export and
import files so it tries to define
property or exports and then exports are
used to attach the methods that we
defined on the other hand the place we
are where we are trying to import the
module we see the good old require
statement that exists in node.js
environment which obviously cannot be
executed in the browser so let's try to
figure out why this is happening so we
will go to today's config and as we
remember by default our module loader is
set to common GS we have few other
options which is none which means we
cannot use import and export at all
common J's which we have right now AMD
is the older version of module loading
for no J's will not stop here system is
the global variable that will be
available in the browser but it's not
possible to use it right now without
polyfills
UMD is the wrapper around common J's and
AMD or we can just have yes 2015 which
will just keep the es6 imports and
exports statements at this point we'll
introduce the web pack which will be our
module loader that will give us a way to
still use common J's require statements
in the code that we use in the browser
so in order to start with web pack we
have to turn our application into node
application so what we going to do will
stop our compiler and as we remember we
have yarn as our package manager so we
can use it for initiation at node.js
application so we will do yarn in it and
we'll pass
- why parameter in order to answer yes
to all the questions for initialization
of our project just to make it easier
now we have our package agent that we
will take care of and yarn lock is just
the file to track dependencies and we
don't have to manage it manually please
at this point this is going to be it for
the first part of modules and loading
modules with webpack please see the
second part of this episode soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
