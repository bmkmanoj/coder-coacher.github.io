series and in this video we will go over
string and number types in a little more
details you will see how to use string
literals for type annotations will learn
about Union types and type aliases we'll
go over to our TS config file to explore
now omit an error option in order to
handle our authoring time errors we are
back in our sample application and in
order to start applying type annotations
and using other features of type script
language we have to do one more change
in previous video we have converted our
project to typescript by initiating a
new type sleep project with PSC init
command but it is not enough to start
start using typescript specific syntax
fix that all we going to do we will
rename our source file and we will
change this extension to TS cool let's
see if everything is still working we
will start our typescript compiler in
the watch mode we'll try to save the
file
typescript compiler is running and we
are getting compiled version of our
source file in case you would like to
get a source code of our project you can
go to the following link
a github.com slash all LED conic slash
rainbow I will post this link in the
description of this video and here when
you get to the github repository you
will see different branches and using
branches you can get into different
stages of our project like this HTML 2
ts is the current one you will see the
source file with F dot TS code just the
same stuff that we have seen just a
moment ago we have seen some type
annotations in the very first video and
now we are going to go into a little
more details about string and number
types in context of our
vacation so what we have here we have
our two files open so we have f dot d s
right here on the left and we have
transpiled version of this type script
file on the right so we'll close this
plane for now and we will be running our
typescript compiler in watch mode so we
can see how our compiled file is getting
changed
so in order to use some typings let's do
a little bit of refactoring we'll move
some variables outside of our functions
and just for the demo purposes we will
be doing those global variables here so
we will define variable element ID
another one will be a style name the
third one will be for interval so let's
see which way is we're going to assign
to that so we have this element ID right
here which is rainbow the HTML ID so
we'll assign it to the first variable
and we will use the variable name in its
place we'll do the same things for the
style name this is CSS property right
here and the last one will be interval
this 15 hundredths right here fifteen
hundred milliseconds
and we will use once again variable here
so if we hover over our variables right
here we will see that we're getting
signed some type inference we see that
element ID is indeed a string and
interval is a number and so this type
inference is based on the initial
assignment of the variable which is very
useful because we don't actually have to
do anything let's see how our Transpo
file is getting changed all the
difference is that we don't have that
keyword but it gets replaced with var
keyword and the only reason for that is
we have es5 as our target in our test
config file another option
of explicitly stating the types for
variable will be to put some type
annotations so in this case it will be
strength the same thing for style name
and as you would guess for interval it
would be a number so in this in this
case it's a little overkill to do this
in such a small application but when we
have more complex scenarios it is very
useful to explicitly put type
annotations one of the benefits is we
are getting kind of a documentation for
our code so it is easier for other
people to figure out what we were trying
to do the interesting fact is that here
on the right we can see that those type
annotations that we had on have on the
left they never get into the JavaScript
file itself so it is authoring time
value only so let's see what will happen
if you are trying to override our
variables with defined types somewhere
somewhere later in our code so let's see
for some reason we are changing the
value of element ID variable and we are
assigning the number to it we'll get
this under aligned variable name right
here and very straightforward error
message that type number one two three
is not assignable to type string and the
same thing is for interval which was
defined as a number at the very top of
our file if we put some letters here you
will get very similar warning so you can
imagine if your application is big and
you are important and exporting a lot of
modules it is very possible that you can
lose track of which value should be
assigned to variable so in big projects
again types they become very handy so we
understood that we have some keyword
reserved for our type annotations such
as string number Blin and much more as
we will see soon another useful feature
is that we can actually use the string
literals for our type annotations so
let's say we have a use case where we
want element ID to be only rainbow
we can do the following and if somewhere
further in our code we will will change
the rainbow ID - let's say - rainbow
underscore one we will see that it's
complaining right here because we have
specifically stated in this type
annotation that it has to be rainbows
during literal so basically what we are
achieving here is constant declaration
so let's see if we actually put constant
here it's our key word and we will
remove this type annotation and hover
over we will see that it's actually
doing this it's put in the rainbow
strangle literal as type annotation
automatically for us so this is the way
how we can use string literals for our
type annotations we will see more
real-life examples a little later when
we will be working with the union types
and type aliases let's go back to our
type annotations and just in a second
we'll see what union type is and just
for the cleanup purposes we'll change
the annotation of element ID back to a
string but now we will play around with
style name let's put string literal S
type annotation but let's say we want
not only border color to be a valid
style name but also background color so
what we can do for this we can use this
pipe symbol to create a union type and
here we're gonna put background color
that's our second option so now if we
want to change the signed value to a
background color it's still going to be
valid we don't see any errors but at the
same time if we assign value other than
border border color or background color
we will probably see an error we see
this variable name underlined and it's
saying that type color is not assignable
to type with this string annotation
so this is a very handy way to specify
several options for our string literal
pipe connotation we can do one of those
so it's not limited to two we can do as
many as we want but as you see it can
get pretty messy right here this type
annotation gets real large so this type
annotation becomes a great candidate for
refactoring so let's do just that we'll
use keyword type so keyword type is
provided to us by typescript not
JavaScript this is the way to specify
type alias so what we going to do we
will copy this value we will call our
type as valid style name and just
similarly as for variable assignment we
will just assign this value right here
and now we can use this name let's put
it uppercase and now we can use it
instead of this string right here we can
double check that it references our
string literal annotation by alias name
if we change it to something different
we see the error again can of course
export this type alias
so we can use it in other places in our
code so you might notice right here we
are getting this warning but at the same
time if we take a look on the right-hand
side right here our style name variable
in our actual JavaScript is still get an
assignment of color which is not the
right type so we even have this warning
here so even though we have warnings
that does not stop our compiler to
actually process the code and put the
output with their own assignment in
order to prevent that if for some
reason we want you don't want this
behavior we want typescript compiler to
stop on error we have an option in our
test config file with name now omit an
error by default it's set to false but
now we will set it to true let's put the
proper assignment here start with okay
good so we don't have any warnings and
we have a proper assign right here of
border color which we expect but if we
change it back to the bad assignment of
just color and save it we see right here
that we are getting warning in our
terminal and we are getting this
underlined here but our compiled file
was not changed we did not get the bad
assignment right here okay let's fix our
code quickly we will remove this export
statement here because it's not going to
work right now anyway and we will change
the style name to proper value of
background color save it our output
JavaScript was updated with this value
let's go to our application and see what
is happening here okay now we see this
weird-looking rainbow with the
background color changing not the border
color even though it is weird but that's
exactly what we wanted let's go over
what we have learned in this video at
the beginning we have seen how to use
string and number types in the context
of our application we also seen how to
use string literals for type annotations
and how you know types and type aliases
can make our code cleaner we also seen
the no limit on error option in TS
config file in order to stop compiler
outputting javascript in case we have an
error please subscribe and I will talk
to you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
