Series if you are here for the first
time my name is Oleg I am full-stack
software engineer here in Silicon Valley
California if you haven't watched my
typescript fundamental course you can
find a link to the YouTube playlist in
description below while learning
fundamentals of typescript a lot of
people overlook the fact that typescript
compiler is highly configurable and
maybe because it has so many options
many are afraid to configure compiler
themselves this is typescript Pro Series
so here we will try to learn how we can
use options of typescript compiler to
our advantage how we can fine-tune all
those options that are available to us
to benefit our project in this video
we'll do high-level overview of TS
config file to understand the
architecture and the major options that
are available to us in typescript
fundamentals we initiated our project
with command-line to do NTSC Anette in
this course we will create TS config
ourself from scratch so let's create
this file ts config that Jason and this
is going to be our starting point of
exploring typescript compiler options in
our config file we want to put this
high-level object and since we are using
Visual Studio code which is built with
typescript it knows everything about TS
config jason and about our options so at
the moment when we start typing our
quotes to put the first key we are
getting all high-level options that are
available to us no doubt the most
important subsection of TS config is
compiler options themselves in upcoming
lessons we will touch most of those
options that are available to us but in
this video we just want to concentrate
on the structure of the file itself so
we understand the bigger picture so once
we are in this compiler options object
when we start typing our quotes again we
are getting even more
options that are given to us by
typescript so just throw a few of them
just to give our file key value pairs as
you can tell each of those object
options they have default value which we
can tweak depending on our needs
obviously our compiler needs some input
to process files so for that reason we
have files property which is an array we
have a few more things that will help us
to define which files should be
processed by typescript include and
exclude are those few options that will
help us with this each of those three
it's an array of strings very soon we
will see exactly how to use each of them
and how different they are and how they
can work together as you create more and
more typescript projects you might feel
a need of reusing TS config file in
multiple projects of course files
include exclude properties will differ
depending on the project but let's say
you want to reuse some major compiler
options throughout your project in order
to achieve this we have very convenient
way of doing it all we have to do we
have to create some sort of base config
so it's called TS config that base jason
this file will have just the section of
compiler options object now inside of
our secondary tasks and TS config we can
use extends property which takes
relative path to our base config file at
this point we don't need to repeat this
whole section but if we want to
overwrite one of those keys we can
definitely do it with this override this
is very convenient way of reusing some
common options throughout our project
there is one more option that will
define how our typescript compiler will
work within IDE we can have even more
ideas specific
options let's say Adam ID can have its
own options within this Adam object
another good example of special options
would be angular compiler options all
those special options should be found in
the documentation for a specific project
this video we went over very high level
architecture of TS config file and in
upcoming videos we will dive deeper and
we will talk about each of them
separately and how we can benefit from
configuring and fine-tuning them
depending on our project needs please
