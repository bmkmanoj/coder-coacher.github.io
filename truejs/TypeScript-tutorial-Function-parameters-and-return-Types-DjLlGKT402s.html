typescript fundamental T's here and
today we will be talking about function
parameters annotations we will discuss
in details return types such as void and
never types even though we got a lot of
really cool feature additions in both
es2015
and typescript functions still remain
fundamental building blocks of any
JavaScript application because we have
so many of them in our programs it's
definitely useful to have some Taipings
around functions so let's see how we can
enhance our functions using type
annotations we are back in our rainbow
application and at the beginning I just
want to remind you that you can always
get the source code of this lesson in my
github repository under electronic /
rainbow and for this particular video
you can find the branch name func params
return types to start we will do some
super quick refectory of our code we'll
create this new function called mutate
element and we will move all code that
is related to Dom manipulation into this
function so let's just cut this piece
and we'll place it inside of the new
function mutate element and this
function will be taken few arguments
first one will be L ID which stands for
element ID of course another one will be
style the third one in which stands for
interval inside of this function we will
replace those references that we had
before with those parameter names and
this function will be called inside of
main function so now we can slowly get
rid of our global variables here on top
so direct
we pass the values background-color
let's change it to back to border color
so it looks nicer and interval will be
integer now we are a key to get rid of
those three global variables right on
top save this it's quickly wrong our
compiler double check that application
is working looks fine we are not getting
any console.log errors which is good at
this moment there is absolutely no type
checking for mutate element function and
it's usually in JavaScript we can just
put anything we wanted here so we can
replace the element ID which we know
should be a string with the number the
place where number should be we can put
an array of something and JavaScript
will never tell us that there is a
problem but of course our application
will fail miserably yeah we can see this
crazy stuff going on here
so what we can do about all this
fortunately typescript provides a way
for us to make a type annotation for our
function parameters and we can do that
directly in the function declaration as
we remember element ID supposed to be a
string so we'll put it right here this
is the syntax semicolon and the type
name we already see in this syntax
before stylists will remember is a
special piece we believe using our
custom Union type valid style name the
same way we can use it right here and
for interval use number perfect so now
when we are trying to do those crazy
changes here
we will get warning right away
with a clear error message telling us
that argument of type 1 2 3 which is
integer is not assignable to parameter
type of string so right here we
prevented Brian runtime error that could
have happened if we put the wrong input
into the function so we will turn it
back so our mutate element function gets
the proper input when we hover our
function name we can see the function
parameters are annotated with proper
types but another interesting thing that
we might notice that we have this return
type stated here at the end with
semicolon void in case of generate color
of function we can see that it infers
string return type which is expected
since we are using two string method
here our return statement so far we've
been seeing inferred return types but
it's usually we can explicitly make
return type annotations of course so
output string here and we'll put void
here so what this return type annotation
gives us for example if for some reason
somewhere in our code we will decide to
multiply the return of mutate element
function by 5 it will tell us right away
that we cannot do this since function is
not return anything so we cannot
multiply it in any way so when I'm
saying that function is not return
anything what they actually mean is it
returns undefined value to illustrate
this let's use our node ripple in the
terminal so what we going to do we will
console.log another console log function
call so console log function call is not
returned anything but let's see what it
prints out so what we see is this
undefined value that was
ended which means if we try to multiply
it by five it will return not a number
which means we cannot multiply undefined
by five of course it is important to
understand this since just in a moment
we will be discussing difference between
void and never return types till now
we've been working with function
declaration put in type annotations and
on this function let's see how we can
work with function expressions we know
that this is another way to declare
function in our program which is to
assign anonymous function to the
variable so we'll create the dummy
function we'll call it at numbers it's
going to be anonymous function it will
take x and y and as you would expect we
will return some of those two numbers so
this function can be annotated pretty
much the same way as we can have seen in
function expression x will be number as
well as Y of course returned value also
going to be a number we'll call this
function something like this and core it
would work fine another option that we
have is little different syntax which
might look a little confusing but after
seeing it few times you will definitely
see the pattern so we will turn our
function back so it does not have any
annotations and syntax looks something
like this so it will have semicolon here
we'll have our parameter annotations
first number is our second number and it
returns number we use this fat arrow
here so this is so called contextual
typing but it gives us the same result
so now what we call this function with
the wrong parameters in there it will
tell us about that
let's talk a little more details about
return types we already understand that
function can return any valid type and
we have two kind of special cases like
void that we have seen right here plus
never type so let's try to understand
what that is we'll create this another
dummy function would name alert me this
type ah this function will alert user so
the third type of return value is void
which means this function is not
intended to return any meaningful data
but if we try to assign another type
right here
typescript will tell us that if function
is not void or any it has to return
value but we are not returning anything
another special case is never return
type to demonstrate this we will create
error throwerw function so always going
to do it will throw error right at the
beginning of execution now for this
function we can specify return type as
never which means that this function
will never reach the end of the
execution it will never go pass this
line another case of user never type
will be infinite loop while true so in
this case function execution will also
never finish it's not very common case
but in the latest versions of typescript
it is supported well today we went
through function annotations we have
seen special cases of return types such
as void and never please subscribe and
I'll talk to you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
