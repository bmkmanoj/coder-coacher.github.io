modules and loading modules with wetback
so now when our project has turned into
actual node.js application we can
install modules that are specific for
our application locally so we'll do yarn
add and right now we're installing
dependencies that are specific for our
development environments will specify -
capital D and we want to install
typescript webpack and web pack dev
server cool everything is installed and
at the time of this recording the
version of our web pack is two point six
point one local dependencies that we
have just installed are stored in two
places first in package dot J's and we
can see this dev dependencies property
with typescript web pack and web pack
that dev server specified also we have
yarn walk file which got automatically
updated again we don't care about
updating this manually in any shape of
form and this file is saved in order to
have reproducible build with exact
versions of everything that we have in
our node modules can see we have quite a
few modules installed at this point in
order to start with the web pack we're
going to have to create web pack config
file which has exact same name web pack
dot config digest so let's use this
config file for configuring our web pack
build so this file can return both
function and object literal for
simplicity we will do object so the
module exports equals object literal and
we'll define few properties here first
we have to understand that now web pack
is taken care of transpiling our
typescript so we'll define an entry
point which is source
at TS file now all do the similar thing
for output in this case we will have
filenames separately which is app GS and
we'll specify path to the directory
where we want to output our stuff so we
know it is dist folder we also want to
specify which file extensions we want to
resolve since web pack is working with
all sorts of files and definitely you
need to understand more about lapack in
order to utilize all capabilities that
it gives to us but it would be a
separate tutorial for web pack only so
right now we will just put the resolve
reference here which takes an object
we'll put extensions be an array of
values all we care about right now is
that TS now we have to specify module
property and here we will tell web pack
how to load our modules we'll put some
rules in here we will tell web pack to
test for regular expression it will be
looking for TS extension and when a web
pack finds files that are positive for
this test it should use awesome
typescript loader awesome that
typescript loader will be another
external dependency that we want to
install with yarn which copy this name
open our terminal we will put yarn add
dev dependency and awesome types
reporter let's go back to our extensions
here and what we actually have to do is
to add a GS also so web pack can do its
thing on the background will save this
config file and few changes that we have
to do to our application so what we want
to do is to have this main function to
be executed right when the file gets
loaded so we will execute it right here
and obviously we have to remove this
thing from index.html so it does not get
called twice now inside our package dot
JSON we will add
scripts property are we going to have
our so called and dams one of our NPM
scripts and scripts object will have dev
server properties specified which will
be executing webpack dev server now we
can have our npm run command execute
that server or just do yarn dev server
okey we are getting some problem here so
let's try to figure out what's going on
it says that we have invalid
configuration object of our web pack so
let's go in there and see maybe we have
misspelled something so our error
message is pretty useful so what it
tells us that our output path is not an
absolute path so in order to fix this
what we going to do we will use the
global variable dear name we will add
this folder to it let's run it again key
so now configuration that resolve has an
unknown property extensions now after
fixing extensions keyword and running
yarn dev server web pack dev server
tells us that our project is running on
localhost 8080 so we can go ahead and
open our browser on this port refresh
the page so everything looks fine so far
those two errors that you see right now
that they are not related to our code it
just some Safari extensions that they
have installed so let's go ahead and see
what is getting loaded in our browser as
we see single app that J's file got
loaded and we see some web pack magic
going on in here and all this done in
order to make our code to load modules
from this point we can use our import
and export statements whatever way we
want and our browser will be able to
pick up our module loading thanks to web
pack dev server typescript compiler and
awesome typescript loader so let's
quickly go over let's quickly
go our stuff that we have learned in
these two parts we understood what
JavaScript modules are in terms of es6
also we have seen how to load our
modules into the browser using webpack
web web pack dev server and awesome
typescript loader please subscribe to
continue learning more about typescript
and JavaScript in general</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
