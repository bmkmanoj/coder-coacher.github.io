with our typescript fundamentals course
where we're going to learn how to
convert simple JavaScript web
application into typescript we will see
how to initiate a project how to
configure compiler and how to run it in
watch mode so let's jump right in so
what we've got here is this simple
application with index.html and FJs
always doing is producing this beautiful
rainbow which looks nothing like a real
one but it should be perfectly fine for
our purpose let's go back to files and
try to understand what is actually
happening here in index.html we can see
this little piece of CSS which will make
our rainbow look nice this div with ID
rainbow is an element that we will be
manipulating F dot J's contains all our
JavaScript and what we have here is
event listener that listens to Dom
content loaded event and this event is
handled by main function see what guess
main function is located in F that GS
and here we are getting the element with
the rainbow ID and we will be changing
the style property border color to
randomly generated color which is coming
from this helper function generate color
so this is our starting point and the
question is how we are going to bring in
typescript into the picture in previous
video we have seen how to install type
suit compiler and now it is the time to
use it so let's double check that we
have it installed by typing TF c base v
if you don't see the version please go
back to the previous video so you can
install typescript compiler on your
machine so to initiate typescript
Jek all we're going to have to do is
type DSC dash dash in and press ENTER
and so what we see here is the message
that TS config JSON file was
successfully created and here it is this
config file provides options for
typescript compiler that are specific to
our project as we can see we have few
options that are already decided for us
we can of course change them later
the first one is so-called marginal
resolution option which is common GS in
our case we will come back to this one a
little later in our course this target
option can also be interesting for us
here we specify in the version of
JavaScript that we want our typescript
to be transpiled to there is a large
number of options that are available for
us which we can find in official
documentation so the best way to get
this one will be just to google
typescript compiler options and here we
will see the complete list of options
that are available to us we should also
remember that options in TS config file
could be overwritten with options that
we pass through typescript CLI as
command-line parameters let's go ahead
and excuse to our TS config JSON file
the first one will be allowed GS which
we will set to true as you can see we
are getting that pop out that is trying
to help us to pick up the right options
we will set it to true what this option
gives us it will let us have plain
JavaScript files as our source and it is
exactly what what we need for our lesson
here the next one will be out there but
this option will specify the directory
where we want to keep our files that
were generated by typescript compiler we
will call it tests the common name for
such
directory cool right now we are ready to
run our compiler and let's see what
happens when we run it so in terminal
all we have to do is type DSC and
execute this command so you can see on
the Left we got this new directory dist
and we expect to have another F the GS
file in here cool it is here let's open
the original one and one that was
generated for us we will have our
original file on the left and our
generated file on the right let's let
the screen move this file here close
this one okay so on the Left we have the
original file and on the right we have
the generated one which looks pretty
much the same which is expected the only
difference that we can see that we don't
have the space on the right between
functions let's say for some reason you
forget to put semicolons and you have a
lot of extra space typescript compiler
will take care of that also let's run
the compiler again so we can see the
file on the right it has all semicolons
and we don't see this extra space
between functions okay cool so another
thing that we have to do in order to
make our application working we will go
into our index file and as we remember
we have this reference to our JavaScript
file in index.html and we have to
specify that now the file that we want
to access is located in dist directory
so we'll fix this we'll save it and
let's go to
to the browser and check if our
application is still working we refresh
the page we see the color is still
getting changed and we are not getting
any console errors here so we are good
so let's do the few more final steps as
we have destination folder it would be a
good idea also to have a source folder
so the source folder clue our original f
J's file in there
good let's double check if everything is
working
we'll get terminal up again around
compiler so did before good now errors
which means everything went well our
application is working there is one very
useful feature of typescript compiler
that we definitely should use is so
called watch mode we can enable it by
typing - W and right now our typescript
compiler is running in the watch mode
what it's doing for us now every time we
are changing file in our source folder
the compilation process will run
automatically and we can see this
message here that compilation was
completed and there was no problems so
what have we seen in this video we
initiated typescript project with THC in
it command we configured our compiler
for our specific project with a low GS
and out there
they have config options and we also
have seen how files are actually getting
compiled and how our compiler can run in
watch mode so it is very convenient for
us so we don't have to do that manually
all the time and it is run for us
automatically in the next video
we'll get familiar with string and
number types and to learn about aliases
and union types please subscribe to get
