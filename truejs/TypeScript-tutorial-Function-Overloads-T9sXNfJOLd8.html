episode of typescript fundamentals today
we will be talking about function
overloads let's see how this mechanism
provides us a way of doing familiar
stuff but in much cleaner way we are
back in good old rainbow application if
you still don't have the source code of
this project please go to github slash
all the conic slash rainbow you can also
find a link in the description of this
video if you have been watching the
previous session you remember that we
have refactored our mutate element
function so now it takes options object
instead of three separate parameters but
let's imagine situation where you want
to have two different signatures for
your function I mean you want both way
to pass options object but also separate
parameters let's copy this function call
and comment it out so we can use it
later so obviously if we want to switch
back to our three separate parameters
typescript will complain badly since it
looks nothing like object that we are
expecting let's see how we can achieve
our goal of making Oracle function more
flexible so it can work with both object
as a parameter or separate parameters
governor name argument name we remember
that we have a fancy way of the
factoring in typescript so we will go
down here we'll select row name symbol
and let's make our new variable name
options or ID hit enter all references
have been changed now when we hover over
to see the type annotation the inferred
type is any definitely not what we want
but it is good enough to start with
let's put some conditions inside we will
be checking if our parameter is a string
so we can do some specific actions in
this
case so I'll put this if statement we
will use type of operator type of
returns string with the name of
JavaScript type so we will do type of
options or ID and if it equals string we
will do something different inside it's
going to be extra implementation from
from previous session before we did the
refactoring
so this to be replaced with options or
ID and to understand that at this point
it can be string only the object cannot
get in here because we have this
condition here output back style and
interval of course we don't have those
two variables defined now but we'll fix
it very soon and this second block we'll
put an else block now it is this time to
do the fun stuff we'll define function
overloads in order to accommodate two
signatures so the syntax is kind of
funky let's see how it works you sort of
read Eclair the function put the same
name good parenthesis again now inside
we will put the option name here we
remember that we are using this
interface it's not returning anything so
we will put void we will do the same
thing for another signature and this
time we'll put our three separate
parameters as you remember we had
element ID type string style with type
annotation of type alias named valid
style name and and which was a number we
can see the tower type script is still
not happy and the reason for that is
that I forgot to put optional parameters
here oh boot style question mark and
integer question mark let's go and see
the place where or
function gets cold if we hover over here
we will see that it picked up one of
over loads and it is smart enough to
pick up the right one because we see
it's telling us that we should have
three separate parameters and it based
on the first input that goes here which
is a string let's see what happens in
the second case pretty much the same
function but now it takes the right
overload showing us that option should
be emitted element interface let's go
back and see what happens to our actual
JavaScript we'll open the terminal save
the file and in our JavaScript we can
tell right away that function overloads
are not present here because it's in no
shape of form is valid JavaScript but at
the same time while writing code in
typescript it provides us all benefits
of type checking we can verify that our
type checking is still working by
messing up our function parameters here
good and let's see what happens if we
change the object a little bit yeah the
same thing it gives us the warning let's
go and see the less thing if our
application is still working okay
refresh the page yeah we see no errors
and color is still getting changed which
means our app is working we learn today
how to use function overloads in order
to keep our functions flexible if you
