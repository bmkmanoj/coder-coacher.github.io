episode of typescript fundamental series
introducing interfaces today we will see
how to use interfaces with object
annotations indexable types implementing
classes and functions typing if you are
doing a newer JavaScript
till now concept of interfaces should be
something completely new for you so what
is interface interface is so-called
syntactical contract that entity in our
case object of some type should conform
to obviously to understand this better
we're going to have to look into some
real world example which we're going to
do just in a minute using our rainbow
application it's usually you can find
the source code of this project at
electronics slash rainbow and today's
lesson will be in the branch named
interfaces till now we have seen several
ways of annotating our values such as
building types like string and number
string literal types type aliases and
union types but this list is not
complete without interfaces because the
interfaces can be used for describing
data structures and objects of pretty
much any complexity as we know
typescript type checking relies a lot on
the shape that value has it is often
called duck typing or structural
subtyping which means that we are
checking the structure of data structure
of the object in context of ratable
application let's see how interface can
be used for describing an object it is
considered a good practice to keep
number of function parameters to a
minimum in order to achieve this we'll
refactor mutate element function and
instead of passing three separate
parameters we will pass one config
object which will contain all of those
three values so we will replace all
those parameters
our mutate element function will cut
them out and keep them as a reference
for later so we'll call our parameter
now and options right now options have
type of any it is definitely not what we
want to have in typescript since any
does not give us any type protection but
at the beginning let's at least make our
code working so we will change
references inside function for element
ID
we'll put options dot DL ID for style
name the same thing options that style
and for the interval of our step
interval function will do options that
end at the place where we call our
function of course we have to change the
input also so the first key of this
options object will be e Li D which
stands for element ID next one is style
and the last one is int which stands for
interval we'll remove the strip this
comment since we don't need it anymore
so options still have the type of any
but at least our codes should be working
so let's go to our application in the
browser and let's see if it is working
so I'll refresh it looks okay let's go
and see if there are any errors we see
no errors and that means everything is
working we are back in our application
so what can we do at the beginning is to
annotate our options parameters right in
line and pull use that reference that we
had before staying that element ID
should be a string style as you remember
is our type alias right here which
combines both throwing literal types
border color and background color and
interval should be a number this is of
course much better approach since
now we cannot pass the wrong values in
here if for some reason element ID
becomes a number our editor will start
complaining that argument of this type
is not assignable to this function but
to be honest this annotation looks
pretty ugly in case we have more than
three let's say five or seven function
arguments this line would become really
long and it will be really hard to read
this and to understand what kind of
inputs should go into this function
another downside of this sort of
annotation is it cannot be reused for
describing other values if you want to
reuse this type of annotation we're
going to have to type the whole thing
again and this where the interface
keyword is coming for our rescue let's
see how we can use it so typescript
provides us this special keyword
interface we will give it a name
starting with capital i standing for
interface this is completely optional
and you can decide yourself whatever
naming convention you want to use our
name will be i mutate element and we
will attach this whole annotation right
here if you would expect now we can use
it instead of that whole string and
again it can be exported if we want and
we used in other places just like with
types interface is just compile time
construct which means if we save this
file our FGS will be regenerated and we
come to our javascript file we don't see
any signs of the interface it does not
get converted to any function or object
and of course it is a great benefit
since the footprint of our Java Script
is not growing let's see if our type
checking is still working we'll replace
one of our options here with that input
and we can see right away that
this statement is getting highlighted
telling us that argument of this type is
not assignable to parameter of type I
mutate element cool so this approach is
working
let's see few interesting details about
interface syntax it is pretty forgiving
if you look at it this way it reminds
you about object literal syntax but we
can get rid of those commas and it's
still going to work fine no errors we
can use semicolons also I personally
prefer commas but you can use whatever
you want you can of course add a method
to an interface let's say in case our
function is taking a callback and since
it is a function we will put what kind
of input it takes let's say it takes
error and will specify the return type
will be void in our case ya will not
keep it since our function is not taking
callback but it is possible in case you
need it even though we have not covered
classes yet I still want to show you how
interfaces can be used for extending
classes and for describing indexable
types so see this let's use a simple
example we'll create interface called
iBook we'll have few properties such as
author if string name and identification
number now let's create the actual class
called book now we can use this keyword
implements in the name of interface
our class we will have constructor but
right now our class does not have all
those three properties that we specified
in the interface that's why we see this
error right here saying that class
booked incorrectly implements interface
iBook and some properties are missing so
let's quickly add those property
definitions you don't need commas now
everything looks fine but to go a little
further let's actually put those three
values in our constructor so so they
actually get assigned to this context of
the object created by this class of
course if we have a book we will have
library so now we will create another
interface and this interface will be for
describing indexable type in our case
library our library will be a simple
object with keys and values so we will
try to describe it with another
interface within my name I library and
this is the syntax for describing key
value pairs will say that our index will
be a string and what is important we
specify the value of this index which is
I book perfect so what we got so far is
interface of a book the actual
implementation of book class and
interface for a library I will create
variable named Lib standard for library
and it will have type annotation made
with the interface to just create it for
a library
and for now it's going to be just an
empty object literal now we will go
ahead and add few elements to our
library let me copy pasted in order to
save the time so we are having some
problem and of course I have misspelled
the word constructor here now it is good
so what we have we are assigning the
property with this hash name then we
assign the new object created with book
class which has those three parameters
that we expect string string and a
number so we don't see any errors here
but let's say if we change the
assignment to something that is not a
book but let's say some random object
will replace this value now we see that
it is complaining telling us that it is
not appetite I book it will change the
key name so we don't have duplicated
keys case that can cause some other
problems also if we assign value from
the library to some other variable let's
say check out book we will assign this
variable will give us a hint right away
that it is of a type I book so this is
an example how class can implement
interface and how we can describe
indexable types using interface who will
clean up all this example code and said
since we don't actually need it for our
application of course and lastly we will
see how we can use interfaces for
function type annotations so of course
start with the interface keyword and
let's say we are defining the I search
function and we know that this function
will two inputs named source to the
string and some substring that we'll be
looking for
and we will return true or false as an
output of our function function typing
with interfaces only works with function
expressions which means we will assign
our function to a variable name so
create a variable search func and it
will say that it's going to be of a type
I search now we can assign the actual
function so we can see right now it is
saying that this function is returning
void while we are expecting it to return
boolean so let's fix it let's put a
source in here source and substring
inside we're going to have some sort of
result and we will search for substring
in our source string now we will return
boolean value will be checking if result
is more than minus 1 which is index
where our substring might be found
perfect so now our function is taken to
expected parameters and return a boolean
so this is a way how to use interface
for describing a function expression at
the end let's again clean everything
we'll save our file let's double check
that everything looks fine and let's see
if our application is working ok let me
refresh the page perfect we don't have
any errors and application is still
working now we have implementation with
interface let's quickly go over the
stuff that we have learned today we have
seen what interfaces are how we can use
them for object annotation for indexable
types and for implementing classes also
we've been using interfaces to describe
function types please subscribe
