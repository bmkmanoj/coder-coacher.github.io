another episode of typescript
fundamentals and today we will be
talking about generics and type
parameters as software engineers we want
to build our software systems so they
not only have valve defined and
consistent API s but also are flexible
and reusable
we want our components to be capable of
working with different types of data
that is the reason why understanding
generic types is so important because of
simplicity of our rainbow application
which you can find at github slash
electronics slash rainbow we don't have
an opportunity to use generics in this
piece of code so we will just come up
with the example which will illustrate
what generics can do for us so I will
start with sort of hello world example
of functional programming so called
identity function all this function is
doing it takes argument and and returns
the same argument C will guess type
inference who tell us that type of any
got assigned to argument and the same
stuff for the return value at this point
function is completely usable so we can
do identity we can pass a string say
Oleg now type inference will tell us
that we are dealing with function that
takes argument of any and returns any
because this is a string we can try to
get it property land and it will be
perfectly fine because actually string
has a length but let's say we have a now
test here and of course now does not
have length but we don't get any
warnings from typescript because it does
not know about now being a no it just
type of any
and theoretically object type of any can
have a length or let's say a name or
anything else this means that we have
absolutely no type protection as you can
see I shall even misspelled the name
property here and we were still not
getting any warnings just again proves
that we did not have any type checking
going on here is the first step of
course we could specify a string as
input type and string its return type in
this case we'll get a notification that
type null is not assignable to parameter
of type string but at this point it is
far from being generic for this sort of
input handling typescript provides us
special syntax so let's going to work it
back so put those angle brackets here
we'll specify the type right here now we
have this sort of a variable name it's
actually so-called type parameter just
like functions have parameters our typed
function can have type parameters in
this case it is letter t so now we can
use it throughout our function
declaration so we can tell that our arg
should be of type t and of course it has
to return the exact same type of t we
have to understand that there is
absolutely no magic in this letter t it
can be oh let's say and it will work
just the same way
let's return it to t because it's more
semantic meaning type generic type now
if we let say passing the object literal
in our function it will tell us right
away that property name does not exist
on type object literal at this point we
have completely genetically type
function let's say if we have a property
use right here and be noticed in the
string all egg when we hover over we
will see that signature of this function
amendment we change to this particular
string and when we access the land it
will not complain at all because string
actually has a lamp but if we put a
number in here and we'll try to access
the land property we'll see the burning
right away that property lens does not
exist on type 8 which is a number just
like with function parameters we can
have multiple type parameters let's see
we still want to have that o type
parameter here and we are expecting
another argument which will be a name of
type O we can freely use this reference
as type annotation inside our function
let's say that underscore name should be
type of O now we can do some
manipulations in here and make sure that
our name variable is still of type O
let's clear this up and now we'll see
how we can narrow down our generics by
specifying the type at the place where
we call our function let's say we
exactly know that at this moment in our
application identity should take string
let's clear this up also now when we
pass a string our function signature is
much more narrowed down because we don't
see the string literal type annotation
but we have a string and everything else
works exactly the same as we have all
those methods and properties available
for us and if we put something wrong
let's say some property that does not
exist we will get a warning it's usually
genetics are simple but powerful
constructs and we will see more
practical usage of it further in our
course when we will be talking about
classes so now let's clean up our
rainbow application since we don't
actually need this code for our
application right now let's go or the
stuff
that we have learned today we understood
that concept of generics we also have
seen how type parameters can work in
conjunction with function parameters
