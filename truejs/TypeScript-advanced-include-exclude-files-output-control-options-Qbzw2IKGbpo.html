typescript Pro Series in this video we
will talk about including and excluding
files for our compilation and we will
see in depth how to fine tune which
files are getting in for our compilation
and also we will learn how to control J
s output during our compilation let's
jump right in
we'll start with really simple
typescript application at this point we
have source folder with single
typescript file in it we have
configuration file for typescript
compiler with just one option enabled
which is output directory dist and if we
run our compiler in watch mode obviously
we're gonna get dist folder which gonna
have single file in it with pretty much
the same information that we will that
we are having in typescript file just
one Jas has main function in it
obviously in realistic application we
would have much more than one file in
our project so let's create another one
two TS and we'll put some secondary
class in it and since our compiler is
running in watch mode we'll get a second
JavaScript file right away with
transpiled version of secondary class
but let's say for some reason we want to
exclude this file from our compilation
process what we can do inside TS config
JSON we can add
exclude property which will take array
this array should be an array of strings
that will represent relative path to
files or so-called glob file named
patterns let's start with simple one
with a relative path to the file so
let's put source
/ - dot TS in it
we will manually remove distribution
folder and hit control s to rerun the
compiler and this time instead of our
distillate we have just one file as we
expected since we have this exclude
option enabled with specific file name
as I said this is sort of a simple way
of excluding files we can also use glob
file named patterns which are coming
from UNIX systems where we can
generalize file names let's play around
with this option a little bit so let's
imagine we have a folder inside of our
source folder which is called internal
and inside of this internal folder we
have some files
with some files that we don't want to
include into our compiled version of
code right now you see that it got in
right away
but let's come back to our config file
and this time we will do blob file named
pattern here so we'll say exclude source
slash internal this time when we rerun
the compiler will see that this whole
folder will be excluded from dist
I use this double asterisk symbol which
means that this pattern will be executed
recursively
within the folder with our file named
patterns we can be even more specific
we'll create another file which will be
non secret it's still gonna be internal
but it will have another word in its
name let's go let's back that TS and we
will have some tests going on inside of
it now what we can do inside of TS
configuration we can specify that we
want to exclude files that actually have
internal dot TS as the last portion of
the name now when we say we actually get
in this internal folder inside of dist
but the only file that is inside is the
spec file which has some tests in it
this is just an example how we can make
our naming patterns more granular and
see would imagine just like we have
exclude we can have include property to
see how it's gonna work
let's delete our dist folder i learned
interesting fact that TS compiler does
not remove files from any folders it can
overwrite existing files but it will not
remove remove any old files for us so
this is just design functionality of the
compiler this time let's save and see
what we are getting
just like our configuration file states
we are getting file with name two
ts and the secret internal file that we
specified in the configuration in more
complex projects we might want to use a
combination of both exclude and include
options so let's say we are adding this
include statement we will say that we
want to include the whole source folder
and now if we look closely we will see
that we are including the whole the
folder then we want to specifically
include everything inside of internal
that has spec to it at the same time we
are excluding the file and excluding
internal content that has internal dot
TS as the end portion of the file name
let's see if this works ok just as we
expected we have to dot TS excluded we
have everything that ends with internal
that TS excluded but at the same time we
have dot spec that TS included inside of
internal folder in addition to asterisk
you can also use question mark to
specify the unknown character inside of
the filename so let's come back to this
simpler version of exclude only and we
will imagine that we want to exclude all
files that have three characters in the
name of the file at this moment we
expect both one that TS and two that t
as not to be included in the folder and
since we have sort of a flat structure
of our project at this point just one
folder the internal folder itself was
dropped from the compiled version of the
code there is one more option that can
be used to control which files are
getting into the compilation process and
this one is simply called files it can
again take an array of strings but this
time those strings they have to be
absolute or relative path to the file we
cannot use glob patterns to specify file
names so let's say we want to tell our
compiler to include source slash one
that TS and we expect on with this file
to be included into the compiled version
of our code
should also remember that if we don't
specify files include or exclude
properties typescript compiler about by
default will take everything that is
inside of our parent directory the same
directory where tasks config file itself
is located so if we don't specify
anything everything will go into the
compilation but compiler is pretty smart
it's not going to take out directory
that we specified but if we don't
specify our directory compiler will put
compiled version of JavaScript right
next to the file so to illustrate that
let's remove it it's also remove dist
so we are not getting confused by it and
you can see that compiled version of
files are just sitting next to the
original typescript files now we're
going to have to remove them manually
since just like I said compiler does not
remove any files in this video I also
wanted to cover two more compiler
options one of them is no omit option of
course by default it sets it is set to
false since we want to emit JavaScript
files out of our compilation process but
we can set it to true and now our
typescript compiler are not gonna admit
anything but still we are having our
type checking enabled so let's say we
are trying to pass something into our
function it will tell us the problem
that we have but no actual JavaScript
will be emitted another one which is
similar to no Amit it's called no limit
on error let's also set it to true and
we will fix the error that we created
here so this time since we don't have
any problems with our typescript code
this folder was generated but if we do
have some problem put back this bad
input into the main function yes we see
compilation is completed but nothing was
generated which means our files will not
be overwritten with bad input
illustrate that let me put back the dist
folder back right now our main function
is in good shape if we break it here and
save after compilation one that GS was
not changed to the bad version of our
code so those are two more useful
options for our compiler configuration
today we have learned how to control
which files are getting into our
compilation process of that script
compiler we also learned about no omit
and no omit on error options that could
be useful to fine-tune our compilation
configuration thank you for watching if
