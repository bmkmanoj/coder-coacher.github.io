typescript fundamental series and today
we're going to be talking about no and
undefined types and we will see how
control flow analysis can help us to
write a better code in typescript 2.0
two distinct types of null and undefined
were introduced previously both null and
undefined were always subtypes of
another type it was possible to assign
them to every type which means that it
was not possible to catch errors related
to misuse of them with typescript 2.0 we
get a way to change this behavior using
another option of typescript compiler
but before doing that let's see how
typescript behaves without strict null
checking using the default behavior to
do this let's go to our good old rainbow
application it's usually you can get the
source code of today's lesson at
electronics slash rainbow and the stuff
that we'll be talking about today will
be under branch null and undefined check
so just check out this branch in case
you want to see the end result of
today's lesson we are back in F dot ts
file of our project and let's see on the
example of document get element by ID
what kind of problems non-strict null
checking
may introduce in our application if you
hover over app component variable right
here you will see that in third type of
this variable is HTML element it is of
course expected since document that get
element by ID is expected to give us a
reference of HTML element if it exists
in our dome when I was saying at the
beginning that no and undefined can be
assigned to any variable it meant this
even though type inference of F
component variable is HTML element
typescript compiler is not complain
in here because we assigned now of
course it does not make any practical
sense to do it here but just to prove
the fact that by default
typescript treats no and undefined a
subtype of any type so let's go back to
more practical case we all understand
the fact that there is no guarantee that
document that get element by ID will
return us an element let's say if I did
that we are looking for does not exist
in our document it will surely cause us
some problems so we will run our
typescript compiler in watch mode so
let's go into web browser and see what
happens to our application if we refresh
the page will get error right here
saying that type error happened and now
is not an object of course at this point
of application app component variable is
actually not HTML element but it is now
and issue like this would cause a
problem during the runtime of our
application type scripts new feature is
here to help us avoid such runtime
errors let's see how strict null checks
can improve the quality of our code will
go into TF config file and we will add
another option here called strict null
checks we'll set it to true so this
option give us both strict now and
strict undefined checking in order to
put it in to the fact you might need to
relaunch your text editor so we are back
and if we go back to at that TS file we
will notice that we have this underlined
under app component reference and it's
telling us that object is possibly now
right now we see combination of control
flow analysis with strict no checking
and what a wonderful feature this is
because we can catch this error before
run time during authoring of our code so
what control flow
analysis is doing is going through our
statements to our assignments if-else
statements switch cases and analyzes
what can go wrong so in order to take
this problem all we have to do is to put
this if statement to protect the
possibility of AB component value to be
false e so wrap this assignment into if
statement and now this warning has
disappeared let's put the reference of
element ID back and check if our
application is working fine yes it is
good even if we change it back to the
wrong value we will not see the error
message because this statement is never
executed and again if we hover over app
component variable we will see that now
it has Union type of HTML element or no
the interesting thing is that if we go
further and we pass if statement now
inside of this if statement F combined
has type of HTML element only this is
the case where control flow analysis is
helping us just like now
undefined also became a distinct type
but at the same time it is separate from
now so we cannot use now and undefined
interchangeably let's illustrate this by
creating this dummy variable a and we'll
assign the value of undefined it will
have inferred type of undefined sign now
if we try to reassign this value to know
it will give us an error saying that now
is not assignable to type undefined to
see the practical utilization of strict
undefined checking let's play a little
bit with function parameters let's clean
this and we will make our interval int
variable here as an optional parameter
in order to do that we're going to have
to
at the question mark right before
semicolon but first let's double-check
what type it has assigned right now so
we see it is a number exactly what we
wanted but it will make it optional
parameter now we'll see that the type
annotation turn to number or undefined
which is Union type in our case it is
working well since set interval function
can work without this value at all when
we hover over we will see that the
interval of time out is optional
parameter while we here we also can see
another prevention of error let's say if
we are using the default parameter of
our function which is 1 and 15 feature
of 1500 here he'll again tell us that
parameter cannot have question mark and
initializer at the same time because
right now in this case it will never be
undefined and in this case this question
mark does not make any sense
so even though strict null checks is not
a default option of typescript compiler
I would definitely recommend to have
this option set to true if you start a
new project let's go back and see what
we have learned in today's lesson we
found out that null and undefined became
a distinct types in typescript 2.0 and
how we can enable strict checking for
those two types we have seen how control
flow analysis can help us prevent
runtime errors in our application please
