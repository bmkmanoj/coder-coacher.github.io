fundamentals and today we will continue
our discussion about classes in
typescript this time we will learn how
extends and implement keywords work and
also how to use access modifiers in
previous video we created our first app
class we learned how to use instance and
Static properties and created first
methods of our class this time let's
imagine situation that we have more
complex app and we want to have some
sort of base class for our application
so let's go ahead and create another
class we'll call it simply component
this class will have a log method this
log method will just print a statement
that component was created and this
method will be called in constructor
function which means every time
component gets extent sheeted the string
should be console logged this moment
component and app class are not related
to each other in any way to create this
relationship we're going to have to
change our app class definition just for
this example let's remove reference to
our interface we can actually remove
that interface completely and now we're
going to use the extends keyword and our
app class obviously will extend
component class and in order to execute
the base component constructor you're
going to have to call a special method
that is given to us as part of es6 class
syntax
we'll call the super method inside super
method will in turn call the constructor
of this base component class let's save
it and go ahead into our browser and see
if component that created message is
printed out here is our message let's
let's refresh the page to see the
message gets printed because our app
class was instantiate and the base
constructor was called intern expense
keyword provides us a mechanism to
create a prototype link between
component and F
create another method so we can better
see how prototype of component is
accessed in app instance we'll create
this silly function Who am I and we'll
just console.log a message and basically
a component will fix the quotation
actually a better practice to use double
quotes for all your strings at least I
feel like it is better and now on our
app instance we'll call that method see
we are getting this prompt here Who am I
which is a method we'll call it save it
compilation went to fine in our browser
will refresh the page let's check our
messages that we are getting let's clear
it up the fresh again component got
created and now our app is saying that
it is basically a component and instance
of the component to illustrate it even
better let's go to typescript playground
in our browser and here we see I have
copy pasted the same class component and
app component and app class which
extends component and if we see here the
transpiled version always doing it sets
prototype of component into our app
there is a fancy way of doing it right
here and prototype linkage is definitely
the topic for separate discussion I will
clean up our code a little so we can
better see how we can use implements
keyboard in our app class remember that
our app class has start on a net method
and let's try to do something
interesting will put start on a net
function inside of our component class
but as you see it's actually not doing
anything but now having this we can use
implements keyword little super because
we don't extend anything so you remember
we were able to do something similar
with interfaces and let's imagine that
our start on a knit function in our app
class take some random parameter but in
our component class we have not
specified that and right now we can see
that
it's actually checking for the shape of
the data that is in our app class and
it's saying that class add incorrectly
implements interface component this is
interesting we created a class component
but it says that we have not implemented
correctly interface the fact is that in
typescript once class is created you're
also automatically getting the interface
that describes the shape of this class
and when we use implements keyword it
gives us a way to use another class as
interface so we'll fix this we'll put
some parameter in here now everything
looks good obviously in our case start
on a net function inside of component
class is not doing anything so it would
make much more sense to change the class
component into interface it would remove
those curly braces now it would function
exactly the same but as we remember
interface is not getting turned into
anything inside of our compiled code so
if we place it here and do implements we
are not getting any signs of component
into our compiled code which means if we
want just to describe the shape of a
data we should use interface but it's
always good to remember that we can
implement other classes now let's talk
about access modifiers we will once
again clean up our code since we don't
need it for this exercise we'll talk
about public and private access
modifiers by default every property and
every method inside of our class is
public which means that we can access it
pretty much anywhere meaning inside of
our class and also outside as aesthetic
or instance properties so let's try to
play around with those access modifier
keywords
go ahead and add public for our element
ID property as you can see we can use
both keywords here public and static but
at the same time we cannot switch them
around you see public should go first
just
something to remember right now the
behavior of element ID property is not
changed at all since we are using public
key word and every property is public by
default but we have a choice to
explicitly put it let's do the same for
our start arm unit function you remember
we actually need this method to be
public because we use it here in our FPS
file and we call this method on our app
instance so far everything is good it
works just the way it did before
but let's change this to private now if
we go to app that TS you will see that
we're having a problem here since
property start on a net is private and
only accessible within a class as you
remember there is no good way of
creating private private properties of
our objects in plain JavaScript of
course we can do some hacks with if ease
and other mechanisms but there is no
true way of creating private properties
so let's see what happens when our code
gets transpile once again let's copy
this class we'll paste it inside of
typescript playground to see how it
looks
you can tell right away that nothing has
changed for start on an it function it
looks the same way than before and the
thing is that those access modifiers
it's compiled time only construct so if
we remove it nothing gets changed so
private or public keywords they exist
only in typescript environment and our
visual studio code is checking for us if
we use properties in the right way as
its intended so let's change it back to
public but at the same time our element
ID could be private
since we don't access it anywhere
outside of our class itself the same
applies for interval and style
properties another option that we have
for our access modifiers is protected
keyword let's see how it works so we'll
change public to protected
at this point it acts pretty much the
same as private access modifier so as
you see we cannot use it as a public
method we cannot use it outside of our
earth class but the interesting fact is
that we can use this method in child
classes of our app class so what we
going to do we will create another class
my app which extends app and let's say
in our constructor will try to access
start on init function will go super so
type script not complaining and inside
of this we will call this that and as
you see it prompts us to use start on a
net method so we can call it right here
and it should work just for the
experiment let's change this to private
and SEC it became truly private since we
don't even have an option to access
inside of a child class of app so this
is the difference between private and
protected the final access modifier that
we are going to look at today is
read-only so let's go ahead and add
read-only modifier to our element ID as
you see we can have 3 of them together
private static and read only for one
property which is cool and again if we
try to mix it around it will fail now
let's go ahead and try to reassign the
value of element ID the thing that we
have to remind remember that this
property is static so we have to access
it on the app class itself so in slide
of our start on an end function we will
imagine that for some reason we want to
change the element ID value so we will
try to assign it to something different
as you see it is not letting us do that
but it says that we cannot assign it we
can apply the same read-only modifier
for any other property inside of our
class so it's not only applicable to
static properties we have learned a lot
about classes over the last two videos
in part 1 we have seen how to define
properties and methods what is the
difference between static and instance
properties and in current video we
figure
what extends and implements keywords do
and how we can use access modifiers in
our classes and subclasses if you like
