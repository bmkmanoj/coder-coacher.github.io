Amazon Web Services in this video we are
going to create a ec2 instance and log
into that ec2 virtual machine from her
laptop basically from my laptop the
prerequisite for that is creation of an
AWS account inside aws.amazon.com you
just need to give your credit card
information initially two rupees will be
detected if you are from India and later
on this two rupees will be refunded back
this is just to validate the credit card
and the authenticity of our information
so I'll be showing you how we can log-in
to AWS and create a ec2 instance and
automatically log in to that particular
ec2 instance from the laptop using the
SSH command so let's see how we can do
that in this particular video rinse the
bell icon on the YouTube app and never
miss any update from tech primers this
is the AWS management console you can
log into the console when you are in
aws.amazon.com so it by default will
show you the login to console option you
can log into the console option you can
notice that there is a sign into the
console you can log into the console in
order to see this particular webpage and
you have lots of options as I mentioned
in the previous video you would have
seen lots of different options which I
showed from these services let's see the
major ones in this series so in this
particular video I am going to show you
how you can create a ec2 instance in
order to create a ec2 instance we have
to go to services and go to this ec2
option ec2 is nothing but elastic
computing cloud so let me click on this
easy to option so once you click on the
ec2 option it takes you to a dashboard
so this is the ec2 dashboard where it
shows all the different ec2 instances
and the regions where
they are present currently if you see
there is zero ec2 instance running in
this particular data center so currently
I am in the data center North Virginia
and there is nothing here some time back
I had created a ec2 instance in another
data center and I was just trying out
stuff so I will just show you that so if
I show if I go to 0 running instances it
shows the see if you see here I had
terminated one easy to instance which is
present in a different data center so
this data center is in Ohio I have now
selected North Virginia so that I can
show you that you can create different
easy two instances in different data
centers and you can individually login
to them separately so let's click on the
launch instance so this launch instance
option is going to set up the whole ec2
instance for us and I wanted a Linux
machine to be installed in this
particular instance so basically what I
am doing here now is I'm just buying a
machine so I'm just buying a machine
dedicated for our login so that's what I
am going to do now in order to do that
you can click on that launch instance
option and it will take you to the
series of steps let's see what are these
steps so we are going to select the
image which needs to be installed in
that particular server which we are
going to buy and the image is called
Amazon machine image which can be
installed in the Amazon infrastructure
so I'm going to use the Ubuntu version I
wanted a one two server you have Red Hat
server you have Amazon Linux as well and
there are various other options for
example windows options as well so you
can even create a ec2 instance which is
windows-based so you can even have
Microsoft Windows Server there I now
wanted her you want to server so I am
just selecting this particular option
and it is eligible for free so the next
option is the instance type now that we
have selected what image needs to be
instant basically what oh s needs to be
installed now I need to provide what is
the memory or the configuration for this
particular ec2 instance I am going to
use the default one for the free tire
eligible so it is going to be
g/b and one virtual CPU so I'll be
selecting that if let's say you are
buying it or if you are using it in your
company you can go for large or
extra-large options which has different
memory sizes based on your need you can
go there I'm just selecting the micro
one so I just selected that already and
I'm clicking on the next configure
instance detail option so this takes to
me to the next step which says configure
the number of instances you need I know
need only one instance if you need more
instances you can just scale it here I'm
just going to say I need only one
instance and I'm going not going to
change any other option here so let's
not change any other option if you are
having more customized requirements then
you can come here and then assign roles
to each and every instance so right now
if you see here there is no role
assigned so you can create a security
group and then you can assign roles to
the instances separately I'm not going
to do that now let's go to the next
option the next option is choosing the
storage so now we bought a machine we
bought the we got the image so we have
mentioned all these we also mentioned
how many instances we wanted now we can
mention what type of storage we need for
that particular machine so by default it
provides the SSD so I'm just going to
say ok and it provides 8 gig of space if
you want more space you can just do that
so if you see free tire eligible
customers can get to 30 gig space or
magnetic storage so I'll just give a GB
because I don't need much there right
now we are just going to do basic stuff
right so I'll just keep it as such you
can even add more volumes if you need
you can add more volumes if you like
we're in the same host or the instance
now let's go to the next option the next
option is adding tags so these tags are
nothing but you can identify ec2
instances based on tags if you have more
ec2 instances in your data center you
can tag these with a name and then you
can identify so you can have different
key value pairs which can be provided
I'm just going to use a common one which
people use which is nothing but the name
and I'm going to call it ec2
instance underscore two because I
already had created one ec2 instance in
a different data center which I showed
you just for my reference I am just
going it going to name it as two so that
I know there is already a different ec2
instance in a different data center
so I'll just say next now this shows up
the security group this is how you can
control the accessibility for your
virtual machine you can have different
types of connections controlled here so
if you had worked on access control
routes for your WebSphere or Tomcat or
any spring security based application
you provide security for your
application right so this is nothing but
security party host you can provide
security at different levels for your
hosts so there are different types of
security rules you can say I want only
ssh traffic to be enabled or I want only
HTTP traffic to be enabled or something
similar so you can control the ec2
instances based on these type of
security types I'm just going to say all
traffic for now so that we don't have
any objection and logging in you can
just enable SSH if you if you need to
login only to the Machine and not do
anything else if you need SSH HTTP HTTPS
you can individually do that as well but
in production people are not suggested
to use all traffic but since this is the
demo I am just going to use all traffic
the next one is the protocol by default
it got selected as all because I
selected all traffic the port range is
complete the source could be from a
particular IP we can mention our soaps
IP address this will enable the
connections only from a particular IP
address but I am just going to mention
anywhere so that any from anywhere I
will be able to log into this particular
machine so that's what I'm going to do
here I'll just select anywhere and let
me give a description for this
particular security code I'll just give
all traffic so that I can differentiate
and I
what kind of security group this
particular easy to instance has let me
go to the next option which is the last
and the final reviewing place where you
can edit the options which we have
selected previously I can just see what
all options we have selected here I'm
just going to say proceed because we
just went through this now right so this
is the important step in the ec2
instance creation there the password is
going to be given to us so this is not a
password as such but this is a key value
fare file so Amazon is going to give you
a private key and we need to use that by
a private key to connect to Amazon every
time so we need to secure this file I'm
just going to ask Amazon to create a new
key file and I'll just name it as ec2
instance underscore 2 because that is
the name of my ec2 instance so I'm just
going to use a different key value pair
file so basically this will generate a
key file so I will just say download
keeper this will generate a private key
and a public key and the private key
will be given to us and the public key
will be present inside the Amazon
instance so I have the key downloaded
here so it is present in my downloads
option so we'll I'll show you why and
when we will use it now the next option
is to click on the launch instance so
this launch instances is going to create
the whole virtual machine right now in
front of us based on the configurations
which we provided in these steps so I'm
just clicking on the launch instance
option so this is now creating the
instances as we talk and I can go to
this particular option it says following
instance launches have been initiated
let me click on that and see how it how
the initialization is progressing and
you can notice that the instance state
is pending so basically this is getting
created currently as we talked all the
images are getting built the spaces are
getting mounted so literally a Linux
machine or a Linux server is getting
built right now with the configurations
which we provided so let's wait for this
particular instance to get completed
meanwhile what we can do is I think
there is no connection option enabled
right so but I will just
show you what we can do from this UI so
there is an option called actions and
using the actions you can control the
instance so for example now if you see
the instance is up so you can stop
reboot terminate you can do all those
stuff here so this is like literally so
I don't do anything so this is like
literally killing your Linux machine so
imagine that you have a deployment
manager UI and you are going to be able
to stop and start in the next service
that is what this is
you can even terminate the Machine and
later reinstated so terminating the
machine will remove all the relevant
files which are present inside that
particular virtual machine and when you
reinstated it will recreate a whole
instance with the same configuration
which you have provided initially so
right now if you see the machine is up
and we have our in each instance up and
running let's try connecting to this
particular machine right I'll click on
the connect option once I click on the
connect option I get these steps for
connecting to the instance so the
initial step it says is you can use
putty to connect to the Amazon server
but I am NOT going to use putty I have
by default terminal in my laptop in in
OS X I have by default terminal which is
exactly similar to pootie if you are
using Windows I would suggest you to use
putty download putty and then install it
right and we already have the
certificate file downloaded right the
key find the private key file basically
so what Amazon suggests has to do is
reduce the permission for this
particular file to only us so we need to
restrict the permission for this
particular key file so let's do that
right I'll just open the terminal
and just say easy to Stearns and see
that I have the file here right yeah so
I have the file here I need to restrict
this particular file to only me so I'll
just say chmod 400 and a c2 instance
underscore 2 dot p.m. so I have changed
the permission for this particular file
so nobody else except me can access this
file now in order to connect to this
machine which we created this is the URL
for our machine and in order to connect
using SSH I need to use this command so
basically I'm using the certificate
which is present here and I'm connecting
to the machine so I just do SSH - I
provide the private key and I provide
something called Ubuntu at the Machine
name so Ubuntu is the default login
which is provided for us so that you can
login to the Amazon ec2 instance which
we created so it is asking me to say if
it is a secure connection and just say
yes so this is going to login us into
the machine see that we are logged into
the machine and let me do a clear so if
you see here this is how we are logged
in so we are logged in to coupon -
username and the directory which we are
in is home slash Ubuntu so we are
literally logged in to the Amazon server
right we are logged in to the ec2
instance which we have created just now
so let me do a hostname so if you see
here this is how the hostname is you so
let's try doing nslookup so I even I
didn't try doing nslookup in a looker
just to clear
you
so it shows an IP address this is the IP
address and I think in the IP address is
mentioned here so I thought it's a
different IP address but looks like the
host name it comes up with the IP
address and it is exactly the same right
so this is the external IP address which
we are connecting to now let's come back
to the console here right so if you want
to stop this particular machine you can
use the actions and then stop meanwhile
let's come back here and you can see
that we have access to create file so
I'm just going to say I'm just going to
create a file called hello dot SH and
let's try running a script file right
I'm just going to say hello YouTube so
usually we do a hello world right so I
prefer hello YouTube because YouTube is
our primary audience right so I'm just
going to create that I will just give
some permission for this particular file
for now I'll just say 777 and I can run
like any other Linux machine I can run
all the commands which I know and you
can see that I just created a script
file and then I did a hello world hello
YouTube basically so this is how you can
login to the Amazon ec2 instance and you
can create stuff you can even install
lots of middleware components like if
let's say you want Tomcat you can
install it with the 8 GB space you can
do whatever you want in this particular
easy to instance and if let's say you
terminate this instance so what happens
right so let's try stopping this
instance so I will just go to instance
and then stop so when I stop this
instance the machine gets literally shut
down so if you see here already we got a
message saying connection has been
closed and it just came out this is
because Amazon received a stop
connection from our UI and then it has
shut down the machine so basically this
is like shutting down your system or the
computer right so that is what happened
so and it if you see here it is showing
is stopping so let it get completely
stopped and let's try restarting again
so whatever file we created this file
should stay there because we just shut
down the machine right so we did not
terminate the machine terminating a
machine will remove all the files inside
that particular instance which was there
but when you do a shutdown and start it
should not Glade files in that
particular easy to instance so let's
wait for this guy to shut down
completely basically stop yeah it is
stopped completely now let's try
starting it again and then let's try
logging in so that we can see what is
the state of the server now
you can even use these options which are
present here if you see here there are
status checks there are monitoring
options here which can show you what is
happening in these servers so right now
it's just new server right so there is
nothing here but maybe we can see once
we have it running for a while and you
can see the tag here
whatever tags we have added we can see
it here you can add more number of tags
you can tag it as a particular
application name or anything which you
need so these are like variables which
we will be using when you want to
identify a server so right now the
server is back again it's showing
running let's try running it connecting
again with our SSH key now it should
directly take us to the machine clear
you
so now we are able to connect it I think
we have to use the command every time so
I just say yes so we are able to login
now let's see if our file is present
here yep we have the same file and let's
try running that hello YouTube yeah so
her file stays there now let's try
terminating this particular machine
right let's try hitting it and let's see
what happens if you do a reboot it will
just do a stop and start
it's like restarting our mobile right so
let's try terminating this I will just
try terminating and let's see what
happens after termination because we had
a file created in this machine right and
let's see what happens to this
particular file whether the particular
file stays there or whether it is
getting removed
yeah the instance now shows as
terminated state
if you notice here we are not able to
start the instance we are not able to
stop
neither we are not able to we are able
to do anything we just can't see the
system log at max so what happened there
that's all it shows I don't think there
is anything which is useful for us it's
just showing what happened inside the
machine yeah it's just powered on now
how do we reinstate this machine so you
will have to create a new instance based
on a template we did not create any
template so we will have to create a new
instance which is not ideal right so
which is which cannot be done so we will
have to go to the launch instance option
and then select again the new instance
and then use it right so this is how you
can create an easy-to instance and you
can stop and start so once you terminate
a instance you cannot login to that
particular instance and you cannot
recover the files so if you are going to
recreate instances every now and then
you can create the template you can
create a launch template and then you
can create that every time so we can
create a common template you can throw
out all the details here and then you
can just click a button and the ec2
instances will be created on the fly so
this is how you can use Amazon AWS
management console to create a easy-to
instance and log in from our terminal
from our laptop I hope you found this
interesting in the next video we will be
are trying to deploy a web service into
the ec2 instance so we just created I
see two instance in this particular
video in the next video we will try to
deploy a spring boot application into
this particular instance which we
created that's it for this particular
video if you liked the video go ahead
and like it if you haven't subscribed to
the channel go ahead and subscribe to it
wait you again in the next video thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
