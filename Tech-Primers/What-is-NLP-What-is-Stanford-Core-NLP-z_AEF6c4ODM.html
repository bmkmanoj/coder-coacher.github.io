are going to see what is the NLP and
what are the different libraries which
are available and we are going to pick
one letter in we we are going to see how
it uses NLP okay so as the name suggests
NLP stands for natural language
processing so right now I have the
Wikipedia page so if you read about NLP
already so you might know that NLP is
nothing but making your mission
understand what we speak so as a human
right so when we talk in some language
and even if we have any mistakes in the
way we speak or the way we speak varies
from person to person right so I might
ask a question which the same question
can be asked by somebody else
in a different form so how is the
computer able to process that and how is
it able to relate it so that is the way
with which we process the language so
that is why natural language processing
is liquid because as a human or brain is
able to process the messages and it is
able to identify that okay it is the
same question and I need to give the
same response so so how will we make our
computer understand that so that is what
that is why we use natural language
processing for for making use of
computer to understand what we speak and
how is it able to understand and take
decisions based on the question which we
have asked okay so that is in general
what is natural language processing so
there are lots of libraries for natural
language processing and these libraries
are evolving right so it's right now you
see they are not there completely
achieved whatever we ask we can respond
in terms of machine language but people
are working on it so for example
Stanford has a has created a library
called core NLP so the Stanford
University has created a library called
core NLP so that is a natural language
processing library so you can use that
as a jar or dependent in your project
and you can use that library to achieve
natural language processing capabilities
so right now we will we are going to see
what is
this natural language processing all
about so what do we do so what what is
this core NLP does say so the scoring
will be is like a library as I said so
it's just toolkit which has lots of
analytical tools so in order to
understand the question or in order to
understand the sentence right we need to
break that sound and make make the
system understand what what it is
relating to and what is the context and
we need to arrive at those stuff right
so for that there are different tools
and different sets of analysis right for
example these are the three different
analysis which core and LP does so one
is the named entity recognition the
other is the core reference and the last
one is the basic dependencies so what
these relate to is if let's say there is
a sentence or a P if there is a sentence
which your program is going to read
let's say your program is going to read
a book right so in that is what is the
first paragraph denotes a so when it
starts reading when the program starts
reading it needs to identify okay what
is the location at what is the person
what is this is there any date or is
there any day or is there any time or
what are the other scenes which are
relevant to what so those kinds of
things are the named entity recognition
so if you see this particular example
president of China on this first visit
state visit to United States show off is
a similarity with American history and
pop culture on Tuesday night so if you
notice here this if you give this
particular sentence to the named entity
recognition algorithm so it is going to
split the sentence and give each of the
themes or each of the words to the
corresponding entity which it maps to so
for example it has identified this is
the name of a person this is a location
this is just sorting them and it has
identified Tuesday as a date and night
as a time so these are the intelligence
capabilities for the algorithm for
identify that from a sentence these are
this is what this is right so this is
this type is called named entity
recognition same way for core reference
how is the sentence related so so most
of the time let's say we ask a question
to a system that I hope you see there
are lots of bots in the internet right
so you ask a question it forgets what
you asked some time back so it needs to
have a
relation it's the same way inside a
single sentence we this particular
algorithm will identify the correlation
between different sentences or different
words in the same sentence or maybe
across sentences right so that is
co-reference
the last one is the basic dependency so
how each word is related to or dependent
on others right so that is the basic
dependencies so these these three are
different tools for processing these
sentences so based on that we can come
up with different use cases for example
let's say let us take a typical use case
write Siri or Google Google nouns so
when you say a sentence Google is going
to do the same thing so they are going
to analyze your sentence and identify
okay what what is it what is that the
key word which we want to look for in
that particular sentence or what the
waters use are trying to ask or what are
these are trying to tell to us so that
is how they identify so this these are
the different types of algorithms or
tools with which they process through
the scan through the sentence which we
tell and then based on that they arrive
at a conclusion that okay this is what
we are we are asked to do so if they are
not able to identify that's when they
ask more further questions so that they
can proceed further so this is the core
processing logic of an natural language
processing system right so you you need
to break down a sentence into different
parts and based on that you need to take
actions right so that is the core
concept of NLP so we will see an example
with coronel peas or in the next video
what I will do is I will create a small
Java project which is course and
Stanford core NLP library and they will
pass a sentence and we will see how this
sentence is getting transformed into
different algorithms and base of that
based on that result set we will be able
to process or take actions based on that
so that's what we are going to see in
the next video so right now we saw what
is NLP so NLP is nothing but natural
language processing okay and Stanford
NLP is giving a library called core and
lt so it can scan through any sentence
or you can give it a PDF you can give it
a sentence or you can give even a text
text by Q control
those can processors messages and then
it can come up with suggestions saying
okay these are T and do whatever you
want with those okay so that is what the
core and LP library does and if you have
any questions are about NLP you can drop
that in the comments below if you liked
the video go ahead and like it if you
haven't subscribed to the channel go
ahead and subscribe meet again in the
next video thank you
