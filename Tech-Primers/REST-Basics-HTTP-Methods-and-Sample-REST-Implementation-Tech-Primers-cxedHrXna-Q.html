your chance to know the basics of trust
in this particular video we are going to
see what is this what are the basics of
press and HTTP and what are the
different maturity models which are
there for creating a rest application
let's get started
press the bell liken on the YouTube app
and never miss any update from tech
primers so the agenda for this
particular session is what is risk
what is HTTP what are the different risk
constraints a sample dressed
implementation and also the Richardson
maturity model which explains what are
the different types of levels which are
there when we are creating a rest
application let's see each of these
separately so what is the risk rest is
nothing but representational state
transfer if you know about rest rest is
just an architectural style it is
nothing else it is not a framework it is
not a library to learn it is an
architectural style so you can create
rest applications in Python you can
create rest applications in Java you can
create it in Scala you can create it in
Ruby or any language the rest is just an
architectural style there is no
underlying language framework or library
associated with it it is just an
architectural style it uses the HTTP
protocol under the architectural style
so HTTP protocol is wrapped around the
rest so it is wrapped with a concept
which is called the arrest and that is
an architectural stand if you know about
Taj Mahal it is one of the world wonders
if you know it is an architectural style
underneath the Taj Mahal is the
preserved body of memcache the wife of
Shah Jahan who built Taj Mahal however
you see Taj Mahal as an architectural
style because of the way it is built but
underneath it's like a monument or it is
created as a remembrance for somebody
right same way wrist is an architectural
type so in order to know about rest we
need to understand the basics of HTTP as
well
we need to understand what are the
different HTTP methods which are out
there to create arrest implementations
these are different rest HTTP methods
these are hash shipping methods in
itself these are not specific to rest if
you go to any website if you go to any
browser you can see through these
different methods so these are called
methods or requests let's see that with
an example right
I have google.com open here I'm going to
inspect this page so that I can show you
how this is coming in so let me go to
Network I'll just refresh this page I'm
not going to do anything else I have
just refreshed google.com and I see that
there are so many requests which which
came here right which went and came and
you see that these are different tabs
here so the status is nothing but the
status of that particular request from
the browser to the background or
whatever and these things are done using
the HTTP protocol because the backend if
you see here this is a should EBS to be
specific right so it is HTTP protocol so
if I click on this particular request I
have some options here and if you notice
here there is an option called request
method and it says get so this is
nothing but the method which is out
there in the HTTP here so there are
different types of method get post put
delete and head so if you notice this is
using get method if I need to show you
some post rate so if you notice this one
is a post method so this is generating
some token or something so it is having
a post method here so like once every
request which is associated to a history
AP protocol will have a request method
associated with it it could be either
gate it could be either post or put or
delete or even head so when do we need
get right so gate is usually a cashable
command so you can use gate when you
want to catch something in the browser
side as well
if you send some additional parameters
to the request then you will be able to
cache it so for example there is a
parameter called cache control here
this parameter is right now set to max
ages zero that means there is nothing
which is cashed in the request so we
won't be able to catch it so you can do
that using get if it is post we
generally used post if we are sending a
request or when we want to write
something that is when we used post or
if you want to generate something or you
want to create something that's when we
use pour so similarly how Google used
here is they are generating some token
out of it out of the records which I
sent that is when they are using force
here put is something similar put a
similar to post you can create that but
if you want to have a differentiation
between an update and an create that's
when you go for put what you can do is
you can do create using put and you can
do an update using post that is when
people go for post versus put delete has
been it straight away clear right when
you want to delete some data you can
directly use the HTTP delete method head
is used when we want to request or when
we want to get the response status only
and the header information from the
server but we don't need the body that's
when we use head so we want to send a
request we just need the header
information we don't need the response
or the body information that's when we
use head right so these are different
HTTP methods which are out there which
we will be using inside the rest
protocol as well because the underlying
protocol which rest uses is HTTP now
what are the different constraints
inside rest when we want to create rest
implementation what are the different
constraints which we need to consider
while designing a rest application the
first one is the client-server
implementation the rest constraint says
that we need to have a client-server
based application when we are using rest
basically you have a client you have a
server and the client requires the
server for any information and the
server should be able to respond to
decline separately instead of having a
single monolithic application you should
have a client specifically and you
should have a server that's when the
rest implementation would make sense
because the server doesn't know what is
a client doing
it just asks for an information and the
server just gives that typical example
would be lets say user information is
stored in a database you have a database
process or the backend process which is
going to be implemented with the rest
and you have a UI from the UI you will
be sending a request to say show user
and this back-end server will go to the
database and retrieve that information
and then return it back to the user so
the client will not know what is
happening in the server the server will
not know what is decline doing across so
it will just respond to some message
based on the type of query the client is
asking the server will be able to
respond so that is how you should define
or design an application using the
client-server model so if you have
already worked on client-server based
modeling then you don't have to worry
about it you already know what is a
client you already know what is a server
it is exactly the same
underneath the client-server why we did
that because of the separation of
concerns as I said the example right the
service responsibility is just to fish
the data from the database and that is
what the server's responsibility is the
clients responsibility is just to
collate the data and show it up to the
user that's what the client does same
way on the server side you can split the
server into different distributed
systems let's say you have a user
request service then you have a payment
service then you have an inventory
service or something like that you can
have separation of services so that it's
easy for us to directly query each
service and that is how micro services
design patterns works natively so if you
know about the service based
architecture also visited architecture
or if you go to distributed architecture
the services are split based on their
functionality so rest is used more most
often when you have like micro services
design pattern or distributed systems
where you have client-server
architecture and the servers are all
split based on their functionality that
way you have a separate separation of
concern for each specific process the
next constraint is stateless the rest
endpoints should be stateless what it
means is that if let's say there are
multiple clients which are accessing the
same server every client should get the
same response let's say there is a user
who is requesting the server to give
some information at one point the youth
server should be able to give the same
information for all the clients which
came at the same time right that is when
you don't maintain a strength in the
server side so maintaining a state in
the sense you just record something and
then based on that you respond to the
user so we should not have any stateful
information the rest should be stateless
so when you query something you should
get that response every time you
shouldn't be having different logic for
different clients so that is how the
rest should be designed it should be
stateless
trouble husband so if you have any
caching logic on the client-side let's
say the client wanted to have a caching
logic you should be able to cache that
so that the client has flexibility to
cache the data and if they don't want to
catch the data they should be able to
decide whether they want to cache it or
not
uniform interface what do we mean by
uniform interface right so we can
identify resources using some common set
of names or something similar which we
will be seeing in the next few slides
however uniform interface is something
there you can easily identify your rs.10
points based on the type of
functionality you have for example if
there is a user you should be able to
identify the features of the user under
the user resource so we will see what is
a resource so based on that your
constraint should be aligned so that is
what unify so interface mean
identification of resources should be
easily available for us the next one is
the representation how do we represent
that particular method so either it is I
guess get or a post or a put or a delete
however we wanted SIL descriptive
messages how should the sources name
look like so it should be Shilpa
scripting if you are going to add a user
it should be user or you can say add
user it depends on how you wanted it to
be some people use directly user
some people use add user delete user
separately however the general notion is
it should be self descriptive and we
will see that in the future why we
should do add user or why patient nor do
we add user or something like that in
the next few slides the last one is the
hypertext as the engine of application
state so if you were heard about hey TOS
that is another way of linking two
different rest endpoints in the same
resistant point so you have a single
restrain point you will trigger that
particular restrain point inside that
particular resistant corn you have links
to the subsequent URLs so that is a TOS
the last one is the layered stream the
data should be layer so that the
processor should be able to easily talk
with each of the different components so
the implementation should be layer this
will restrict the knowledge in each
layer of the component so when we are
defining or designing an application we
should have different layers in the
application where you have segregations
of concerns so that you don't have to
talk with each and every part of the
application
restricts the knowledge in every layer
which we design one major disadvantage
of this particular layered system is
latency will be huge and it adds to the
load so it is typically overloaded
system you will have so much of hops you
will be doing so many a necessity
lookups that will be an additional
overhead in the layered system
so now we have talked about rest right
let's see a sample implementation about
rest this is a simple pet store example
swagger had exposed swagger UI and it is
the best example which I can show you if
I write a new application it is going to
take me so much time and I need to
create documentation around it
instead I just wanted to see an existing
implementation which is good and I found
out this particular example from the
swagger website which is called the pet
store this is the sample implementation
of the REST API and this is the swagger
UI which is just showing what are all
the rest endpoints which are available
on the server side if you notice here
this is the pet resource so this is
called a resource slash pain a resource
is nothing but a path from where it
starts so this pet resource is nothing
but a feature and you can notice that
this says everything about pets
so under pet you will have everything
about pet if you want to add a pet you
will be having a post see this right
there is the post with which you can add
a pet if you want to update a pet you
can do put if you want to get something
a gift a particular pet ID you can use
by a tip if you want to delete a pet ID
you can use via the same pet and you
just need to pass that using a different
shipping method so these are the
different HTTP methods based on that the
resources are changing and based on
these two combinations there will be
implementation so for post and slash
spirit there will be an implementation
on the server side the for the footbed
there will be an implementation on the
server side same way forget
delete as none and if you notice swagger
is just showing you what type of model
you are going to send and you can test
some data here itself if you want so
this is how you can design a rest server
and slash pet is a resource post is post
put get all these are the HTTP methods
and these are just the parameter types
there are other implementation as well
for example there is a store resource
there is a user resource where you have
lots of again methods user post you can
see this right you have different types
of implementation you have you have a
create with array create with lists then
you have a user login user lock out user
snatched a user name post put and delete
for all the same right
so this is a simple example of rest
implementation which you can do so if
you are not aware about how to design
interest implementation go take a look
at this particular website pet short
swagger Ohio where you can see an
implementation or an example of rest how
you should create the rest
implementation
the next one is the recession maturity
model this is the guide which was
created by Martin Fowler based on
Richardson's idea of breaking down the
principles of rest into three different
approaches we are going to see the model
the first one is the level zero so level
zero basically it doesn't do anything
in general what Martin father says that
is as a part of level 0 we should have
created a bear breakfast which can be of
any type it just needs to use the
internet to traverse so it can be HTTP
it can be remote procedure call and
anything as a part of the level zero
maturity model you should have a end
point exposed it can be anything so
let's say there is an end point called
add request we can expose that in
certain point with some technology that
is what level 0 is and this is the level
0 of the rest implementation level one
considers resource creation as we saw in
the previous sample example we should be
able to create different resources
example the add resource add inventory
or add account these are different
resources under that you have different
methods or different sub resources where
you have their own implementation so
this is when an application reaches a
level 1 maturity model then it is using
resources to have different end points
and it is not using a common endpoint
like in the previous case in the level 0
there was only an option called add
request which was adding all the users
inventory account information however in
the level 1 resource we have split that
into three different parts add user ad
inventory add account so this way you
have separate resources you can have
separate code you can have separate
implementation you will be able to
follow the constraints which we saw
right earlier the next one is the level
2 where we need to consider using HTTP
verbs so instead of adding the add user
we will be using a user that way under
the user you will have addition deletion
or updation happening same way for the
inventory and the accountants well that
way you know that it is simple to
understand rather than adding an add
user delete user or add user with array
or something big this way if you try to
create that by creating verbs then it is
easier for us to understand and the
resources are much simpler
level three is the hypermedia controls
if you know about the hit us
radius is nothing but 11 3 concept so
you have a rest endpoint let's say there
is a rest endpoint called slash user
slash 1 2 3 if I hit this particular get
request I'll be getting a response of a
particular user information and that
particular user information has links to
subsequent requests so for example here
I have linked to the account information
here so this is hyper media control so
using one request endpoint I have links
to subsequent rest endpoints I don't
have to remember these because I query
this and I get that particular link
automatically from here
this is phyto media controls so if your
application follows these three concept
then you are in the level 3 maturity
model this is what Martin folder has
created based on the concept developed
by leonardo jackson who created these
three concepts and martin fowler created
these as richardson maturity model so
that your application can be aligned to
these model and amenity process so what
did we discuss as a part of this
particular video we saw what is the best
we saw what is HTTP we saw the basics of
HTTP as well what are the different
constraints we saw a simple sample pet
store which was implemented using
interest we also saw what are the
richardson maturity model i hope you
guys understood the basics of rest from
this particular video if you have any
doubts or concerns to let me know in the
