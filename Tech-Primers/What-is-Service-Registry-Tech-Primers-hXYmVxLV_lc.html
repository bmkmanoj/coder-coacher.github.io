video we are going to see what is the
service registry and why do we need
service registry so if you see the
modern architecture so we deploy all our
applications into the cloud like so
these are called the micro services
right so for example let's consider this
particular case so we have an
application which has a client and we
have a REST API this is a server so
there are three instances of the server
deployed in our club however there is
only one client so this client is going
to access this these server so how will
the client know it has to access the
server right for example if you have a
client and if you see if there are three
instances of this application running
and these IP addresses will be assigned
dynamically by the cloud deployment so
how will the client know that it has to
connect to a particular REST API
instance so that is why we need a
service registry so what the service
registry does so all these clients needs
to be registered to a common process
called service registry and decline
service client can directly connect to a
service registry and service registry
will now decide which process is free or
which process it can redirect oh so that
is that is the advantage of service
registry so if you go let's say you
consider platform as a service
deployment so let us take Cloud Foundry
as an example so let's deploy if we
deploy an application in the cloud for
me and if you scale the application into
three instances all these three
instances will be running in three
different machines inside the cloud form
so all these three instances will be
having a different IP addresses and you
won't be able to directly hit that
particular instance and internally Cloud
Foundry it has a service registry which
will round to a different instance so
for example let's say we have a client
which is outside chrome for cloud
foundry and we are up to we are like
using a URL to access these REST API
then internally in the Cloud Foundry
they have a load balancer which will
route it to different instances so those
load balancers works on the round robin
fashion but in general let's say inside
the Cloud Foundry environment if you
want to identify which rest endpoint I
need to
so then we can use this service registry
the idea of service registry is that all
these servers rest api server register
to the service registry and the client
can now connect to the service registry
and service registry will now decide
which particular process or the instance
that request should go so that is why we
need service entry for example now
Netflix has created Eureka so that is
that is a type of implementation of the
service registry so you can add the next
Netflix oasis you rake our library into
your application so let's say we you
have a spring boot application so you
can add the Eureka jars and then we can
make the application have the service
registry out of the box so you don't
have to worry about creating a separate
service instance so you create a service
registry and all the rest server should
register to that using the Eureka Eureka
da then our client will be now able to
connect to the service registry and
services she will now how many instances
of our application is running and it
will automatically route our application
to that particular instance so that is
the significance of the service registry
that's it for this video
meet you again in the next video thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
