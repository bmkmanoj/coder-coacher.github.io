know the latest technologies which are
in the current trend any market subburaj
had the similar question on how do I get
an all the latest technologies and how
do I keep track on let's see what do I
use to know what are the latest
technologies and how do I keep tracking
press the bell icon on the YouTube app
and never miss any update from tech
primacy if you have heard about the
company called thought books taught
works are a leading open-source
contributor and a consulting firm so
they are the creator of selenium cruise
control snap CI and lots of other
products so they do nots of consulting
as well so they publish a technology
article called the technology radar this
is the link for the technology radar
they published this particular article
every quarter so in a year you get two
to four editions I think to this year we
got one for March and then one for
number likewise they started this
particular magazine I think yeah you
have one every quarter for the year so
there are only two so try some 2010 they
have started this particular magazine so
this particular magazine is extremely
helpful when you want to know about the
latest technologies what can be adopt
what can be leveraged what can be used
what we should not use and stuff like
that I'll just open one particular
article I'll just open one particular
volume which they published in November
2000 used to get to know all the latest
terms and technology terms from this
particular article and the contributors
for this particular article of the
magazine are the board of directors for
the chief technology officers who are
inside the top that works for you you
see them these are the people who have
contributed to the article
and they do have this kind of trend so
they have a radar which says what is
what technology we should adopt what
technology we should have a trial run
what technology we should assess and
what technology we should hold off and
stop proceeding with it so example they
have different categories there is a
category called techniques these are
techniques and there are different
techniques which you can adopt which you
can test it which you can assess and
then which you can hold on same way for
platforms what are the different
platform for example kubernetes or AWS
flood io GCP cloud spanner cosmo DBC
these are different technologies these
are different technology terms which you
might not know about as well and you can
get to know about these terms from this
particular article and then you can
google out obviously right you will not
get everything in a single place but you
will get to know about these
technologies in a single place
so example comes has changed you can get
to know CSS so that means you can try
out cosmic of countries what do you want
to hold off is over ambiguous API
gateways then the next comes the tools
so for tools what are the different
types of foods for example Circle CI
your Prometheus tsipras lighthouse
spring clock contract so there are yarn
etc right these are different tools
which you can adopt so these are the
latest one so the all these are the
latest technologies this doesn't include
the old ones
all these are latest apologies x1 is the
languages on framework you can see all
the frameworks and the languages angular
Kotlin spring cloud etc right this is
just the index in the top and you can
see the explanation here for each and
every one of these topics so I do read
the technology radar and that is how I
get to know all the latest technologies
and sometimes I read about the
technology and then I try it out
whichever I can because not everything
could be tried in my laptop right so I
just try out whatever I can and then
that is how I make videos and that is
how I get to know about the latest
technologies
it's not only the technology radar which
I follow but I also follow people who
are creators of some frameworks and
something like that in Twitter so I have
a personal account in Twitter so I use
my personal account to follow people who
are creators who are designers who are
architects so they do talk about some
technologies and that is how I get to
know about these latest technologies and
I do follow technology later as well but
majority of the terms which I get to
know is from the technology data so you
can follow that as well I'll leave the
link in the description below you can
get the link and then you can check all
the doctor all the volumes of the
technology data you can even check the
older ones where you can see different
different technologies which were in
that particular year and then what all
their trending that particular year so
that is what I use a shrubberies I hope
you got to know what I use hope you also
use that and then get to know more about
the technology tones right so if you
liked the video go ahead and like it if
you haven't subscribed to the channel go
ahead and subscribe to it later again in
the next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
