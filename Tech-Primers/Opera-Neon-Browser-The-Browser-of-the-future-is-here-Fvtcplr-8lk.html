and never miss any of it from tech
primacy
ideal you guys are surprised to see a
background without the tech timers look
so long they have been seeing different
technologies and they have been doing
lots of coding for a change let's
experience the technology by the way we
do browsing opera the company which
created Opera browser has come up with a
new browser called opera neon which is
extremely cool let's see how we can use
opera neon in our day-to-day life and
how the different from Google Chrome
which we had been using daily
don't get me wrong this is the Opera
browser if you notice it is completely
transparent and if I open it you can see
that the browser is present here this is
why I wanted a different background
because if I have a dead Primus logo it
will be very boring when I start
explaining it but if you see the
experience what the browser provides it
is amazing the home page is completely
revamped there is no tab option it's not
showing any tab there is a search bar
there are some tabs here and if I click
on that a YouTube
it is going to create a tab which is
going to be here the only downside I see
here in this particular browser is this
phasing however that can be sorted out
when I do a maximize here everything
goes away from here the tabs which are
in the left and right are gone now let
me get it back if I need to open new
tabs I can just minimize this or even
plus this less option to create more and
more tabs let's say I open more and more
stuff right I will open Soundcloud
I'll open opera calm and you see these
options popping up here these are the
different tabs and they look so cool if
you want to experience browsing then you
can use opera onion obviously that bear
your brow stuff feels so cool however
let's say you want to be very focused
and you want to do something specific
let's say you are watching a video and
you want to watch that video without any
annoyance then you can directly go to
the maximize mode here which eliminates
everything except the content the other
good part about opera neon is display
option so let's think that I am playing
a song from SoundCloud
I'm just searching for my favorite music
creator so you hear lots of music from
my videos right so this is the Creator
who creates these music let's play a
video or sorry let's play a music from
his collection right so I'll just
release the volume
I'll just reduce the volume so let's say
I am inside a different website let's
say I'm inside Facebook I can control
the voice for the music from here I can
control the music from the Facebook tab
directly
I don't even have to go to the tab and
then they say pass or play
I can't directly control that directly
here
which is a very good thing if let's say
I'm playing a video the same applies as
well so if I'm playing a video I can
control that here the next part is
taking screenshots you can crop messages
or you can in fact take screenshots and
them save them
so if you notice here I just did a
screenshot here I just took some
screenshot and it gets saved in the
gland reel here and you can use it in
time you don't even have to use the
snipping tool now you can directly do
that from the browser
there is also also a download option if
you are downloading stuff you can this
take a look at it let's come to the
settings here there are different
options like how we have in Chrome
almost everything is similar there is no
extensions apart from that you have a
history you have the settings option
which is all the same if you notice
everything is almost the same how it
looks in chrome there is a new incognito
window and it looks amazing isn't it it
just shows up an incognito background
and then there's a guy peeping it and
then change it is extremely cool isn't
it that's why I said I want to feel it
you can feel the experience of browsing
if you are using a peroneal if you don't
want incognito lets me close that and
you can control the tabs here directly
if I don't want this tab I can just
close this same way I can just close our
music tabs and stuff like that the
browser is available in opera comp it is
available for both Windows and Mac I
have installed in my Mac but if you are
having Windows you can definitely go
ahead and try go to appear calm and then
go to opera nyan and you can download
the browser here I just was thinking
about opera and then I saw opera was
dead and I wanted to see what would they
do now and then I realize that they have
a new browser which is extremely amazing
that's why I just started using it and
then I just wanted to share the
experience which I am getting out of the
browser so you can also try it out and
do let me know how the browser works if
you want to get
newborns are a new field or a new way of
browsing stuff you can use the operon
here I hope you guys liked the video if
you liked the video go ahead and like it
if you haven't subscribed to my channel
go ahead and subscribe to it meet again
in the next video thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
