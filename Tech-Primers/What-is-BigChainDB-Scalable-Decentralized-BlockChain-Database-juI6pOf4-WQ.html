blockchain many people were trying to
use blockchain as a database and they
saw there were too many issues or too
many performance related issues the D
blockchain in itself what if there is a
distributed database which has blocks
chains in it let's see what is big chain
DB the new scalable distributed
blockchain database
place the bell icon on the YouTube app
and never miss any of it from text M's
Big Jim Beebe is a blockchain database
it is relatively a new database which is
live only for few months or something
they have just created the latest 2.0
version let's see what is big chain DB
and how we can leverage big chain DB or
where can we leverage big Shane DB big
chain DB uses MongoDB in the backend for
the database storage however how do they
store data they store the block chains
inside the distributed database so
blockchain technology features are
wrapped up inside a distributed database
so big chain DB can be considered as a
database which is distributed however it
has the blockchain features so basically
it is decentralized
so how blockchain is decentralized
similar to that bitch NDB is a
decentralized database which has
immutable data storage example if you
want to push the data to the bitch NDB
that data cannot be altered everything
in the big chain DB is treated as an
asset and it is immutable
so in short big chain DB is a database
with blockchain characteristics so let's
see what are the different features
which picture in DB provides right
apart from decentralization it has a
query API engine where you can query the
big chain DB like how we used to query
the Mongo DB so you can query with rich
REST API so you can get the data you can
create application create as etc the
other features are the immutability so
once the data is stored the data cannot
be changed or deleted so once you create
a block inside the big chain DB you
cannot delete that so with the newer
version of a chain DB default aldrin
mechanism has been advanced so they are
using the Byzantine fault tolerant
mechanism for the concern sense inside
the blockchain network in order to
arrive at a consensus they are using
division team fault tolerant mechanism
also this can be customized to her
a private network or even a public
network as well since this is open
source people who contribute are the
open source community and there can be
lots of applications which will be built
around top of it similar to how we see
the open source world evolving so you
can see big Chain DB giving the basis
for the blockchain database and people
using that and then creating different
applications or it so big chain DB also
supports both the traditional stack and
a blockchain stack if you already have
applications which are normally running
in a cloud environment without using any
blockchain technology you can still use
blockchain DB because just the storage
part is using the blockchain concept so
you don't have to have a blockchain
based technology in order to use the big
change database so if you see this is
the architecture diagram which is
explained in their website where it
shows the traditional stack versus the
blockchain stack so you can have
applications platform processing and the
file systems out of the decentralized or
the blockchain based protocols or
methodologies you can still use big
chain database in that particular use
case as well so how is big chain DB
achieving all these stats so they are
using the big data systems basically
they are using the MongoDB in the
backend for storing the data so big
chain DB is a merger of both distributed
database features with the blockchain
features so that is why big chain DB
might exceed well compared to the normal
blockchain using your normal blockchain
as a database because bitch NDB
incorporates the features of distributed
database additionally to the blockchain
technology so that is why big chain DB
might be advantageous so we have to wait
and watch because it's a new technology
and new database so I'm not sure how it
will evolve in the future
so that's it about big chain DB hope you
guys got a basic understanding of what
is big chain DB and how it works if you
liked the video go ahead and like it if
you haven't subscribed to the channel go
ahead and subscribe to it meet you again
in the next video thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
