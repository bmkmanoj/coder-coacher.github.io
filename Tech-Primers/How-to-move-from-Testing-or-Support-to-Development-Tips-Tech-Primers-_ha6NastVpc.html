you would like to do development and you
would like to be a developer let's see
how you can follow some different tips
and tricks in order to move from your
testing or your production support job
role to a development job board let's
get started
press the bell icon on the YouTube app
and never miss any updates from tech
primers
there is a myth that testing our
production support person cannot move to
development however I would say it is
just a myth you can still move from
testing or production support to
development if you follow some tips and
tricks which I feel might be helpful
the following steps which I am going to
tell it is all from my perspective from
what I think a person should follow who
is the tester or a production support
person in order to move to development
there are different ways of doing it but
I feel this is a more efficient and more
productive way of doing stuff the first
and the foremost thing is improve the
domain knowledge in the area of your
expertise so if you are a tester make
sure you know the end-to-end system flow
of your product if you are a support
person do the same thing so you should
know why you are doing support and what
is the primary function of the
application which you're working on and
make sure you know end-to-end features
of the product this will help you in
having better collaboration with the
development team because whenever they
do some change they will have to
communicate that to you so you can go
and have better collaboration with the
development team and it might help you
in the long run because if a person from
the development team thinks that okay
you have very good understanding of the
product he might even ask you for some
help because most of the time that is
what happens in the service-based
industry right lots of the lots of the
teams are working only on the support
and then there are very less development
team the level development team keeps on
moving
however the support team remains and the
support team has better understanding of
the system than the development team
itself so it is better to improve your
domain knowledge as a start so that you
have a better understanding of the
system which will help you in the long
run I will tell you why the next one is
identifying a mentor who can guide you
in the process of learning new
technologies right so identify a mentor
from either from a development team or
he may not be from your team or he may
be your friend or he may be someone who
met in the internet or he may be some
acquaintance you
mid somewhere or the other right so keep
a mentor whom you can call anytime and
ask doubts about what technology to
choose from or what is the right thing
to do right so that helps in not only in
terms of moving into development
perspective but in opener in as a whole
if you want to develop yourselves
identify a person who can guide you in
the right direction who will be able to
make your career path right right the
next one is try to automate something
which you find it difficult so let's say
you are a tester right and you are doing
something manually right for your
internal process try to automate that if
you're a production support guy I'm
pretty sure there are so many manual
stuff which you are doing currently
so trying to automate that stuff okay
like how development teams create their
own software's try creating a software
on your own right so try to see the best
thing you can do to your process and
start off from that because nobody's
going to come and give you a piece of
software and say ok do some coding in it
but if you are doing or if you are
creating your own software you have the
luxury to choose the technologies you
have the luxury to decide what you want
you have the luxury to add the features
and nobody is going to come and question
you why you did this or why you didn't
do this because you are automating
something apart from what you are doing
at work right so that will help you in
getting a bigger picture and trying to
simplify this processes right so that is
what development team thinks about they
try to simplify processes right the next
thing is obviously get somebody from the
development team get some advice on the
technologies which you can use because
obviously you are new to technology it
is better to approach to somebody who
has a better understanding of the
technology and the toolings around it so
identify somebody from the development
team collaborate with them make sure you
have good networking with them and make
sure he can help you in terms of
wherever you are stuck right so let's
say you are working on a project or
working on some automating something on
your own right
you should be able to approach that guy
and then ask for any help and you should
be able to help you
hey identify somebody like that or in
general what you can do you can
proactively talk or set up a meeting
with a development team and you can just
propose your idea and then you can get
some ideas from them that is also
appreciated okay
once you have developed it definitely
review that tool with the developer he
will have a better understanding of how
you have developed it because he is also
a developer and he thinks that they you
develop a software so it is better to
review the tool with the developer and
showcase your ideas and incorporate its
incorporate some comments which they
give so that you have a better
perspective from a development team
right you may not be judgmental in all
the ideas which you have implemented but
there could be something which you can
leverage from the development team
always right so I would say you can do
that as well
last thing take it to the wider audience
for more visibility so once you are done
with that of automation of your tool
take that to your manager or maybe above
his level and then showcase that what
you have done and how much effort is it
reducing for you from an automation
perspective right so what you did as a
part of this particular whole processes
you developed a software on your own
basically you did developers job so as a
developer that is what we do we develop
some software just to automate a process
if you are automating something for your
own sake that is also development so
this is the first step towards
development so you would have learned
lots of things as a part of this
particular process you would have learn
new technologies you'd have faced
hindrance of creating or usage with
these technologies and you would have
learned something about it right so this
is a start for taking a direction
towards there's no print because you
cannot just like that directly start off
with a feature and then you cannot just
like that start off with the development
right so if you do something like this
and then you have a better visibility
you can definitely approach to your
manager or maybe
your peer in the development team and
asked for a moment from the testing or
the support role to the development role
definitely there are people who consider
it because if you have a good domain
knowledge and if you have a decent
coding skill definitely people like
prefer you over getting a new person
into the development team because you
have better understanding of the product
and you can learn the technologies on
your own as well if you are a self
learner and even if it is a even if they
you need small guidance people are ready
to help so I would say this is the start
so better you start working on these
things so this is from my perspective so
whatever I have seen in my career
over these past few years I have seen
people who used to I am a developer I
worked I have done support as well
but we do only n3 support but there are
so many people who had approached me who
used to tell me that ok they don't want
to work on the support job they wanted
the development role however they never
take any step of these kinds right they
just come do the support job and then go
home they think that ok next day when
they get up they will be a developer
that's not going to happen right so you
have to improve your domain knowledge
you have to work on so many things in
the background in order to make you make
yourself move from these are photo into
the development role because in the
current world there are lots of support
role and those support roles are getting
automated and people are trying to move
away from support role to the
development or in order to stand out of
the lot you will have to do something
different and I feel that these are some
things which you which will make you
stand out from your team members when
you are doing these kind of things like
you have your own domain knowledge
expertise and you create an automation
process using some development tools and
you have learned development as a part
of that particular process right so that
is what I wanted to cover in this
particular video if you find this video
relevant for somebody who's working in
testing or the application support do
share it to them I hope you liked the
video if you haven't subscribe to the
channel Gordon
start to it if you liked the video go
ahead and like it meet again in the next
video thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
