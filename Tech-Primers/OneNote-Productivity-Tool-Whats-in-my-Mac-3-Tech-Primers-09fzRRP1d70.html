and never miss any updates from tech
timers welcome to tech primers in this
video we are going to see one of the
productivity tool which is the most
underrated tool which I would say from
Microsoft so it's nothing but Microsoft
OneNote so I'm just opening it so I had
been using Microsoft OneNote for the
past five years now so it's very
productive then you use one for OneNote
because most of the time what we do at
work is you have a long pending North
task or a notepad left click file where
you have lots of links you have lots of
steps and stuff like that which is like
accumulated in a single notepad or you
have multiple notepads and then you go
and check the links in OneNote fast you
have steps in one notepad and you have
organized them in a different different
place right or depend of unfolding
effect and when you want to search
across them you cannot search right
that's what happens when you have like
notepad notepad plus left side but
OneNote solves all those issues so let's
see how it solves all those issues right
so I just open the algae's insult one
note in my Mac I haven't used it in my
Mac for quite a while but I use it in my
Windows machine at the work so I have
like a Windows 8 machine so I am using
it in there so let's see I have just
installed and this do you get started I
will show you how to use OneNote and
then what I do
so right now it's asking me my email
address and for email address so let me
enter this and let me log into it and
then let's come back so because I'm not
sure if I remember the password right so
I will have to cry out quite a few time
so let's come back once I log it so I am
logged in right now so I have entered my
account details and now it is asking me
how would you like office to look so I
just say what is the classic look I'll
just say colorful right so that you can
see the difference between one not
another application so looks like it is
all done yep it's pretty good actually
so in Windows I hear you don't see these
colorful tea but looks like a Mac
version is better than the Windows
version I feel like it's great now so
let me maximize this yes
I think it's all done like cool so you
have something called as notebooks so
you need to understand the concept of
notebooks a Jason section so there are
three parts to known hood so you have
something like in OneNote so you have
something called as notebook so you can
have multiple notebooks so notebooks are
like similar to a notebook or a diary
which you have so you can have one diary
and then you can have multiple chapters
and then you can have multiple pages say
so it's notebook is something similar so
you have something called as notebooks
so you can let's say if I mark my
notebook as a personal notebook right so
then I can mark it as personal I can
have a separate notebook for personal
and then I can have a separate notebook
for book right so so if I say insert I
can see the different options which I
can insert in the page right so let's
say now I have an option here so I'm
going to create a new notebook so right
now that is one notebook called my
notebook but what I'm going to do is I'm
not going to use that I am going to
create one called tech primers right
over for YouTube right so I'm going to
say tech primers
right and I'm going to give some color
so I just want to give red because I use
it for the YouTube it now where can I
save it so here there is an option to
save it in onedrive
so if you have an onedrive account you
can use that to log into OneNote and
then it will be saved there and if you
have the same app in your Android or iOS
device you can sync it from there so
literally you can access your notebook
from any device so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to create this OneNote
account here and I'm going to use it in
my butt but right so now if you see I
have a I have written a note book called
tech primer okay that is my notebook so
not my notebook is done now the next
section will be next one is the section
so if you see here notebook is the first
one the next level is the section and
that finally pages so you can have
multiple sections so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to rename this section
I'm going to add one more section so you
can add sections under age so you can
have multiple sections so you can have
something called as notes so I have one
section called notes I'm going to add
something called topics for videos so
I'm going to have some something like
that then I am going to say useful link
okay so all in the different sections
where I want to have some multiple pages
so inside notes I can have something
like today what is the day to day start
so I can just have today's at work what
I do I just mentioned tasks like
creating some requests for some job to
be done right so you can have multiple
tasks whatever you can have right so
these are pages so you can have multiple
pages under the section so if I say
another section so I can create
something for 17th August what what do I
need to do or if I say I want one more
page I can add 19th August what you need
to do right so I can add substract it so
if you see these are different pages so
these pages are tagged under a section
right so notice a section and under that
I have different pages
right same way if you go for our topic
service there is nothing here so I can
have multiple pages here so I and if you
see here I can even email this
particular page I can attach I can
attach files and the other beauty is you
can type anywhere if you notice here you
can type anyway
so that is like OneNote because you
don't have to go to the start of the
line or the end of the line like how we
have in notepad you can type any anyway
now if you notice it you have also have
a audio recording and if you want to
convert into a table by default it
automatically does that when you do a
tab so that is another good thing which
I like about it so you just type
something it automatically converts it
into a tape table when you press the tab
option right so that is pretty good I
feel right so those are the different
sections and those are those different
sections inside one no so you have
notebook section on the page and if you
want to have a specific color to the
page you can add that so you have an
option called paper color so you can
change the paper color and then it
changes the color of the background so
you can have multiple you can have
different pages with different colors
right so you can do that and if you want
to draw something you can draw it so if
you notice here you can draw something
here you can do that right so that also
gets saved by default there are lots of
other options you can extract text
command image if you have an image you
paste that image here and without doing
anything you can just extract the text
from that image so that is the another
good feature about the OneNote so that
is that I was mentioning that it is an
underestimated software for productivity
increase okay so I think that is it if
you want to search across notebook site
so you can do a search here so if you
see there is a search option here and if
I search for what did I say some I try
to type something inside the podesta I
type the wall call some and if you
notice here it is searching me there and
it is automatically suggesting maybe
if I a type ASD I think I had some pages
with ASD right so if you notice if it is
automatically suggesting me all the
pages even though they are in a
different section you can notice here
this is inside the notes section this is
the topic for video section so this is
how you can easily search across the
nodes so literally if you have multiple
notepad when you are handling it you are
it was difficult for you to search right
so down with one note you have the
single software you can search across
pages and you can have sections like
based on your interest and then you can
have a different color associated with
it then you can just customize and then
play around with it I use a day in day
out in my workplace so wherever I go I
first install this particular software
it's our company I switch to buy a just
I have been installing this software and
with my first daily driver because I
need to need a place to store some of my
Quick Links or some shortcuts or some
frequent visited stuff right so I use
one node further and you can also try it
out see how the productivity is I would
say that it is pretty good compared to
the notepad the usage of notepad or not
fertilizers let's this it is going to do
the same thing but it gives you lots of
other features and then it is much
better and even you can even send the
send this particular page it sense to
somebody here if you need and you can if
you have Outlook configured in your
workplace you can have add tasks ok and
this task immediately gets displayed in
the outlook as a pending item so you
don't have to worry about linking those
two they automatically get linked so
that is another good part about OneNote
so if you want to have any mail
extracted into OneNote there is an
option inside outlook you can do a
export to OneNote and then it get saved
as best or not one or two page so so
that you can use it for future reference
so that is what I think I wanted to
cover I think I covered most of it so as
I said you can have personal notebooks
you can have multiple notebooks you say
more you can add multiple new other
notebooks weekend I can say personal
notebook and then it will be separate so
you will have a different notebook and
then you can have multiple section
inside them and same way pages which are
specific to the sections so that's it
for this particular video hope I think
you found this particular software
interesting give it a try and do let me
know how it was in the comment section
