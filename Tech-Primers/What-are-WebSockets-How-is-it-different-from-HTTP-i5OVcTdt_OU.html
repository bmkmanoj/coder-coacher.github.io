applications in the browser and have you
ever wondered how's it different from a
normal website let's see what are
WebSockets and how is it different from
a normal HTTP protocol press the bell
icon on the YouTube app and never miss
any update from tech primers the
identify this particular session was how
does the HTTP protocol work we are going
to see what happens under the hood
whenever an HTTP request is sent and
received we are going to see what our
WebSockets where and when can WebSockets
be used real-time WebSocket
implementations and also when not to use
WebSockets so how does the HTTP protocol
work under the hood take a typical
google.com so whenever we hit google.com
the request goes to a back-end server
and this request goes in the form of
HTTP or HTTPS so these are the
communication protocols which our
browser uses to communicate with the web
server whenever there is a request sent
to the web server there will be a
response sent as well so when a request
is sent there will be a TCP connection
created between the client and the
server and once the response is received
this connection gets closed so every
time you RL is sent to the web server
that is the connection open and the
connection is closed
once the response is received so let's
say a website is giving five different
requests to the web server in order to
retrieve five different information it
is going to create five different
connections separately and it is going
to close those connections once the
responses are received this is how a
typical HTTP or HTTPS connection both if
you take any rest
connection it is also the same thing so
whenever you are hitting a rest endpoint
from your UI or from a different server
it is going to create a separate
connection it is going to request the
data from the server once the response
is received the connection gets close
let's say there is a web client which is
going to send hundreds of requests to
the back-end web server when it is doing
some trade processing it is good to
retrieve those 100 information with 100
set of new connections so every time a
request is made a new connection is made
this is how a typical HTTP or HTTPS
connection books so every time you hit a
website it makes a request so a new
connection is created every single time
what are WebSockets and how are they
different from the traditional HTTP
mooned whenever WebSocket is involved
there will be a client and server
similar to how we have in our current
day-to-day scenario this could be a
client of the browser or maybe a
different server in itself there is a
bi-directional communication between
WebSockets WebSockets are created using
WS colon double slash unlike the HTTP
WebSockets use this format
whenever you see WS colon double slash
in a website that means it is using
WebSockets I'll show you that in a bit
but understand that the difference
between the HTTP connection and a
WebSocket is that HTTPS are
unidirectional so the sender has to
trigger a request and he will get a
response web circuits are bi-directional
so the sender can send the data the
receiver also can send the data so in
this particular case let's consider
chatting application so you have a chat
window open you are sending a request to
the server you are hitting hi to your
friend your friend also has his browser
open he receives the request from the
server automatically whenever you are
sending the request it is from you to
the server when that is pushed to his UI
it is done from the server to the UI
same way whenever your friend pushes
some message you also receive it in the
same fashion
WebSockets uses bi-directional
communication how are they achieving it
they don't close the connection which
they open for the first time whenever a
client has established a connection with
the server the connection stays there
until the client or the server decides
to terminate the connection let's see
that with the example let's consider
client there's a client which is the web
browser and there is a server whenever
we initiate a connection between the
client on the server the handshake is
made and the client of the server decide
that ok we will create a new connection
and this is going to be there forever
until I die once the connection is open
the communication happens in terms of
bi-directional message processing once
the connection is opened the connection
exists until the client or the server
dies when one of the side decides to
close the connection the connection gets
terminated permanently from both the
ends so this is how WebSocket works
unlike HTTP where a connection is
created response is received and the
connection is closed here the connection
is created and kept open and
communications happen between the same
connection once the client decides that
I am done with the updates I don't want
to receive anything from the server the
connection gets closed where and when
can WebSockets be used obviously it can
be used with real time applications when
you want to load the UI without even
having to refresh the UI you could think
about ajax ajax is the implementation
over HTTP where we do HTTP polling or
streaming it still uses HTTP so every
time it has to open a new socket and
then hold the data however in WebSockets
there is already an open connection and
the data is pushed over the same
connection that's why deb sockets are
faster I'll show you a typical example
of WebSocket in the night next slide how
faster it is the next one is the gaming
applications if you're playing a game in
the web browser you might notice that
you don't have to refresh show you what
the UI gets automatically refresh
without even having to reestablish a new
connection so WebSockets are very
helpful when you're playing games chart
applications as I said earlier with an
example chat applications heavily use
WebSockets so let's see some real time
WebSocket implementation examples I'm
just going to show you some websites
which are using WebSockets even
google.com uses WebSockets but I'll just
show a little bit complex implementation
so that you have an idea about what are
WebSockets and how they are really used
this is the Bitcoin exchange this is the
most volatile thing which is happening
so I just wanted to show you or make you
feel how the communication happens and
how quick it is what we are going to do
is we are going to see the back side of
this website so we are going to see
what's happening then there then there
are that question responses going in let
me move this down a little bit so that I
can show you or maybe if you notice here
this is the G tax exchange their
bitcoins and some of the crypto
currencies are traded these are some
different crypto currencies which are
getting traded I just wanted to show you
how WebSockets are used in this
particular website if you see if you
notice here the data is getting changed
every second or every millisecond right
there are so many data which are getting
pushed to the client side so how are
these happening so these are happening
because there are WebSockets implemented
in this particular webpage let me go to
the network option here and let's park
this a little bit whenever you click on
a URL let's say this is a URL which got
loaded as a part of this which then as a
part of this website load if you notice
here it uses HTTP connection so this is
the traditional HTTP protocol however
how
the feeds getting updated that is using
WebSockets if you notice this particular
URL the request URL this is using
WebSockets it is using W speed dodgy Dax
and using the request method get the
status code is one not one because the
way WebSockets worker slightly different
from how HTTP works let me load this
website again when we load this website
a connection is created between the
client and the server and it creates a
socket and keeps it there and further
communications happen via the same
channel let's go to the same WebSocket
channel there is an option called
streams where you can see what's
happening now notice here there are lots
of messages coming in and these are the
JSON messages which are getting updated
in the UI
that's how whenever there's an update we
are saying that there is a change in
thee let's move this if you notice here
the frames are coming in and you can see
the data getting changed so this is
WebSockets we did not refresh any page
we are not doing any Ajax call we are
not triggering any requests however the
data is getting pushed to the u1
whenever there is an update from the
server side so whenever there is a
change in the stop the data is getting
pushed to all these clients which are
registered to the server our client is
one of the register that's why the data
is getting pushed to our UI this is a
example of how WebSockets can be using
the trading world let's see a chat
example let me close this window let's
do the same inspect here so that we can
see what's happening when there is a
communication happening with the server
let me refresh the page so that the
networks are loaded here so the
transport happens using this particular
WebSocket notice here there is a
WebSocket here as well so WS : so this
is a WebSocket you can go to the frames
the frames show how much data is coming
in and going up so see this somebody has
left the chatroom that's why the data is
gone let
enter the chat room right saying tech
primers see that there was a request
sent to the server saying add user ted
primers somebody else also logged in i
think it's a login message saying 26
participants are there including us then
i think we got some message 2 and 3 i
think it went up and down right let's
try publishing a message say hi once we
say hi we sent 4 different messages the
first one is called typing then stop
typing new message and then stop typing
so these are the different messages
which we sent to the server and now if
you notice the server send us some
message this is how WebSockets work so
we had created a socket connection
between the client on the server if I
just refresh this particular window
these communication whatever we did
already will be expired and there will
be a new set of communication happening
so the state is like lost once we
reverse the connection once we recreate
the connection so messages which we will
be publishing will not have any internal
dependency within the state
so whenever a message one receives the
client that message should not have any
relevance to message two that way we
will be able to easily get new and new
data every time we reverse the you want
that's how we are able to see only the
new messages in the chat window and we
don't care about the messages which we
got some time back that leads to us to
the next topic which is nothing but when
not to use WebSockets
that socket should not be used whenever
we don't want to how only the new data
if let's say we want to retrieve old
information as well that's when you can
go for HTTP because you can use some
restful web services and hit the rest
endpoint and then get rid of the data
because it's going to be only one short
thing WebSockets can be used when you
want real-time updates if you don't want
any real time updates then it is better
not to go for WebSockets because web
socket just needs a socket and then
keeps it alive if you are not worried
about
getting the data every now on them and
if you want to just load the data only
once you can go for HTTP because HTTP
creates a connection once we send the
request and it closes the connection
once the response is retreat however
WebSockets keeps the connection online
until we kill our connection as I said
restful web services are sufficient to
get the data from the server if you are
getting the data only once if you are
loading the data only once then it is
better to go for restful web services
however if you want to get real-time
updates that's when you can go for
WebSockets so what did we see in this
particular video we saw how does the
HTTP protocol works they should TP
protocol is a unidirectional protocol
you can create a connection using be
they should it be a request method and
the connection gets closed once the
responses have seen we also saw what are
WebSockets WebSockets are bi-directional
communication protocol which can be
using a single connection and it can
send the data from the server to the
client and from the client to the server
where and when can WebSockets be used we
saw the real-time stock trading
application we saw chat application and
also it can be used in all real-time
applications which we created then not
to use WebSockets we should not be using
it when we don't want to have the
connection retained for a stipulated
amount of time that's when we can ignore
using the WebSockets I hope you guys
found this video interesting and you
just got a basic idea about what are
WebSockets in the future videos we might
be seeing how to create WebSockets using
a UI application or maybe a java
application or even a JavaScript
application
that's it for this particular video if
you liked the video go ahead and like it
if you haven't subscribe to the channel
go ahead and subscribe to it meet you
