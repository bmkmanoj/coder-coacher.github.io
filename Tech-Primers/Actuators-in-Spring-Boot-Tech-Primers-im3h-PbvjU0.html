primers welcome to tech primers in this
particular video we are going to see how
to use actuators in spring boot using
spring boot actuators so what is an
actuator right so actuators are a
concept created by springboard where you
can monitor the application for any
production support related stuff so for
example in general what do we do in
production right so we monitor the
process we go and check the hell we go
and check whether the process is up and
running we check whether the database
connections are up and running whether
the database connections were successful
inside the process or those kinds of
metrics ISO for example the heap size or
the space which is available in the
particular JVM so all these are taken
care by the concept called actuators so
spring boot internally is a rest
endpoint right so internally is a web
application right so spring what they
did is they thought of creating library
which can expose some restrain points so
that different monitoring tools can just
use those restrain points and get the
data out of the restrain point so that
is why the actuators were created so
let's see how we can create those
actuators and what these actuators
provide for our site so I'm going to
create a group called health and then
I'm going to say actuator example
alright so I'm going to use the spring
MVC how the web project teespring that
project and also I need the actuators so
I'm going to add the actuator dependency
that's it I'm going to create the
project and then I'll unzip this
so I think it has gotten zip so let's go
and open those in IntelliJ
yeah project is open now so if you
notice in the dependencies we have only
two dependency one is the actuator the
spring boots tractor actuator the spring
boot where web so if you see in such
spring boots chart of actuators you
would have spring both shorter and the
spring boot actuator by default so this
will have some default dependencies
which it requires for its processing
right so that's it so we don't have to
do anything else
by default the spring boot actuators are
security base so they have some security
restrictions in order to access those
rest endpoints right so you can if we
can disable them using the management or
security dot enabled as false so this
will disable the security for the
actuator resisting points because those
actuator rest endpoints are exposing
environment variables and matrix
information which not everyone can see
so that is why it is enabled or secure
order by default so we have disabled
that right now all right so so once we
have added that particular restrain
point we don't have to do anything else
so if I just start this process right it
will by default have its own distinct
ones of course we can overwrite those
restrain points and we can add some
custom information but by default what
we can do is we can just start it we
don't have to do anything else let's see
what information this actuators provided
then we can later decide on what kind of
over I do we need to do
okay I think I need to overhype or
because my at&amp;amp;t is occupied by the
Jenkins which I have tried sa80
yeah the server is up if you notice here
there are different resistant bonds
which I've come here see I did not even
create anything but by default you have
info health beams dump environment audit
events config property loggers mapping
see all these are resting points
provided by actuator itself right let's
say what are these there is 10 points to
it so the first one we are going to see
is the info right so let's see what this
info to us so the info if you notice
here there is nothing because we can
override some things in painful
information so it displays some not
sensitive information so you can put
whatever we want here we can override
that so right now I don't have anything
over at enter so that's why infos are
turning empty response so if I say
envrionment this is called in from
return all the sensitive information
which they have configured inside the
JVM if you notice here the it shows what
port it is running on what are the
different system properties so if you
see here what shady can using or the
Java version what else is sensitive here
so what is the directory in which my
project was running all those
information so for example temp
information the library path all these
are shown here time zone your Java class
path if you see here it shows even the
Java class path right so all those are
shown up in this particular environment
here and also it shows the properties
that we see here what are the properties
which we have added and you chose what
is a property file as well and what is
the class path of it so these are the
two properties which we have in our
application or properties and these are
shown up as well okay this is the
environmental standpoint if you need to
see any metrics information we can do
metrics and this shows all the heap size
what is the unused size of you see here
the memory of the this particular JVM is
219 right under or how much is free is
this what are the processors which is
using for puzzles are there or the
uptime how much is the heap size how
much of the he used all the
shown up here it also shows the garbage
collection information thanks Ben
right so that is the metrics there is
something called trace so the trace
shows what are the different rest
endpoints people have been accessing so
for example inside trace you can see I
accessed metrics I accessed environment
right and also accessed in 4h ya see
here right so this shows the last few
requests which was hit for this
particular resting point so this trace
shows what are the different rest
endpoints people have been accessing so
if you go to trace you can see what was
the last request
people have been accessing via this
particular rest server ok so these are
the different rest endpoints this is the
major ones basically so there are lots
of other rest endpoints inside the
actuator but these are the different
ones major ones there is something
called health as well which shows
whether the server is up or not so if
you notice here this shows what is the
status of the disk run what is the
status of the server in itself as a
whole if there is a database
connectivity it shows DB connections
automatically so if I oughta wear a
database connection right so if I had H
2 database right if I add H 2 internally
and it automatically shows up here let's
try that out right
okay I've added it to here so I have an
ordered added anything else I just added
the dependency here and spring boat is
now going to automatically configure or
hit show database into the actuator
endpoint so that is the beauty of these
spring boat right so it it does so many
things in the background to a greater
extent it is good because you don't have
to do so many stuff manually but to some
extent it is it is difficult for you to
understand how it does it because it's
it looks like magic right so you should
be using some good as a caution so if
you are okay with sacrificing your like
dependencies or the complexities then
you can go and use spring boat right so
let's go on the first is here I think it
does not come by default maybe if I add
if I had scipy is right it should come
see for example I don't have the my
sequel and database up right now what
I'm gonna do is I'm just going to add
the my sequel Java connector and I'm
going to add some properties for the my
sequel database egg which I had
previously so I've added them let me
restarted so once I restart so they
should try to connect to the database
and it should fail and my health should
show us failed so let me first shoot
again just to be sure so right now we
don't have any connectivity to the
database but what happens when you boot
up your process spring boot tries to
create the connection to the database
and then it shows up the status of that
in the health so let's see what happens
they help right now it is not showing
anything maybe it's because I haven't
done any repository maybe I can use some
maybe I'll try one right so that I can
show you guys how the minimal I'll try
creating one just for the sake of it but
we can try whether it is I think it is
working so I don't create a positive
file instead if you notice the
connection got refused I think it failed
I don't think I can bring it up right
now but you got the point right so if if
the database was if the server was up
and running and if the database
connection was lost you can see that in
the health here right now the actuator
went down so that is why we are not able
to see the trusted one but in general
what happens is playing boot
automatically adds that to the health
endpoint if you want to add any custom
rest health endpoints what you can do is
there is something called a health
indicator so if I see here there is
something called health indicator you
can override this interface so by
default if you see there are lots of
health indicators which are configured
by default those are the ones which
identify whether the health of that
particular dependencies are good or not
for example diskspace health indicator
this is what shows that the disk space
was it was showing up right so
previously it was showing up or what was
the health right so that is how it shows
the disk is the health of the disk is
good or not same way you have lots of
health indicators here elasticsearch GMS
LDAP MongoDB rabbi trellis and
everything so like that if you want to
have your custom health indicator you
can just over at this felt indicator
interface and you can check what is the
status of that particular external
third-party stuff
right same way with info if with the
info you can override whatever you need
to show so that is another manual thing
which you can do apart from that there
are lots of rs.10 points there are there
is something called end the point so you
can have custom end point which you can
create so point so this is the one so
there is an interface called end point
and you can override this end point and
have a custom end point right so you can
create a custom end point which users
can hit and then you will see what is
the rest endpoint so for example let's
try this custom endpoint right or what I
will do is I'll just disable the
dependency which I added here and I will
show you how to create a custom endpoint
so you can just give my packages
okay just create this custom endpoint is
it not more yeah let me go on create
this here
custom in point so I'm gonna create a
component because this needs to be auto
wired
initially and I'm gonna say end find and
let's say I'm gonna run some string
right and implement method so I need to
implement some methods so what are the
method the gate ID is the one which will
say what rest for rest endpoint URL you
need so in our case I'm just going to
say YouTube right I'm just going to say
YouTube is enabled true you need to
enable the stru you can have some
configurations here and you can say
whether it is sensitive or not right now
I will say not sensitive and here you
can give the response so you can just
say hello YouTube
then this is going to restart this so
this new rest endpoint will be created
called a YouTube and then you can have
this as a response so if you have a to
returning list or something you can have
a list here if you have a model to be
returned you can have the model here so
that is why this is a generic here so in
my case I wanted to return only the
string so I had only the string right so
I think I have to remove this
okay let me start it so that we can see
how is it behaving the build is taking
so much time
okay so to notice your the rest of 10
points have been created and we should
see something called YouTube yup if you
notice here here we are having a rest
endpoint on YouTube which we created and
let's go and check that out
yep if you notice here hello YouTube has
come right so this is how you can create
custom rest endpoints inside actuators
so you can have these actuators as your
production support related tasks so if
you want to expose any sensitive
information you can secure what if you
don't want to expose any sensitive
information you want to expose any basic
information you can do that using custom
end points or any existing end points
you can override and then start using so
I hope you guys understood what is what
our actuators and how you can enable
them so you just need to add some form
dependency and then by default it will
have some default health endpoints you
can use those to access the address so
right so hope you guys understood how
actuators work hope you liked the video
if you liked it go ahead and like it if
you haven't subscribed to the channel go
ahead and subscribe to it so if you want
me to make videos on any specific topic
go ahead and drop that in the comment
section below I will try to do that and
that's it for this particular video meet
again in the next video thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
