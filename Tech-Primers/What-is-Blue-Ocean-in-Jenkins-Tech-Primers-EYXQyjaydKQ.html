completely different UI under Jenkins
with a revolutionary pipeline view
welcome to tech primers in this
particular video we are going to see
what is blue ocean inside Jenkins let's
get started so blue ocean is nothing but
a plugin which Jenkins has created with
lots of users in mind so if you see a
traditional Jenkins UI this is how it
looks like right and 50 revolutionary
Jenkins pipeline this is how the stages
look like in the Jenkins UI this is
nothing but Jenkins Stewart oh plus so
this is how a Jenkins UI looks like but
what Jenkins has now done is they have
rethink that whole UI okay to make it
better for the pipeline's
so in order to make your pipelines how
better view Jenkins has created this
blue ocean theme okay to make the
pipeline better alright so what is the
Jenkins blue ocean right so blue ocean
is nothing but a theme or a plug-in
which Jenkins has created so if you see
here this is how it looks like Jenkins
has created a plug-in so that you can
install it whenever you need it so if
you are using the pipeline's for
automating your continuous delivery and
the continuous deployment then you can
go to blue ocean it has very good UI and
then if you see here right it was
showing different ways the plug-in can
be seen so it is very intuitive actually
so if you have multiple parallel
pipelines so for example these are
parallel pipelines so when you have
parallel pipelines right now in the
Jenkins right right now the Jenkins it
doesn't show that ya parallely however
in blue ocean what is going to show you
parallel right so it is nothing but a
theme so or a plug
basically it's a plugin so what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to install the
blue ocean plugin so I'm going to go to
manage Jenkins and I'm go to manage
plugin so that I can see the plugins
there right
so I go to available in the available
window I will be having the blue ocean
right and this is the plug-in so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna install this
particular plugin and I'm going to say
download now and install after restart
and I'm going to just say restart and
the installation is complete and no jobs
are running okay so what is happening is
in the background this is going to
download all the necessary plugins so if
you see here there are so many dependent
plugins which blue ocean requests so all
these plugins are going to be downloaded
and they are going to be installed this
but in this particular Jenkins instance
and the instance is going to be
restarted right meanwhile we can see the
documentation of what blue ocean says
right so blue ocean if you see
continuous delivery for everything so as
you know Jenkins is used for continuous
delivery and the deployment and blue
ocean is going to take that to a
different level with lots of
visualisation changes down to the
Jenkins right so why I am calling it as
revolutionary or something like that is
because the UI is so nice so we are
going to see that in two minutes once
the plugins are installed and now
Jenkins has got to accept it meanwhile
these the different options so if you
see here there is a visual pipeline rate
editor you can edit the pipeline you can
add scripts you can add the content to
the pipeline there itself from the UI
you have pipeline visualizer which is
going to show the pipeline in whatever
stage it is right diagnosis you can see
the logs and stuff directly github and
get yeah
by default they already had these
integrations personalization obviously
you can personalize your dashboard so so
blue ocean creates something called a
dashboard so for example this is the
blue ocean dashboard right you can
customize this dashboard so you need
initially Jenkins has its own dashboard
so this is how blue ocean shows up in
its dashboard so you can have customized
a dashboard so that is that
personalization and of course it's 100%
open source which is basically you can
also contribute to a blue ocean so every
code which is there in the blue ocean
plug-in is out there and github so if
you go to github of cloudBees so which
is the company which maintains Jenkins
you can see the blue ocean is open
sourced so the code is completely open
sourced so you can even fix go and fix
it so how to get started this is just
the step for how to install blue ocean
which are which we have already
triggered right so let this download get
completed and then we'll come back I
just fast forward it so that you can see
there are no insulation getting
completed yeah the installation is
completed and if you notice here the
Jenkins is restarting enough hopefully
the installation was successful let's
see after the restart and we can check
the dashboard for the blue ocean so I am
going to the home screen and if you
notice in the home screen I have a new
option called
open blue ocean right so previously I
did not have this particular option so
right now I have this particular option
let me open the blue ocean do I so I'm
just clicking on that blue ocean option
so this should take me to the new UI so
if you notice here this is the new UI so
it's completely revolutionary it's
completely different from how Jenkins
was till now so Jenkins had that
traditional dashboard you want and this
is the new open ocean UI the blue ocean
UI which is all open source right so let
me go to the pipeline so that is where
the real fun begins all the normal job
if you see this is a normal job so the
Jenkins example is a normal job if I see
that particular job I might not see any
anything big so if you see here it's
slightly changed the way it is showing
slightly different if you see this
particular build fade so that is very
showing in that particular this is a
successful bill so it shows up in the
green color so let's go to the plug-in
so that that's why the real fun begins
so plugin shows up in a different way so
that is what I wanted to see mainly if I
see if I go to the plugins build number
seven if you notice here my plugin is
showing up this way right so I had only
three stages in the plug-in in the
Jenkins pipeline so sorry it's a
pipeline which I meant as plug-in in the
last few minutes so in this particular
pipeline I had only three stages which
are the major one so I didn't have any
parallel stage access but if you have a
parallel stage then you can see them in
this particular place right and also if
you notice here these are the different
deployment steps which we did so as a
part of the deployment stage right I did
a maven deploy and it shows up that here
by default so that way whatever you have
done inside your script shows up here
right they so if I click on the compound
stage it should show the maven compile
and the check code right so since I
clicked on the deployments they showed
up that maven deploy in the testing
stage it should show me and test right I
just ran some tests there so this is how
you can directly use the stages so you
don't have to go inside the console to
see all the logs and it and it doesn't
show it logs intuitively right so now if
you see in this particular open the blue
ocean theme you can directly see the
stage and their logs here directly you
don't have been have to go to the
console log right and there are lots of
changes here to the UI itself right so
there are there is something called
artifacts you can go to test directly I
think maybe this is a rerun or something
so let's go to maybe I think this is the
old one yeah okay this is the back
button oh no it is a built right okay
yeah looks like the build number eight
is running right so if you see here
build number eight has started already
and this is a power-play okay yeah there
it has started so that is just is
nothing but the build now option so this
is how the blue ocean
team has changed the Jenkins how the
Jenkins was and now the Jenkins is now
so if you didn't like the blue ocean
option that if it didn't like this
particular theme you can immediately
flip it using this particular option
here so which means go to classic so if
I click on that option it'll take me to
the classic usoc here this is the
classic UI which we had right so this is
the option so if I want to open the blue
ocean I can just click on the open blue
ocean and I'll be just redirected to the
blue ocean you are right and if I go to
the build I can see what are the stay
safe you see here this particular stage
is building right now so that is where
it is showing this way and I can see the
logs here cutting table if I want to see
the logs of the existing one I can just
go and check it okay so this is what
blue ocean is all about so that is what
I want to cover as a part of this
particular video so in the future videos
I am trying to create a pipeline where I
can even deploy here the deployment
stage is just MAME and deploy which puts
our jar into the artifact which is
inside a maven repository but I want to
show deployment to the cloud machine so
I'm trying to do that so I'm trying to
see if I can get something in the Google
cloud platform so that I can show a full
end-to-end deployment or into in project
creation committing it in it into github
getting the build created and pushing it
into the cloud deployment right so
that's what I'm trying to show so that
is as a initial step I thought this blue
ocean is interesting and then I that's
why I wanted to share it hope you guys
found it interesting that's it for this
particular video if you liked the video
go ahead and like it if you haven't
subscribed to the channel go ahead and
subscribe to it meet you again in the
next video thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
