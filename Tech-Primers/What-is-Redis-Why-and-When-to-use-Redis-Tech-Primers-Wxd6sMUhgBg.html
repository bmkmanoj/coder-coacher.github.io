app and never miss any updates from tech
timers welcome to tech primers in this
video we are going to see what is rated
and where we can use Redis in our
application so if you are not familiar
with what is ready reader stands for
remote dictionary server so Redis is
extremely fast and it's an open source
in-memory key value data structures - so
where do we use Redis right you would
have heard these four term read with
respect to Twitter because Twitter user
it is for caching okay so it used
straightish for publishing and
subscribing your client you wise as well
so if I open Twitter client if let's say
I open Twitter so the web UI
connects to a web socket and that is
like subscribing to a channel which the
data is publishing to so if you see here
this is my Twitter ID so this gets
published
subscribe to channel so in the backend
of Twitter so they have a channel and
then if there is a message they push it
so if you see here the UI doesn't get
researched but I see some to it here
right so that is a twitter is using
rated so basically RIT is is used for
caching it can be used for session
management it can be used for publisher
subscriber based messaging and also it
can be used in places where they have
leaderboards where they want to publish
n number of information immediately and
they want to process them very quickly
so basically this is very fast because
everything is stored in in-memory so
there there is no hardware involved in
it so if you have a database you cannot
compare reduce to the database because
there in a database system data is
stored in the hard drive so if you
request for a data from the database the
database is going to get the data from
the hard drive and then return it back
to you however Redis has everything in
its cache so it this doesn't have
anything in its hardware it can in fact
you can redirect rate though store it in
a hardware
but it is a secondary option so by
default Redis is a cache basically so if
you want to use Redis you can load data
from the RT VMs on the red disk cache
use it wherever you want and then
finally when you are done you can just
throw it off so basically it's a caching
database right so Redis was written on C
language so it was written in C that is
why it is extremely fast so if you you
cannot compare anything with ready so
read its class is extremely fast because
it is written in C language right so
let's see how to use Redis right so what
I am going to do is I'm going to
download it it so you can also download
as well if you want to give it a try so
I'm just going to download it from here
it just has a slip I believe so I'm just
going to say downloads and then save so
let that get downloaded meanwhile you
can download attachment so if you see
here it has already got downloaded so
I'm just going to say show unzip this
guy clean so the unzip is complete so
let's go to the command prompt and then
so where's my and minty okay so I mean
there it is the directory where I don't
order than unzip so let's go to the
source direct alright so if you are not
familiar just yeah so what is there the
source so there are lots of commands
here if you see here there are dot C and
dot H file these are basically the C
language files good so let me go out and
then I'll do a link because if you see
here the the files were all like dot C
files right so there were no runtime bin
files which we can execute so basically
I think we need to compile the Regice
code because that's just a raw code I
just need to compile these now so I just
did a make so let's just get completed
so then we will see how to run dot
actually in fact it is done quickly cool
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
go to source and let's say water all
there so there are lots of files if you
see here all the dot o files are all the
ones which got created right now soap is
here right now the time is eight twenty
nine so it got fatal just now so there
is a ready alike file as well so I'm
going to just say ready CLI so why is
could not connect to that it is that
does it so now we need to run the radius
server so what I will do is I will just
go to the radius server so let me go to
source R it is silver right so this is
now ready to accept the server
connection okay now I have opened
another tab so what is happening here
this aster server is up there it is
server is up now so we are going to use
the command line interface to connect to
thee
it is the server so I'll just do this
yeah if you notice here I am just
running the R it is CLI so the other
server is now connected from the CLI
okay so what can I do from here right so
I can basically put the values into the
data the data store basically that's
what we said right so we can put values
and then get the values so what we are
going to do is we are just going to put
some information inside the reddit cache
and it is a key value store so we have
to put them as key so we can to put
anything inside a key so anything you
want to put you have to have a key and
you can put the value inside it so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to say is
sick if you notice you have by default
is suggesting something so it is saying
you have to put a key and then the value
so in the in the in our case I'm going
to have the key as the name okay and I'm
going to provide the name as tech
primers all right okay I'm going to
press ENTER and it just said okay so
that means the value got inserted the
key and the value got inserted into the
radius server so I need to get this out
so I'm just
take it and give me that okay so I'm
just saying that get and made so this is
like a hash map right so it is basically
like an ash map air you put key and a
value and then you get it by other key
so that is what rel does this and if you
notice a and here it is so fast one more
thing which I liked
extremely about the Redis caches you can
have a subscriber publish of model
without even having to create any
drivers or stuff like that okay and also
there are lots of polyglot libraries
which you can use so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to show you I'm going to
run two different British caches and
then I'm going to show you how to do
publish a subscriber model so what I'm
going to do here is I'm going to say
subscribe okay and I'm going to say a
channel name so if you notice here by
default it is suggesting me that give a
channel name so I'm going to say the
channel name is tech primers okay I'm
going to subscribe to this channel so
basically nothing has come here right
and here I'm going to do a publish to
that channel so I'm going to publish
some messages to that channel right so
I'm going to say hello YouTube to that
chain so if you notice here it said
integers so one message got published
I'm P notice here hello YouTube got
received here right so in the subscriber
we received the message which we
published in the other channel so that
is how the publisher subscriber box if
you see here it is so simple right we
just set up publish you just subscribed
it nothing big okay and there are lots
of libraries which are which are there
in the Java or JavaScript or not even on
Java scripts of the Java or three
different poly or
languages like Ruby Python and
everywhere you can have different
libraries which are providing lots of
functionality and you can use them to
communicate with the publisher and
subscriber so there's another good thing
about carrot inside so you don't have to
store these messages in the end email in
the hardware it is all stored in the
cache so that is why
Twitter if you notice they use the web
sockets and then transfer the message or
the poster message via the Redis cache
on to the UI so that is a very good use
case of using records then you want to
have
very fast and quick publishers of
scatter model all right so that is what
I want to show about what is the reddest
so I hope you guys understood what is
read is so in the next video we are
going to see how to create a springboard
application with a reddish cache so we
are going to use spring data ready which
spring provides in a spring board
obligation and we are going to see how
to create a simple application how to
communicate with a retic server inside
that application hope you understood
what is read is I will just summarize
what we discussed in this particular
video so redness is a extremely fast
open source in memory key value data
structure store where we can use it for
caching session management publisher
subscribe model and wherever we want to
have faster communication between the
server and the client and you have like
let's say you have multiple channels or
multiple clients register to the server
you can use Redis so you can load the
data from the database on to redish
cache and then use the cache to
communicate with each other or use the
cache as a faster medium for
communicating with different different
processes or microservices right and
Redis is written in C language that is
why it is extremely fast and if you're
not aware latest stands for remote
dictionary server okay so that is for
this particular video meet again in the
next video with the Redis springboard
implementation thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
