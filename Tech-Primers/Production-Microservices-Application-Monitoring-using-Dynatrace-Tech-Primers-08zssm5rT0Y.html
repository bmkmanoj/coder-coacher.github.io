application do you use any manual checks
or do you run any scripts every now and
then let's see how we can automate that
using dynasties hello everyone in this
video we are going to see how to use
dynaTrace to monitor our application in
production let's get started
dynaTrace is an application performance
management software which is created for
people like us who are using production
applications in order to monitor those
applications and get alerts from those
applications so we use dynaTrace at work
so if you personally ask me I have used
dynaTrace at work and it is pretty good
so what dana trace can do is like
monitoring your application it can do
network monitoring it can do synthetic
monitoring it can do real-time user
monitoring so it can even track your
request right from the end to end so
let's say when you hit a request to a
server one okay from sever one if the
request goes to server two and then it
goes on so it dynaTrace can even show
that level of detail there it can show
you the level of information across
these services for the processes so if
you have configured a trace in your
application in your firm you can get an
end-to-end statistics of what is
happening inside your JVM just right at
your desktop
okay so dynaTrace uses a thick client
basically it has a jnlp client so
basically it is a swing UI which you
will be using to monitor these
applications but I think rat-race is
also changing their landscape they
wanted to move to a web UI as well so if
is notice here this is how a dashboard
looks like in dynaTrace you can get lots
of information from dynaTrace for
example your real-time user monitoring
you can see how many services are up how
are the services performing are there
any network lags are there any
performance degrades you can see
literally anything you want in the diner
Tracy why so how do we configure this
Janet race you one so in general the
Tanit race comes up it a little bit
costlier charge so you will have to set
up damin in your
the next machine let's say if you are
not using the cloud enrollment you will
have to have a dynaTrace demon or a
collector they call it so you will have
to run a lieutenant risk collector in
your vsi machine or your Linux machine
so you should have that running in your
machine and also there will be a central
dynaTrace instance which will be
collecting all these information using
the collector so in the backend
dynaTrace collects each and every
seconds information and then stores it
and then you can use the dentist's UI to
consolidate and then see it up in the UI
so that is how the dashboard is all
getting built so the collector
collection transforms information to the
central collector process in dynaTrace
and using the transgress UI you can see
all the information and then you can get
a consolidated view of what's happening
how's the queries performing how how was
your process status at a higher level so
that is how you can see it so if you see
lots of companies are using it if you
are using any cloud infrastructure you
can use it you can use the notarized by
default so it can support a sure it can
support Cloud Foundry it can support all
the existing cloud platforms which are
out there for example AWS as well so if
you see here these are the different
cloud platforms dynaTrace is supporting
what does dynaTrace powerful at so if
you see here these are the different
stuff which they have listed by default
the the synthetic availability
monitoring which I mentioned earlier
same way with real user monitoring the
mobile app analytics business
transactions connected device experience
Internet of Things and stuff like that
so also dynaTrace claims that they are
using artificial intelligence to come up
with the statistics I'm not sure how
true is that I haven't seen that level
of detail but they claim that they are
using artificial intelligence but I have
seen both in cloud and in the vs eyes of
the normal Linux machines the monitoring
in dynaTrace is pretty good so you can
even configure that level of detail that
if your performance is degrading in your
JVM you can ask directly
to raise an alert or a send a mail to
you so you can configure that level of
detailing so let's say if your JB me is
going to hit out of memory you can
configure it saying that okay if the jvm
heap size is reaching 80 percentage give
me a message or an alert saying that
okay your heap size is almost reached 80
percentage and if there is a restart or
if there is a process shutdown you can
get alerts so it all just works
seamlessly so if there is a shutdown or
if there is an unexpected failure on a
particular instance you can immediately
get a main trigger from the dynaTrace
instance as well so and it is pretty
good in terms of microservices
monitoring that is when I I saw the real
power of dynaTrace when let's say we had
for example in my case I had a system
where we had like lots of distributed
architecture so you had like 3040
processes running in parallel across
machines right
so using dynaTrace we can see the
end-to-end picture of how the request is
traversing through the processes or the
layers so it is pretty good in terms of
building these layouts based on the
transactions how they Traverse so
dynaTrace is just literally creates like
an architecture diagram without even
having to do that the only good only
thing is you have to configure a
collector in your every Linux instance
but in terms of cloud infrastructure you
can have a common collector in the cloud
data center or a pool so that you can
get the directories activated by default
on any microt surface which you deploy
across the cloud okay so this is one of
the tool which you can use for
monitoring so in my previous video I
would have showed the J visual VM so J
visual VM was specific to JVM but
dynaTrace is it's at a different level
so J visual VM gives the statistics at
that particular instance you will have
to run it in the machine or you will
have to connect to a remote machine and
then run it but dynaTrace keeps track of
data for a much longer period so for
example you can keep their trace
information for more than three to four
days because it collects information for
every sec
so you can configure that in dynaTrace I
don't know how much is the maximum time
limit but you can configure that time
limit in dynaTrace so it can cause it
can like track every second information
and you can even see what happened at
each second you can even see a method
level break breakdown so I don't know if
I I don't think I will be able to show
it but you can do a free trial and then
try it out but I haven't tried out in my
laptop yet because I don't know whether
it will work for Mac or not so you can
see like if you are having it in your
firm you can check it out you can just
do a POC and then check how useful
dynaTrace is in terms of monitoring your
application right so that is what I
wanted to cover as a part of this
particular video hope you found
something interesting so meet you again
in the next video until then thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
