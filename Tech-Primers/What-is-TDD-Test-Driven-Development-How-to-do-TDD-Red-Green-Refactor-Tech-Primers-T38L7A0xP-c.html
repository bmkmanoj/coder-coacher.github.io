are going to see what is TDD so recently
I interviewed a guy in my office so he
was telling that ok he does TDD at work
ok so I asked him to write a small
program ok so what he did was he wrote a
Java program and then he wrote a test
case to test that Java program and he
claimed that as TDD but that's not real
TDD so let's get started and see what is
real TDD and how do people do TDD
okay so TDD is basically test-driven
development so as the name suggests you
start writing tests first before you
develop the actual code so what we are
going to do is we are going to write a
small Java program ok so basically we
are going to start from the test and
then see how how really you can write
TDD
ok so I'm going to create a program for
testing phase with ok so phase which is
a game where children is used to play ok
if if you tell the number which is
divisible by 3 okay you have to say
faith if the number is divisible by 5
you have to say buzz if it is neither
then you are to just say the number okay
that is what so basically what we are
going to do is we are going to write a
Java program for his base ok and we are
going to start off with a phase based
age so that is what test-driven
development is all about so you first
write a test class ok you don't write
the Java class you start off with the
test class and then you proceed further
in creating your main classes so before
going into the test right so we need to
add a unit so I am going to use J unit 4
ok so if you are not familiar about what
is J so J you notice our library with
which you can let your a framework
basically so with which you can write
test cases in Java to test your actual
code ok so I'm going to just add the
dependencies so I am going to use JUnit
4.1 ok
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
add the annotation add test and then I'm
going to start writing it so what we
need to do is first I am going to say
I'm going to test number so I just want
to print a number right so what I'm
going to do is I am going to create a
new main class so I am going to create a
new phase bus class all right so this
class is not there so what I do is when
I start with TDD I start with creating a
test case and from there I just start
the creation of main classes so here I'm
going to do the main class creation okay
so I'm just saying okay create fizzbuzz
for now I'm not giving any package so
once this is done what do I need to do
okay I need to play the game right so
I'm just going to say I need to play the
game okay and I'm going to pass the
number integer so that should be an
integer right so I'm going to say in
number equal to let say 1 so I what I go
what I do is I I create the methods from
the test cases only okay so here I need
to make this particular play return
something right so let's return a string
right so for now what I will do I will
return some empty string so what I do is
I write a test for this so I just say
number returned for now okay and I'm
going to assert this so I'm going to say
assert equals I want to check if it is
one right number returned so that is
what I need right so I just created a
sorry number returned okay so what I did
is I created a class okay from this test
case and I wanted to do a play okay and
I'm just passing the number one and I am
checking if it is returning one so I
deleted a string so it is returning a
string right so yeah so if I run this
test case it should pass
so that is my expectation so my
expectation out of the gate AG's all the
test cases should pass so if I do a
refactor I need to rerun the test case
and the test case should pass but if I
see that the test case is not passing it
is not returning anything because in the
main plus what we wrote is we wrote it
to return empty string that is the
problem so now we need to modify this
main class to make that particular test
fit a path so because we wrote a test to
check if it is returning a number okay
and we expect one to be written but it
is returning empty so we have to make
the main code to pass now so what I'm
going to do is I am going to convert
this to a string so I am going to string
string dot value of so I just change it
and I need to rerun the test case so
this notion of modifying the main code
and reasoning the test case again and
again is called red green refactor so if
you notice your first time and I ran the
test was failed which is in red now why
when I ran it did a a dead pass then is
that that's what it means your red green
and refactor so I just say factor my
main code to make my test pass so if you
notice here this disc is passing so and
this is satisfying every use case right
so I I said that okay if I tell one okay
you need to tell one only okay now let
us write another stress case so in what
is the next criteria right so we need to
check for fill so basically a number
which is divisible by three okay now I
am going to say again so if you notice
here I am just creating the object again
instead what we can do is we can extract
this out into a method right basically I
can do a setup method so actually I do
not have to do this here I'll just - I
will create the variable outside okay
I'll get a global variable and I will
annotate it with add D for I'll just
create a method called a setup so that
this particular method is run before
each and every test so that I can create
the object every time I do not have to
read rewrite that code right okay so now
I do is I'll just remove this piece of
code
so I don't have to write this again so
now in this case my number is let's say
I my number three so because for phase
right I need three so now I what I will
do I will do the same thing right and
just copy stuff here
but what I need is says so let me run
the test case and see what is happening
okay
actually it is running only the test
number because I ran only that taking
later on the whole test file right so if
you notice your test phases failed
because it is expecting phase but the
code is again returning three now what
we need to do is we need to refactor the
main class to make the test pass right
so what I will do I know that okay I
need to check if it is three if the
number is divisible by three I need to
do it so what I do is I can in order to
make the test pass I can even do this
okay the number is equal to equal to
three I can save this you can do this as
well to make it pass right for now let's
say we do this later on we will do
whatever we need right so okay now my
test is pass now let's say I want to
write another test okay I say divisible
by three
so here I'm going to pass six and still
I'm going to expect phase okay now if I
run with this case will it pass or fail
it will fail obviously because they
erode the main class main code to make
this the particular test pass but now
this particular test is failing now we
need to go to the main class and
refactor it again to make this
particular test go green okay so what we
need to do is we need to check if the
number divisible by 3 is equal to 0
right that is what we need so now will
it pass obviously it should pass it so
now we know that okay we are we have
added test cases of phase okay we have a
data schedule for divisible by three now
we need to add test case for five right
so we need to add this case for buzz
basically so what I will do is I will
just start this case
I'll just say test buzz okay I'm going
to say number equal to five I'm going to
use the same thing okay and I'm going to
expect buzz so if I run this test case
is it going to work
no it is not going to work if you notice
here it did not work now I need to go to
the main class and modify this same way
I'm going to add a statement okay I'm
going to say equal to equal number equal
to equal to five and I am going to
return buzz to make the test case pass
right okay let me run this let us
successful now I need to write another
test case so see me if you notice a
similar to this I need to write one more
for divisible by five so if I pass 10
will it will it pass it should pass
divisible by five
okay but if I run it it will fail right
so whenever I introduce a new test my
main code is failing so this is why I go
and refactor it to make it pass so that
is why we call it red green refactor so
I just say divisible by Phi equal to
equal to zero then only you return bus
so if I run this it should pass so if we
notice here whatever we wrote is when we
started off with the test cases okay we
started off with a failing test and then
we ended up in a successful test so this
is how you do TDD so basically it is the
real TTT so you start off with the test
you write the main class later you
create the main class or the methods
from the test okay you make the test
fail okay and then you go to the main
class refactor the test to make it pass
so that is how you really do TDD so this
is what a TDD is all about so if
somebody asks you what is TDD don't
start with writing Java classes first so
write write with start with the writing
test classes first and then you come up
with writing the main class so it by
this way
you will be able to easily test your
class and your class will be like tested
with all the scenarios so if you notice
here I initially had a three i
hard-coded three and then I realized
okay if I pass six it was not working
and then I went and three factored so by
this way you will be able to identify
all the corner cases when you start
writing the test case itself because you
are starting off your code by writing
the test first and then the code later
so this is whether there is another way
of calling it like test first approach
so which is knitting nothing but the TDD
approach okay so that's it for this
