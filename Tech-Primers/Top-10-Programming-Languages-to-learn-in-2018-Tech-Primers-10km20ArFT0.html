a new language isn't it not only when we
speak colloquial languages but also when
it comes to learning programming there
are lots of different languages and DK
the exciters every time you see a new
language let's see what are the
different languages which you can learn
in 2018 these are my personal 10 picks
if you have a specific favorite language
do let me know in the comment section
below let's see whether it matches to
what I have put down let's get started
press the bell icon on the YouTube app
and never miss any update from tech
primers
you
the first in my list is fightin Python
is a general-purpose
dynamic language that mostly emphasizes
on the code readability it also enables
the developers to use fewer lines of
code compared to the C++ or the Java
code it generally supports multiple
programming paradigms and also has a
large standard library similar to how we
have for Java and other JVM specific
languages in general if you have seen
the general community of developers lots
of people love Python compared to the
other programming languages because of
the object-oriented support which is
great and also for the shortcuts which
are very easy to handle
I am personally interested in learning
Python next year so what do you think
the next one in the list is Java if you
already know Java has released the
latest version of their software with
his new job online and they are going to
have the end of life for Java eight soon
I'm pretty sure that most of you are
already new to Java eight and learning
these streams and stuff I have already
done some courses and done some videos
on Java eight streams you can check that
out for learning Java and for Java nine
I have just started making Java 9 and I
have started learning Java 9 as well
because of the new features it's Java
has added as a part of that but if you
are new to Java Java is one of the
leading chances when it comes to
developers who are writing program all
over the world it is a language which is
object-oriented language it is also
class-based and also it is following the
write once run anywhere principle you
can write it once and you can run the
executable or the final compiled State
anywhere in the civil so in general
people love Java for its concurrency
when it compared with the Python which
we saw earlier it has also lots of
libraries and it has a very good
performance when it comes to the
processing lots of enterprise companies
use Java because of the support which
the community provides which when it
comes to enterprise grade that is why
lots of Java fans have their support
towards Java because you have a greater
community you have a wider community
than anything else
the next in the list is JavaScript
JavaScript is another language which is
very popular among the web developers if
you are a web developer I don't have to
say about it javascript is an
object-oriented and dynamic language and
it is one of the core technologies in
the internet right now any website you
open it will definitely have JavaScript
inner nowadays people are writing
without JavaScript however javascript
has transformed into a server-side
programming language in the recent times
with the introduction of node.js
so javascript is also gaining popularity
so even though some people tend to think
Java and JavaScript are same they are
not really the same they are completely
different languages Java is not a
dynamic language javascript is a dynamic
language and JavaScript is mostly
influenced with its own self-sustained
schemes so it is not similar to Java it
is completely different from Java
JavaScript is seeing the rise in the
recent times and is also included in the
list of hottest web development trends
in the Year 2070 so definitely if you
have not tried a Java Script definitely
do try it out try out any node.js
application try creating a node.js
application with server-side policy
the next in the list is PHP PHP is
generally a server-side and the
general-purpose language which is used
for the web development if you had seen
lots of websites use PHP in the current
world there was a statement there were
more than 90% of the websites designed
using PHP in the entire world so PHP is
considered very easy to learn and it is
often chosen by developers who just
start off as a fresher so when you want
to design a website within few hours of
just learning then people start off with
PHP because the language in itself is
like a C language you can easily write
or learn stuff in PHP that is why people
use PHP and it is loud by people who
just start off with programming in
general it also has lots of high quality
solutions for the array of web problems
and it also has lots of frameworks that
is why people use PHP because they can
just get started in a matter of few
hearts or maybe minutes
the next in the list is Golan or go as
we call go is a language which was
created by Google and it is an
open-source language it is compiled and
has lots of features such as garbage
collection memory safety and limited
structural typing compared to C language
Golan is the most preferred language
nowadays because of its flexibility it
is a really good choice if you are
working with network applications and
also with web servers if you see the
lots of latest containers are using the
Golan because of the way the language
has evolved in these last 10 years maybe
I think seven years now seven or eight
years now go also behaves consistently
across the platform and it is why it is
a great deal when it comes to developers
for writing server-side applications
the next in the list is Kotlin Kotlin if
you have heard in the last year has
gained a lot of attraction from the
Android developers and Google has
announced Kotlin as its official
language for creating Android
applications because of the way the
Cortland language itself has evolved
along with the community with which
Android is developing it is a statically
typed programming language where you can
use it on any JVM if you are writing a
JVM application you can use Kotlin along
with it
that is why Cortland has been used
inside the Android studio so if you know
about Android studio Android studio
primarily support Scotland because the
creator of IntelliJ created Cortland if
you haven't had any hands-on on Kotlin
do try it out I have done couple of
videos on Cortland and at usage it is
pretty good I like the feature of not
having a null pointer in the whole
language which is what I feel is good
compared to what we have in other
languages like Java or groovy because it
is a JVM language you can do whatever
you do in Java and groovy along with
that it provides lots of flexibility in
writing less code compared to Java
it is completely interoperable with Java
because it runs on the JVM so you can
call Cortland the Java Java to cut
length and stuff like that very easily
in a normal fashion not like Java 2 C or
C to Java con right if you know what I
mean with the j'ni
when we talk about Android we need to
talk about iOS as when right
Swift is the language which is powering
the iOS devices it was created by Apple
as a part of the iOS upgrade Swift is a
multi paradigm protocol oriented
object-oriented functional imperative
and block structure language it is too
much right that is what is powering the
iOS or your iPhone that is why it has so
many features if we had known about
objective-c that was what iOS was using
initially however in the recent times
Apple has switched to a new language
called Swift which they had created in
2014 it is completely static and strong
strongly inference it can work on Linux
Darvin or any language which you know
many any platform which you know if you
are an iOS developer you definitely know
that you will be using Swift but if you
are not know that ions or the Apple
platform run using Swift applications
the next in the list is r-r-right that
is the language name in fact so R is a
language which is also a multi
parallelogram object-oriented functional
style procedural reflective an
imperative language R is generally used
by people who are working on statistics
usually data miners for developing
statistical software's and for creating
data analysis of ways arts popularity
has increased in substantially in the
recent years because of the way people
are mining data if you know about the
recent boom in the data mining industry
where if you have lots of data within
latest technologies with the usage of
Big Data and Hadoop kind of systems data
mining has gained lot of traction and
languages like are are gaining more and
more users nowadays are is generally a
command-line interface however there are
recently graphical front lines which
people are developing in order to
support the language
the next in the list is C language
obviously everyone would have learnt
about the C language because that is the
basic language which you start off with
right C is generally an imperative or a
structured language which was created
for the multi-purpose or the general
purpose usage however people are not
using it much compared to the other
languages because it is just a basic
language it lacks lots of features
because it was created I think 45 years
ago right it is static language it is
slightly weak it is nominal it is
cross-platform however it doesn't do
whatever the other languages do
currently however if you are a beginner
you can start off with C because it
provides the basic functionalities of
how you create a program so as a part of
C language you will learn lots of basics
of how your thinking should be when you
write a program
the next in the list is groovy groovy is
an object-oriented programming language
for the JVM however it is a dynamic
language unlike Java it has lots of
features which are copied from Python
Ruby pearl or small talk that is why it
is more powerful and it runs on the JVM
in general groovy files are converted
into the bytecode and they run on the
JVM directly so groovy users Java like
curly braces and the sin taxes so you
should be familiar with groovy when you
already know Java if you know Java or
Cottenham you probably know Ruby as well
because it is almost similar however it
is a dynamic language you don't have to
do casting or typecasting every time and
it is object-oriented obviously because
it's a JVM language and it was founded
14 years ago I am interested in adding
groovy to this list because I feel that
the Jenkins pipeline already uses groovy
so can you come to the DevOps world of
automation and automating starts using
the Jenkins pipeline you will have to
learn groovy so that is why I add a
groovy there are other languages which
are more or better than groovy however
groovy is useful when you are writing
pipelines in Jenkins and you need to
learn groovy if you want to write
pipelines when you are using Jenkins and
it is a JVM language so it will be very
easy for you to learn when you already
know Java if you already know Java you
know a little bit of groovy you know a
little bit of coordinate so if you learn
these languages little bit they will
give new features from other languages
like Python or Ruby or Perl if you know
them personally like Python separately
then you might be able to easily guess
the features of groovy they CH are
incorporated from the Python goodnight
so those are the different languages
which I wanted to just put it down here
which I am looking forward to know in
2018 I know most of them however there
are languages like Python or even Biko
which I have no clue on which I wanted
to learn in 2018 what do you want to
learn in 2008
do let me know in the comment section
below I'll try to make videos on that if
I know if I don't know I will try to
learn along with you that's it for this
particular video mate again in the next
video
thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
