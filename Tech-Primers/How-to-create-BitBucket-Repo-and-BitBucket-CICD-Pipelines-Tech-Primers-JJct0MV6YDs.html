CI CD pipeline for free so that you can
play around with it let's see how we can
use bitbucket pipelines to create our
own continuous integration and
continuous delivery pipeline for free
let's get started
in my previous video you would have seen
that I created a bit pocket account and
I was mentioning that there are free
pipelines in the bait bucket so in this
particular video we are going to see how
we can create pipelines inside bit
bucket okay we are going to create a
project so we already have a sample
project in IntelliJ I am just going to
push that project and topic bitbucket
and I'm going to show you how to create
a pipeline from big bucket and this bit
bucket pipelines run on the docker
engine right so let's see what are these
bit bucket pipelines so I had created a
sample project few minutes a few minutes
ago yeah I was just in the pipeline so
I'll tell you what our pipeline is right
so bitbucket pipelines are nothing but
continuous integration and continuous
delivery software okay or the what you
call the pipeline the build basically so
it is similar to Jenkins okay but it is
on the cloud and it is for free so if we
are using a bitbucket project inside a
bit packet Auto RG and if you have a
project creator and if you have a
repository you can enable bitbucket
pipelines on the fly and whenever you
push a code to this particular
repository if you had a pipeline enabled
your build gets triggered okay so we are
going to see that how this is going to
work but just know that bitbucket
pipelines are similar to jenkins
pipeline so if you had seen my videos on
Jenkins pipeline those Jenkins playpens
are written in groovy and there is a
groovy DSL inside the Jenkins host
itself but bitbucket pipelines are
something different so in the bed bucket
pipelines you can use docker images so
you will have a Hamel file where you
will mention the docker image which you
want to use as a part of your pipeline
and there are some Yambol formats which
you will have to use for using the bed
bucket pipeline okay so in this
particular example we are going to see
how we can push our code from your local
machine on to pin pocket and use bit
bucket pipeline to build it so that is
what we are going to see here so I have
a project here which I used for the I
think writing test cases so I had some
tests here
right yeah nothing I was showing how to
write integration tests right so those
are the tests here and what this project
has is a simple resource right so that
is just a resource which uses the user
repository there is a h2 database there
are some data inside that and we are
just covering that particular resource
that's it nothing else okay this is a
small spring JPA hibernate application
so it is a spring MVC okay what we are
going to do is they are going to push
this on to the new repository which we
are going to create in bitbucket and see
how the pipeline's can be enabled so I
don't have anything else apart from that
we eat me dot MD in this particular
project the readme says sorry the red
means a sample project for testing bed
packet Backman that's it okay so I'm
going to create a new repository so let
me go to the home right so this is the
home so this is whenever you create a
project inside bit packet and when you
log in you will see this page so right
now I have two repositories here I'm
going to create a new repository I'll
just say create and then I can click on
the repository option so you can create
private repositories or public
repository I am going to create a public
repository so that you guys can also
take a look at the example so I'm just
going to name it as a spring Jaypee a
pipeline example okay and the repository
which I am using is good I don't have
make period so I'm going to use git so
I'm just going to say create repository
so this is going to create a completely
new repository you can create whatever
you want in this particular project okay
that is what you can do you can create
files you can decorate this with any
other existing projects so what I am
going to do is I'm going to use the
commands to integrate my project which
is there in the local into this
particular repository so bitbucket by
default provides some commands here so
if you see here if you are starting off
from the scratch you can use these
commands if you are having an existing
project and you want to integrate and
push that project onto the bitbucket
repository you can follow this process
so i am just going to add the remote URL
for this one
tickler project so this particular
project is already on gate so yeah this
particular project is already on gate so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
paste this option what this does is this
is going to add my remote repository to
this particular option okay since I
already had a remote repository it is
saying that ok remote origin exists so
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to update my origin to new repository so
I'm going to say set URL ok this is
going to add the new repository to my
origin okay so my local repository which
is gate is now pointing to the remote
repository which is the bitbucket server
ok so now what I'm going to do I'm going
to commit these files I I think I have
already committed them just let me check
if I have anything to commit so I'm just
giving some comment saying sample
project this will do a commit yeah I
think one file let's go change so I'm
going to push this to the remote
repository so the command is get push
origin master I'm going to push my
master branch to the origin so our is it
is nothing but the new repository which
we created right yeah the push is
successful a new branch got created in
the remote repository so let's go and
quickly check if our code is showing up
here so I'm just refreshing this
repository yeah if you notice here this
is what we had right in our 8 meter
MD so it is showing sample projects and
all our commits are here right if you go
to source option you can see the files
there yeah all my files are here right
so if I just go and see if this is the
same project yep this is my project
which got committed now okay so we have
created a remote repository we have
pushed our code from local to remote now
how do we enable bitbucket pipeline
right so if you go to this pipeline
option in the left side this takes you
to a page where it says how you can
enable the bit record project
example by default bitbucket provides a
template so I'm gonna use the template
itself so you can choose whatever
language you are using so if you are
using a PHP project you can push the PHP
projects or JavaScript or Python or
darker project anything you can push it
so in my case I'm going to use a maven
project because I am using maven so this
is the maven template right so what I
need to do is I need to create a file
called bitbucket
plug it pipeline sort Yama and then I
need to have this as a template so let's
see what happens to it what I'm going to
do I'm going to create it from my local
it's in if I'm going to show you how you
can push it so let me make sure if the
repository in sync is in sync so I'll
just do a git repository pull to sync my
origin with this okay yeah the pull is
successful now let me create a new file
so the file name should be bitbucket -
pipelines dot yama right so let me check
once again bitbucket - pipelines
Toriyama right yeah I need to add this
to give so the content of this
particular file should be the template
so if you notice this template this is
what bitbucket pipeline will be using
okay so the default image which I am
providing here is the maven because this
is a maven project and if you notice
here there are some comments here okay
you can specify a custom docker image
from docker hub as you as you're
building room so if you have a different
build type right Gradle or something
else you can provide that as an image
here okay so that the bed packet
pipeline when it runs on the docker
image it will use that particular image
so in my case I'm going to use a maven
image so I am just saying maven version
has three three nine
so pipelines is the Yael notation so
default and there's only one step so
this is the default step I'm providing
I'm just saying maven is my default step
the step is called maven and what is the
script I need to run as a part of that
step right so the script I'm going to
run for now is maven verify let's run
this first and then we can modify this
too
maime and clean and Stan just to show
whether bitbucket is triggering
automatically after every commit right
so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna say
the commit has ADD bitbucket pipeline
and I'm going to do a commit and push so
this should automatically push to my
remote repository which is there in
bitbucket so this is getting pushed
let's see if the push is successful yeah
the push is successful now I need to go
to source if I go to source I should be
able to see the new file which we pushed
just few seconds ago yeah if you see
here the bitbucket pipeline sodium l is
available here and this got pushed 19
seconds ago so let's go to the overview
page again right here it should show the
pipeline status so if you see here there
is something which is loading up here
here it is saying no pipeline has a run
for the head of master because we did
not enable the pipeline right so let me
go to this pipeline option and enable
the pipeline first so there is a option
here which is called enable and if you
notice your bid bucket by default
identify that okay you have a ml phone
so if you see here you have found we
have found the existing yeah Mille file
in your repository you can enable
pipelines to start building edit and
commit a new configuration so this is
basically the configuration file which
is required to run the big bucket by
plane so I'm going to enable this if I
click on the enable option right so this
is going to enable a pipeline build so
let's go to the pipeline built and see
right let me just show you in a
different window so once I enabled it
there should be a build which should be
starting so if you notice here this is
the build which has started right so if
you see here the master build is running
and this is the build number one right
let me go and say the bill so this is
similar to the Jenkins build however
this is running inside a docker image
right
so if I remove this or make it bigger
you can see what it is doing so it is
downloading all the maven dependencies
and it is just running the task called
maven verify right so as a part of
verifying it's just making sure all the
dependencies are downloaded and the
build is ready there are some tests
which are running as well so that is
what is happening as a part of the
builder right and if you see here the
build is successful so our build has run
so if you see these are the two steps
which are there so the first step is the
berry setup which is doing a checkout of
the code and then it is setting up what
emails it needs which is a maven image
for us and the next step is doing a
maven claim very fine okay and if you
notice you're in the builder log here it
says the build number is successful so
when there is only one step okay if I go
to the project home you can see that
particular status here now if I see here
master has passed so what we did here is
we did not even set up any Jenkins we
did not even set up any server we just
had our local project we just created
the repository inside bitbucket website
and we just pushed a code from our local
to the food packet server and enabled
the pipeline once a pipeline got enabled
we were able to get our master build run
right now if I modify how we'll
bitbucket know that right so I'm going
to what I'm going to do is I'm going to
change this as clean install and I'm
going to commit it once I committed
bitbucket
automatically detects that there is a
change and it will trigger the build so
I'm going to say clean change verify to
clean and install I'm just pushing it so
once this push is successful you should
be able to see that in bitbucket the
build is automatically triggered I think
I need to pull in the latest change
and right the push is successful now
they have a tow commit so the Porsche
successful let's see this page right so
this page should now show that there is
a new bed which which should be starting
okay because we committed the file so if
you notice your sorry if you notice here
the master build is again running now
automatically so I didn't even trigger
anything it is automatically running so
let's go to the build again this should
run the same thing just that it should
run the step called maven clean install
if you notice they are already they
build a successful and you can see that
it is successful if you want to rerun it
you click on the rerun button this will
trigger a new build okay if you see here
pipeline number three has started it is
spending for the next executor service
so once it is received as I see it is
started now step one is starting and the
next one should be maven clean and start
okay so this is how they can configure a
bitbucket pipeline okay so what we did
in this particular example is we created
a project locally and that project we
pushed it onto bitbucket repository
using some get commands and be enable
the width akut pipeline and we saw how
we can run the pipeline and how big
bucket is identifying if there is any
newcomers okay if you want any
customizations you can do that in the
settings here so there are lots of
customization here you can add your
image you can change your project name
we can add reviewers you can invite new
people so this is exactly similar to the
bit bucket you have in the enterprise
world but just that this is or it is for
free you can have any open source
project you can enable pipelines to it
you can just use it as you want okay I
will I'll be start using this pipeline
because it is very good if you want to
Ransome project and then upload it into
into a maven troppo you can use this so
I'll be using this if I if you are using
any open-source project or if you are
contributing to open source community or
if you have any open source idea you can
definitely go to bitbucket because it is
pretty good you can leverage the
pipeline's because they are giving the
bail for free okay so that is it I think
that's it so that's what I wanted to
cover so hope you guys found this
interesting so if you want me to make on
any specific videos on bitbucket or the
pipeline's do let me know or if you have
any other topic do let me know is it I
will definitely try to do that that's it
for this particular video hope you guys
like the video if you liked the video go
ahead and like it if you haven't
subscribed to the channel go ahead and
subscribe to it maybe ogive in the next
video thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
