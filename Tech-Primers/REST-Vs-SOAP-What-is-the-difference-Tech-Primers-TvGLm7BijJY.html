are going to see what is so and how is
it different from rest and we are going
to compare soap and rest and see which
is better so if you are familiar with
soap
so soap is a simple object access
protocol so you can transfer soap
objects in terms of XML format over HTTP
protocol and then you can use those
objects and formulate those objects and
then do whatever you want with that so
why do you need soap right it is
important to create a application which
is which your it which you are able to
communicate over the Internet
so that is when soap started so
initially when soap started people
wanted to transport data from one
website to another or they wanted to
ship data from one place to another over
the Internet so that is when soap was
invented okay and so what it did is it
wrapped around lots of stuff inside it
and then it was shipped over the HTTP
protocol so basically soap has lots of
building blocks basically if you notice
here this is the skeleton of a soap
message so you can see an envelope you
can see Heather's body you can see some
data inside that called fault okay so in
general soap has a specific type of
format like you have to have a name
spazio to have differents type attribute
so for example you see here there are
different types of attic attributes and
stuff like that so you need to have all
those things but in terms of the rest
you don't have to do any of those so if
you notice here this is a typical
dressed message so you have a successful
success which is false and payload you
have some data and then there is a error
code touch it so that is the rest is as
simple as that so rest is nothing but
representational state transfer so so
how are they different right so how what
is the difference between soap interest
both are in HTML HTTP transaction over
HTTP protocol but still how is it
different right so if you notice this
particular
a column so it clearly shows the
difference between the soap and the rest
protocol so soap is basically xml-based
a message protocol however rest is a
architectural style protocol so we will
see in depth about rest in in few
moments so let us come back to soap
right soap use something called a blaze
diem format for communicating between
the producer and the consumer okay so
however rest with rest you can do
whatever you want so you can even use
XML or you can use JSON so whatever data
we saw here this is JSON data so this is
nothing but JavaScript object notation
okay so that is an imitation if you want
to transact examines you can do that as
well interest okay also smoke soap
invokes the services by calling the
remote procedure calls however rest is
all like URL path
okay so soap if you notice your soaps
responses are not that much readable so
it takes a while to understand it has so
colon envelop so cone body and stuff
like that however rest in terms of
looking at it it is easy for us to
understand since the okay error has code
and message something like that okay so
that is a difference in the india
readable format okay also the transfer
of soap is over HTTP most mostly the
rest is always HTTP you can use as some
TP FTP etc and so also those another
thing is a JavaScript can easily call
the soap but it is difficult to
implement however interest rate so you
can easily call the rest message or you
can easily call the HTTP endpoint and
get that message in JavaScript very
quickly because if you are using JSON
it is very easy so Jason is nothing but
JavaScript object notation so okay so
the performance is not great compared to
the sole and soap if you see it's heavy
bite it can notice a soap message it is
heavy very tight so you are just sending
a price and you have to write so much of
code for that your you are having
basically lots of ceremonies which we
don't require however in terms of thrust
all gone you just concentrate on
whatever data you want okay so that is
why rest is always having better
performance than soap so if you notice
the Martin Fowler he has proposed a he
has created a blog post on the
Richardson maturity model so Richardson
is a person who had created different
levels based on the rest approach okay
if you notice here he has created a
different approaches or levels basically
called as level one level two level
three okay that's what we are going to
see what is this level one level two
level three all right so before that we
have something called level zero as well
so he has a name for that level zero but
if you notice by default soap is level
zero so basically whatever you transact
over the HTTP protocol okay so that is
all level zero so soap is you can come
sector data by HTTP so soap is level
zero okay so that is what is mentioned
here so I'm not going to go in detail of
what is what but I will just brush up so
that you can easily understand so our
other easy way to understand soap and
rust is consider and envelopes right so
soap is like an envelope so you have an
you have a cover and then you put
something you use soap you put your
paper inside the envelope and then pack
it and send it over
so soap is something like that however
rest is like a postcard so if you see a
postcard you it's all open right so what
about content you have it's all open so
that is like rest of something similar
so it is not that much secured but you
can make it secured internally in
application however soap if you see it
is much secured and it is like not
everybody will able be able to take hold
it quickly you need a WSDL to decode
stuff and something - ok so that that is
the basic difference between soap and
rest so in terms of understanding right
so the next one is the level one or so
so level one is like what - I said there
what mm Richardson says is that you need
to have a resource basically so
resources in the things you need to have
rest endpoints in terms of resources
for exam instead of having a big
resource you have a you introduce any
cultural sources instead of having a big
recent point you have instead of having
a single rest endpoint you have
resources basically for example if you
notice in this particular example it
says dr. slash and Jones and then you
have slots one two three four so you
have different rest endpoints so
basically these are different resources
rather than having our single rest
endpoint you can easily query based on a
particular source so you can say slots
one two three four and then you can get
that particular data for that particular
resource so those are called resources
so rest is majorly concentrated on
resources so that he can easily update
those reserves for example I can notice
here you on that particular resource you
can do something so you can do a post
for example on the particular associate
or doing an appointment so on that
particular slaughtering an appointment
so so you can do operations on that
particular resource so that is the level
one too so the next one is the verbosity
so in HTTP for us try TB you can create
URLs in terms of verbose so you can you
can have a resource path in terms of
creating verbal communication like the
for example if you notice here these are
like dr. /m Joan slash law so this
clearly shows that this particular this
point is specific to M Joan's slot and
he is a doctor again if you notice here
the other one under the slots there is a
number one two three four so you can
control the one two three four slot
number one two three four a separately
so if you notice here the location is
also four incisors law says one two
three four slash appointment so you can
do you can cancel the appointment or
create upon mother stuff like that you
can do all right and and if you notice
here the names are all Nick Bobo's so
I'm not saying get slots or I'm not
saying get M Jones
slots or something like that okay so
that is the level 2 that is what
Richardson says the last one would be is
the hyper media control so you have
something called hey TOS so hypertext as
the engine of application state so base
you have links within lennick so if you
notice this particular response right
you have response and internally inside
the response you have a link to another
rest endpoint basically so I'm saying
that okay for the dr. M Jones the link
for the slot ID one two three four is
this so basically you have you can
access another restrain point from this
restrain point so that is what the
hyperlink the 11:3 says the hyper text
or they have the media control so you
can have hey tio is implemented as well
so you don't have to worry about linking
the data within the same response so you
can use that as well so that is another
major change over in Vegas right so
these are the different differences
between soap and rest so if you notice
arrest is very lightweight and you have
lots of control over wrist it is all
verbose you can do hypermedia controls
as well so that's where rest is popular
now if you if you personally ask me a
rest is better than soap I would say you
add yeah there is a security concern and
so but however in ended rest actually
but you can have controls in the
application using like if you see the
latest of spring security in spring MVC
right so you have lots of security
options inside spring MVC you cannot
think security and control your secure
your first ten points based on
authentication and authorization of
different mechanism so it is it is
lightweight and it is good
so rest is lightweight and indirect is
good so P on the other hand is it is
heavy weight and and it is outdated if
you ask me personally so so that that is
the difference between the soap and that
is hope you understood what is the basic
criteria between soap and rest so choose
your protocol wisely okay so until then
make you again in the next video until
then see you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
