applications with angular and how do you
manage the HTML files and the JavaScript
files in a spring boot application isn't
it difficult to configure the setup
initially because you will have to have
lots of HTML files and JavaScript files
generated beforehand and you will have
to integrate that into your spring good
project under different folder so that
it can align into a single codebase
isn't that quite difficult Jay hipster
is going to solve the particular problem
by automatically creating these projects
out of the box in this video we are
going to see how to create or how to use
je hipster to create a spring boot
application with angular
press the bell icon on the YouTube app
and never miss any update from tech
primers J hipster is a framework or a
generator which creates code for us to
easily create applications with spring
boot and angular this is the website of
J hipster J hipster dot tech it is
nothing but a utility with which you can
create deploy and develop spring boot
and angular based applications
out-of-the-box you don't have to create
projects from the start not spring dot
IO and then add your HTML and JavaScript
files you don't have to hand craft all
those stuff manually you can use J
hipster to create all these stuff
automatically so what J hipster does is
it use a spring boot and creates the
spring boot based project it uses grunt
gulp and other different configurations
to set up NPM based UI module with which
angular can be known
it creates an end to end setup with
spring boot and angular so that you have
a UI framework with which you can manage
your application you can customize that
based on your need but what Jake Jake
ster does is it is going to create that
with just a single step process we are
going to create a series of step we are
going to use series of step which J
hipster provides to set our expectation
and the project gets created based on
our inputs so let's see how to do that
before starting off with each a hipster
project you need to set up some stuff
for J hipster to be run you can use the
J hipster command line interface to set
up the project in order to do that you
can go to the setting up environment
where we have an option called
installing J hipster this shows up the
different steps which we need to perform
during the setup process it can be
either for the mac OS or it can be for
windows as well so you have different
options mentioned here if you follow
these options you will be able to set it
up so i have mac OS here so what i did
is i just installed hips j hipster brew
install j hipster
also i did not have gulp so i had to
install gulp you
yawn so previously I had created yawn
and NPM packages so I had already Nold
yarn boa etcetera I did not have gulp
and J hipster so I used J brew because I
have brew in built in my laptop so I am
using blue to insult a hipster and I
have done that so it provides a
command-line interface as well if you
are using Windows you can use the
chocolaty to install chain stir
so I'm going to use the angularjs
project so which basically is the
JavaScript version of angular 1 dot X I
have not learned angular typescript yet
so I am going to show only the young
angular JavaScript part of J hipster so
let's try setting it up right I have the
terminal here so this is just my
terminal nothing else I'm in the folder
called J hipster where I'm going to
create a project there is nothing right
now in this particular directly I'm
going to create the project called hello
world let's go into the module so in
order to create the spring boot and the
angular application using J hipster you
can run the command J hipster so J
hipster is going to setup my default
stuff so J hipster is a command line
interface so I have done that already I
have installed gesture already that's
why I'm able to enter J hipster
separately if you want to create an
application you can say J hipster : app
even if you don't provide that by
default it will execute the J hipster :
app command and you can see this
interactive shell which is going to pop
up and there are lots of options here
which we which are like by default
mentioned here you can take a look at
that this is going to say application
files will be generated in the folder
this particular folder yeah I want to
generate it here that's fine which type
of application would you like to create
I would like to have a monolithic
application because I don't want to have
multiple microservices if you want to
create microservices basically different
JVM or different services then you can
select the microservices option I'm
going to select the monolithic
application because I want the UI and
the Springwood application to be in the
same so so I've selected that what is
the base name of the application I'm
just going to say hello world this is
just for the naming purpose in the poor
Maxim one the next one is
package so I'm going to say calm tech
primers J hipster that's going to be our
Java package name so do you want to use
Apes register to configure monitor and
scale your application so I don't want
to do that right now so I'm just going
to say no what are the different
authentication so at which type of forth
and authentication would you like to use
I'm going to select just the HTTP
session authentication there are
different types of what on vacation you
can use JWT or oauth2 so by default the
UI is going to set it up so many of you
we're asking me to help you in the OAuth
or JWT space but if you are using je
hipster you don't have to do that
because je hipster by default integrates
with OAuth which is the spring
implementation of work so I'm just going
to select HTTP session authentication
here the next step is which type of
database would you like to use I'm going
to use h2 in in our case so this is for
the development purpose next it asks for
the production purpose because in
production heat suggests that we should
not be using h2 so by default it is
telling me my sequel my ad be post clay
sequel Oracle um Isaac Microsoft sequel
so I'm just going to select my sequel
because I am NOT going to deploy
anything to my production or anything
remotely so I will just select my sequel
for development it is asking me what
type of database who I would like to use
I'm just going to say h2 with in-memory
persistence so I don't want to store
anything in the file system I'm just
going to say I want an in-memory
persistence whenever I'm having the data
the next step is do you want to use
spring cash abstraction I'm just going
to say yes use the eh cash
implementation the next is do you want
hibernate second level cache I am just
going to say no I don't want any
hibernate second level cache would you
like to use maven or Gradle you can
choose either I am going to use maven
the next step is to integrate the other
technologies which are required into our
applications for examples social login
do you want to integrate Google Facebook
Twitter login or search engine and
elastic stuff so I'm just going to or in
fact you can integrate the
sockets as well but previously we saw
some time back what are WebSockets if
you want to directly use WebSockets you
can use je hipster to directly integrate
WebSockets as well we can see that later
but I'm just going to use this swagger
for cogeneration so I'm just going to
select API first development using
swagger cogent so swagger will be
integrated into our application out of
the box and the API is are going to be
created the API designs are going to be
created the next is the major part which
framework would you like to use as a
client so I'm just going to select
angularjs one dot X because I don't want
to use typescript here would you like to
enable SAS support I am just going to
say no enable internationalization
support if you select this as yes it is
just going to ask you a different
language but I don't want a different
language I am just going to say no if
you are from a different country and if
you want to use your own language you
can do that besides j-unit and comma
which testing framework would you like
to use I am just going to say protractor
would you like to install any other
generator from the je hipster markets
place I'm just going to say no I don't
want anything else so this is going to
download and validate all the setups
which we did now if we had mentioned a
different step it is going to take a
different route so I'll just fast
forward this for the next five seconds
so that you can see the completion of
this particular step
you
so the installation is completed I need
to run either gulp install or maven NW
I'm just going to do a gulp install
meanwhile I'll just open the project
using my IntelliJ I'll just say idea
open
let my project open in IntelliJ again
and meanwhile I'll also do a gulp
install so that it downloads or install
the UI related stuff as a part of the
setup
because gulp install is going to do the
maven install basically it is going to
download the dependencies which are
required for that particular UI related
project so let's do the gulp in store
this will take a while
meanwhile IntelliJ is coming up and we
should be having our project importing
the stuff I'll just fast forward that as
well so that you can take a look in the
next five seconds
you
okay the project is almost up the
dependencies are getting downloaded and
the indexes are going to happen after
that mean when what we can do is we can
open the bomb examine and we can take a
look at the different dependencies which
I mentioned inside the power maximal
let's remove this so the different
dependencies are maven version is 3 Java
version is 1.8 Scala
there is a scholar version as well in
this project there is a node node
version yan yan version so node and node
is a JavaScript server which we can use
for hosting our UI there so for example
the angularjs part can be hosted there
yarn is a dependency downloader like
maven like just does the only the
dependency part it doesn't do the
complete stuff like maven next we have a
bunch of projects related dependencies
then we have maven related dependencies
there are J hipster dependencies for
example this is the J hipster version
0.1 dot 7 then we have the spring boot
version 1.5.2 have hibernate Java is
foreign tation processing then we have
liquid base liquid base is for database
schema creation which can be done
automatically then we have the
validation ABI in Hammon it then we have
map strut as well to map the Java beans
to the java class
then we have some maven dependencies
here then we have the docker file so the
docker file gets created out of the box
in this particular project we are going
to see that next it also has the plugins
and also the Java code coverage jacoco
plugin it also has a front and Mayman
plugin so these are different plugin
related versions it also has the sonar
exclusions which are configured
explicitly here these are different
sonar exclusions which are done apart
from that nothing else and then we have
the dependencies mentioned here so all
the versions which we have seen all
those dependencies would be mentioned
here so they are using hips j' hipster
drop wizard for metrics then jackson
hero database JSON path we have swagger
we have liquid base we have Hikari
connection pool and all other stuff
right so all these are mentioned here
let's go to the exact structure of the
project so the indexing is completed
here and if you notice it has already
converted this project into a kid
project as well so J hipster in fact
converts the new project into a git
project by default so we have bunch of
folders here we have gulp folder we have
maven folder we have the node modules as
well so under the main you can notice
that there is a docker folder docker
folder has the dock of files which are
required when we are going to deploy
this particular package as a docker
image so these are different
configurations which we are supposed to
add to the talk of file in order to
create a docker image so these are by
default provided by the hipster project
same with the my sequel yeah Milan this
one are for the package scans the
abdominal is specific to our application
ml so these are different configuration
files which are provided by J hipster
for the docker project or dhaka
deployments then we have the Java so
Java has all our Java code so if you see
here these are the different packages
which are created by default and there
are a bunch of code here already because
we are going to see why in a while we
have lots of files here the repositories
the config has the config Java
configurations or the Springwood
configurations you can see the add
configuration orientation so these are
different configurations which are
required for the setup which we already
did and there are lots of JPA
repositories which are by default
created here we do have some service
classes in the under the service package
and the resources are under the web rest
package so I can see our counter source
which is the risks controller so it is
using spring MVC by default because we
are using a spring boot project so
that's with the Java code we do have the
configurations under the resources
folder so the liquid based
configurations are present here for
example the table schemas can be
mentioned under the liquid base folder
we do have the application specific
configurations in the application Yaman
for dough we have some separate
configuration and for prod we have some
separate configuration so all these are
by default created by j hip-stir
so same with other package related stuff
so for example these are for sending out
mails there are other HTML formats as
well which can be used ok we do have
into server properties that's it so now
under the web
folder we will have all the JavaScript
and HTML files which are required for
the angular project so consider this as
a separate angular project that's how it
is going to look like so we do have the
Gulf file outside the Gulf file on the
BOA Jason these are some different
setups which we can use for the dam
these are outside the web apps so under
the web apps we have the app folder we
also have this Wagga UI if you notice
here there is a swagger UI directly so
you can configure or even modify this
particular code in order to make your
swagger UI custom driven so under the
app we have the application specific
angular code so this is angularjs so you
can see the JavaScript code here if I go
to home you can see the index dot HTML
which is going to say welcome Java
hipster so this is where our HTML codes
reside and if you want to do any angular
specific changes for example JavaScript
makes changes then you can do it in the
controller
or you can even create services then you
can bind them so now let's start the
application so that's it right so we
don't have anything else apart from that
we can directly start the project so I'm
going to go to the plugin the spring
boot plugin and then I'm going to run
the spring boot run so this is going to
bring our application however I have
eight zero eight zero blocked by my
default Jenkins so I am going to change
that particular port since the profile
is due you can see the profile here here
as there so I'm just going to do
application dev let me search for server
yeah so I'm just going to use the port 8
0 8 2 4 now let me start the application
now because I don't want to use the 8 0
8 0 port because it is going to fail
because already Jenkins is running in my
laptop with that boat
the other thing is I think it is using
Java 9 let me down create that as well
because by default I have Java 9 in my
laptop let me change that as well
so yep that should do hopefully there
are no more changes let me check think
that's it let in on the project so this
is going to take few minutes for us to
power up meanwhile we can go to the gulp
install yep gulp install is completed so
we should be good with the UI part so
once this spring boot application comes
up the UI should be ready as well so we
don't have to do anything extra
if you don't run the gulp install you
will be getting errors because the UI
will not be ready until you do a gulp
install gulp install is similar to the
maven install because it is going to
download the dependencies for the UI
project
so the J hipster is almost hop I can see
the banner here and it is registering
the different components which we have
asked it to do
so we are up here the application
HelloWorld is running access URLs are
these so I'm just going to open this URL
let me copy this
and I'm hitting the URL here
yep my application is up and you can see
this is the UI this is created using
angular and we do have the backend stuff
which are running in the spring boot
framework so this is what J hipster has
done it has created a UI and it has
provided us some back-end stuff
out-of-the-box we didn't do any setup
here we just created using the J hipster
command-line interface we just created
the project and we just started this big
boot application and we can see the UI
handy back-end already let's try running
logging in so by default the login is
admin admin or user user
I will try login using admin admin
you
and I can see more options here I can
see administration options and I can see
metrics if I go to matrix it shows how
many threads are running in this
particular JVM wherever we are using
Sonia I can see the service name see
this write the package names whatever we
have I can see who is using you can see
the number of requests coming in and how
many requests were failing as well
currently the memory is at 39 percentage
known heap usage threads waiting we do
also have the health checks for the disk
and the database which we have
configured we do have configuration
details you can see the configurations
from the administration UI you can
notice this see this right you can see
all the configurations which we have
embedded in the application Yaman which
can be seen from this particular UI as
well we do have the logs as well so it
is just loading this is going to load
all the logs which were there present in
this particular application it also has
the swagger UI so if you go to API this
is the API designed so which is going to
have swagger and you can see swagger API
is by default so if you add new
resources those are going to get auto
scanned by swagger and they will be
generated here
along with the resources and I can see
this right I can just try running one
resource just to show if it works I'll
just try this so this is going to show
what are the different account different
accounts which are there in the server
and I can see only one account which is
the administrator or the current one
right and it has author area thora T's
like Rahul user role admin etc so this
is J hipster so let's try changing
something right I showed you the HTML
the home.html where is a home HTML yeah
the whole HTML is where we had the bill
comes a hipster let's try changing this
to welcome tech primers we need to
refresh this manually because I don't
have the real-time live reload setup so
wherever whenever you modify the HTML
page it can immediately refresh the
browser there is an option in gulp or
grunt you can set it up but I am NOT set
that yet right I just created the
project out-of-the-box so I just changed
the HTML and let's try refreshing this
should get reflected see this welcome
tech promise the change has got
reflected
from here you can even modify stuff you
can add stuff you can customize this
particular UI so we can customize the
HTML page based on our requirements and
we can make it look completely different
as well so it is completely up to us
1j hipster does is it acts as a
generator and it creates the skeleton
and the initial setup which we require
which most of us require that's what it
has done and then we can customize that
for our meat so that is for J hip status
and J hipster has been the talk of the
town in the last few years because it
has easy connectivity between the spring
boot and the angular UI so that's all
about J hipster I hope you got a basic
understanding about what is J hipster
and how we can use J hipster to create a
simple spring boot application with the
angular UI if you are using angular 5 or
angular 2 plus you can directly go to
amplify like how I showed ya I didn't
use the angle of Phi but I need to learn
angular 5 in order to show you guys but
I know angular 1 that's why I showed you
with angular 1 I hope you like this
particular video if you liked the video
go ahead and like it if you haven't
subscribed to the channel code and
subscribe to it we took it in the next
video thank you
