are going to see what a Stanford Cornell
P and we are going to create a program
using the Stanford core NLP the basic
aps and we are going to see what it does
and how we are using natural language
processing using a Java project ok so if
you had seen my previous video we saw
what is natural language processing and
we saw a little bit about a Stanford
core NLP so in this video we are going
to lose those Stanford core and a
library and we are going to create a
small project and we are going to run
that project with a Stanford core and NP
and we are going to see how a sentence
is passed and what we get out of the
Goron will be library okay so I'll just
refresh again what is the Stanford core
and meaty so Stanford Cornell tea is a
library which Stanford University has
created and made it open source so this
library is going to have all the natural
language processing capability so this
particular project is evolving right now
so it's not that ok this this is
completed and you can go ahead and use
it and it will work for every scenario
so natural language processing as a
whole is evolving as you guys know
artificial intelligence is the latest
thing and it's getting able so Stanford
has created a library and they are
getting contributions from different
open source communities and students and
stuff like that so right now they have
released lots of ocean so they are
having different processing capabilities
international language processing
library so if you go to this particular
link in the github so this is their
official link so they have all details
about what are the different ways or
tools which the core and VP has to
process the language ok so in general
this if you see this particular
coordinate page R it is almost 200 plus
MB ok so that shows how much amount of
coding is there inside that particular
guy right so on how much amount of
natural language processing capabilities
are there embedded inside the particular
charge
so in this video we are going to do is
we are going to use a typical example
which they have given so before going
into that we see some basic tools which
are they right so there is something
called named entity recognition so named
entity recognition is nothing but you
split a sentence into different parts
and identify what makes sense so if you
notice this particular example which
they have here so it says that the
president zip seizing thing is a person
and China is a location so these are
basically named entity recognition so
the natural language processing library
it's able to identify that ok this is a
name of a person and this is the name of
a location same way it is able to
identify what is the date and what is
the time ok
that is the natural that that is the
capability of the named entity
recognition so this is one type of tool
so like there are different types of
tools similarly so there is something
called Core reference so you can relate
it to different sentences or different
words in the same sentence ok and same
way dependency so you can identify the
parts of speech that you can identify
what is a verb or you can identify the
dependency between different words and
stuff like that there are lots of other
annotator so you can see parts of speech
limit ization and then you have the
named entity recognition there is
something called named entity that it
gets recognition so all these are all
documented here if you go to the
specifics right for example this is
specific for a part of speech so as you
guys know part of speech is nothing but
it identifies in a sentence it we can
split each and every board and basically
you can tokenize each and every birth
and identify whether it is a noun or a
verb or an adjective or stuff like that
so the software has the capability to
split a sentence in to give that way
because that is our natural language
processing works because I might speak
in a different language you might speak
in a different language and also I met
the the way I tell could be completely
different so the way you ask something
the way I ask something is completely
different but still both might a basic
board might be resulting in the same
solution so that is why natural language
capabilities are separate
so that the machine can learn itself and
identify that okay okay if somebody asks
about this I need to answer even though
if he has a different word in his
context I should still be able to answer
the same thing so that is what machine
learning and natural language processing
are all about so let's go ahead and
create a project before that I am going
to show you where I'm going to take an
example from so I'm going to use a
simple core NLP API which they are
providing so I will leave the link of
these URLs in the description below so
you can go ahead and check it out so
what we are going to do is we are going
to create a program with that okay so
let's go ahead and create a maven
project so let me open intelligence just
quickly create a maven project so that
we can get started okay so I am going to
say comm tech primers search NLP once
make or nfe example
okay let me finish it get it open
okay so there is nothing else in this
project so I am going to add a
dependency
so I already have created a life
template so you notice where I just
created this already so so I'm going to
add these three just okay so these are
the three jars which could NLP provide
so I have already downloaded the just
because it's 200 MB almost so it might
take a while right so I have already
downloaded that into my maven repository
so it should not take take much time for
me
so that I can show you guys easily so
I'm going to create a simple class
called
NLP example okay and let's start writing
some code right so before that we need
to identify what we need to write so
this is the example which I have taken
so I have taken be Stanford Cornell pa
pa okay so we are going to what we are
going to do is we are going to create a
new Teamsters okay
so if you notice here this is what we
are going to do we are going to use this
code which is there here okay let me
copy paste and then I will explain what
it each does okay so let's do a move on
input let me import it and
things till the project has not
downloaded aegis why is it so yet very
important it is showing the dependencies
but it is not able to identify why I'm
not sure is it because I haven't enabled
the dependency management or why was I
not sure why this is not that
loud
so let's import this and try I'm not
sure why that is not coming right okay
so it has got detectors right now I
think it should be okay so what we are
doing here is what we are doing here is
we are creating a properties so this is
nothing but a java.util property
basically okay and in the property we
are setting something called annotators
that is the key okay for the annotators
they are giving different and different
types of annotators so these are
different types of penalty it is the
parts of space they look in a meditation
the named entity recognition then you
want to parse it and then correlation so
these are different types of annotations
which I was mentioning it you can
different types of these are annotators
basically so you can add whatever you
want and the properties are going to be
fed to the coronal P library if you
notice here the properties are now fed
into the library so this particular
class is coming from the Stanford core
NLP library again we are just creating
it as a pipeline so this is going to be
a pipeline so we are going to put T
create a pipeline we are going to give
some text to it so let's say I'm going
to create text right so what is the
weather in Bangalore right now okay so
just creating this particular text okay
so we are going to do annotation so we
are saying okay we are going to create a
document with that text so this
annotation is coming from the Stanford
core library you have to create an
annotation and feed that annotation to
the pipeline so you have to say a
pipeline would run at 8:00 and then give
that annotation okay so next thing what
we need to do is we need to pass these
annotations right so that's what we are
going to do here so this is the code
which we have here already
as an example so that is what we are
going to use as well okay
let me motivate it
okay so everything is important so what
we are doing here is from the annotated
documentary they are getting these
sentence annotations so we are going to
use sentence sentence annotation so it
written something called code map okay
code map is another what you call a
wrapper class or something like that
which Stanford uses for enclosing stuff
so it's like a map but it is not the map
okay so it puts everything into the core
map and from the core map we need to
take objects out of it so if you notice
here the core map gives it sentences
okay so if you had multiple sentences it
gets multiple sentences it gets split
into multiple sentences and that will be
pushed here so in our case we are going
to give only one sentence right now but
you can do multiple sentences as well
okay so every for every sentence what we
need to do is now we need to get the
tokenized annotation so that is what we
are doing here so we need to get the
tokenized annotation so we basically say
token notation so you just do another
gate okay and it returns something
called core label okay
core label is something similar to Cork
map but core label has other features so
if you notice here it's a class korma
for the interface core label is the
class from that core label again we can
get the text annotation parts of speech
named entity so these are extract out of
it so basically this core label is a
class which has all the tokenized values
and from that value we are going to get
everything okay so what I am going to do
is I'm going to print everything so let
me print what do I need I need word and
I need parts of speech so let me put
this in some format
okay I need parts of speech and then I
have named entity recognition so I'm
just going to print these so word parts
of speech and then a mentor technicians
on the door closes come back okay
that's it why this is complaining okay I
think anything okay so what we're going
to do here is we are going to run this
program okay so what we have done here
is we are giving this particular
sentence what is d better in Banglore
right now to the core and EP library and
we are going to extract different tokens
from that library and we are going to
see what is the value of each token
after it has passed and also we are
going to try some to three other
examples to say how is it different from
the previous examples and stuff like
okay this is how the Corin will be
basically works so based on this
tokenization and based on these values
and the named entity pairs we can
process our logic so based on the result
which the parts of speech and the word
and the nails named entity reason
mission returns we can use that value
for further processing so if you notice
here what has happened is for what for
the word wat there is nothing so there
is something called WP so the WP will be
corresponding to a particular type of
part of speech so let's see there should
be something example to do to to to put
some speech so there is the parts of
speech on wf8
so let's go to that sheet and then so
that we can relate it to what it means
right so do so these are the different
things but I don't see any shortcuts
let's let's see what are the VBS so let
me search maybe basically be like yeah I
think this should give us so that are
different yeah okay so these are the
ones which we wanted so there are
different abbreviations for each of them
so for example in the first one we got
WP so WP is nothing but pronoun okay wh
pronto so basically we asked a question
watering so that is that is why it is
the WP okay so next one is if it is VB
easy I suppose it should be verb so we
busy nothing but boob third-person
singular present so this is
corresponding to other person singular
present so that is why it is VB Z so
this is the parts of speech right so P
boy is parts of speech and named entity
it didn't find anything that so it is
showing showing 0 the next word is D for
D it is DT so DT is nothing but Data
Miner okay next one is better so whether
is an NP so NLP is proper noun singular
okay same way any any 0 in is I n I ni
is nothing but preposition or
subordinating conjunction okay the next
one is Bangalow so Bangalore is nothing
but n NP so named entity whatever proper
noun and singular right so named entity
is showing as location which is what we
wanted right so the API
identify that in this particular
sentence Bangalore is their location and
right now if you see it is saying date
and now also it has identified that it
is date RB is let's see what is RB RB is
the adverb so based on this we can do
our processing so this core NLP is now
using natural language processing and
splitting using different tools so here
we have used 2 different tools parts of
speech and the named entity recognition
to extract data out of that particular
word ok that is what we did
so for each and every board
it has identified that okay what is the
parts of speech and what is the named
entity is animation and based on this we
can write our logic so for example I can
write my logic saying if it is an NP and
if it is location do whatever you want
if it is RB and do a date to whatever
you want or if let's say the information
is not proper you can again post a
question so that user can give that
again and then you can do something like
that so if you take a city or Google now
right so that is all they work so they
work on the same concept they might be
using different ApS but Stanford API is
more popular and many people use that
and there are lots of contributions
happening to the Stanford core and lt
library and if you are if you want to
try natural language processing in your
project or if you want to try it out you
can go ahead and try this out the only
glitch would be the jar is 200 MB so
just be patient to download that for the
first time when you are importing it
into your project I will push this
particular code into the github
repository where I put all my code you
can take it from there and you can try
it out as well but for now this is what
it means so the core NLP is the library
which is available as an open source you
can use it to give a sentence and then
you can use different annotating tools
to tokenize each word and identify what
type of word it is and based on that
word
you can now process your your messages
so based on that bird you can now write
your own logic to process them okay so
that is what I wanted to show in this
particular video so if you like the
video go ahead and like it if you like
the channel and haven't subscribed go
ahead and subscribe to it if you want me
to make videos on any particular topic
go ahead and drop that in the comments
below I will be able to see and reply to
you whenever I see it okay that's it for
this very particular video hope you guys
understood what is code and NP and you
will be able to relate it to what people
talk as machine learning and natural
language processing okay that's it for
this particular video meet again in the
next video thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
