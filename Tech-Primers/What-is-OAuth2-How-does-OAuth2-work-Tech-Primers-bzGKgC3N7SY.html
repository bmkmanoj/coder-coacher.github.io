are going to see what is worth - and why
everyone is using in the internet so if
you notice Facebook or Twitter apps
right so you would have noticed that if
you are using a third-party application
to access Facebook or Twitter so you
used to get a notification saying do you
want to authorize this particular
application so that is all done using
oauth2 so let's see what is this worth -
and how is it helping Facebook Twitter
and other tech giants in accessing our
information from some other source right
so what is this worth - basically so
horth is basically a open standard for
access delegation so it is not for
authentication only it is for access
delegation so basically you delegate
your authority to somebody else right so
that is what what does in general so it
is not an authentication protocol or
something like that it is an
authorization standard okay so OS also
provides the secure delegated access as
I said earlier so instead of so let's
say you have a Google account okay
however you are accessing a bank
statement or something like that let's
say right so on the bank statement asks
you to provide a Google account and you
get redirected to the Google page and
from there Google asks you whether you
want to authorize your back to redirect
or give information about you to dip
back so that is the that is what happens
in over - so literally the back won't
have your username and password from
Google so instead it will just delegate
the URL or the request to Google and
Google with other authenticate you and
then Google will ask you what all
accesses do you need to give to the bank
so basically the authorization
information is received from Google to
the bank and the bank then uses that too
for any further communication ok so that
is
happens in war - so what - is more of a
framework than a protocol so as I said
earlier right so it is just a delegated
dedicating it's just dedicating your
access to a third party application from
the source authentic authentication
server so what - is just a framework
than a protocol okay let's see that
better an example right so let's say you
have a client and server so let us take
this particular example which I was
discussing right so let's say you login
to your bank account
let's take a city bank for example right
so you log in to your city bank account
for some reasons the defense is asking
you to authenticate your Facebook
account let's say right so imagine city
bank server as the authentication plant
and sitive on the Facebook server as the
authentication server okay so literally
you have logged into your Citibank
banking website okay from there it is
asking you to connect to the Facebook
account okay so what happens is you
login to the Facebook account so when
you when you trigger that request to
login to the Facebook account what
happens is a request goes from the
client to the server so basically a
request goes from Citibank
to Facebook saying that okay can you
please authorize this particular client
okay I want to authorize this particular
client and my client ID is that client
whatever and then redirect me to the URL
that client comm slash accept so imagine
that Citibank is sending this particular
request to the Facebook server now what
happens is Facebook will now pop you up
with a screen saying do you want to
authorize city back and it will show you
the list of details which you want to
authorize so so basically you can give
your name email address or phone number
and stuff like that so that is what
Facebook asks you so Facebook literally
asks you and you can control what
authorization you can give to this city
bank account so you are not giving the
username and password to the city bank
accounts however you are delegating your
so literally Facebook is delegating your
authorization to City
by our authorization so you are saying
that okay I am authorizing Facebook to
give me give access to city bank for all
these stuff okay so that is what is
happening here so once you say authorize
the URL will be now redirected to
Citibank website so that is why you have
to give the Raider a QR here saying that
okay in case redirect oh so what will
Citibank receive now will say depends
will now receive a token so basically an
access to authorization token so
basically now Citibank got a privileges
to request now for further further
requests okay so now you gave access for
city back to access your Facebook
account so what happens in the next case
so let's say now your first request
succeeded immediately Citibank request
same Facebook server with that
particular token and asks for a access
token so basically Citibank was has to
now identify basically it has to
authenticate itself right so previously
it received a authorization token for us
now Citibank has to authenticate itself
so what happens is Citibank will now
send the client ID and the client secret
so be these two informations are nothing
but registered informations of Citibank
with Facebook so Facebook would have
already got their got and generated a
client ID and client secret for Citibank
so Citibank customer authenticate itself
ID so what if some of the server is
faking like a Citibank server side so
that is why the device has now give its
own secret and its own client ID along
with that it has to pass our token
whatever token what generated whatever
authorization code which we generated in
the previous step so it has to send that
again to Facebook now Facebook what it
will do it will just now send that
something called an access token
so access token is something which is
valid for a particular user only for a
particular period of time so so if you
notice here let's say I had my name is
Peter okay so Peter has requested
Facebook authorization and it I and
Peter has delegated all the
authorization permissions to City
and Citibank has now gone to Facebook
using its own authentication and
authorization details along with the
deed token with which Peter got
authenticated and then finally an access
token is generated with a particular
period of time so the access token as a
time out of let's say it depends on the
implementation so that is why I oath is
a framework so some people implement it
for one so or some people implement it
for half an hour or something like that
so this Act access token will be valid
for a stipulated period of time okay now
what will we do with the access token so
Citibank has no authenticated your
details and Citibank has authenticated
itself as well with Facebook now
Citibank has got all your access
privileges okay so next what we can do
with that is so now Citibank can now
directly use that and then let's say you
are going to retrieve your account
details okay so with that access token
it is going to retrieve your account
details from Facebook legit right so
that is what happens so now Citibank
will now use this access token for every
request you give to access your detail
inside Facebook so that is what happens
so in general I consider this as account
or you can you can consider it as
account information or your profile
information basically so now the
Democrats access to access your profile
information using this access token
because you are already authorized and
authenticated it okay so this these
steps are called authentication server
and this is called the author resource
server so basically this is nothing but
a resource ID arrest URL so once you
have authenticated that is when you will
have access to your resource server so
if you don't have access token you
cannot access this particular resource
so basically internally oath as a
framework how it is split is you have a
resource server and you have an
authentication authorization server so
authorization server is what you have
they have done here under so server is
where it uses the token which you
generated using the authorization server
and that is how it allows you so in
general of the oauth2 as different
implementations so Facebook has a
different way of implementing it Twitter
has a similar way so that you can
you write your own implementation it is
not necessary for you to write in the
same way but the general concept is you
will have an authorization server and
you will have a resource server so once
you authorize your application that is
when you will be able to access your
resources and this happens only when you
want to delegate your authorized
authority to somebody else so if you
have a server and the client
architecture you don't have to go 400
watts to both to is necessarily used
only when let's say you have a third
party coming in picture and you want to
delegate your authorized access from one
place to another so that is when you
have you can use oauth2 so if you are
working in an organization right
typically imagine that as something like
let's say you have your portal your
employee portal right so you have your
information there so all your
information is all started and let's say
there is a team which is writing an
application to access your details so
let's say your HR tamers are writing an
application to access some details they
will have full access however let's say
there is some other application and
inbuilt application or application built
inside your firm by somebody else so in
that case he will have to request you
whether you are ready to give your
details to that application so that is
when o earth can be used so you can so
literally you are delegating your access
for that particular third-party
application developing Center for to
access your HR records or something like
that so that is when or two will be
useful because you are not using your
username and password and you are
getting you are giving it right so you
in general you will have a Kerberos or
you have your username and password
right so you don't have to give that to
your application so to get third party
application or the inbuilt optic in the
internal application instead you just
authorize using an authentication server
authorization server delegating saying
ok this guy can use my information these
are the informations and I'm and I
authorize that so that is when we will
use OAuth 2 so hopefully you understood
what is over - in the future videos we
will see how to use over through inside
string security
that's it for this particular video if
you have any queries or concerns about
wants to just post that in the comments
below I will try to reply so if you
haven't subscribed to channel go ahead
and subscribe make you again in the next
video thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
