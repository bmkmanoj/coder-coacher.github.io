firms and if you want to handle lots of
traffic you would have heard about the
term load balancers which people use
very often let's see what is load
balancing and why do we prefer using
load balancers in order to get the
incoming traffic into our net
press the bell icon on the YouTube app
and never miss any update from tech
primers the first topic is what is load
balancing
let's take an example of Amazon Amazon
might be deploying lots of servers in
the backend for DUI part let's consider
these are the different servers which
are deployed in Amazon infrastructure
which are running the same code as the
Amazon UI now how does the request get
into each of these servers let's say I'm
hitting the amazon.com website and how
does Amazon know it needs to redirect me
to a particular instance and how the new
request needs to go to a different
instance that is when load balancers are
useful load balancer does the routing
for example my request 1 goes to this
particular server which is marked as
green the request 2 goes to a different
server the request 3 goes to a different
server and wreck us 4 goes to a
different server all these requests
could be from a different user or may be
from the same user so these are
different strategies which the company
can do in the load balancing part so
this is load balancing so what are the
usages of load balances so what does the
load balancer provide
load balancers are generally used to
distribute the incoming traffic to the
network by efficiently distributing the
request across multiple servers
reliability and high availability is
maintained by redirecting these requests
to the servers which are available in
the network if there are servers which
are unavailable or offline those servers
will be removed from the load balancing
setup and the request will not be
redirected to those servers so
internally the load balancers maintain
the health check of all the servers
which are available and the requests are
redirected only to the servers which are
available the other part is the ease of
use in adding and removing these servers
in the network based on the demand let's
say Amazon wants to scale up for a great
indian sale or a universal sale which is
happening for a Black Friday or
something like that they know that the
number of requests which are going to
come in for the UI are going to be more
so they can scale up and then they can
scale down based on the demand so load
balancers help in easily configuring by
Adi adding more servers and reducing
more servers with just a simple
configuration change there are different
algorithms which are used in these load
balancers in order to redirect requests
to different servers we can see the
three different commonly used algorithms
which companies prefer for setting up a
load balancer the first one is the round
robin fashion where the requests are
redirected to different different
services in the round robin fashion so
let's say there are three servers in the
network the first request goes to the
first server second request goes to the
second the third goes to the third the
same fashion is followed for the all the
requests in the future cycle so this is
a round robin fashion where every server
gets a new request every time so if the
server for one is hit for the first time
the next request will be redirected to
the server - so that is the round robin
fashion the next one is the really least
connection option where the request will
be sent to the server which has the
least request
which is processing the least number of
resources in order to do this the load
balancer needs to know which process or
which server is having the least number
of resources so it might need to do some
additional computing because it needs to
know which server has the least
resources so it might take a while for
the load balancing or the load balance
it might take so it might take a while
it might take a while for the load
balancer to identify which are the
servers which are having least
connections or the least resources so it
needs to compute or it needs to get a
metadata information from all these
servers so this might be a little bit
costlier compared to the round robin
fashion which was just blindly
redirecting requests to each and every
server in the list the last one is the
IP hashing so IP hashing is useful when
let's say a client sends an request and
the clients request needs to be
dedicatedly going to a particular set of
servers then that is when IP hashing is
used so redirection can be done based on
the clients IP address and only those
servers which are specific to that
particular clients IP address will be
redirected to that particular network so
this can be another strategy where some
specific networks or some specific
servers needs to be given preference
over the other
a typical example could be if you see
the IRCTC website in India the requests
from the clients or the general people
will be redirected to a bunch of server
farm however the requests which are
coming from the internal setc receptions
that will be going to a different server
that way they will have more performance
or they will have better performance
than what we really see in our end
sticky sessions there is this concept of
machine persistence where let's say we
have a request for example in amazon.com
BR using the Amazon cart let's say right
we have added lots of information into
the cart and this particular card
information is stored in the session
basically this is stored in let's say
the client-side browser the browser
usually caches all the session
information and keeps it and every time
a new request is made these session
informations are shared
so the browser literally keeps the
session ID which the server has
generated the previous time when we
logged in and the same session ID is
given every time the request is sent so
what happens generally is if the
requests are redirected to different
different servers then the session ID is
tend to be lost because the first
session which was in the which was
generated by the server one might not be
visible for the server to so the session
information is lost and your cart will
be disappearing so this is a problem
there you have sessions which are
persisted in your browser this is a
general use case where we will have to
handle that at our application end so
either we can use a common cache for
example Redis cache to store our session
information or we need to allow the load
balancer to go to the same instance
every time so in general load balancers
have this concept of sticky sessions and
they do supports icky sticky sessions
because they know that this particular
session ID came for the first time I
redirected it to server one for the
second time if I get the same because I
need to still redirected to server
server one though I will not consider
the traffic or the other factors in into
consideration so this is called session
persistent most of the load balances do
handle session persistence because they
know that they need to redirect to the
same instance if the request is going to
be the same from the same client in
general let's say you want to handle
that
that's when you
go for a caching mechanism where you can
use the session ID to be stored in a
different cache or like how Amazon does
they can store the card information in
the separate database and then route the
request to different servers so every
time the request goes to a new instance
and they are retrieved from a common
data store the only difference between
these two approaches are the read
operations might be more because your
card needs to be loaded every time
however if you don't want to sacrifice
the performance then you can redirect
the request to a single instance so it's
up to us to reside whether we want to
support sticky sessions or whether we
want to eliminate sticky sessions in our
network
so what did we see in this particular
video we saw what is load-balancing why
do we need load-balancing we saw the
different features of load balancers we
also saw the different algorithms which
are used in the load balancing and we
saw what are sticky sessions and how we
can handle sticky sessions or when will
stations come into picture I hope you
guys got a basic understanding of what
our load balancers and you might be able
to use it to relate it to your
enterprise application implementation if
