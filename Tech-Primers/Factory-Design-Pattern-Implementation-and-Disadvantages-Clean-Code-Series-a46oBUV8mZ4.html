primers factory design pattern in
general is an opposite of the singleton
design pattern and it is one of second
most recently used design pattern after
singleton design pattern because lots of
people use the factory design pattern
after they use the singleton design
pattern what factory it is in pattern
defines is it doesn't expose the
instantiation or the creation logic
let's note it down so it doesn't expose
the instantiation or the creation logic
instead subclasses create the objects
subclasses create the objects or the
instances there is generally a common
interface you can consider it as an
interface or an abstract class you can
have a common abstract or an interface
which defines what needs to be done in
the factory and generally factories are
used when we use it with framework
creation it is used when we create
frameworks and the client or the
implementation uses the factories so
that is what factory provides us there
is also a contract provided by the
factory that is why people go with the
framework because it designs the
framework in such a way that you have to
do it in such a fashion and you have to
implement the necessary steps
let's try implementing a factory design
pattern in the previous example of the
Builder design pattern we created a
phone right we are going to use similar
example we are going to create a phone
so we are going to create different
specifications in a phone so we are
going to try and create different phone
models like for example iPhone or the
Android let's
try creating an iPhone and an Android
right for that we need a specification
what is the specification denote so
specification could be an interface
where every every what you call a
feature or a part of the phone
constitute a specification so I'm going
to override a method call I'm gonna
provide a method called public word by
default everything is public so I'm they
saying
void description of the specification
right and the specification needs to be
implemented by let's say what
specification first we need we let say
we provide a 12 megapixel camera
or we can say an Android candy
and we need to implement the interface
and they say yes and this particular
filename is gone here let me try
renaming it
you
I'll just say it's at 1 megapixel camera
same way I'll create some more
specification
let me try creating
you
I created iPhone camera
we need a front panel
let's say I'm just gonna say pendant I'm
just going to say a phone panel and I'm
going to say android family
we also need the processor and I'll just
stop it
you
I'll say iPhone processor is a a10 chip
let's say rate and I know rate and chip
and J say a 10 for the Android processor
just say Snapdragon 625 chip
for the Android panel and I see and say
sandstone finish
for the iPhone penalty charge a glass
panel something like
for the iPhone camera I'll just mention
it as let's say 16 megapixel
right so we have some camera
implementation based on the
specification so this is just a
specification interface we have
implemented different types of camera
now what we need is a we need a phone
right we need to create a fool isn't it
instead I'll create the Android phone
and the
- right so I'll create something called
as an Android phone based on some
specific features for that we need to
have a phone so I'll create a framework
or a phone interface a phone abstract
class so that way we can use that while
implementing the Android phone and
iPhone so that way we know what we need
to act I am going to create a phone
which is going to be an abstract class
so just say class below
I'm just going to create it as an
abstract class I am going to have a
public phone constructor and I'm going
to say create phone and this create
phone is going to be an abstract method
so that way we will create a phone which
we wanted also while creating a phone
what do I need I need some stuff right I
need to add the specification so I'm
going to say protected so that we can
use it in the implementation we need to
add the list of specification to our
form
and just grater empty ArrayList so that
way we can add it to the specification
so we can add lots of different
specifications to the phone so I have
created a phone abstract class where you
can add different specifications to it
and create phone will be adding those
specification while creating a phone we
will be adding this specification right
so this is an abstract class now what do
we need is a implementation for it we
are going to implement it using the
Android phone and just say implement
methods what do we need to add in the
specification we need to add some stuff
right in the specification we are going
to add new Android camera new Android
panin and also the Android processing
so our Android phone is done say maybe
we need to create an iPhone we need to
implement this I'll just say I for me
I'll just say it has an iPhone so we
need to implement the create method what
do we need mean to add the specification
we need to add new iPhone camera
we need to add the iPhone panel and also
we need to add the iPhone processor so
that's it so we have created an iPhone
and an Android using the phone which
allowed us to create a phone using some
specification and we have added that
specification to the phone we have added
the specification to the phone now what
do we need now we need to create a
factory out of it okay so we wanted to
create a factory because we want to
create a factory design pattern if you
provide a type of phone we will be
getting that type of phone created out
of a factory so we need to create a
factory so we are going to create a
phone factory so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to create a new class which is
called the form factor so this factory
creates a form so while naming your
factories make sure that you are able to
understand the factory first so 413 is
going to create a factory
so what do we need we are going to get a
phone so I'm going to say get phone and
I need to provide some phone object
let's do that before that I need to
return a phone right so this gate phone
is going to create a phone out of it
what I'm going to do here is I am going
to expect a type of phone right I can
create an enum for that what I'm going
to do is I'm going to create a enum so
instead of having strings I'm going to
create a UNAM so I'm going to say phone
type so let this be an enum that way I
can know what type of phone it is if I
say Android
or iPhone
so I have an enum called
i Android and iPhone and just mention
the phone type here so that way we just
pass the phone type and we can directly
use the switch to do phone type right so
I'll just say case of Android I will
just do something I'm just going to
return
new Android phone and I'm going to break
it
if it is an iPhone
I am going to return a new iPhone
and I'm gonna break it again if it is a
case default
if it is a default case I'm just going
to return mal right we don't even have
to break it because we turn when
directly break the statement yeah that's
cool
and just remove everything here so yeah
the phone factory has a method called
public phone and let's make this static
because this factory we don't have to
create an object right if you make it as
a static method we don't have to create
an object out of it and we can directly
use this particular get phone method to
directly get the different types of
phone so this is how you can create a
factory let's use the factory in our
implementation so I am going to say
factory example
so public static void main here how do
we use the factory using the phone
factory I need to get a type of phone so
I'm going to use phone factory door get
phone and I need to pass a type of phone
and I'm going to say phone type not
Android if I pass the Android type I'm
going to get the Android type of phone
so I'll just go and just want to say and
right if I pass iPhone I am going to get
an eyeful
right so let me try doing a print of
Android and print of iPhone just to show
how these values of printer main why
let's go to the phone here
you
and try to bring the phone
I'll just try to overwrite the two
strings so that we can see the
specification so let me run this program
so what we have done here if you notice
we have created a phone factory using
the phone factory we are getting a phone
and we are passing the type of phone as
Android which is going to create a phone
for us and it is going to return a new
phone for us so all these objects if you
notice your all these are different
types of objects and if you see I think
I have not overwritten the specification
right but yeah you basically got the
point at if you notice here the
specification czar different the first
phone had Android camera and Android
Panem and also the Android processor the
next one had the iPhone camera iPhone
processor and their phone panel so that
is how you can create different object
and if you are using the factory again
to retrieve an object or at literately
the phone it will create new objects
because it is not a singleton it is
going to create new instances every time
so if I want to create an iPhone again I
just create another instance and then I
can print it and see that it will return
a different object instance so every
time you use battery and retrieve the
phone you can create new in your
instances because that is how we have
created a factory but sometimes people
use a factory to written the same
instance however that is not exactly the
factory pattern which you wanted because
factory means every time it creates a
new product so as the name suggests if
you get a product from a factory you
create new instance of a product right
if you buy a product out of a phone
factory you obviously get a new instance
of the same product right so that is
what factory denotes same way in this
case we had a phone factory using the
phone factory we pass a phone type using
that type we are creating different
phone so if you compare this with our
concept which we wrote in the readme
factory doesn't expose the instantiation
or the creation of creation logic
yes Factory do not expose because we
just directly used the get phone and all
the creation is done by the subclasses
yep the subclasses which are there
inside the factory created the objects
if you notice the subclass which created
the object is the
phone cone created the path created the
phone because we have ordered in a
create phone and that is where all the
specs got created last one is the common
abstract or an interface yep we had
common abstract interface we had a
common abstract class called the phone
and also we had some interface called
specification but you can use the
interface as well instead of the phone
abstract class here I wanted to show how
the abstract classes create the phone
object that is why I had used abstract
but if you are willing to use interface
you can use it already because in Java 8
you have interfaces you can write
default methods in the interface the
last one is framework or the client the
implementation uses the factory Copp
notice here this factory can be used as
a framework we don't have any framework
creation here however if let's say you
are creating a framework and you're
creating a lifecycle you can integrate
the factory and you say that ok first I
need to use the factory to create an
object and you will have to implement
your objects for example if you have a
different type of phone let's say a
Symbian or a Windows Phone you will have
to now create your Windows Phone
implementation and then you can add it
to your enum which is the phone type and
that gets added to the factory by
default on your framework will align to
that so that is how you can define your
framework so that is how you can create
your factory design pattern so this is
how factory it is in pattern is created
I hope you guys understood what is fact
it is in pattern I will upload the code
to github repository for your reference
you can directly take it from there
if you want to know any common examples
of factory design pattern which we
already have in the JVM then you can
take a look at calendar calendar uses a
similar way you can use calendar or you
can use the number format number format
also uses the fact it is in pattern
there you can have get different types
of number formats same way with calendar
you can get different types of calendar
from the calendar pattern so for example
if I want to show that
you can just say calendar or getinstance
and you can do a get of a topic typical
tied up field where you can say calendar
type
you
calendar itself so I think you're under
itself is a type and it said you can yup
you can get it like this so day of a
month we can get directly something like
this
what is the current day so this is the
type of a factory design pattern
okay this is the type of factory design
pattern you can see in the JVM itself
now coming to the disadvantages of the
factory design pattern let's put them
down
the first is an disadvantages it is very
complex if you had notice here we had
created so many classes and so many core
to achieve the factory design pattern so
under the hood it works as simple as
that however we had to create lots of
code and it is very complex to create
lots of code the other disadvantages is
the creation happens only in the
subclass which in itself abstracts as
too many things because you won't even
know what is happening so you will have
to go to the factory design pattern to
understand what is happening under the
hood so that itself is a disadvantage
and when you do lots of refactoring it
will be a tedious task because there are
too many classes and if you want to do
refactoring of your code it will be too
much so that is the only disadvantage so
these are the different disadvantages if
you know how to handle factory design
pattern in a more controlled way then it
is easy for you however just keep in
mind there are advantages and
disadvantages using design patterns in
general when you are using in your code
so you should know when to use what type
of design pattern and when to use norm
so that's it about factory design
pattern made again in the next video
