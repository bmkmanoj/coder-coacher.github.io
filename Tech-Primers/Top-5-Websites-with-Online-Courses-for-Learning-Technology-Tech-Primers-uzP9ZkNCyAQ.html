online these days compared to the older
way of studying in an institute right
now everyone is flocking towards the
online websites for learning something
new let's see what are the different
websites which are out there which you
can use for learning in the online
little sight Pluralsight is an online
education platform or a company as such
so they offer a wide variety of training
videos for everyone so their videos are
completely in depth so they're the way
they make videos are they invite the
subject-matter experts the people who
created those frameworks the people who
have worked on those frameworks for lots
of times the people who are working on
that particular frameworks or the tools
so they bring those SMEs and then they
make videos on those so those videos are
completely in-depth and right from the
basic so if you see any particular video
if you take JavaScript or angularjs or
anything they go right from the start
and they make you understand everything
in and out so which is why I like
Pluralsight out of this lot because
their videos are completely intense and
then you have a very good understanding
of the frameworks or the technology so
this is a thirteen year old company they
have right now more than seven seven
hundred subject matter experts they have
more than seven thousand courses in
their catalogue so it has also more than
like 9 lakh individual subscribers and
then more than like seven thousand
clients who have registered to the
Pluralsight so officially my company
uses floral side so I also use
Pluralsight for learning day-to-day
stuff so if I want to learn any new
technology I go to our on site and then
so as for the videos from there and then
I get I get it from there so there is a
free subscription available for ten day
it's a trial period so you can see as
many videos as you want for that trial
period so you can just utilize that for
ten days if you want to see any specific
video on Pluralsight they don't have any
specific topic on artificial
intelligence or machine learning or
something like that but they are adding
more and more topics in the recent time
but they don't have these specific
topics right now but they are just
adding it one by one so for example Big
Data series has been added but they
don't have a complete in depth
big data series but still they are just
adding it specific to that specific to
that but do you have very good tutorials
on web technologies there is a child
company for Pluralsight called code
school
I said code school calm and that is the
link so that provides very good way of
interactive way of learning JavaScript
and all their technologies you will have
a ID inside your browser itself and you
allow to do programming there and you
can proceed only when you complete the
program or the trial and that's how the
code school works it is a funny way of
explaining with a song and as the song
assets but yeah it is pretty good so if
you want to learn the basics of
JavaScript or angular and stuff like
that you can go for floral sightings
it's pretty intense and pretty in-depth
so I like pretty I like the total sight
a lot like I use it a lot I have been
using it for the past maybe three to
four years now so it is pretty good
lynda.com lynda.com is the one of the
oldest in the lot it has been there in
the internet for almost like two 22
years now so they started off with the
online library with books which people
can register and then read it in the
website right now they have videos they
make lots of video tutorials they are
one of the oldest companies which is out
there and LinkedIn recently bought
lynda.com I think in 2015
LinkedIn bought lynda.com so most of the
trainings which you see in Linn LinkedIn
rights area they are all linked with
lynda.com because LinkedIn bought them
some time ago all right and you can
obviously offer free trial so if you see
the trial is for 30 days compared to
parole set rules it had it for 15 days
for lynda.com you will get it for 30
days
you can give it a try you will have a
wide variety of videos you can just
check him preview as well so if you want
to check any cause and you want to see
how is it you can just check the preview
of that particular course and then
decide whether you want to view it or
not so that is a big advantage here so
you can just hit the preview button and
then you can see a few snippet of the
course how it is right so yeah so that
is a about lynda.com so if you want to
see any specific topic you can even
search it before even registering it you
can search it and then you can see the
agenda of that particular course and
then decide whether you want to go to
that website or not okay so that is
linter calm
edie Rekha is a Bangalow based startup
it was started in 2011 by a bunch of
high tech grads I believe so
Erica is one of the hottest website
which is out there in India where lots
of schools and colleges are using a
generic are to have the instructor-led
courses which people can do online so
you unlike the other websites you will
have like live sessions led by the
instructors where you can talk to the
instructor and then get your doubts
clarified then and there unlike the
other websites which are all having
recorded sessions edge raker
additionally provides these live
sessions along with the recorded stuff
so most of the subject matter experts
are the professionals who have worked in
the information technology domain so
these are all like driven by extremely
hands-on people who are out there in
India right
so the headquarters is obviously in
Bangalore as I said earlier this was
started in 2011 so it's almost just six
years for it and then by within six
years if you see here they have lots of
courses and then people who have
registered because they have very good
tie ups with the local strength here
okay so they have also created courses
on big data machine learning and AI
related stuff you can take a look at
that the only thing I felt is the
courses are pretty cost here compared to
the other ones because if you notice
here this big curve they get a Hadoop is
like 21,000 and if you notice the
position is like what three halves or
something I'm not sure like how many
sessions you will have for these three
years but the trifid for three years if
you are going to spend twenty thousand
bucks it's it's I don't think it's like
justified right so I'm not sure I
completely but and that is what they
regard as so you it has lots of
trainings related to the current
industry trends and also the education
system in India so that is why it is all
trending because it's an Indian startup
so they know the in
market more than anybody else so that is
why ad Rekha is one of the top among the
list
tell me
udemy is a seven year old startup so it
all started in a similar fashion like
other websites so udemy has lots of
courses the good thing about udemy is
it's a little bit cheaper compared to
the other ones if you notice here there
are trainings you can get it for like
final Fox if you see here there is a
discount which is running right now that
is why if you see all the crosses are
like very cheap you get it for micro 50
bucks so right now he motors this
particular angle of 4 course is like
just for 50 bucks for 27 hard right so
which is like pretty good it's a 27 1/2
course and you get it for 450 bucks
ideally it should be seven thousand
bucks or something right so which is
pretty cool it is very cheap so that is
why they they are also in the leading
raise right they also have trainings on
AI and machine learning so if you see
here there are lots of trainings on AI
amplitude learning so this has like 227
lectures 277 lectures so which again you
get it for like 450 bucks so if you are
interested in learning machine learning
you can give it a try
you are not going to spend much it's
just for 50 bucks
you can just reduce your vacant
restaurant outing and then just take a
course if you think that okay it's too
much right
so that is udemy
diversity is the youngest in the list so
audacity started off as a free
non-profit educational organization when
it was under the California Institute
you can use the density for getting
courses for free so if you notice here
there are free courses there are some
paid ones I believe but most of them are
free if you see here all these are the
latest technologies which you find in
audacity but there are not more so
compared to the other websites which are
having thousands and thousands of
courses Buddha City has very less
because these are all like free courses
and then people from the companies like
for example these is an Android
foundation sponsored by Google so all
these trainings inside this particular
topic is all like sponsored by Google
and people from Google gave these
sessions and then courses so if you
notice a there is a waiting list here
like so I'm not sure what is that form
maybe it's a live session or something
but but they are all free so if you'll
notice here most of the courses are all
free so you don't have to worry about
paying huge money here but you can have
paid co successful if you notice here
you can have paid ones so that you get
your seat secured but there are three
ones as well so that is Udacity so this
is one of the youngest in the lock so it
is just like I think 5 to 6 years old
now so maybe 5 years I guess yeah so you
will find all these machine learnings
and androids the digital marketing
related stuff here in in Udacity
so that is it I hope you guys like found
it interesting try one of these I think
either of them must be used in your firm
if you're working in recent large size
firm definitely you might be using one
of these utilize these because not
everyone gets these opportunity to use
these online courses because they are
all pretty costly in the olden days we
used to go to institution to learn them
but now you have everything in your
thumb in your laptop in your screen so
utilize them and then you can even see
YouTube videos like my channel and then
additionally improve your skill for free
right I'm not charging anything from you
right and YouTube is not charging as
well so utilize this opportunity that's
what I wanted to cover in this
particular video if you want me to make
videos on any specific topic do let me
know in the comment section below if you
liked the video go ahead and like it if
you haven't subscribed to the channel go
ahead and subscribe to it meet again in
the next video thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
