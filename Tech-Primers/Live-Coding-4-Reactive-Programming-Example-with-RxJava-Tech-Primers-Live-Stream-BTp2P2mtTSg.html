just checking if the video is live if it
is like then you can get started I'm
just double checking on my mobile if the
video is LAN hang on for a second
okay be a life let me get started
welcome to tech primers in this
particular session we are going to see
what is reactive programming and we are
going to see an example of reactive
programming and how to start writing
reactive code using rxjava so if you
have seen my previous video on what is
reactive programming this is going to be
repetitive the initial five minutes I am
just going to cover up what is reactive
programming and then we can get started
with the code so reactive programming is
the type of programming bill you program
for a synchronous data streams so you
basically program with a set of events
which are ordered in time so as I said
before time is a set of streams tweets a
set of streams the data which is going
to change with respect to time is going
to be a stream and using reactive
programming we are going to process them
in the form of a synchronous data
streams okay so our X Java is an
functional reactive programming
implementation which was created by
Netflix so Netflix has created this
library for composing via synchronous
and even based programs using the
observable sequences so if you see the
github link for the RX Java so they have
defined and they have defined what is rx
jar so rx Java C is a lightweight java
virtual machine implementation of the
reactive extension so reactive X is the
original concept of how we write
reactive programs and there are lots of
different libraries which have been
written based on this reactive
extensions and rx Java is just one
implementation of that particular
extension so in this particular example
we are going to see how rx Java is used
for reactive programming if you see here
what Netflix is is Rho is a poly good
implementation
it supports Java 6 or higher and it's a
JVM base and it also supports in the JVM
based languages such as groovy closure
JRuby Catalan and Scala so we are going
to use the Java implementation in this
particular example also there is a react
to manifest
based on which TV our two systems are
created so if you go to this particular
website so you can see all the different
properties or the behavior for the
reactive systems so the major properties
will be the responsiveness of the
application the resiliency of the
application elasticity of the
application and finally the message
driven architecture for the application
and in case of reactive systems it's all
going to be as simple as message
messages and what we are going to do is
we are going to act upon the events so
these are the message driven stuff so
blazon of the events we are going to
handle the handle those events and how
to process them that's what we are going
to see so let's start with the spring
initializer so I can go ahead and create
a new project so I'm going to create
context timers got the reactor I'm going
to tell you this react to example one
okay so the only thing which we need is
a web we can add via reactive rx Java
implementation data so I am going to
generate this particular project okay
it's just asking me way to sale so I am
going to save it under sky okay so I
have wanted to pull this okay let me
elicit this so I am open IntelliJ IDEA
we can open this particular project and
intelligent so open this
okay so what we have done is we have
just added only nuclear as a dependency
nothing else we have added so what we
are going to do is we are going to add
the RX correlation form dependency so
let's go to the version latest version
so I am going to take 0 dot 20.7 so this
is the RX core Java dependency I'm just
taking this particular dependency I am
going to add to our project so let's go
to the form as you see here there are no
other dependencies except the start over
which we added so I am going to add the
net flix dependency of our action
so let this input also in this
particular example what we are going to
do is we are going to get the stock
information using the Yahoo Finance API
okay so so we are going to get the
information and using reactive framework
we are going to see how we can process
these code information the stock code
information are synchronously so there
is a ABI from the finance codes F
navy.com
so there is a ABI available for us it is
a John dependency so I am going to add
that particular to our dependency so
this is the URL
okay so I am just adding that particular
dependency so that we can use Yahoo
Finance API and directly get the code
information of a particular stock so
that we can use get the prize or other
information and we can string that so
what is the latest version 3.6.13 same
version 3 dot dot one our enrollment is
ready so we have the rx Java
implementation added but also the Yahoo
Finance API we have added into our
project so we can directly get started
so I am going to create a class called
react to call it a reactor source for
now okay let me write it
ten points or I can even write it as a
novel class y equal to Sigma C I'm just
going to create a main class so here
what we are going to do is we are going
to use the RX implementation our actual
implementation so what we are going to
do is we are going to create an
observable package so I am going to say
we get code I'm going to need the strong
code information right now this just
create a to the source in stock so what
I need is a observable so observed from
the Arctic I see this is the class
absorbed is a class and what we are
going to get is something from P also so
let me create a service and let's say I
will create a soft soils okay from there
I am going to get to a get stop let me
create this class to edit this class
called stock service so in that I need
to have a method called get stock return
observable and here what being up to
return is a stock if you see here stock
is a model inside Yahoo Finance I'm just
one unit of the stock so how am I going
to query the stock information is if you
see this particular API they have given
that information as well so if you see
here I can vary by this okay so what I
am going to do is I'm going to use the
same code so I'm just going to
use Yahoo Finance not Kato let's say we
want to get the stock for Google okay
and this is going to Donna exception for
us so let's say we are just going to
users to filter them and then the
exception okay how does this absorb
really a bug so we have to create a so
here what we are doing is we using the
stock service we are just creating the
we are just getting the stock
information however what we need to
return is an observable stream however
we are not returning that here who is
the on / - you have to create an
observable stream for peace talks
because that is what we are going to
return back okay so I'm just going to
say don't create okay so I'm going to
say absorb it on tree for B stock
information is expecting a lambda so I'm
just gonna say some code on it okay
and if you see this will return
go inside so what do we need here where
is this complain okay that's fine so
what we have to do is be able to give
this talk information inside the observe
will not create okay I'm going to say
stock from subscriber so subscriber is
the object which we are getting here so
I am going to I am going to check it the
subscriber has been subscribed or else
I'm not ready I'm going to say why this
is not yet so I could identify
let me check why why is this religion or
little to identify an option let's check
it out once right a new functions that
I'm going to say Coons at this let's go
inside this guy okay control so here you
create that is a create okay
so inside to create we have to have a
observe look all observe the function so
why is this not getting created sure
let's do
you
no because in sky it still shows error
moving something wrong here so let's
check what is wrong we're going to
create correct Gilbert let me meanwhile
open the project which I had already
done meanwhile let me check if anybody
has any questions or something
no it's just the first is just to be
sure okay I did the current thing but I
think we don't have to would I write so
that we don't have to this sucks a
problem okay Wow it seems to be fine so
we were using the wrong method this is
deprecated that's what they say however
we are going to use the other function
which is this sky so that should good
resolve auto matically but let's write
this guy also I'm going to check if it
is the SUBSCRIBE it looks to me like a
vision so to build or clean okay I'm
going to write it trickier so I'm going
to say some troubled on his unsubscribe
so I'm going to check if it is
unsubscribe or not if the subscriber is
not subtract and don't do the stream so
what I have done here is I'm just
checking if the subscriber is subscribed
or not so you flip the subscribe to
subscribe then only I'm going to get
non-stop information so I am going to go
there
remove this piece of code which is not
required now
so this is working little bit all right
okay so I'm just thinking whether we are
subscribed or not and I am going to get
the stock information from the audience
and also how do we send this meticulous
message back to the contrary so it's all
a synchronous data stream so the encoder
will have to just do a subscribe here so
for example just close this the stock
code and created an observable for the
strong code I need to just subscribe so
once I subscribe that's when all the
synchronous messages are going to get
pushed back so once I subscribe I have
to have three functions three arguments
basically sorry
so I have three arguments so there will
be you have lots of Commission methods
with different arguments but I will have
three arguments the first one is going
to say the first one is going to be a
callback so what I'm going to do here is
going to say callback and the second one
this would be Li on error so whenever
there is an error you get this
particular contact card and the last one
will be uncompleted so basically all
these are like callback methods which
will be conned whenever there is a
problem or something okay so what we are
going to do is we are going to create
the callback so once we get the call
that we are going to get the stock
information basically so what we will
have here is this talk we are going to
call this talk information okay this is
going to be stock
why it's a lambda parameter cannot be
applied so let me go and try to schedule
interactions one then you can convert
into work will have the so do I think we
can help
let's select the function which is the
toad subscribes over that
so which one has three subscription this
has three yes this is the one which we
have two what I'm going to do here is
this I think this is the reason why we
did not cut now we should be able to use
them does its observable as a stock of
all back let's talk okay
can be physicists in with other friends
so then for this is the first successful
contact so whenever that is a message is
this going to come here so next what we
need is the error all right so we will
have to so whenever we get the error
so either we didn't have a drawable what
we will do is we will have a drawable
then we are going to call the function
let's say on error or even the error
callbacks accantus error callback for
our reference so what this is going to
do is this is going to give the
exception which we got so I am going to
create this vertical method as well so
then we can just lot it also okay I'm
just log this gun this method should be
created outside we just create it
outside
so this is going to be the punch
document is the callback for the
implementation what we need to do the
second one is the compact for the error
handling and the last one will be for
the completion so I'm going to say just
create a function for complete for that
okay you don't later so let me just
create this together so here I need to
which party stuff like in fact it
doesn't it will be empty I guess I'm
just going to say completed successfully
later in the callback 'le also callback
what we are going to do here is till we
need to do some action on this
particular stock right then what the
return something okay so what we're
going to do here is I'm going to go to
stop dot gate code so I am going to this
print v is talking finishing which we
receive so I'm going to say in systems
internal I'll just be some string for my
code so what is the code and they are
just in the code then I'll just spend
the price of the code and just bring the
a is high and also the base go okay so
this should be available for us from the
stocks or stock target code will be the
code then we need the price I'd stock
dots click OK it co dot is
okay here we should use this symbol for
the coding should print the symbol next
strong dot get both
we need the previous day's sorry we need
the base highlight so this is that is
highly an IEP is what's the song target
code dot get low so this is correctly
MIDI information for the simple the
price the that particular is high and
the low information vintage bit depend
high and what about of the price which
was high and low okay that's what we are
going to do so basically what we are
doing here is we are just printing the
stock information which we got as a
callback okay that's it so here what we
need to do is okay so this particular
class is done so this is where we are
calling the observable pattern so here
what we have done this we are just
calling the service they are just
calling this talk service and then we
are just getting this talk okay
and just getting the stock information
so so once it is received once the
observable handle is received I am going
to subscribe to that particular
observable handle and I am going to
register some callback methods so that
once we get the messages back it will be
calling the callback methods now from
the server service we have to make sure
these callbacks are properly called so
what we are doing in the services we are
creating an observable pattern we are
just creating a pattern with the
subscriber and we are checking if the
subscriber is subscribed or not once the
subscriber is subscribed I'm just using
the Yahoo Finance API to get the stock
information of Google okay once I get
the stock information I need to send
this back right so how will I send this
back to the callback is I need to call
the subscribe or not on next and I need
to pass the stock information so once I
do this the stock information will be
directly retrieve into this particular
callback method so and we are going to
get the output printer okay
once the contact is completed once all
the processing is completed we are going
the same on completed method so it is
going to trigger be complete
call back so that is going to just print
our completed successfully message and
if there let's say there is an error
message so what we are going to do is
here I we have an exception right so
what I am going to say is I am going to
say subscribe or dot on error okay I am
going to pass that particular exception
directly so once I pass it that
exception be received here and that will
be printed here okay for now what we are
going to do is we are going to get only
the if you see here this is not a stream
as such but this is just a single a
synchronous message which we are getting
from the service and we are going to
print it in the resource here so or to
subscribe put a log out of this thing so
completed okay let me start this
particular code so what we are going
what we doing is just a single message
we are getting from the Yahoo Finance
API so it is basically a stock
information about Google they are just
getting that and vehicon which is
printed but the only thing is we are
using D reactive observable design
pattern to do that so if you see here
it's completed actually because there is
only one message and it is immediately
cut completed so what we did is we
created we added keylock all going to
subscribe we subscribe so once it got
subscribed we received the stock
information and this particular law this
particular log is coming from the
callback here so for let's say a ladder
a ladder message saying call back : : so
that we know that where is this coming
from
okay and then B here we will say
complete and here this will then I'm
going to guess a good call back
okay so here we have a callback we have
the complete go back okay done so let me
read on this okay suppose we subscribed
once we subscribe the Yahoo Finance API
got called from the service okay that is
what we did here I think I can add some
blog here so that we can easily fill
here so I am just started I am added
that log but which should have got
printed here so if you see these two
logs are coming from the API itself it
is just doing a REST API call for this
particular URL up then it is getting the
stock information and it is just
printing the whole JSON or CSV message
which which if it should be received and
then you see here this is the callback
which we received so the callback says
this is equal back we got the quote
information because the current price of
Google now so it is a nine zero mind
then today's high was nine one 6.85 and
today's low was a time zero seven as
what is here and finally once we
completed this particular stream
processing actually there is only one
data in this particular stream so they
got completed and recorded the complete
data and we see the completed
successfully message and finally we
completed our processing so if you see
here this particular subscribe method
was literally just waiting for the
processing to be completed right if
there is an exception or a completion
message the stream will be terminated so
basically the stream will be terminated
when there is an error callback or the
company call back so once it is done
that's when the control moves from this
particular line to this slide so
literally the Java compiler ready for
waits here the run times the Java
Runtime in moment page here until the
completion is done
okay that is what has happened here so
let me make this a little bit complex so
here we are just waiting for Google
stock right so let's say we want to
query for
applause okay
Apple will stop code and the Google
stock code so what I have done is I've
just created a spin here what I'm going
to do is I am going to stream this okay
I'm going to stream this particular
stock so every every stock will be see
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use
each stock name my code basically so
this is the code right so let me rename
this gun
he's our focus right so I'm getting each
code and I am going to do a Yahoo
Finance but get of that particular code
right so the only thing which is
spending here is we are to do it
surround the try-catch okay and here
once we received this particular stock
what will be returned with the stock so
one till you see the stock I'm just
going to say for each and inside that we
have this top confirmation of so
stalking form so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to say subscriber not on next
stop so basically I'm not doing anything
different from just converting this
particular whatever the implementation
which created here into an extreme so
since we had that rich thing here so
what I did is I we had a variable name
we maintain state about it shall be here
what we are doing is we are not doing
anything we're just using the Java 8
streams to do some stream processing
okay so why is this suit only error
missing
so when we just gonna single and if
there is an on let's say filter talking
to that not equal to what we are doing
here is here I can do this now what here
what I have done here is I'll just
enclose this particular function
I'll just extract this into a method so
I'm just saying just get stock okay I'll
just in coupled with the into a method
so that this will be neat for us so yeah
so what are we doing here so I am just
training over the board information so
for every code I am just going to get
the stock information okay I am just
mapping utility so I'm just getting the
stock information and what we get here
will be a stock and I'm checking if the
stock is not none then only I am just
calling the subscriber dot all next okay
so once this is completed this is
printing we are drain them I think they
can give that inside the gate
information so we have we get stock
right there I can put what stock are we
go to pretty fierce so I'm just gonna
print that
so k is going to print via log saying
retrieved three retrieve stock info for
a particular code okay one to visit it
three will get it and then okay so there
is no error callback here right now but
I will just do this particular seem so
this is the typical example of how we do
reactive programming so a reactive
versus functional so if you see here
this is functional style of
implementation so if you are familiar
with Java 8 streams this is how we
stream or VI trait through a particular
particular stream or basically a
collection so what we do when the
imperative style is completely different
than what we do here is a functional
style so if you see here I can easily
read it I'm getting the codes I'm
mapping that to get stock and then
finally I'm filtering the normal values
and then finally I'm calling the
subscriber or next for every stock
welcome so let's run this particular
code there is no sleep here so what I am
going to do is I'm going to sleep for
some time so that we can see how the
ascension is programming box right so
what I will do here just to sleep inside
some method so where can I do a sleep so
I will do the sleep after this or next
is called it might look shabby but let's
change this prior yeah what I'm going to
do is I'm going to follow call this guy
for the next then what I'm going to do
then we'll do is click click on let's
say I'm going to sleep for two seconds
okay so I will create a method for sleep
whatever
don't sleep about particular another try
cache block this particular information
is subject so what we are doing here is
when after we finished recording the on
next they are doing asleep so that the
next iteration takes a while and we can
see how the synchronous programming
books okay so let's start this file okay
so we are going to do going to subscribe
we unsubscribe and initially if you see
the service will trade the stock
information for Apple and immediately
return something so I think apples code
name is wrong I think it is double a VM
so let's run this again
actually I grow another job here okay so
if you see here we received the callback
for the Apple code and the price for
today's Apple code is one for 3.94 and
today's high was this and low was this
and after some time we again got a
service called Google then again we had
it so if you see here these are
literally the callbacks and once all
these callbacks are completed we are
calling the uncompleted and that is why
they completed callback has got after we
finished to processing the messages in
this tree and then finally once images
are completed may the same completed
processing right that is there here
okay so let's add some more stock right
so I don't know much of the code name
for the stock there were some examples
here in this particular website so we
can add those talk itself so for example
they have added so many so I'll add
these stocks
okay so that we will have lots of
information to stream and also I'll
increase this to three seconds once I
have added a log statement okay so let's
run this so we will be able to see all
these stock information getting stream
so if you see here first we got Apple
yeah
we got the Apple information we got to
call back now it was sleeping I should
over at asleep before actually so once
we got Google we got int C now we got
Baba so we are getting the shock
information one by one so this is the
stream so if you see here these are our
synchronous call back messages which are
coming from this service to the main
glass so basically you are not doing
anything here we are just subpages
subscribed and then we had registered
the callbacks to this particular service
and we are getting the message is pushed
into the callback and those are getting
printed here successfully okay so we
will never just just move the log here
so now we saw successful messages let's
see some failure messages right so what
I will do is I will throw some exception
here or what I will do I just manager
Lee by default I will throw some - - -
how do I throw control here who knew
about exception okay
we're just going to complain me my crew
I just say code equal to equal to Corp
is equivalent to Google I'm going to
grow an exception okay that is what I am
doing here and what we need to do is
here is we need to call call the on
error that the exception title we need
to have the subscriber here physically
the code is required here and I'm just
going to say get storm this could come
on the subscriber so what we have done
here is we have got the subscriber
taking time so as the subscriber is
already defined in the scope yeah we
need to use this guy here this passing
it right so why is it even complain
quote is already defined in scope
okay okay it has changed to this
particular size okay let me do a
controller significantly just because
this particular method is also scared
off so that's why he has changed that is
for a massive signature so let me go
here remove this and now it should
change for thee it's not changing the
thorn but it is a movie itself let me
remove this and put it here okay so we
have got the subscriber and I am just
using the subscriber to do one error
so what we are basically doing here is
we are just calling a callback if there
is an exception we are just calling a
contact to that particular on error okay
so the call caller will know that okay
there is an exceptional
we'll be preached to the error callback
so that is what that is how we handle
exception so basically the service will
tell you if there is an exception so you
don't have to basically handle
exceptions in the trying part instead
you will have a different call back
there you can handle the exception so
let me run this so you'll see now when
the Google stock is hit it will be
throwing an exception and another thing
is once we receive an exception they
come and the processing will be leg can
be terminated the processing can be
terminated or you can still proceed with
the processing okay so that that we
should be able to define so if you see
here too
what happened was Google came and if you
see here this service hit Google and we
had an error callback and what happened
was the corn the error callback directly
and the message which is inside the
error called the court printer Domino
tire and we just said hey that's it okay
that is the error callback mechanism and
once it finishes the processing we got
the completed message processing
operated right if you notice here the
callbacks
for the other retrieve stop did not even
get called these callbacks they never
got called because the on error
terminated this particular subscriber
stream
okay whatever we created here it
basically terminated but however Silby
since we had the array stream kept on
going
so it was still hydrating it but it was
never having subscriber so it was never
calling it so internally our exchanges
hystrix so to handle fallbacks okay so
if you see here since we call it the own
error nothing happened so we just got
the callback but nothing will really
happen so instead what we can do is we
can even do it through exception so we
throw the exception I don't think we can
so
this is going to sham distribution with
my god
so let's see what happened or why we
can't proceed to the check my demo
program is the devotion for my good
oh it's very caring so how did I handle
error is since we we're in the same map
and think me directly used this on
herself okay that's why you minimize
this function of worked I don't know why
it didn't work since it is the inside
the method know why it should create a
differentiation between the sub method
console you see here what I had done is
I had done down next and then sleep the
same thing same way I will saw using the
subscriber of honor up but basically
terminated the function it did not
proceed further but that's not happening
in our case I don't know why or in the
callback I just printed in the complete
digester
so let's come this way this follow okay
I think I was doing the exception call
back after the next so let's try that
right we can try that instead of calling
the exception here throwing the
exception here what I will do is I just
call this of trampled on
absently the same thing but let me call
it here in this particular case let's
say some kind of a trawl net on that
okay so what we are doing here is I'm
just throwing an exception what is the
spectrum so it just expecting the
probable in the thumb so it doesn't need
any lambda anything we're just over no
exception that should suffice for this
time you run time exception of this and
why is it not croaking okay there is a
extra-canonical good ah let's see now
what we are doing here is we are on
throwing the exception here on the first
try itself let's see if it is still
proceeding let's do that check chapter
the sleep of three seconds after the
Apple stock so now it's slipping
actually now it should throw an
exception let's see what happened so
yeah it threw an exception and still it
is proceeding further
maybe I know why it proceeds further but
looks like that is how it works but
basically you've got the concept right
so the callback will be called when
there is a known error so that callback
will be specific to the error canta and
you can handle some things here so you
can even do a fall back or to whatever
you want in the error error case so that
is that is how strange what so so this
is this is how we do reactive
programming so if you see here I just
say I take what we did so we created an
observable pattern and registered an
object called stock and that is what we
were expecting from the get stock code
and that method internally uses a
service to get the stock information and
that service internally created an
observable stream so basically we
created an observable stream okay and
this for the subscriber we were checking
here the subscriber is subscribed or not
once this obscure
subscribe via i parading through the
course we are basically doing a stream
of the codes and we are isolating and
getting every code and we are going to
the Yahoo Finance API and getting the
stock information for every code and we
are doing some manipulation here once we
got the code information we are calling
the on next once the on next is called
be easy we call back here we receive we
call back here and we print it out and
if there is an exception we can call the
on error once all over is called we will
get that in the on error once all the
extreme processing is completed we will
get the contact messaging the completed
contact once all this particular
processing is completed or the terminate
terminate command is called internally
by the reactive streams then only this
particular information will be printed
so basically the execution engine will
be waiting here until all the contacts
are done and then the processing is
completed and then it moves proceed
moves further okay so that is what
reactive programming is all about so you
see here how this works is from the
caller I am not waiting for I am not
getting the response here and then I am
not processing anything there instead I
am just relying on an external service
which is nothing but a stock service
imagine the stock services and external
service and it is giving some
information so the so we have move to
the mop that part using the Yahoo
Finance API right so this Yahoo Finance
API is literally getting the information
from the current stock information and
maybe are just idle aiding and getting
that information back to the callback a
synchronous call back and they are
printing it here okay so this is how we
implement the reactive programming using
this rxjs framework there are lots of
other methods you can do lots of lots of
fallback you can do lots of logic here
lots of transformation and stuff using
the functional programming CPC am using
functional programming here - - then you
can add functional programming and all
with reactive programming to do all
those information and to the client you
can just give the message in the
callback directly so you don't have to
do anything in the client side so
service will have to do all the heavy
lifting and then we have to just queue
back the model of the message
to the rental client which called video
service so this is how we are to
reactive programming and this is what
Netflix uses internally for reactive
programming so I felt this APA was
easier and I thought it's a more
powerful way because many Enix has
created it and many people have already
started using it and I felt it will be
it will be filled with less bugs that is
why I use the RX chair and I just also
famous if you see the documentation what
they claim is they have done this for
groovy closure JRuby Kotlin in Scala so
that is why I started using this
particular library if you feel feel free
to comment if you have any cover
questions or something if you feel the
video was good give a thumbs up if you
want to follow my channel do a subscribe
you will be getting lots of live coding
sessions and I will be doing lots of
hands-on so that you will get an
understanding of how to do programming
on the latest concepts something ok
that's it for this particular session
meet you again in the next session thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
