CD we are going to see what is there in
my mac so as a start in this series we
are going to see the software xmind so
if you have noticed in all my videos i
would have used its mind so what is X
mind so if you are aware about mind
mapping so mind mapping is nothing but a
visual representation of an idea usually
the there will be an idea which is the
center which will be in the center so
for example if you see this particular
mind mask by default came up with the ex
mine so this the idea for this
particular mind matters welcome to X
mine so this is the central idea and
there are different ideas which are
associated with it which are arranged
around it so for example let you see
here the usual chakra so this is an idea
associated would be welcome to explain
how to map a clue that is associated
fatigue will come takes when same way
all these are different other ideas it's
like a something make a sub ideas or
something similar so if you see there
how to map is internally map the with
supper ideas like press input and rich
structure beautify same way in terms of
every every ideas and also we can group
them into a particular somebody or
something like those so this particular
X mine tool helps us in doing that so
it's let's say you are presenting
something to somebody and if you want to
convey that ok this is my idea so this
is how my other ideas are related to
that alters how we want to implement
something so you can use X minor it's
very good in in terms of visual
representation so that is why i started
using it so for example if you notice
here this particular idea you can add
lots of my knees logos and stuff so that
you can visually increase the depth to
that particular representation so if you
are using UK familiar with flow charts
or something so it is almost similar to
that but it's not really directly like a
flow chart or a map or something but it
adds more visual representation to it so
for example this particular
representation is a map so you can even
change it to a different balance map or
you can even change it to a chart or
something less so if you see here the
structure can be
no charge for up and down down two up
three chart or even a map to the right
now this is the balance map or you can
even have it have as a triangle timeline
which is horizontal or vertical so these
are different ways in which you can map
these and you can style them as it so
there are lots of other software's which
does this but I felt X mind is like
better so it work i started using free
mind but that's not great like how i
find us but x mind is very very good in
terms of reusability and the user
friendly for example I just you can just
press the tab button and you can just
start ID an idea if you tap again then
it will create a tough topic and you can
go on tell me if you want to create any
link linkages between some different
ideas you can do that so it's pretty
good actually so you can play it on the
set and then the visual to conservation
is just from eye catching so that's it
for the session materialize in the next
see thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
