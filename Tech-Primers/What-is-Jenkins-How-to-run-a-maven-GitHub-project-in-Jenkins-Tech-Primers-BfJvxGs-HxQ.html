are going to see what is Jenkins and how
can i integrate a maven project in
Jenkins and how can we use Jenkins in
our day to day life so if you're not
aware about Jenkins so Jenkins is a open
source automation server which we can
use for running your build so basically
when you want to run or compile or
deploy something you can use Jenkins so
if you see most of the companies are
using Jenkins for automating their
workflow so if you see the latest devups
model so most of them are using the
Jenkins and the pipeline building
Jenkins to automate their build deploy
procedures into UAT production and stuff
like that so in this particular example
what we are going to see is we are going
to see how we can create a job inside
Jenkins basically how we can set up a
continuation integration for your
project ok so we are going to see
various steps involved in creating a job
in junkit and also I am going to show
you how Jenkins can run your build so
basically what I have done is I have
created a github project already ok this
is basically the fizzbuzz project which
I took and then I have put inside
Jenkins example so that we can play
around with this particular project so I
can modify this here and then I can
trigger build on this particular project
project so if we notice here this is the
Jenkins server so what I have done is I
have gone to the Jenkins website I have
downloaded the Jenkins package ok and I
have installed it in my machine so in my
laptop I have installed so you can also
try that at home
so basically I download the Mac OSX
version so if you have Windows you can
try the Windows version if you have open
to water that you can try that version
as well ok so basically it's like any
other server like a tomcat or something
like that ok once the server is started
so basically you will just go to the
command company start or you can start
it using the launches ok so for example
if you notice this
this is how it looks like so I have
started my Jenkins server so right now
it is running in the 8080 port so what I
have to do is basically when I start off
verge in case I can create start
creating new jobs basically these are
nothing but new items so I can click on
a new item and Jenkins shows me water
all the different stuff I can do so if
you notice here there is something
called freestyle project ok so this is
there it combines different axioms and
you can turn it it based on your type of
particular thing you have a what you
call a make project on C or C++ or
Python or something you can use restart
so in this particular example we are
going to see the maven project so I'm
gonna show maven there is something
called pipeline ok you can create
pipelines or workflows basically inside
junkit that will be in the next video
because it is slightly complex version
of a job ok so in this video we will see
what is maven project and then there is
something called external job multi
contributor configuration project folder
github organization so get a github
organization is like you give your login
and it will scan all the projects inside
that particular organization or the
login and then it creates a build or
pipeline for each of these projects okay
that also will see as a part of pipeline
because it is slightly different multi
branch pipeline is like it it can it is
similar to pipeline but it checks all
your branches so basically when you
create a pipeline you can configure it
to listen to a particular branch but
multi branch pipeline is something
similar to how it scans through all your
branches in that repository so it can
build any branch so let's say your team
is working on different branches right
your team members are working on the
front bracket when you configure a multi
branch pipeline it can trigger a build
for each branch so based on the hook
from the bid packet or wherever your
code is hosted
so the multi branch pipeline will be
triggered and the build can run on
branches also you can you can control
that using something called Jenkins 5 so
that we will see in the next video but
let's get started by creating a simple
build right with this particular project
so I'll I'll take to you
love this project okay I'll create the
Jenkins no job name as Jenkins example
and I'm going to just select maven
project and I'm going to say okay okay
if you see here there are different
options in the general I have the
project name which we have already given
now it is this car all this let's not
discard old old bins I'm going to say
this is a github project and I'm going
to just paste this this project is
parameter is no throttle bills no
disabled this project no execute
commands books expense I know so I'm
going to say so Scott is good yeah so
I'm going to give the git repository URL
don't get okay now I have already
configured my credentials here so I'm
just going to select it here okay and
also you can specify a branch so right
now if you notice this is running on the
master branch okay I have only one
branch called master for this particular
project so I'm going to run on only on
master also the trigger point for this
build so how does this particular bed
gets triggered right so these are the
different trigger points you can have a
bit hook or you can have a pole SCM you
can just schedule how many times it
needs to be pulled so far no and will
not do anything or you can do a periodic
build periodic scheduler so you can
configure this particular job to run at
a particular time every day okay or you
can add a dependency on another project
okay but also you can do for now I will
not do anything because I am going to
just trigger it manually but you can
configure that and it works out of the
box there is nothing baked it okay
during the builder now I will say delete
my workspace so workspace is where all
your code gets checked out and stuff
like that so I'm going to say that
delete my workspace every time when the
build starts okay guess further making
it good so these are the maven goals so
I'm going to say clean and deploy okay
I'm going to say clean and apply as a
part of deploy it is going to run my
test and also it is going to create a
package as because deploy is a deploying
close source and also you can have post
validation steps or something so based
on this particular criteria you can add
some different scripts or see for
example set build status to pending it
github commit so you can even
automatically commit
of the build if it fails or something
okay that also you can do right so in
this particular example what I'm going
to do I'm going to show cleaned apply so
what I have done is I have created a
free maven propo
so if you notice here I have some files
which are pushed here if you notice you
have the GFI example that is my project
name
I have already pushed that under comm
tech primers testing J unit 5 if you
notice here that is what we have that so
what we can do is I have the project
open and IntelliJ here let's change this
particular artifact ID to something else
so that we can test it so I'm going to
say Jenkins example ok and the version
I'm going to save 1.0 snapshot so what
I'm going to do is I'm just going to
come at this particular file took it and
push it to github I'm going to say
artifact ID update artifact ID I'm going
to say commit and push so this is going
to push my changes onto the github
repository as well so if you notice here
it's asking me to push I'm going to say
push it ok and this is going to push my
changes onto the github repository and
we are going to say see that has all
your the push is successful and if I
reverse this particular file now my bomb
should have got updated yeah if you
notice in 19 seconds ago so we have
updated artifact ID so if you notice
here in the maven index this particular
in this particular folder context
primers testing here and my artifacts
should get created right now it has only
jfi examples here it should get created
so the only difference between the je
units I example project and this is
these two parts ok so I have added a
repositories and I'm just passing my URL
from there I can pull it and push it so
basically this particular project is
going to be pushed into this particular
wave and repository ok
that is why if you see here the URL is
Howard so it is going to push my
repository day so I have added this
configuration here ok as a part of maven
build as a part of the deploy it will be
pushed to this particular repository
because these are my repositories where
I have permission
so that's what we are going to do if you
are working in a company you will see
the company's central maven repository
which I mentioned here right so now
let's finish this job so I'm going to
save this job and if you notice here
this is going to check out my code from
github and automatically build it okay
so we are going to trigger the build no
option in general however this
continuation decoration stuff works is
whenever you commit something it
automatically gets triggered the build
automobiles get stupid so if you notice
here these are different options which
we have you can go to the workspace and
see how the code is getting checked out
what is the code which is present here
you can wipe out the workspace you can
build it you can configure you can
change whatever we configured here
anytime ok so I'm going to go to the
build and I'm going to go to the if I go
to the build is I click on build so you
have different options here I am going
to go to the console output so that I
can see the log ok so if you notice here
the build has already got triggered the
code has got checked out and the Maven
comer has already run so let's check for
the goal which we did so if you notice
here they may one command is running
clean and deploy for that particular
form got excellent alright and if you
notice here the test which we wrote also
has the runt of its first test and the
build is successful
so once the build core successful we did
a deploy right so the maven deploy
plug-in is automatically got triggered
and it is automatically uploading my
jars into the maven Drupal and the build
is successful if I go out I can see the
build is successful if you see you build
a successful ok now here I should get my
new project let's refresh it yeah I can
see this so I can see the Jenkins
example I can see my snapshot version
here so I have the jar here if I rerun
this build it should again upload it but
the only thing is the jar will have a
different timestamp now if you notice
yes I am I'm stamping the timestamp in
the jar ok so if I rerun it again this
particular jar will decay we'll get it
again and it will be pushed to this so
is particularly poor but with a
different time so just trigger the build
so if I go to the log my tests are
already completed okay the jars are
getting uploaded nope load should be
successful by now yeah if I note if you
notice here it has already appended - -
and also the time stamp is deficient
right so that is what that is how it
works so let's for simplicity for
checking how whether our chains are
picked up or not let's fail some test
case wait I will just comment one piece
of code okay to check if this particular
test cases getting kicked off or not if
the build is still body cams Ascona will
commit and push this
okay so this should push the change
which I did here
okay the push is successful let's go
ahead and trigger the build now so this
should pull all the latest changes
whatever we did on the build should fail
because the test case where we have a
written test case for each and every
scenario and but first a sophisticated
way now that's what we are going to see
here okay if you notice here the clean
deploy command has got sugar so
basically this is running the running
the command which we are going to run in
the command prompt here if you notice
here we will run a clean install right
inside I just do the deploy because I
want to push my jobs on to a repository
it's basically running the same thing so
I am just giving the maven goal there
but only thing is the build is going to
run on a different server and that will
be automatically triggered and
controlled by Jenkins if you notice here
the test case has failed but I have
since I have mentioned I haven't
mentioned that the build should fail if
the test case of failed the bail got
succeeded if you notice here the test
cases failed here it is saying that
expected three but worst case right it
came a three but should be safe all
right so that is what is happening so
this is how we configure the Jenkins job
on to a maven project okay if we notice
here the toast is also showing and the
test shows is unstable right if you so
if we will see this success and this is
unstable okay so this is how we
configure a maven project inside the
Jenkins build and most of the time what
happens you won't have admin privileges
on to the Jenkins film and that is why
you won't be seeing this configure
option you might see the read-only
configuration but that's ok still this
is how in general you can configure
genkai so if you want to try out
drinking that you can just download that
onto your local laptop and try it out
and you can configure any github project
to pull that change because github is a
free anyway a free and open source or
save agent Keens is also open source so
you can do that also Jenkins has the
capability to do master slave
so if you have lots of bills running in
your project and you want to use Jenkins
extensively you can using master slave
concept where you can configure slave
nodes so if I go to the manage Jenkins
option so there is an option to
configure the nodes so there is a
managed nodes option so if you notice
here there is only one master right now
but I can add a new node and I can add
it I can add a slave so that the jobs
can be half the jobs can be running in
the master half the jobs can be run in
the slave and you can allocate this case
you can allocate equal space in both
e-service that that is how you can
configure Jenkins and Jenkins does must
escape out of the box so it can it can
just control math they can control the
place okay so that's it for this
particular video so hope you understood
what Jenkins is and how we can configure
Jenkins to run a maven project so if you
have any doubts queries or something you
can just post it in the comment below I
will reply whenever I see it if you
liked that video go ahead and like it if
you haven't subscribe to my channel go
ahead and subscribe it meet you again in
the next video thank you
