primers welcome to tech primers in this
video we are going to say about what is
apache geode so if you are familiar with
gem fire you know that gem fires core
processing has been taken out from the
gem fire code and then it has been moved
to the Apache foundation so that is the
Apache geode so Apache geode is the core
processing engine of the gem fire cache
so gem fire was developed by pivotal so
it was previously under vmware and now
it got moved to pivotal so gem fire is
now owned by pivotal and the core
processing of the gem fire cache has
been taken out and then moved to the
Apache foundation so the first version
of the Apache geode came in November
2016 but the gem fire was in researcher
for the past like 10 years or something
so gem fire was the initial in memory
data grid which people were doing
research on and then they had taken out
the core processing of the gem fire
cache and then they put it inside an
open-source foundation which is under
Apache which is called the geode okay so
Jim fire is a product which pivotal
sells and Apache geode is an open-source
framework which we can use for creating
gem fire kind of caches so most of the
core processing is inside Apache or
there are some additional features
inside gem fire okay so what is this
Apache geode right so a pathogen is a
real-time in memory data grid which you
can use for caching so Apache geode
cannot replace a traditional database
but it is used for caching your data so
imagine Giroud is like a Giada gem fire
is like a sophisticated in mamela key
value pair which can natively support
Jason
so so the gemfile cache can natively
support Jason by default anything uses
the key value pair for storing me in
memory data grid okay you can do queries
in the form of objects so you can do
object querying there is a concept of
continuous query so you can string the
querying of data from that in-memory
cache all right also Apache geode is
designed for the low latency sodium fire
when you use it you will see the
difference between the traditional
databases and the in-memory databases
right obviously if something is in
memory it is going to give you very low
latency right so same way Apache or the
gem fire is designed for the low latency
okay all these are key value paths which
are stored in the in-memory data grid
okay so in memory data grid is nothing
but in-memory caches from different
machines or the clusters which are
connected in the form of a grid so
basically these are all interconnected
so all these are interconnected
there is no clustering it is it is it is
like clustering only but there is no
ring as such so if you have a ring not
all the nodes are connected but in the
data grid
you have the nodes interconnector okay
so it is a in-memory data accurate it is
by default cloud ready so you can move
the Apache Geo to cloud by default
anytime and most probably it is like
memory oriented so it has memory
oriented features okay so it is okay
memory oriented and you have an optional
way to write it to the disk and these
rights are all a synchronous so you
don't have to wait for the cache to
persist into the disk but these disk
rights are all a synchronous so you
don't have to worry about writing and
then going back so just say write this
data into the disk and then you go back
as synchronously the data will be
written to the disk by the cache also
you can use Java or geode with different
technologies like Java C sharp C++ or
any anything so
you don't have to have a common language
to use Apache or Jim fire caches right
mostly people use Java because that's
more familiar than other languages right
so that is another thing also a pathogen
provides a concept of pub/sub model so
you have a way to publish and subscribe
like how we had in Redis so we have that
model as well here so you can publish
and subscribe to a single channel so
that is where the continuous querying
comes into picture as well so you have a
concept of continuous query where you
can query the data continuously
streaming stream you can stream that
data so for example let's say you are
doing a select star from some table or
select some data from a cache from a key
value pair right so from a key you can
get the data in the form of stream so
you can continuously query the data and
then it can be pushed or synchronously
to the consumer and the consumer can
process it also these these continuous
queries can be pushed to the message bus
and then these can be processed like an
event-driven mechanism okay so the data
is stored in the form of shots so as you
guys know in traditional in any you know
sequel databases people use shard
concept where you can have distributed
caches across different nodes right and
all these shades are based on the
customer ID so if let's say I'm querying
there are five different customers who
are querying 10 different nodes every
customer is assigned node or more than
that so only that particular node will
be serving data for that particular
customer and each customer will have a
different node so that way every
particular node in the particular
cluster is served so all the machines
are constantly processing the data and
then serving the data for the clients
all right also the gem fire supports
one-to-many many-to-many many-to-one
relationships which can be modeled so
you can have relationships inside Apache
or unlike the Cassandra where you cannot
have relationships here you can have
relationships modeled right also the
other good feature about jeffires you
can have
parallel functions executing executed so
you can execute functions in parallel
like how you can do it in MapReduce kind
of concepts okay so those are the basic
features which I wanted to cover apart
from that if you see in the website they
have mentioned almost whatever I said
replication and partitioning I just
mentioned right you have partitioning
concept so replication obviously every
cache is now having a replication so
they replicate across these partitions
so persistence as I said earlier it's
super fast so performance is the major
thing about in-memory databases is the
performance is the key right and same
way this is an in-memory storage so all
the data is stored in in memory and you
can have an optional way to write it the
other good part is the events so you can
stream even so you can have server-side
data pushed as events and the server can
process them linearly the next one is
clustering so you have like a grid
connected so you have like lots of nodes
interconnected and you have them
connected always now can you have multi
clusters as well so if you see here you
can have a different data center out of
a different region or a different geo
location and you can connect them
together in a single grid so you can do
that as well so that is the most LD
cluster so continuous query is whatever
we discussed already the clients
obviously as I said you can have C++ C
sharp dotnet node.js all these are there
and there are rest api so as you know
the rest api is what is exposed from the
gem fire cache so you can have any
technology use this particular rest
endpoint to access the cache so you
don't have to have this specific
technology right the other good part is
the adapter so I forgot so the adapters
are nothing but you can have adapters to
connect from the gem fire or the G or to
the Redis cash or other memcache okay so
you can connect these two caches using
the adapters so literally you can have
read disk cache as well as the geode
cache and then have adapters to talk to
them right
so that
is what I wanted to cover so that is
what Apache geode is and if you see Jem
fire gel fire is just an implementation
of Apaches year it has it is a
enterprise product which permit all
cells so they have some wrapper around
the Apache geode and then they have made
it
we were tell specific so if you see yeah
they are just mentioned what what is the
feature which is specific to this Jim
fire from the Geo so so sorry intended
out to millions event-driven
architecture ideal for micro services so
if you're not capable familiar about
what is event-driven architecture you
can check some of my videos for knowing
about what is that event-driven
architecture and how things work in the
micro services world alright so that is
it about Apache geode and Jim fire I'll
just summarize what we discussed so
geode or the Jim fire is an in-memory
cache which has a key value path for
storing the data so it is a key value
pair a key value store basically and it
gets about JSON messages by default it
was designed for low latency it has the
con other concepts of replication
scalability and the resiliency all these
are they're out of the box same a the
publisher subscriber model is there
there is a continuous querying concept
where you can stream the data to message
bus or the or you can use the event data
event-driven processing mechanism to
process these messages in the
server-side right it can also support
the relationships it can support
one-to-many many-to-one or many to many
relationships which can be modeled it
also supports the parallel functions
something similar to MapReduce okay so
that is what I wanted to cover as a part
of this particular video hope you
understood what is a geode so in the
future videos we might see how to use
the geocache but in this particular
video is specific to the understanding
of what is geode and Jim fire right so
if you like the video go ahead and like
it if you haven't subscribed to the
channel go ahead and subscribe to it
meet again in the next video thank you
