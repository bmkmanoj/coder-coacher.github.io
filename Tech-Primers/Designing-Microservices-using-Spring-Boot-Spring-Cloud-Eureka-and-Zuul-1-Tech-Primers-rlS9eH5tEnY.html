are going to take a simple example of a
stock price viewer and then we are going
to create a microservices architecture
for the stock price viewer and we are
going to choose the different technology
stack for the stock price viewer and we
are going to proceed with it so if the
video takes much longer so what I will
do is I will break that into two or
three videos so that you guys can
continue watching it later I don't want
you to bore with the two or three halves
of contiguous station but will just
break down into 45 minutes or 1 R max ok
so I will try to do that so let's go and
see how to create this architecture
right so we know that ok we need to show
the stock price in a UI ok that is what
our aim is so we need to give some stock
quotation names and then we want the
stock price for that particular quote ok
so the typical architecture which I have
thought is what I am going to present so
you can create n number of architectures
you can come up with different different
types of microservices pattern but
whatever I thought was what I have put
here so let's see what what what does it
look like so typically there will be a
web UI so the user is going to access
that let's say I am a user I'm going to
access that gave you one so we need to
design a web UI and then from the web UI
to the back-end services I need an API
gateway because if there are so many
services in the backend I cannot hit
with different URLs itay can be deployed
in different different hosts or with
different port numbers right so what I
need is the API gateway so I'm going to
hit the API gateway from the web UI ok
from the API gateway I am going to hit a
service registry so we will see why the
service registry is according them in a
bit and I'm going to have two different
services one called the code maintenance
service the other one is called a stock
price service so code maintenance
service is going to act as a what he
called a maintainer write that I act as
an admin for adding new quote
information for a particular user so if
I let's say I want the quote information
for Apple and Google so I that quote in
maintenance service will add my username
with apple and
so that I know that okay I need decoding
summation for that for those companies
right so that is what the code
maintenance service is going to do the
stock service is going to go to the
Yahoo Finance API okay we are going to
query the Yahoo Finance API and then
retrieve the stock price information
real-time okay that is like an external
call to the Yahoo Finance so we are
going to use a library which are who
finance if you provide so we are going
to use that right the final one is the
DB service so I need to store these
quote information from tenet so it's
basically a small table it's just two
columns one with a user name and the
code information so I am just going to
store that in the multiple database
because I have that running already in
my laptop okay so that is what we're
going to see so how do we choose these
technologies right so we have how many
Plus this one two three four five six
right almost six processes right so how
do we choose different technologies
right so I'm going to show you what
technologies I have chosen you can
choose different technologies as well
but time since I have taken lots of
tutorials on spring boot and spring
cloud services I'm going to use those
relevant things so I'm going to show you
what are all the technology stack which
we can design all these all right the
first one would be the UI part so for
the UI I am choosing angular so I'm
going to use angular basic angular 1.5
406 whatever I'm not going to use
angular 2 so I am going to use angularjs
okay for the UI parts for the API
gateway I'm going to use the spring
cloud services so spring cloud services
give something called zone proxy so
Netflix has created this zone which is
going to act as a proxy okay
so spring cloud has created a wrapper
around that and then made it feasible so
that we can use it in a spring butoh
plication so we are going to create a
springboard application this Zune proxy
and which is going to be a sprinkler so
this okay so if you're not sure about
what is the zone
proxy I have made a video on what is
owed and what is you reckon you can
check that before proceeding this video
so that it will be easier for you to
understand what it is right so next one
would be the service industry I am going
to use Eureka so same as zone Netflix
has created Eureka and spring cloud
services
again wrote a wrapper around the Utica
and then they made it easy for this pink
love spring cloud or the spring mood
application so we are going to create
another spring good applications that
you read kind it okay which is going to
act as an intermediary so all these
three processes the three services are
going to register to the service
registry and they can easily interact
with the service registry without even
knowing the UL so if they can just give
a name so if you if you call me how do
you call this channel it you call it as
text famous you don't have to give a URL
to go on so so same way you don't have
to give a URL to interact with these
different services so instead you can
use the service registry to ask that ok
give me from the database service you
can from the structure which you can ask
service registry to say TB service and
it will automatically route you to that
ok so that is what you records going to
do and that is what string service
registry tensile force ok ok so
literally this diagram doesn't show that
everything is connecting to service
issue but internally what I'm going to
do is I am going to register all these
three as a service registry client
basically so this will be like a server
this will be like a client all these
will be register to the server and then
who hits the service registry they will
be able to round to whatever so will be
half ok so this is the unica is there
because we need to if you have lots of
services like for example stock sales
let's say there are two instance of it
operates on it so we need to do some
load balancing right so directly can do
that load balancing ok it can do the
local no domestic so you could hit
though your service is the state law
technically route e2 the service it is
free ok that that is why we are using
service registry and if the number of
certificates throws on right then it is
easier for us to hit the service with
the service name rather than going with
a URL right you don't have to hard code
that you are so even if the DB service
is deployed in some other machine you
don't have to worry about that ok you
just need to and you just need to
register that with a service industry so
that services she knows the new you are
but you don't have to know that if you
stop so ok so
that is why you record use the next one
the code so isn't the maintenance
service we are going to use the vanilla
ring boot application they're going to
create a spring MVC application so
they're going to explore some western
point so that from the API gateway it
can be hit the final one is the DB
server for the DP service we are going
to use this thing boot and the jpe so we
are going to use the same API when you
spring MVC asset and we are going to use
the springing data GP because we are
going to interact with the my sequin
database okay so it's going to use
hibernate so we are going to use ping
data GPA for that alright so how I'm
going to design this application is I am
going to design right from the database
service ok till the wait till the UI
path so I'm going to take approach of
bottom-up approach because if I do a top
panel approach I won't be able to test
it properly right so in a typical the
world or a typical assess scenario what
how people design is every Microsoft has
a different team or there will be one or
two people working on the trigger
mechanism so that independently you can
create those micro services and
independently you can test them and
finally they integrate it since I am
only one person so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to create right from the
bottom to the top so that I can easily
test if I greater database service I can
test with the rest endpoints I will make
sure that it is good then I create the
stock service then I can create the
court mountain service I can
individually test them and check if it
is all good then I can go further
ok so that's what I'm going to do so
let's go ahead and get started
so I hope you guys understood so this is
the typical architecture the typical
Microsoft exact attacks which we are
going to design I just chose a small
example because it shouldn't be like I I
create a huge one and the video goes to
huge and then you guys don't see it so I
just want to make sure that it is as
simple as possible that is why I chose
this particular example ok so let's go
to our typical website so there I always
create our springboard application so so
as you guys know it is the start of
spring dot IO so we cannot have air
above this axis there I create all the
spring put application so you can
like an initializer you just give the
dependencies on the artifacts and the
group ID name it'll automatically create
a project Sumerian project so you can
even create dreidel projects here but I
prefer creating payment so that you guys
understand I think many people don't use
cradle but for simplicity I'm going to
create a maven project with Java 8 and
spring boot 1.56 I don't see any other
version so I'm going to use the word
final six okay so I'm going to create a
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a group so I'm going to say comm
tech primers and I'm going to say since
our stock dealer is named as our project
his name the stock viewer I'm going to
use the group ID called stock viewer and
let's say our database service is called
TV show so that's what we are going to
dig in for strike so for that we need
the my sequel connector we need a spring
MVC so I am going this and we need the
GPA so I am going to use the KP
that's it if I'd only ten seconds let's
quickly go ahead and create it so I
created a folder called story where I'm
going to save it there
so let's say I'm going on Tippett time
one let's open it on eBay
the project is open so let's see what
are the dependencies if you notice here
the references are string data JPA the
spring MVC the spring web my sequel
connector and this thing the startup the
string book shutter that is we don't
have anything fancy here so I'm going to
straight away go ahead and create all
the rest endpoints and stuff which we
need so I think JDK is not set up let's
do this okay getting some basic
setups are necessary let me reopen this
project I think it entitled the
intelligent identify let's go to the new
folder so I'll just open it again so
that encourages IntelliJ C then create
the maven project out of it so stop you
okay for some reason it dented it if I
still why
anyway I'll quickly go and set it up I'm
going to say the Java sources is
resources with us dead
okay let's quickly the word okay it
should go let's train for this closet
and it should be good so that's it so
let's go ahead and create the rest
endpoint so I'm going to quickly go and
create the rest endpoint so I'm going to
create the package all the source I'm
going to create a TB resource so I'm
going to say DB further to the fourth
okay this is data standpoint which I'm
going to expose so that other
microphones can use it companies risk
controller it goes missing I'm gonna
speed up here so if you guys are putting
that on too fast you can just pass a
video and then take a look so that that
is easier for you guys okay lemme just
what do I need to returns i need to
return the list of course I'm going to
say return the only list of strings okay
and this is going to be a fast variable
and I'm going to say what is the part
variable in the path variable in this
username right string usually right okay
so next what do we need to do we need to
query the database like so gate is going
to query the database for that
particular user so I'm going to create a
repository so I'm going to create the
table called coats okay I'm going to
create a course table so I'm going to
create a quote suppository and I'm going
to say fine by user name because that's
what we need right and I'm going to give
the easy right so let's go and create
this particular course for a positive
clap so page great should be an
interface we are going to use pink it as
a play sitter okay so let's go and
create this class I want to use it to
create another positive package and I am
going to extend this from the JPA
repository
okay we are going to create a entity
called quote okay and I am going to use
integer you need to create the code
before that let's go here and add the
annotation called enabled JPA
repositories because they are wire JP
repository and I'm going to say this
package classes okay it's going to be
under comm tech primers don't stop don't
t be in service don't for positive okay
I think I need to give the base package
want a class okay yeah so I'm given the
packages that's it
so let's go to the repository so we need
to create this code this model is not
there so I'm going to create this under
the model package okay and I am going to
annotate this with the entity and the
table so what is the table name I need
the table name as quotes okay I will say
quote and then I am going to create it
under a database called yes so what are
the frames which I need I need an
integer field is going to be writing and
in the username field and creating user
name right and 980 list of codes right
basically since these are individual
records so I am going to say code I need
in detail code let's name the tabular
scores
that should be it so I think and create
this also as codes but it's going to
have only one quote and let it be code
fine I don't care what the table name is
but yeah so I'm going to annotate it but
that ID is going to be generated value
so it's going to be auto-generated so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create this as a auto-generated value
okay I'm going to create the strategies
or both right so that good case
automatically and I'm going to annotate
it with the column and I'm going to
provide the name as reading okay we
don't have to do that but just for some
readability purpose I'm going at it as
okay and here I'm going to create these
are the column names of what this I'm
going to give it to for the middle
school so I'm going to create some
getters and setters
so I'm going to create a concept or is
going to be an empty constructor for the
GPA right that's it so we have care to
the code we have greater therefore the
tray we have created the resource and
everything is ready we just need to
create this particular method so I'm
going to create this method in the
Apocrypha and we need to get the list of
who okay right so once we get the list
what do we need to do with a list right
we need to do something with a list so
I'm going to okay I'm going to so this
is going to return less so I'm going to
do a stream so what do I need I need to
get only the quote information return it
right because we need to return the list
of things so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to return so we have the quote
information here okay from the code I
need to get only the get-go right what
I'm going to do is I'm going to return
only this and since I need to tell this
is a list okay I need to collect this
I'm going to do a collector dog to list
okay that's it and I can simplify this I
can replace this with a method reference
again also I need to get on this
right that's it so what I have done here
is I am querying the repository for that
particular user and then collecting only
the quotes okay and then I'm sending it
back to the rest endpoint right let's
quickly do a test right so we wrote some
code I don't know if it is going to work
so let's quickly do a test so that we
can proceed with the next endpoint but
meanwhile when the meanwhile if the
process and the process comes up let's
quickly create some both mapping where
I'm going to add a user right I'm going
to say add I'm going to add is the name
on the code so here we just retrieve the
information but we need to add as well
right so I'm going to create it so I
don't want to waste any much time so I'm
going to I know we do that I'm going to
say add and I'm going to say request
body you need a quotes and it codes to
be think
it was insane
I cannot remember things yeah I think I
haven't given the database details I
said so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to use some different port numbers
so I'm going to say server tour for
equal to 8 3 double zero I'm going to
use this particular port and I'm going
to give some application in sis playing
that application of name I'm going to
say it is a DB server right and also I
need team Icicle properties so what I
have done is I have already created some
property I'm just going to use that I
just use the spring or the Kindle it is
like template so I have stored it like
this
I have stole it to the shore fact if I
do add a bit we're going to face that
for me automatically so that is what it
will thought that what is more fanciful
faster got to go against the mine can
pick from intelligent okay so we have
created all the properties they'll get
to the port I think that is it going to
be continuous yeah so let's go ahead and
create this class so I'm going to create
one more class called quotes that is
going to be the model which the user is
going to push so yeah there is no error
that's quickly run this I mean when we
can create it yeah let it quickly run or
I'll just go through a compilation error
so let's not write any code until this
comes up
meanwhile I have the postman here so the
URL would be JTP : / / localhost colon a
little / yes / TB / what is a username I
just let say for some point escaped
eater okay there is a
nullpointerexception
oh yeah I think I know why it's an
enfant exceptions happened so this is
because they didn't instantiate this
repository we just created it we just do
auto wiring I am just doing the
construction constructor injection so
now this should fit an empty response so
I have restart with application of
attack since Leslie if it returns empty
response VSS okay our application is
working our plumbing is working is going
to the database we can plate as a table
in the database so yeah so if you notice
here here I have given the spring jbi
hibernate DDL authorize update this is
going to automatically create the table
if it is not existing so let's go to the
postman and came to send again it should
return empty response actually I had
created some table already so that is
why you see here Peter has a data for
Google and Apple okay so if I give some
name Sam it's going to return empty code
yeah we are getting the data getting a
response food now what I'm going to do
is I'm going to add the post method so
they have greater the force method but
we haven't done anything right so we
have created a POJO here what i'm gonna
do is i'm going to add some basil so
this is going to be the json which the
user is going to push using the post
method okay so what I will do is I am
just give this
right so we need the list of quotes and
the user right that's it so I'm going to
create a greater than set of right and
I'm going to create some constructor
right so that is it okay so I'm going to
create some empty constructor as an item
like that will be relevant but yeah
let's go and create it so I'm going to
use that particular course okay and I'm
going to again T quotes information and
I need to insert these right so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to iterate
through this strain so that I get all
the code information and I need to
purchase that right so I'm going to use
for each so I'll get the code like I
will get the code information so I'm
going to use be repository right and I'm
going to say say okay while doing the
same I need to create a new codes of
code object right I need to create a
code object isn't it so the code object
is nothing but the object which we
created here right so let's add some
constructor so I'm going to add the
consequencies name input so what we can
do here we can operate the username and
the quotes information okay what is
going to do is it is going to I trade
this list of quotes and it is going to
insert for the same username so that's
what I'm doing here I'm going to I'm
going to do is save on creation of new
code every day okay in fact I can even
do a map and then make it much simpler
so I can do constrains I can do that so
I can just say you
oh of course
dog get you in a coma and then in the
for each I can just do a favor this
school I can do the sensor so this make
the functional programming stuff like I
can do this
so what if you see here I have just
creating a new quote object which I need
to be using the repository so finally
what I need to do is I am going to
return the list of codes which got added
so I will what I will do I will just use
this weather so I'm gonna enclose this
inside the get username get close by
using I'm going to use that I'm gonna
tables that get post by easily remove it
oh my dear again so that lady came here
to that one this function can be be used
you can just move it down so we have
added a post which is doing an ad right
so let's quickly test this so that we
don't get blocked and meanwhile we can
add a new one to do daily
so we have added at yet we have added a
add and then we will be adding a digit
let's switch click as the ad now I mean
well let's go to the postman I'm going
to see it I need to pass I need to
create a post right so I'll do a post
and I am going to say add that is for
another standpoint of that Debbie act
and I need to pass the content type in
the header I'm going to say it is
okay so in the body I need to pass
something right so what I need to pass
using so what I need to pass to say
wrong and I need to pass a JSON message
so I need to pass the username which I'm
going to say is Sam okay I need to and I
need to pass the list of codes right so
I'm going to say course and I'm going to
pass then it's tough code so in this
particular case I'm going to say only
Google ok I'm not interested in more
than one so I'm going to say I'm going
to add this particular information okay
so let's see if the process is up yeah
the process is up I'm going to quickly
go and hit the send button so this is
going to return me a list of objects so
what has happened did it return
unsupported media-type why is it I just
say ah I think I didn't type it fully
content type let's just do the send
again this is going to add yeah if you
notice here it has added and it is
giving me what is the list of list of
quotes for that particular user so I'm
going to do a query of salmon and I'm
going to see if it is correct okay so I
think it is it looking should override a
target so what is I forget it okay so
and what get here okay code if I reduce
spam I'm getting Google okay so it is
correct so ad got worked so I'm going to
quickly add the delete option and then
I'm going to finish off this particular
address this particular Microsoft so I'm
going to say Tilly
okay
you want me to get just pawns I'm going
to say I'll just certain boolean or just
say dilute and let's add it editable or
permit so let's say we can delete only
the user okay we can modify this later
if we need more methods but just for the
initial testing purpose I'm going to
have only
okay what I'm gonna do here is I'm going
to say it or delete and you need a quote
what we can do is we can say new hole
usually but I don't know if it will boy
so what we can do here is instead of
doing this I'm going to query all the
final username easily and we have the
list of quote information and I'm going
to pass this decline if you see here we
have the list of code and I'm going to
pass this clicking delete so that we are
going to delete all those and I'm gonna
say return true or if I want to query
what I will do is I'll just say query by
this so that we can confirm that there
is nothing so this basically will turn
always empty response so that people
know it's empty so it is here what I
have done is and querying for the
username and I'm getting the all the
codes and I am deleting them okay just
was a safety purpose nothing it bite on
three starters and I will quickly test
this and move on to the next one
right so let's go to postman for the
post I need to delete right I'm going to
say delete Sam right and there is no
body request I am gonna say nothing okay
get this comma with the storm of yep
just come up so I'll just quickly do the
same yeah if you notice here nothing is
coming so if I go to get done to train
staff I am getting nothing so luckily it
got deleted okay so our microservice is
ready so
the Debbie microservice you can see the
baby service is ready now so any process
can use the DB service to add or delete
or retrieve e-coat information for a
particular user right the next one what
we will do is we will create a stock so
okay so one of the Microsoft's is ready
so next we will do a stock service
creation so I'm going to create stock
service so for this talk service we need
the spring MVC we don't need JPA as such
because we're not going to get a
database operation and I think we need
to do anything else I think we need the
you take our client okay you need to do
the you record discovery because we are
going to add this here a cursor in stock
service as a trying to D you wreck us
over okay basically the service existed
so that is where we need to mount in the
next line so that's why I'm adding the
you take our discovery question point I
dependency okay so let's quickly create
this okay I'm going to create it in the
same location that existed
okay to dump it let's go to IntelliJ and
open it so what I will do is I will stop
this guy and bring it when we test it
right so that
we don't mess that up we'll just all
funny mean stuff feels a little loose
topsoil
that's no good so it's doing an import
the other thing is saying this since
this spring both version is new I think
if my downloads my spring cloud
dependencies so it might take few
minutes I believe because it's going to
download it for the first time because I
have not started a project with spring
flood one hot side of it so it needs to
download all the new jars which take all
right and before that way let's go
through what is there in the palm
products um if you notice here the bomb
has a spring cloud start and Eureka this
is what I was mentioning so this is
going to give us being your discovering
your client from Shanti and we are going
to use spring both spring MVC right to
springboard shot of F that's it you're
not going to have anything else and the
other thing which we are going to adhere
to this is you're going to add the Yahoo
Finance API so I'm going to customly add
that so I'm going to add Yahoo I have
already added a template so I I have
added that depends here so the Yahoo
Finance API this is the non TPA and the
version is 3.6.13 use okay so let's see
the project structure look structure is
good so I'm going to annotate it this
with the Eureka client because this is
going to be a client right so I wanna
take this city client so you don't have
to do anything else if you see the
difficulty you reckon implementation you
have to do so many things but spring
cloud services is doing this annotation
magic right so it is those things still
is saying that okay you add just an
annotation I will take care of all those
the string I'll take care of discovery
and stuff like that and the other thing
what we need to do for this particular
client is we need to add some properties
in the application yeah okay so what I
am going to do is I'm going to add some
property so I am going to say that okay
my eureka server is going to be running
in this particular report okay and it's
going to be running in the localhost and
i'm saying that register with you
regards to for the client and say that
fetch the registry to so this is going
to give me be ready
information this is just the conjugation
which we need so right now there is no
server running here but still I have
just mentioned it so that we will have a
dump and running when will be created ok
let's create a rest endpoint so what we
need to do is we need to expose this
rest endpoint so that from the UI if you
hit this particular process if the user
is going to give the user name with a
user name we are going to query the
database service and then we are going
to return it back right that's what we
are so we are going to return the we are
going to get the quote information and
using the port information we are going
to go to the Yahoo Finance API and so
let's go and create peace resource so
once I start creating waiting you will
because you'll understand so I'll create
a stock resource ok you want to use the
rest controller one use this mapping and
I'm going to say rest - stop stop
and I'm going to say game ad stock
information for the username
I'm gonna have only diesel and the I
don't know what object OTP
so I think it is a stock book we can
return the stock hope information let it
stop so what also we need to ability
part variable is the name
I'm gonna store this inside still easily
right so we have the username now we
need to query the other TV service right
so we need to query the DB service so
what do we need is we need the rest
template so we are going to use the rest
template okay and I'm going to oughta
wear this so we cannot Ottawa just like
that so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create a convict class where we
can add the beam creation so that it can
be created only one okay so what I have
done here okay so I'll just created a
new beam so that I can auto wire later
in other to other for example in East
officers I have Auto wearing
automatically so that it can create that
as template only one and spring both
will know that it has to do the load
balancing right and this class is going
to be a configuration class so I'm going
to rotate it the add configuration okay
that's so we don't need anything else we
can in fact even we can move those there
okay that's not a big deal okay so the
road at load balance is going to do the
client-side load balancing you can see
here it is coming from the spring cloud
client okay so this is going to do the
client set roll load balancing when we
are using the Eureka you wrecker service
okay so I will show that when it is used
right so for now what we are going to do
is we are going to use is the custom
plate and since we are not going to have
the eureka server created yet i am going
to hit the URL up e rest endpoint
directly so I'm going to use get okay
I'm going to use get four objects so I'm
going to say this shady pecan little to
what was the port number eight three
double zero right a tree double zero
slash red slash TV slash our username
right
okay and then what do we need so what do
the definition here I need the class of
response type I think they give a string
rate I think they give this okay and I
am going to store this into
photogenic boots it's going to be a list
of course credit so instead I can now
instead of using get object in fact I
can use the exchange so I'm not sure if
I can easily use it right yep so I'm
going to say this URL
use this particular URL and I'm going to
use get okay they're going to get order
the new stone parameter it should be
entity do we need to give a if
entity I don't think we need it and then
we don't need a sequence T we need to
get the response of result so what is
the definition is given
I need the class of type T right so what
class is that I think it's going to be a
list right so I but I need a parameter
is a couple so I won't give a parameter
of type depends on which is a new
parameter ice type reference of list of
strings that one may be right you need
to edit anything from this will the
system be empty
okay so what I am going to get here is a
response object right I need a pork
response I will be getting a cold
response and from the response I can get
the body which is going to give me the
coats which is going to be the coats so
what I have here is the list of course
from the list of course what I'm going
to do right I think I can not give the
name course because I am scared of over
here and just delete it because that's
not require know to say anything the
exchange right so I'm going to use the
quotes so I'm going to do a string so
for every code what I need to do I need
to do a mapping so for every code what I
am going to do is I need to query the
Yahoo Finance API
so I'm going to create
Yahoo Finance I'm going to use this I
hope no one's done
oh-ho what is the class wanna be with it
kanta is Yahoo Finance let's see I don't
remember what was it you think it's
Yahoo Finance what was the I think
something oh there's some cool boss Kato
but nothing is coming right now to the
mind so let's quickly go and see the API
so I have created I have created a
suppository I think I created a project
on that so let's quickly go and check it
so I crater the reactor for example with
that so I'm going to only check what are
they exactly PA so I don't remember
exactly what was the method name
completely tragic here
okay it's going to be oh it's going to
be a static thing okay I can just the
way you are open arms or get off with
right can do that so I'm going to say
rock new plans or get off yeah you have
the symbol so if there is a let me check
it will be too fast clean list
oh nothing alright so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to pass the code so that
we get the port information right and we
need to collect it with those dot two
lists
okay that's it and this can be done here
we don't leave this we don't need any of
this object because it's a static method
and if we there is the i-word solution
and you say is it wearable paper or
physics inside this guy and this is the
try catch okay fine and close to the
concoction-- put this inside our third
pit stop
okay so I'm gonna replace this with a
tree method results so that it's easier
for me here I staged a little in code
what does it stop so I need a stop here
so - Yahoo structure I think I have to
put the stock here as well right
okay so we have collected this
information and when and when it is
returned this that's it good so what
does this is done here if there is a
catch I think I need to return
click on create the stock I think I can
create a super simple but I can create a
pretty good if there is an exception I
am is gonna crater and the stock okay so
that does it
so what we are going to do here is what
we are doing here is there we have it
addressed in point called rest us better
slash stock and I have created a get
mapping for the username and we are
using the username and we are querying
the other baby service and then we are
getting all the list of code information
and then we are querying the Yahoo API
and then we are going to trigger it
right trigger T we are going to return a
response right so let's start this guy
meanwhile I need to add the port
information right so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to say
I'm gonna make myself stop sauce and for
the server I'm going to give the port
number as a three zero one okay right
let's bring this up
meanwhile I will open the other project
to change without loss of blemish hello
from the DB service trial during the DB
server so that when we hit this
particular standpoint it is going to
connect to the DB servers and then give
us a response for the courts which are
there in the DB okay and just triggered
the bill just it at the top let's see if
it is coming in hope it comes up because
the service registry is not something so
it should fail the there should be some
keepalive are not here so I'll just show
you what it I we just poles and sex if
the server's is running or not because
this is how you write our client right
so here month is as you take a client so
this is going to do a poll I hope it
should not fail so it
yeah I sitting here it's doing a
initializing a decline the day then
something contained stone jumping it
failed okay yeah yeah the query failed
cannot agree because because it's not
the server is normal so we've done
because we having to hire a bit
meanwhile the porters come up so the
process is up what we can do is we can
hit this particular standpoint so what
are the rest endpoint we are having a
resting point faultless slash top
slashing on it right and let's check
another yeah the other ones also the DB
service is also up at the 18 double zero
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
to the TV service alright so I'm going
to add the Sam so I deleted some
previously read so let's go and check if
Sam is there I don't think it is it yeah
Sam isn't it so I'm going to act them
for the Google stock line okay Sam has
got added let's query in sick one okay
Sam got added what I'm going to do is
I'm going to hit the six eight three
zero one so I'm going to hit these talk
service and then I am going to check if
the stock price is getting three so the
rest endpoint is the rest class talk /
Sam
so I am going to hit the send button
let's see if the data is working so it
is saying no instance is available for
localhost one
so the database query came if you notice
here the I see the database query came
here but there is some problem here
there is a connection refused so this is
coming because of the spring oh okay so
I think I know why that is coming
because I have added load balance here
so I will not do that let's restart it
yeah there was a Replicators client-side
whole balancing using it open so it is
identifying if that practical service is
there or not so that is why I think
everything is getting it open - if this
is not coming up what I will do is I
will disable the year dependency here so
that it is not connecting to any server
so let's try let's try this one more
time you take out that particular
annotation or as what I what I will do
is I will just disabled this particular
definition then we will just test it
later on when the server suggesting
server is created we can enable it but
also its up again so let's hit it and
see
it's telling saying unknown post
exception why is it unknown horse
exception I think it's not able to
connect to the Apple I Jack right yeah
that's what I do if you go to the
exception is for the i yahoo i chart
yeah it's not able to connect physically
but it will fill the information right
and it was completed it's better I'll
disable this disguise so next enable the
Eureka server so back pxk from the
Govinda's also ok and also leave
application we often Oakland come on
tomorrow you a little starter
tokido be sugars or not you hope
Bob I should not be any exception we got
that look a little up and it's great to
go and simply get option tell me that is
an exception to the staying on board
under the host exception so why is it
coming away but also that the board
information got your trade I'm not sure
why that is coming okay so see here the
Google's alphabet information about
literacy and it is getting fast but
still it through a long post adoption
right yeah I don't know if what happened
to be after you API
maybe the I chartered yahoo.com it
settles down or something
I'm not sure right so what I lose and go
ahead and check if that is a new API
which is available so what I will do is
I'll go ahead and check that okay
okay so I'm check if the version as a
second Yahoo Finance API website whether
the version is go Donna so meanwhile
let's go to the architecture so if you
notice here what we have done is we have
created the tabi service and we have
kicked at the stock service we need to
create the service registry so what we
will do is we'll quickly create a
service register you make a server so
let's go to the thing initializer so I'm
going to create a new data source okay
and I'm going to say it's going to be a
bib and it's going to be a wrecker
service so that's what we are going to
select here and I think that is it we
don't need any other difference right so
I'm going to create the project and we
let's quickly create that okay so and
then with this particular services
education and stop the video so that we
will just regroup again in the next
video with the character the Yahoo
Finance API so I'll just correct that
whatever whatever is the latest right so
let's quickly unzip it okay and with the
successful let's go to IntelliJ and
quickly open that
okay justice for all just opened okay
the consumers so I think this also may
take some time to do the import because
this is the first time I'm using this
version so it needs to download all the
record
silver property hopefully it should be
done between that's it okay Colette has
done it good for us so that's it
what we need to do is we need to create
a the annotation here called the add in
a balloon you don't cross ever okay we
are going to add the annotation call
Ãºnica server so this is going to be the
server okay with which other processes
are going to connect and we need to
create application numbers similar to
how we created they're in the other
processes I'm going to create the
application gamble I'm gonna name this
application we're bringing application
name as you the cards over right and I'm
go go say idea properties of self so I'm
going to say that this particular
project is not a client
so disable and don't fetch me the
registry information because I am going
to directly it so that's what I wanted
okay so that's it that is all we need so
this is going to be the the records also
be noted here things the small spoon
would application which is just going to
behave as we take a server that is what
we are going to get ok let's go ahead
and start this particular server ok
so one starter this is going to be the
server and it is going to have a
dashboard okay from the dashboard we can
see that what are the different clients
which have got registered and stuff like
that right so let this come up okay if
you see here by default it comes up and
in this particular book okay let's go
and then okay because we notice here
this is almost similar to the URL which
we gave to the other projects so let's
go ahead and quickly see I think this is
saying already in use so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to give a different
I'm going to say a 3:02 right let's see
if it is coming up a third
okay something's coming up yeah
if you notice here I think it is up yep
our server is up let's quickly go to the
browser and I'll show you any dashboard
for this
what is the browsers and browser is here
so if you see the low close eight seven
six one that is where the server is
running but let's see where you see a
little thing they created it out smooth
a Roger apply in create to the zero to
yeah okay so I don't need to give the
eureka so if you notice here in the
dashboard so you can see this is Erica
so this shows what all the different
applications which are registered with e
you recover so this is going to be the
server if you notice here there are no
instance which are available here right
now so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to disable what we I'm going to enable
what we disabled here right and I'm
going to bring this up and we are going
to see what is happening
okay so I think
so the more important okay put a
successful isn't a living okay
so let me bring this yeah so once this
comes up there's going to be a client
and the client is going to be register
here if you'll notice here there are no
instances right now to disturb because
there are no clients right now running
but we need the clients rate so let that
particular server come up and they
should not see any failure here are I
think we have to give the eureka so yeah
I need to give the port number here so I
have written wait three zero two right
so we are it with you that it will be
repose and LT started here so this
particular client is now going to
connect with this particular server
okay if you notice here it has connected
already it is connected using the stock
price and it is saying that it is under
support 8301
right so let's go ahead and check if
this us come up here so yeah if you
notice here the stock price is showing
up here okay so instance apparently
registered with a eureka this is what is
happening here right great right so now
we have a DB service as well so we
register the stock service with it we
have the DB service as well let's
register TBB service as well so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go to the
form add the same dependency so getting
that dependency so I'm going to add that
also as a client so I'm going to add
this guy also here so that the DB
service is also registered VD you record
server so that you can easily access
from the stock service to the DB source
using the name achill so we don't have
to do that that's what we are going to
do here so let it both have running main
one I'll create the application yeah
and my new thing you take a breakup
client okay when it's needed and a port
number is a 3:02 so I'm going to add a
notation called enable you recall I know
committing call the forum did it get I
think I have to add the bring boots
spring cloud sell property see a little
artistic
thank God wasn't and you okay
just needs to be imported and is getting
in football
okay we need to stall so wmm is really
specific
hopefully this should resolve the import
problem to students with editorial
it's still in large majority so let's go
and check whatever things are heated so
apart from them do you need anything
else we the Utica stocking that's it
doesn't need this here and then I 2250
recorded
and unfortunate
okay and shouldn't have put this here
here should have been here and they put
this back of all oh yeah that's the
import now we've gone okay
yeah no a little bit yeah
cook so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to restart this guy again so that
this is going to behave as a client
again and it is done will now be
registered with these silver fir so
right now which is you only the stock
services register we need the DBQ is
also to be register here and let it come
up as this comber I think DB service is
coming up so I will close the or this
particular session with this particular
registration and I will just summarize
what we did so that we can continue from
the next Microsoft in the next this next
video okay so yes the process goes up
let's refresh this page okay so
emergency you recommend being correctly
claiming instances of when they are not
the annuals are less than official so I
think this is because all right
if the unica things that some of the
services down but it that is that is the
reason it is showing um that better okay
you can ignore it for now so we have the
DB service registered as well and also
the socks of is registered so if let's
see the architecture diagram what we
have done here so if you notice here we
have registered both the stock service
on the db7 onto the registry service
industry okay so from the stock service
you can easily access this DB service
via the service name instead of tu one
okay so I will show that in the next
session okay for this particular video
we just created an architecture so this
is going to be the architecture for the
microphones which we are designing
be creativity be civil with the
different dress ten points we are going
to add David and get the code
information for every user and stock
service is going to connect to the Yahoo
Finance API and get a stock information
and it is going to go into the DB
service to carry all the coding finish
for a particular user and using that
quote information it's going to go to
the offices and safety and get
and also we have cricket the service
registry this is going to be the unica
server and we connected the stock
servers on the DB service to the service
registry and we saw that in the
dashboard that these both are getting
registered to this particular server so
in the future in the next video which we
create the API gateway in the zip so
from the web we will be able to easily
from the API gateway will be able to
easily route to T different services
from the stock sale from the service it
is to basically the user customers which
we created ok so that is what we are
going to see in the next video and I
hope you understood everything you know
whatever waited in this particular video
so we have created three different micro
services we created all these three
using the spin boat application and this
thing you reckon spring cloud services
so if you have any doubts regarding that
properties in the comments below I will
be able to help you with that
you can try this program as well from in
your local system if you don't have any
might be called a tables you can use H
to instead of the my sequin connector
database or the my sequel of dependency
you'll be host to database ok are also
trying to push this code into the github
repository so that you guys can download
that from there ok so that's it for this
particular video we keep it in the next
video we will cover these remaining now
micro services and we will create an
end-to-end working prototype ok
hope you guys understood whatever we
discussed in this particular video video
again in the next video thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
