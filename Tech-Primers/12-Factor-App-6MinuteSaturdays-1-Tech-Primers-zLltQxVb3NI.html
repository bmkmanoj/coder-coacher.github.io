session we are going to see the
difference well factor as principals add
up Lincoln who was the co-founder of
hero hook which is a platform as a
service offering which is similar to the
Cloud Foundry founded these twelve
factor applications principles when he
designed applications deploying to Hilo
ku so let's go through them one by one
so the first one is the code base so
what he defines as a code bases let's
say you have a deployment every
deployment should have a separate
repository so let's say you have like
five different prophecies or five
different deployments then basically you
will have to have five different
repositories so he wants to split
everything into a separate repository so
that you can deploy as a whole so you
would either deploy as a whole or you
don't deploy at all so that is what the
code base principle means the next one
is the dependencies so managing the
dependencies in the application should
be brought in from the application so it
shouldn't be like coming inside the
application so it should be hosted in a
repository layer so something like a
maven trip or something similar to that
so that is what dependency mean conflict
so conflict should be out of the
repository so accelerating the
configuration out of the repository
would basically mean that your code is
separate and the conflicts are separate
so you don't have to redeploy or
repackage your application when you have
to change something in the context so
that is what this config means backing
services so let's say we want to connect
two different services to connected
application for example database
services so these database data sources
can be injected as separate backing
services rather than having these
configured inside the application so
that is what the backing services means
the next one would be the build release
and run so basically what what it means
is you build the application you release
the application you run the application
basically be all these will be impaired
in sequential so you don't have to
release the application before it is
built right so you have to first build
it then you have to release it and then
finally you run it the next one would be
the stateless processing so every
application which you deploy should be
stateless so it shouldn't hire any
state maintained in itself so that is
what stateless possessing the next one
would be the pause binding so for
example then we design applications
right for example let's say in Java we
create applications deploy two Tomcat so
we used to allow Tomcat to decide which
port to on which our application should
be running
so those shouldn't be exposed to the
platform instead the application should
drive which port the app should be
running so that is what port binding
means concurrency so concurrency
basically means when you scale up your
applications right so when we scale
application so when we develop locations
to cloud the ideology is that you can
easily scale applications basically you
create new instances of the same app
concurrently so we should manage our
application in such a way that
concurrency is not compromised so that
is what this mean this possibility so
this possibly LT means basically when
your app shuts down or when the app
comes up it when the app comes up it
should be faster and when the app shuts
down it should shut down within like ten
seconds so what what it should do is
let's say when the process gets a big
term error for shutting down in itself
so it should clean up all the resources
which it was using so that it can
gracefully shut down and it doesn't
maintain any state or it doesn't take
any data and then burn in itself so that
is what this possibility me dev
prosperity so this is the main part
where whenever you deploy an application
to the dev it should be the same which
you are going to deploy into cut so you
should not have any parity between the
dev and prod when we deploy the
application in terms of the code base so
the conflicts could be different that is
why we are segregating the conflicts
separately in the previous config space
however the application should be the
same which where we deploy in death and
rot the next one would be the log
so the log should be streamed that is
what he says the logs at you know in a
traditional application monolithic
application what we do will be create a
log file and then we just dump those
logs into the log file and so that we
can log into the Machine and then check
it however in the cloud-based
environment how we are going to log
matters
every time you crash and burn or every
time you start a new processes process
the logs will not be in a single host or
single machine so basically it will be
in different cloud machine so we need to
stream those logs into a common place so
for example clunk or elk these are
different offerings which we get from
the cloud so that we can stream the logs
directly from the application entities
probably the last one we'll see the
admin processes so as a part of the
admin processes what we are saying that
is let's say we are running a one-time
script so for example database migration
or database maintenance scripts which we
run as a part of our production release
or something like that so we need to
have those running separately so it
should not be the same process which is
going to do that so that is what the
admin process reasoning so these are the
twelve factor apps 12 factor design
principles which Adam begins has
proposed and most of the micro-services
patterns are following these so for
example the cloud native pattern which
spring boot or sing or pivotal has come
up with is also covering all these
twelve factor app in mind so that it's
easy for us to deploy our application
onto clouds and manage them that's it
