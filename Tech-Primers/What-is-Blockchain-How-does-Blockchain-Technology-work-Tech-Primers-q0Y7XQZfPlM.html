blockchain then you're probably not in
2070 let's see what is blockchain and
why everyone is talking about it let's
get started
press the bell icon on the YouTube app
and never miss any updates from tech
premise
if you have heard about the recent boom
of the bitcoins you would have probably
heard about the term blockchain and
everyone is talking about bitcoins
because it is like the digital gold
let's see what is blockchain the
underlying technology under the Bitcoin
so what is blockchain so blockchain is
basically a distributed ledger
technology which is used for the
bitcoins for transaction so we are going
to see what is a distributed ledger
we will also see what is a ledger to
understand the distributed ledger a much
better in a much better sense right so
blockchain is also a peer-to-peer
network so it is basically a group of
computers connected in the network so
basically the Internet so we will see
how these are connected and why these
are connected and why these are need to
be connected
what do blockchain do so they record
transactions between two different
parties and then they verify them and
they do also have the security checks as
a part of the verification these
security checks are validated to make
sure that there is no intrusions which
are occurring one of the network in the
blockchain so once the data is verified
you cannot alter the data in a
blockchain to the most popular
implementation of the blockchain is the
Bitcoin as you know so what is the
legend right so ledger is nothing but a
repository of all the transaction
information which has happened in the
system so if you want to track
transaction which has happened in the
system you have a ledger which records
all the transactions which has happened
in the particular network or the system
which has consolidated everything and
then entered in a single place okay so
let's say you have different down
streams all these downstream push the
information to the ledgers so based on
the ledger information you can identify
what type of information occurred or the
what type of transit
occurred at some particular point so
ledger is nothing but a repository of
all the transactions which are happening
hey how does blockchain leverage this
blockchain uses the concept of
distributed ledger so what is
distributed ledger me right so if you
have heard about the distributed
computing or the distributed
repositories for example get in itself
is a distributed deposit so you don't
have a central copy you have multiple
copies of the same repository so the
distributed ledger is also something
similar you don't have a single ledger
you have multiple copies of the same
ledger so if you notice here there these
are little so there are different
Ledger's and how these Ledger's work
together so they work together in the
form of a distributed computing paradigm
so all these Ledger's are interconnected
and if a transaction happens in the
blockchain every distributed ledger will
get that information so even if one
particular ledger goes down the other
Ledger's are there to give the
transaction information or create the
transaction information so once the once
a new ledger needs to be joining a
particular group or the network you can
copy the exact repository from one of
the ledger and then create a new nature
so that is how the distributor ledger
box works
so in blockchain it uses the concept of
distributed ledger so you can have n
number of Ledger's in this particular
distributed network you can have more or
we can have less it depends right so
what does a block consists of so in the
blockchain world so in the distributed
ledger setup right so you will have lots
of blocks which are chained together so
what are these blocks so each block
consists of the current transaction
information so for example let's take a
payment information right you're going
to pay a particular person so-and-so
amount of money that information will be
there in a block along with that it will
also consist the hash of the previous
block so hash is nothing but
destination destined unique
identification number created for a
block so imagine it as a unique number
which cannot be altered for a block so
if you so basically the block is nothing
but a current transaction information so
it will have the transaction information
and that gets translated into a hash so
that num that is a constant a unique
number or a unique character music right
so that will be created for every block
and each block gets linked to each other
using this hash so you have linked to
the previous actual let's say this is a
block right so I have a block which is
having a transaction which I want to
send from A to B just $30 then I am
sending it from C to D for $40 right
this is a transaction block okay along
with that you have the hash of the
previous block right so those to form a
single block and a transaction
uniqueness ID is created which is
nothing but the hash so this is nothing
but the hash of this particular block so
the next block which is going to get
created it is going to use the hash of
this particular block so if you notice
here this is the new block which got
created and this is going to contain the
hash of this particular block so this is
always unique so if somebody tries to
alter this particular block this hash
changes and your subsequent blocks are
altered right so this is there is no
linking here so if this particular has
changes then this also will change and
there will be inconsistency or
redundancy right so your blocks are now
not insane so that is how blockchain
eliminates the intruders so if somebody
tries to hack a system they won't be
able to do it unless they alter every
block in the particular level right so
every block in the particular full block
change so let's go to the distributed
diagram which we had right so imagine
there is a block initiated from this
particular nature so the same block will
be pushed to all the Ledger's and all
the lodgers will verify this information
saying okay do I have
this much amount of money in a and do I
have some amount of money in P and once
everybody verifies this transaction and
their uniqueness and their links the
final money gets detected from thee from
the destination Daka right so from the
source of the distance depends on what
type of transaction it is so that is how
blockchain works so Bitcoin leverages
this concept to and it takes it to a
different extent but they don't go to
cover Bitcoin in this particular video
so this is what I wanted to cover so
what is the blockchain so blockchain
works on this concept of distributed
ledger and it uses blocks and how these
blocks are related are using the hashes
and how they are transaction transaction
using the peer-to-peer network and every
ledger validates each blocks in that
particular chain and then it knows that
okay this particular information is
correct if there are more than 50
percentage of the Ledger's who deny a
particular transaction then the whole
transaction will be canceled so the
particular block will be canceled right
so that is how Bitcoin or blockchain
technology works right sobayed they can
use blockchain so first as we said
earlier one typical example is the
digital transaction which is the Bitcoin
blockchain is used there already you can
use it any way literally so which is
having digital digitalization in their
transaction so for example the payments
information the digital security
information clearing and settlement
trading information supply chain
management gambling you can use it for
insurance you can use it for digital
voting you can even use it in the
medical field for the rnd
so that is how block blockchain works
and this is why everyone is talking
about blockchain
so I hope you understood what is
blockchain so blockchain is nothing but
a technology concept which with which
you can have secure transactions and you
don't have to have a central party to
verify all your transactions because
what
but party goes down right so that is why
you have a distributed ledger and if you
have a distributed platform where
everyone verifies everyone everyone's
transaction and if there are problems
that particular transaction will be
eliminated
so it is very difficult for an intruder
to come and modify a block because
everybody where it verifies their each
block and there are links between each
blocks right so that is why blockchain
technology is powerful and that is why
everyone is talking about blockchain I
hope you've got the basics of blockchain
right so that is all about blockchain
that's what I wanted to cover in this
particular video let me know if you want
me to cover in depth about Bitcoin or
blockchain in the comment section below
I'll do that hope you guys understood
what is blockchain hope that was useful
meet you again in the next video thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
