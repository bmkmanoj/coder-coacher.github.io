video we are going to see what is
history so his this is a good break a
pattern implementation created by
Netflix so what is that hystrix
so if you if you have if you see it his
sticks is a latency and fault tolerant
library which is picked up created so it
stops the cascading failures which is
happening in the complex distributed
system so for example if you see this
particular diagram we have a request
coming in to a particular process that
process delegates that I close to
another process that internally can get
here two different processes if you see
if there is a failure it has happened at
focus three that will get replicated to
cover two and that will in turn be
pushed to do process one so the failure
will be seen by the initial records
image that so you see this right the
failures are cascaded basically so from
the cost reach goes to pursue and then
it goes the first one so what is fixed
so mystics is providing a framework to
close this particular circular basically
you if let's say process three fails you
can close that error here itself and we
can handle that here it doesn't it it
doesn't cascade to the purpose one so
the failures are handled so basically
Olympics is a latency and fault
tolerance library which you can use in
your application so that you can make
your application resilient so mostly in
strict is used in complex distributed
system well the failure is inevitable so
you cannot expect that everything should
be always outside so there are so if
there are too many processes if
something goes down you should handle it
in a way so that is what it takes away
so let's see a typical example of how
you can write his checks implementation
so I'm using hystrix
scientistic implementation so string
towards a wrapper around the his tricks
so if you see here in the dependency of
the hydrat spring cloud strategy 6 so
this dependency is going to give us an
easy way of implementing místico we
have to add an annotation call enable
hystrix and then we inside the result so
for example this particular resource is
a rest endpoint which is going to call
another URL so what I
I have done is I have duplicated
equality applications inside the clown's
family so I have two applications so I
have instructed micro-services so one is
called a spring boot tech primers the
other one is called the spring hystrix
tech primers bring boot tech primers is
the one which has some user related data
so for example this particular URL have
this data so you can see here there are
three year olds in that okay these are
user details so I'm going to access that
via we hit trick so for example this is
the Mystics you are also DC here the URL
is rescue those his kicks so I'm going
to access the data why are they so what
this particular application is going to
do it's going to call this particular
process and then get the data so that is
what is happening here so if we see here
the first get mapping is red slash user
slash hit sticks this is going to do the
rift called to that particular URL so
the URL what I have posters I have put
inside the applications or properties so
this is the URL which it is going to hit
and it is going to get that data and
then push it back to the US or the
person who hit this particular
standpoint so if you see here it is
returning the same same way I have
created a normal method without his
shakes which is a general method which
is not the way to do anything it's just
a typical get get mapping and then you
are going to get the data from Venus
endpoint and give it back so it's going
to give a list of this party BC here
this particular method I have annotated
with a strict command so I am I'm in
providing your command key and the group
key and also I was providing this all
that method will be fallback method
which his stick is going to call when
something bad happens to this URL or if
some is this particular request times or
something happens to this particular
call so if you see here in de sticks all
that and just creating an empty list and
returning so that we don't casket that
particular errors till the request
initiated so let's see real-time how it
can be tested so let's say this is the
his six endpoint and we have the normal
users which is gender okay this
particular endpoint is the general input
so this is not using his fixed pattern
and this one is using is expired okay
now I'm going what I'm going to do is
I'm going to top this particular
application in Clark County
so basically this particular URL is top
so the springboard tech primers is top
now if I hit the red slash users it is
the general URL so this is going to
throw an error say for example he
rickety phone or foal not cold and then
we are getting in terms server error 500
so this is the typical example of
cascading exceptions which we saw so the
first problem is getting back the
exception whatever the second bus is
throwing okay so now let's see how he
sticks us spread so if you see here
these pixels return empty lips right if
you see here this is what has happened
right so in the code we have returned
the empty list if there is a fallback so
that is what has happened here a
fallback has happened we are and we are
getting the empty response so that is so
that is how it sticks work so see here
see to see here this application is talk
a little how this particular application
is calling this spring booth and it is
it has pain okay so that is the typical
implementation of how we can use hystrix
in our application but in terms of usage
it is it is mainly used in the complex
distributed systems where they have
multiple micro services or multiple
commands which are going out to
different sources and then if you need
to handle the failure you need to make
sure that it doesn't get cascaded so he
sticks helps in that case so that's it
for this video
meet your rain in the next video thank
