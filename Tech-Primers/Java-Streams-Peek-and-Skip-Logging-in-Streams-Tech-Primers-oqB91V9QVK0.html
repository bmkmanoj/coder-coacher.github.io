primers let's look at how we can use
peak and skill in the Java streams API
let's take an example of stream I'll
just do stream dot off let's have some
numbers here I'll just say 1 2 3 now I
want to do something over the stream I
just want to filter the stream
I just wanted to filter the objects so
let me just say object and I want to
filter only by 1 and I don't want one
let's do that so that we will get 2
values now I just do a collect and I
just collected it collectors don't do
list so zeros are coming because of the
Java 8 language right and I just set it
now should be going off yeah so what we
are doing here is we are using a stream
of 1 2 1 3 filtering it out saying if it
is not 1 then push it to the collection
and finally we are just storing it in a
collection
right we are just doing this now have
you ever imagined adding some log
statements you see what are all
collected inside the string so in
general I have seen people using
something like this
they just do logger they'll create a log
statement and then they'll add a log in
here so for now I cannot system without
println I'll people will say printing
and do this
and finally they will do a return here
so what we are doing here is
accidentally we are using filters to do
something else as well in order to do
this there are some operations which are
available in the streams API for example
piqué piqué is an operation which is
useful to peek in a stream so peek is
nothing but just seeing what's inside
the stream so we can use peek in order
to do this let's remove this
so we have this working right now if I
want to print the objects which are not
getting filtered I can do a peak I can
just do a peak I'll just get the object
and I'll just say system dot out dot
println peaked and the object so this is
going to print just the object and
nothing else this is not even a consumer
this is not even a terminal operation
this is going to be dependent on what is
going to be happening afterwards so
since we did a filter beforehand we are
going to filter out the one the value
one two and three will be printed
because it has passed through the filter
once the object is passed through the
filter we are just doing a peek if we do
the peak beforehand we'll be able to see
all the objects so this will be
especially helpful when you are doing a
print operation or when you are doing a
logging operation so let's say you want
to log all the values which are inside
these collection and you want to log it
before doing a specific operation then
you can use peek and notice that peak is
dependent on heavily on the next object
which we are using we are doing your
collect here so all the objects which
are going to be collected will be peaked
but let's say you're doing a filter
again or if you are having some other
operation then it might not make sense
for example let's say there is a count
if you're doing a count and then you are
doing a peak if you see in the Java 9
the API changes are done in order to
make it efficient for example if you do
a count it doesn't go through the
streams API completely so it just
doesn't go through the stream completely
if you just do a count
so in that case peak will never make
sense because peak is an intermediary
operation and the intermediary operation
will be dependent on the terminal
operation if there is no terminal
operation and if there is a terminal
operation like let's say count then
there is there is no guarantee that it
will work in the future versions of the
API that is why we should be very
carefully using the peak if we know that
there is a terminal operation coming up
next then it is better to use peak in
that case or there is no guarantee that
this peak is going to be executed so
this is how we can use peak in the Java
streams API
now the next new one which we are going
to see is skip so let's say I want to
skip two objects let's try using integer
stream I'll just say 1 2 3 let's say I
want to filter some values which are
based on let's say the greater than
let's say 3 or 5 let's say this filter
out objects filter out the images which
are greater than 5 before doing that I
want to skip some objects I'll just say
skip 2 so if this is going to skip 2
values from the stream the initial two
values from the stream and then the
filter is going to up get applied after
that so subsequently the filters will be
applied only from 4 to 7 so you'll be
getting only 6 &amp;amp; 7
let's see that right so I'll just do a 4
which so that we can print it and let's
run it so this should print only 6 &amp;amp; 7
because we are skipping the first two
values 23 should not be printed even
though it applies this particular filter
we should be getting only 6 &amp;amp; 7 because
we are skipping the first two if I just
keep one object then 23 should be
printed because we're just skipping the
first object in the stream so this is
how you can use Skip in these streams
API so we saw water speak so B can be
used when you are doing any peeking
operation for example if you want to
interrupt the stream and you don't want
to interrupt a functional operation but
you just want to log anything or you
want to print out something then you can
use peak in that case make sure that the
next operation is going to be a terminal
operation so that you can confirm that
the peak will be executed always because
there is no guarantee that the API will
help you in the future releases in order
to work
peek next we saw how to use skip how we
can skip different values on the string
I hope you guys understood how we can
use pecan skip that's it for this
particular video material in the next
video thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
