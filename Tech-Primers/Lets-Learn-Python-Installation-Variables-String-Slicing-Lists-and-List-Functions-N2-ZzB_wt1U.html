is to learn at least one more language
and I have started that I have started
learning Python
I just wanted to share whatever I have
learned today let's start off with some
funny comic strip I just came across
this particular funny comic strip in xkc
recom it just basically mocks Python how
it easy it is if you notice that guy one
says you're flying how the other guy
says Python so I just learned it last
night everything is so simple hello
world is just print hello one
I don't know dynamic typing whitespace
whatever come on join us
programming is fun again it's a whole
new world up here but how are you
playing I just typed import anti-gravity
and that's it
I also sampled everything in the middle
C cabinet for compiles it but I think
this is deep I think it's just a funny
me me I just wanted to share it because
I just came across it and I published a
little bit funny but yeah it is very
simple as it is setting this particular
meaning it is pretty simple if you're
starting to learn programming then
Python is a good choice that's what
people say I also I'm not sure about it
but then I saw the initial part of
Python it's pretty simple I have just
got the basics of Python I'm just going
to cover the these parts in this
particular video the installation of
Python printing the hello world program
variables strings lists and lists
functions let's learn typing
press the bell icon on the YouTube app
and never miss any update from tech
primers
the first part in the agenda is
installation of Python I have downloaded
Python and I have installed it already
you can download it from Python dot over
G slash downloads there is a version
available for every OS if you are using
Linux you can go ahead and download it
for Linux or Windows or either for Mac I
have downloaded the three dot 6.4
version I'm going to learn Python 3 or
6.4 basically I am going to learn Python
3 plus Python 2 is completely different
from Python 3 there are major
differences that's what people say but I
just wanted to learn the latest version
so I have installed Python 3.6 dot for
my Mac already by default had 2.7 but
I'm going to use only 3.6 now how do we
code for python there is a plug-in in
intelligent if you are already using
IntelliJ you can use the intelligent
Python plug-in or if you're not using
IntelliJ and if you are a new developer
you can go and install pycharm it is
also provided by gen trains it is
exactly the same as intelligent however
it is specific for Python development it
is completely lightweight and it is
extremely fast however if you are
already using IntelliJ IDEA for your
java node or UI related stuff then you
can install the Python plug-in like how
I have done
let's go ahead and create a small
project inside intelligent
I have the Python project here so you
know to get this particular option you
have to install the Python plugin if you
don't have the Python plug-in installed
you will not get this particular option
here in the create new projects window
and you'll be able to select the project
SDK so I have the project tree dot 6.4
mentioned here I have added the SDK so
by default IntelliJ identified that
there is a 3.6 version and it picked it
up however if it is not identifying you
can just create a new version and then
say add local and then add your version
of python there I'm just clicking the
next option here I'm just going to say a
Python exam basics one let me maximize
the window so that we don't have any
disturbance and if you notice there is
nothing here so the project got created
there is no folder structure nothing so
you can have your own folder structure
for simplicity let's create a folder
structure just for our coding preference
I'm just going to create a source and if
you notice here when I created the
source it automatically created a Python
script called in a dot here but we don't
want to do that let's create a new
python file I'm going to create the
Python file as example one the first
thing which you wanted to see is the
printing of hello world and let's try
that so how to print hello world in
Python it's pretty simple like how we do
system dot out dot println in Java you
can directly say print if you had worked
on groovy you can do print same way with
Kotlin similar being you can do that in
Python like this so we can just say
print hello world and let me run this
particular
and if you notice here the hello world
has popped up here the good thing about
Python is it is easy to learn and if you
notice it ran so quickly
so there are running time for Python was
quick because it did not have much of
the compiled times like the Java GBA
let's understand the variables so how do
we create variables
variables can be directly created like
this you can directly create a variable
and assign some value
you don't have to mention the datatypes
you cannot have variables with spaces if
you notice your IntelliJ is going to
complain to us and if you try to run it
is going to complain saying invalid
syntax so we cannot have variables with
spaces however you can put variables
with underscore and you can have
variables with camelcase as well
you
you
now how do we manipulate variables right
you can directly do that using
you can do variable 1 plus variable 2
you can do additions you can do
subtractions everything using this
option so what do you think will happen
here so I am trying to add a string with
a integer so what do you think the hell
happened here let's try it out as
expected
the compiler is going to complain saying
that integer and string cannot be
concatenated however we know that there
are some tricks which we use to use in
Java like how we use to use here that
also won't work because there is no
datatype mentioned because by default
whatever you assign that is created as a
data type here so you cannot use spaces
like this however you can merge two
different data types which are string
I'm just going to create a variable for
you can
you can merge it here you can add
additional strings that would work as
well see here it has worked so this is
how you can create variables if you want
to assign variables if you want to
assign same values to multiple variables
you can do that I can just say five
equals variable 2 equals hey you can't
do this that's it on this yep if you
notice here the tech primers got changed
to him so you can assign variables in
such a way that you can directly do a
equal to B equal to the value so this is
how you can work with variables now how
do we create strings and how do you work
with strings we saw how we have created
strings but let's see how do we work
with strings we had the variable called
variable 2 here imagine that this
statement is not there I'll just assign
pay to variable 5 so now I need to work
with the string tech primers I want to
print only tech so what do I do
I can do square braces mention from
which index I want to do a substring and
tell how many characters so in our case
1 2 3 4 I want to display four
characters so this is going to display
it so I'm just saying substring
let's print it notice here the substring
got printed so this way you can't filter
out these strings using the square
braces option so this is called slicing
so you can slice a string using the
square basis so now let's do another
substring however in this case I want to
print primers I want to print from
primers till the end so I want to print
whatever is there after H till the end
so I can just say one two three four so
I am gonna say that print me from the
fourth element so 0 1 2 3 from primers
so and I don't want the end because I
don't know the end so let's see what
happens now so the primers gets printer
because I wanted to slice from the
fourth element till the end similar to
how we did the slicing from the zeroth
element in the length as for here a bit
in new then then so we did not give the
length and Python prints the string till
the end so this is how you can do
slicing inside a string the next in the
list is lists how do we create lists
let's say I am going to create a name
list needs similar to how we came to the
variables you can create the list like
this I'm going to say Peter Sam Ryan and
Adam this is how we can create a named
list and let's print it right just for
our simplicity I'm just printing it and
this gets printed like this so how do I
print a specific person or a specific
index you can directly do this so this
is going to print Adam because he is in
the fourth index basically the third
index the fourth
similar to how we have in other
languages the index starts from zero we
are using three here to print ad if I
want to count how many elements are
there in this particular length there is
a method called length which we can use
to
get the length of the list so we can use
the length better and we can get the
length of the list so notice here we
have got the length of the Lester's poor
imagine I want to change the name of
Peter to something else I can do that by
using name list of
zero
equals
course
and let me print the list
see here the Peters name has been
replaced with Chris you can directly
change an index in this way if I don't
want to change Peter however I want to
change Ryan I can do this and it will
change the Ryan to Chris see that Ryan
has four changed to Chris so this way
you can change values in the list
let's say I want to delete some values
from the list so how do I do that so in
order to do a delete we have a delete
operation delete is an operation which
you can perform on a list so I'm just
going to say Dell name list so you can
delete on a nameless Dell is a keyboard
which is used inside Python so we can
say Dell name list and provide what
index do we need to delete so let's
imagine I want to delete the first index
this command will delete it and let's
print what is happening inside the list
so if I print this see that PETA got
deleted and we have the rest of the
names now if I want to print the length
of the name list I can do that
this should return three and we get to
be here so this baby can delete the
names from a list or an index from a
list
how do I find maximum and minimum from a
list so we created a name list however
let's say we have an age list we have
ages of different people so for Peter
let's say the age is 34 Sam let's say it
is 42 for Ryan let's say it is 18 and
for Adam let's say it is 60
so how do we find the minimum so there
are methods similar to how we had the
length method we have the minimum method
so we can find out the minimum of
ageless we can assign this to a variable
here and then we can fill in that as
well or if you want to run directly you
can just say print for simplicity and
for ease of use I can directly say
friend Max age list so let's run this so
this is going to return the minimum age
in the list and the maximum age in the
list see that the minimum age is 18 and
the maximum age is 60 this way we can
identify what is the min and Max in the
list there is also an option to identify
duplicates or the number of occurrences
in a list let's imagine there list
contains one more value for 18 there is
an option called count so we can do a
age this dot count and pass what is the
value which we want to and define so
this passing 18 this will return the
number of occurrences of 18 in the list
notice here we have got the value 2 if I
just say 30 this is going to return only
1 so this way you can identify the
number of occurrences from a list so
these are different list functions which
are available inside the list so those
are the basic stuff which I want to
cover in this particular video I hope
you guys understood the first thing
which we saw was the variable how do we
create variables this is how we create
variables we can hang the variables
without even having to mention the
datatype you can assign values to T baby
bills we can do a print so print is
similar to system but after printing and
in Java we can do obtained variables add
variables delete variables hi variables
it unsubscribe variables as well I am
not shown the substract option but
you can do that you can do division
multiplication they can also do
concatenation if it isn't string if you
just say addition and if you do the
string it does a come cognition the
other good thing about the strings are
slicing so you can do slicing of a
string by mentioning this so you can
mention the index of where the slicing
should start and where it should end so
this is nothing but the length of the
characters it should end at and this is
the index where it should start off if
you don't know the length of the string
you can make it empty and it will end
till the length or the end of the string
less can be mentioned using the array
format they can be extracted by
mentioning the index and if you want to
find out the length of the array you can
do the length if you want to delete an
element from the array you can do a
delete if you want to find the minimum
and maximum of an integer array you can
use the embedded tax functions if you
want to identify duplicates from an
array you can use the count so you can
identify the occurrences the number of
occurrences from an array using the
count so this is how lists work inside
Python I hope you guys learn the basics
of Python let's learn more concepts in
the next video
meet again in the next video thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
