talk about relational databases then
came the concept of no sequel databases
then there was something called document
database so it kept on growing databases
kept on moving ahead recently I heard
the term called time series database I
wanted to find out what is this time
series database and I went and I did
some debugging I just saw water time
series database and how it can be useful
let's see what is times these database
in this particular video
place the bell icon on the YouTube app
and never miss any of it from tech
primers time series database is a
database which is completely optimized
for timestamp or time series data what
does time series data mean time series
are simply measurements or events that
are tracked or monitored or in fact
collected or aggregated over a period of
time so these could be data collected
from heartbeats or even from motion
tracking sensors or collecting jvm
metrics from our JVMs
or collecting trades in the market
collecting network data etcetera
there are lots of analytics which can be
done with this data however if we need
to store this data we can store it in a
no sequel database or a relational
database but when we query these data we
have to have an index and we query that
right so here we can use time as an
index so time series database are
completely customized with time-stamped
data which is indexed and which has been
efficiently written in such a way that
you can insert time series data and
query those time series data much faster
than how you will be doing it in a
relational or no sequel database the
other key difference between a
relational or a no sequel database
compared to a time series database is in
the other database B query with values
of different data types however in a
time series database we ask questions
only over time so we just say the time
series database to give our data over a
particular period of time that is how
time series database always works on the
query dice up to a time date range which
it can query the other stuff which makes
the time series database completely
different or optimized or the way these
workloads are performed and how these
data psyche life cycles are managed or
even summarized inside these many
thousands of billions of records which
in turn
so the way the architecture works is
what distinguishes the time series
database from a traditional database
that is how it can perform lots of heavy
loads quickly and efficiently than the
relational databases so why do people
talk about these time series database
now right so why people are talking
about these now and why is it a new
thing now initially when the time series
databases were created they were used
for stock markets where people were
trying to solve trading information I
have worked on different investment
banks and I have seen people collecting
data and doing something with the data
so that they can identify patterns and
come up with a solution initially time
series database was used for that
purpose but later on the volatility
comes in to everything so with the
Internet of Things where we collect
every information every every second
thousands and thousands of data are
getting uploaded to cloud and companies
are collecting lots of information about
each and everything from where they can
analyze or get some efficient data out
of it so that is why time series
database has evolved where we are using
time series database to do lots of
monitoring stuff which are done over a
period of time the other reason is
everything now has become
compartmentalised monolithic mainframes
have got been replaced with serverless
architectures microservices containers
etc today everything that can be a
component is a component which is
individually independent and if you want
to monitor these components and make
sure that everything around this
component is all good we need to monitor
these and we need to monitor these at a
particular time as well so time series
database helps in monitoring these micro
services or collecting stats from these
micro services and from those stats we
can analyze and come up with patterns on
let's say for example how much is the
success metrics or how much is the
failure metrics or how is the prop
process behavior over time or when there
is a huge workload or something like
that so this is one example of using
time series databases but
you can use it for collecting weather
information for example satellites are
connecting lots of information and
pushing to the cloud at every event so
using that we can identify how is the
weather going to change over time etc
and as I said with the introduction of
Internet of Things every data is getting
collected the traffic information is
getting collected the data sources are
increasing and more and more these kind
of data are getting pushed into the
cloud and how do we efficiently query
these data that is when time series
database fits in so there are lots of
time series databases which are useful
for example I have just got a blog here
these are the some top 10 time series
databases which they are saying in flux
DB Prometheus or graphite from a theist
uses graphite I think so in fact people
use elasticsearch as a time series
database however it doesn't give that
much performance compared to other time
series database but still you can use
elastic search because it is still
efficient enough to retrieve data in the
form of time series data so how does
this time series database distinguish
itself from the relational database
right so time series database
architecture is designed in such a way
that they have different way of storing
data for example these data are stored
as timestamp data information and they
are compressed and the data lifecycle
management the summarization or the
aggregation is completely different from
how these are done in a traditional
database so that is why time series
database is able to handle huge amount
of information they can scan multiple
records at a time compared to a
traditional database so for example with
a time series database it is common to
request a summary of data over a large
period of time let's say for a for the
past six months right
so this records going through different
range of data points to perform some
computing operations right so that is
why time series database splits this
into different workloads and they are
triggered impact
so these kind of workloads are very
difficult to optimize for with a in a
distributed key-value store and time
series databases are optimized for doing
this use case in a given millisecond of
time there are some other use cases
where people use time cities database
for aggregating and storing these data
for example there could be data
collected for every millisecond and
these data's are huge if we collect for
every millisecond right so we can
compress or aggregate these data which
got collected as a part of a minute and
then they compress it into a meaningful
time range so that it can be used as a
trend analysis for over a period of time
because milliseconds of data might be
huge so you can compress that and then
store it for a minute or something and
then you can store it for more period of
time than compared to how we would have
stored for a millisecond data mostly
people try comparing time series
databases with Cassandra
MongoDB or HBase the major difference
between these are there is a quiet lot
of investment when we do Cassandra
MongoDB or HBase database however in
terms of time series data base the cost
involved is comparatively less because
time series database is equipped only
for time series data and it does that
job very well however the other
databases which I mentioned do something
extra additionally to what time series
data betas can do as well and the other
stuff about these databases is as a
developer we might have to write more
code in order to push these data models
in order to equip with the time series
information however if we are using a
time series database you can do that
out-of-the-box because it uses api's via
the api's you can read and write into
the time series database there are less
tooling is available with Cassandra
MongoDB and HBase in order to query
these data however time series database
provides all these complete tool sets
where you can insert and query data
using API Sun 2 links which are
available so that is it about time
series database I hope you guys got a
basic understanding of photos time
series database let's see how we can use
time series database in the coming
videos
I might even try to create a video on
prometheus I will try to set up
Prometheus in my system I am not sure if
I will be able to but I will definitely
try that and then we will see how time
series data looks like if you liked the
video go ahead and like it if you
haven't subscribed to the channel code
and subscribe to it meet you again in
the next video thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
