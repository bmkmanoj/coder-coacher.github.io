are going to create a simple spring
reactive application using the latest
springboard 2.0 2.0 okay right now cc
spring boot is in the candidate release
version so I'm going to use the m3
version of spring boot and this is going
to use this spring file which is going
to have lots of features which are
dedicated to the reactive streams and
the reactive wood so that is what we are
going to see in this particular video so
I'm going to create a small application
which is going to be exposing the
reactive end points right so that's what
I'm going to do so it's going to use
praying reactive framework so we are
going to see what are all the different
new classes which got created as a part
of this spring 5 or the reactive
framework inside spring so which is
called the reactive spring
okay there are documentation around
these the release notes and stuff like
that you can check that out if you want
to see in depth of what they are so I'm
going to cover some of the features of
the reactive spring in this video and
also I'll also create a series where you
can I will show you different features
of the reactive spring in which can be
used in different parts so right now
what we are going to do is we are going
to create a simple reactive service okay
which is going to connect to the MongoDB
and then we are going to stream the data
from the MongoDB to the clients end so
what we are going to do is we are going
to create a server which is going to be
a reactive server using spring reactive
it's going to emit some streams that's
what we are going to see so I'm going to
create a package to contact them as
reactive I'm going to name this as the
spring that a reactive Mongo so it's
going to use MongoDB so I'm going to say
react to Mongo example and I'm going to
name it as one okay so the dependencies
which we are going to use is we are
going to use reactive Mongo okay and
also we are going is reactive okay that
is going to use the spring dead flux so
we are going to see what is the flaw
so before that we will just create a
dependency so we need these reactive
Mongo on the reactive web that's it we
are not going to do anything so I am
just creating this project okay it's
getting open
let me maximize the window yeah so let's
go to the forum cortex-m one so that is
there we are going to see what are the
dependencies which are added as a part
of web slugs and the reactor Mongo so if
you notice here there are two different
dependencies one is called the spring
boat starter data Momoi to be reactive
so this is the spring MongoDB dependency
and the next one is the web flux so the
flux is going to have the new packages
which are packaged inside the spring
reactor framework so the flux is going
to be the framework which is providing
all those so let's go inside with
frequency water what do they have so
they have something called spring the
flux okay so this is nothing but the
spring the flux which you get as a part
of spring fine since the spring boot is
what we are using so we have a spring
boot starter with flux again it has the
spring bib by default so that is why we
didn't add any a spring give
dependencies because this is going to
bring the spring web dependency by
default it has hibernate it has a neti
now you can use a neti server for
running your application so spring boot
is going to help you in running your
application inside neti aspect so right
now spring both witty reactive is the
first application or the first framework
which is going to support unity
although the box so let's get started so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create some services so I'm going to use
some port so by default I'm going to use
some port as eight zero eight two let's
say right so I'll go ahead and create
some resource so let's start from the
resources that so we start so we will
create some rest endpoints which we can
expose right that's what I am going to
do here so I'm going to create a Java
class called employee resource right as
usual I am going to use the spring MVC
kind of notation so I am going to use
the rest controller and I will just say
this request mapping and I'm going to
say employees right press slash employee
so I'm going to say red slash employee
so what we are going to do is first
let's do a get mapping and then I will
just say give me the list of employees
right so here what do we do in a
traditional stylist we used to do this
right so we just say get on in a
traditional spring MVC application what
do we do we just say this and then they
return a list of employee so in the
Mongo in the reactive word what we have
is something called mono okay and
something called flux flux so it's not
getting deducted so let's go ahead and
check mono alright so meanwhile show
fluxes and so if you see here mono and
flux are two new what do you call the
two new interfaces if you see I think
it's abstract class so sorry for that so
mono is an interface if you see it is
implementing from the publisher so mono
if you will use mono when you want to
return one data out of the reactor
stream so that is when you use moon okay
it cannot accept any attached and there
are lots of methods inside this class so
you can use the if you are using or if
you are using a data which is going to
return only one element then you can use
mono okay so that is when mono is used
even if it is a reactive stream mono is
used where you will have only one finite
element okay so flux is something
similar to mono but it is going to
return multiple elements so if you are
using mono you will have one element and
if you have multiple elements to be
written then you use flux so in our case
we notice in the resource what we need
is a flux in this case right because we
are going to return stream of data okay
you are going to return a bunch of data
so that is why we need a flux okay and I
am going to create a model called
employee so let us create the model I
will just create it under model trust
model package so I am going to use the
MongoDB so I am going to annotate it
document okay so this is going to get
converted into as a document alright so
one of the viewers requested me to use a
long book so that I do not have to
create getters and setters so what I'm
going to do is I will create a string ID
so I'm going to create some ID so I'm
going to mark this as ID for identifier
right and I'm going to have a string
employee name I'm just going to say name
and then I'll just say salt right okay
and the salary is going to be long so
you can see here I had to create greater
than Saturday so I don't have to do that
when I use a Lombok library so long
Lombok is a compile time annotation
processor so I'm going to use Lombok
okay
Springwood by default has it so I'm
going to just use the dependency so that
I can use Lombok here so what I get with
Lombok is I can add annotations and the
logbook is going to create the getters
and setters for me so if I say all
argument constructor is going to give me
all arcs constructor okay
so I'll just show you I think my
intelligence not detecting why is it not
detecting things because okay so yeah so
if you notice here I have added the all
acts constructor and it is detecting
Lombok so this is going to create a
constructor with all arguments okay and
also I'm going to say I create me an aux
constructor it is going to create an aux
constructor if you just say getters and
setters it will automatically create a
getter and if you say setter it's gonna
create a setter
if you want to display the two string
you can just say to string it will
automatically create a two string if you
want to do equals you can just say
equals and hashcode so it is going to
generate a equals and hashcode so so if
I see here I have just added annotations
and I have not added any of the methods
so you will be able to access the
getters and setters here so if I just
say a new employee right and if I just
say see this notice here all the Gators
have come by default okay that is what
Lombok is doing so it is a compile-time
annotation process if you notice here I
have not written any of the Gators and
setters but it has already created the
getters and setters for us so that is
what long Bock is doing so you can use
Lombok it is very good if you don't want
to write boilerplate codes in Java right
if you see other languages they don't
you don't have to write like Scala or
Copeland or groovy you do not have to
write those code but in Java if you want
to use those features you can use Lombok
for that okay so let's come back to the
reactive world so if you notice your
flux is what we saw so it is going to
written as the list of seen so I'm going
to return flux so in order to do that I
need an employee repository right so I
need to create a employee repository so
what we are going to do is we are going
to create a field called
employee depository okay we need to
create this class because they are not
created it so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to create this class under the
repository okay
I'm going to run today today I'm going
to implement this class okay I'm going
to implement this class from the Mongo
reactive repository so Mongo reactive
repository is a sorry reactive Mongo
repository so that is similar to the JPA
repository like how we were using but
this is specific to the Mongo database
that is what we external external right
so we added a dependency to add the
react to Mongo so that is what we are
doing here and when we create it it's
going to be extends here because it's an
interface and we need to pass a POJO and
also the primary key so in this case the
primary key is the string right so the
rate a type of the primary key so I'm
going to pass employee which is going to
be the podium which is going to be
stored inside the Mongo database which
we created few minutes back and the
primary key is going to be a string
right okay so we have created our
repository now I just need to inject
this so I'm going to adding it as a
constructor to allow string to use
constant injection now the fun part
begins right so we have created the
repository and now we need to return all
the data from the repository right so we
can do this so you can do a fine dot and
this is going to return a flux so if you
see here inside the reactive thread
repository so this is equivalent to the
JPA repository which we had so
previously we had a JPA repository which
had lots of functions but spring has
created a new set of repositories which
are named as reactive and it they are
under the reactive folder so I
accidentally click the Safari it's going
to kill let me go to the project
structure if you notice here the
reactive crud repository is another
reactive package okay so and there are
some other interfaces so previously we
had jpay repository under different
package now we are having the repository
active repositories and a single package
because the return type needs to be
either a mono or a flux so that is the
reason why spring has created new sips
of repository so that we can use them
with the reactive framework so it is
here all the methods are annotated with
mono or
let's go to the resource so what I have
done is I just simply is the fine doll
and this is going to return a flux so
done right so we don't have to worry
about it now we need to add some data
into the database right so what I'm
going to do I'm going to create a
command line interface Rhonda so the as
you guys notice right so spring has a
way to inject a class which is going to
do something for us before even anything
start so there is something called
command line Runner and I'm going to say
add some employees into that okay so I
am just saying that add add some
employees into the monk or a position so
we have to inject the monk or
repositories I'm just saying employee
repository right since it is a
repository it will get by default
injectors but it will get injected
before the command line so in the
command line Runner so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to use this employee
repository right and I need to inject
some data right so before that I will
delete all the data from the database
because if let's say for the second time
if I am running the rate I would have
got injected into the head of it but I
want to clean them up right or else it
you get accumulated again and again
whenever I restart the server so I need
to do a delete all so before the
reactive world we always just do a
delete on and gets deleted right but in
a Mongo world if you want to do a delete
all you have to do a delete all and in
order to know that the delete operation
is successful you have to subscribe to
events so you have a bunch of subscribe
methods here you have to subscribe to
subscribe to these events to identify
whether they are done or not so what we
are going to do is we are going to use
this particular notation there you are
going to subscribe to D so I'm going to
say employee
so this is going to subscribe if you go
to let's go to the function so if you
notice here
do you have three different arguments
the consumer the consumer which is going
to throw an error the consumer which is
going to be successful the final
consumer which is going to say that okay
this has got completed and this is going
to be a runnable so it's going to run in
a separate thread if we see here there
is nothing here right so that's what we
are going to do here we are going to use
a we are going to use the eternal the
completed action so that basically means
once all the delete operation is
completed this third function will be
con so basically whatever we write here
it will be called so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to save the data into
the database right so before that I need
some list of employee names right so
what I'm going to do I'm going to say
stream dot off so that I'm going to
create a list of employee details okay
so I'm going to say a new employee right
and I'm going to pass the the ID first
so I'm going to say create some random
user ID right and pass the name as Peter
and the salary yes Nate when is 300l all
right so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create something similar for
each of the employee so I'll just
annotate it with like Flecha for
employee I'm going to create Sam but I
am and Chris okay so with different
salaries let's say okay
and it is going to create new different
IDs so random UID generator is going to
create a new ID now what I need to do is
I need to strain these rates so I am
going to stream these and using for
which so I'm going to say employee ok
for every employee do something from
right so I'm going to remove this so
using the employee repository you need
to save it save the employee right so
I'm going to say save the employee right
so once I do a save employee I want to
print that in particular employee day
right so what I need to do is I need to
do is subscribe now you can see this
save operation is a model again right so
once it is saved now what we need to do
is we need to iterate through the
employee repository and then we want to
know whether it is completed or not
right so you don't know whether the save
is complete or not until you do
something isn't it so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to do a subscribe so
that I know that the data got persisted
so I mean in this case I'm going to use
the single subscribe so that I know it's
got completed so and what I'm going to
do is I'm going to say employee ok this
is going to be a different hundred so
I'm going to say EMP and I'll just say
system dot out dot println write and
print the employee for me right so if
you notice here
can be replaces measure of console just
replace this with method so what we have
done here is we have I traded through
the list of streams for every stream
save that into the repository and print
that out so that we can know that it is
done right so and before this what we
did is they deleted all the data from
the repository and once the delete was
successful they are going to perform
this operation so this basically means
they are injecting data into the Mongo
database after the data has got deleted
so this is the way you have to use the
reactive framework so you how to do is
subscribe because this is going to be a
mono okay so if you are getting a mono
or a flux you have to do a subscribe
because they are all it's all publishers
so you have to subscribe to get the data
once it is published and you can consume
that so this is how you do reactive
programming so you have to subscribe and
they get the data and then work on it
okay so that's what we need to do so we
are done with the command line runners a
one-line run alright so apart from that
what else do we need
alright so we need to write some more
rest endpoints so we added for all so
let's add for a specific ID date so we
need to give a specific ID so I'm going
to add a rest endpoint for a specific ID
but this is not going to be a mono this
is going to be a flux edge is it going
to be a mono because I need to return
only one employee so I am going to
create a moment here and I'm just going
to say employ positi dot find by ID
right and I'm going to pass the ID so
here what I'm going to do I'm going to
use a path variable because it's a path
variable and I'm going to say employee
ID right that's it
so I which is created another question
point now these are all basic rest
endpoint set it's just going to return a
list and this is going to return a
single value so I need to create a rest
endpoint which is going to return me
stream of values so that is what a
reactive framework is going to do for a
set that's what spring is claiming that
they have done some reactive
implementation so what we have to do is
we have to create some events so these
are going to be reactive events so what
we are going to do we are going to say
get message mapping I'm going to create
a something called as events so you need
to pass an ID so what I'm going to do
I'm going to get the ID and I just say
ribbons right so that I will get some
events for every ID so and this is going
to be a list of data so I'm going to
pass this as flux okay so get even and
we have a pathway table so if you notice
here I need to pass the first variable
ID just posit the same here and just say
employee ID so now we need to return
some data here so this is the fun part
ID so we are going to do some reactive
programming here I need to return the
stream with a delay right so I want to
create some delay artificial didn't so I
want to introduce some artificial delay
so that we will be able to return data
from the database okay so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to create the
employee repository and then say find by
ID and I'm going to say it employee ID
okay so this is going to return data
right so what this is going to return
just going to return a flux isn't it so
this flux they are now going to use
something cloth flatmap meaning so what
we are going to do here is we are going
to get the data of a particular employee
and then we are going to create a stream
out of the data okay so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to wrap the timestamp
to this data which we are going to send
it send back to the user
so for that I need a different pose oh
so because that in that pose I need the
time hazard so in the database I am
storing it as employee but I need to
store date as well so what I am going to
do is I'm going to create one more pose
oh okay so I'll create one more simple
poses so that
we can use it for transferring the data
right and I'm going to use same Lombok
so I'm going to say I forgot to mention
one thing you have to mark the mark the
annotation with the data so that you
don't have to add the Gators and setter
so if you don't want to add the getters
and setters you just mark it as data
right and I'm going to say or logs
constructor I'm going to say in orgs
constructor and we don't need the
document because it's not going to be a
Mongo structure right so I'm going to
say employee and I need an employee and
also I will just have the data object
right because it's going to have the
date so that is it so I don't I need
only two values one is the employee the
other one is a 10 so let's go back here
so we just said that okay we are going
to create a new object and that object
is going to be that employ event and
that is what we are going to do here as
well so we are going to return an
employee event only okay which is going
to be a flux which is going to be a
different data model at different Bojo
so we need to create some artificial
degrees rate so in order to do that we
need to create a separate flux for that
so in this case what we will get is a
employee okay we will just create a flat
map stream using the flat map mini so
before doing that we need to create a
flux rate we need to create a flux of
interval so let's say the interval is
long okay I'm just going to create a
artificial delay inside the flux inside
this particular reactive stream so that
they can see the real a synchronous
programming of reactive programming
right so I'm going to say duration okay
so how many
seconds do we need right someone and
save 5 seconds or let's say 2 seconds
right so I'll just say 2 seconds now
this is going to be a flux so this flux
is a interval which is going to return
the data every 2 seconds ok so this is
going to return an interval every 2
seconds now we need to create another
flux so this is the flux which we needed
so this is the flux which we just
created right so we need to create an
employee or event of flux so I'm going
to say employee even flux equal to so
and I need to create a stream of flux
right because I'm going to create a
stream using the flag map because it's
going to create a stream so what I need
is a flux stream so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to create using the flux
tour from stream function so I need to
create a stream ok it is going to be a
flux stream so I need to do that before
that I need a stream right so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to say streams
or generate again I'm going to create a
new stream so I'm going to create a new
employee event where I need to pass the
employee and also the date right so that
is what we said we will have interpose
oh so I have created a stream of
employee event which is going to have
the employee and the date so what this
is going to is going to introduce
artificial delays for every 2 seconds
and there is two separate streams now
and we need to merge these two streams
into one stream when we are sending it
out because if you want to introduce
artificial delays this is how you have
to do in the reactive world you have to
create a separate flux for each and
every event and then we have to merge
these two ok so what we have done is we
have created a flux here so we have
created a flux for the interval and also
the flux for the employee event now we
need to merge these things right so we
need to do something called zip so if
you see here there is a method called
flux tourism and we need to zip these
together so we need to zip the interval
and also the employee even flux so we
need to zip these together and we need
to do it in a different page so we need
to do these zip and I don't care about
the interval value right so for example
how this else is you have two different
rest endpoints and you're calling two to
Pinterest and point
which are going to return the data
asynchronously and also you need to zip
these together and then sell it back to
some other person right so isn't it back
to some some other call it's that is
when the zip is used so you have to have
two separate fluxes and then you can zip
them together so I'm going to have
interval and the employee even flex but
I don't care about the interval because
I know neatly data from the interval so
I'm going to say use the data only from
thee so let's see what this guy gives
right so this guy is going to create an
object and if you see here this object
is going to be a function but when I
just say the when I didn't select this
let's see so when I just said this right
so it was it was giving me some solution
if you see here it's going to return a
function of type pupil - okay
and it is going to have a long and
employee even flux which is nothing but
the type of interval and the employee
even truck so this is going to have an
object called pupil and it is going to
have the data for the long and the
employee and we need to written only the
employee vent right so what I need is
the second part right so if I say
objects like how it suggested I and this
objects if you see here I have two
things here in the objects get T one and
get T 2 so T 1 is nothing but the first
flux T 2 is nothing but the second flux
and this has extract of the object out
and if you see here it's just a longer
than the employee went there is no flux
involved here so I am going to return a
map which is going to return me only the
employee even ok so that is what I'm
going to do here got it
so I'm going to zip the interval and the
employee went flux and then I am going
to map it saying return me only the
second object because I don't care about
the intervals that is all it is right so
I can remove this return statement and I
need to I can treat a replace this city
lambda reference reference
implementation so what I'm going to do
here is
I'm just saying at all okay so this is
so that this is going to return the data
to the user so where is this getting
closed so this is getting closed here so
I need to return this guy right okay
so this is going to return a flux of
employee stream and I am returning the
zip object okay so what I am doing is I
am zipping to to some stream
one is the interval stream one is the
employee event stream where I am just
stamping the date here so that we can
see that in the in the server side of
the from various pushing calling it
right so that is all we need so we
wanted to show how we can write reactive
stream so we have written that here and
that is s right that's it before that I
I need to start the Mongo DB instance so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
start the MongoDB I have already
downloaded MongoDB here and it is in
this particular path I have unzipped it
okay I'm just going to start it right so
this is the command I just have the
amount Cody come on okay I'm just going
to start it in this particular part okay
looks like the server has started let's
start our process as well so this is
going to do an insert of the data into
the Mongo database right with this
particular employee details first it's
going to do a delete and then it is
going to insert the data and also add
some sprint along so that we can see
what it did and also we have written
some rest endpoints here so that spring
can use the reactive reactive API so
that is what we are going to see and
this the reactive framework is coming
from the reactor project okay from
spring so that is what we have seen so I
am getting some compilation error so
what is it saying employee in the class
cannot be applied to the given type no
augs
so this is saying where is
but why is it throwing another it's just
okay I think I added the North North
constructor right so I just need to
remove that I guess yeah so here also a
dozen or so I just remove this and I'll
just start it so if you notice here the
error was received at the compile time
right
that is what Lombok does so what is this
actual in the format length differ so
what is Lombok saying cannot be applied
to string string long so isn't this long
it's a long right so why is it
complaining both of strings isn't it
let's go inside and see so it's a string
string and long isn't it okay so I have
a long object with what if I do this it
I'm still getting some arrows cannot
find the desserted ah okay the Lombok is
killing me
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
skip the Lombok and screw that and I'm
going to use our usually get as and sit
as well I don't know I don't want to
deal with the Lombok right so I'm going
to create all the Constructors myself
I'll just add a twisting as well so that
we can see what is getting printed so
here here also I will just remove the
notation just quickly add some getters
and setters and also I had added to
construct them okay so that is it so let
me quickly restart the process hopefully
the bottles in complaint right now so
yeah so did not complain
so let's see what happens yeah so our
connection with the MongoDB database is
getting established and if you notice
here the rate I've got inserted and that
is why it got printed so that is what we
did here right so data got inserted so
good to see that and everything is
working so a repository is working right
because it is using the repository to
purchase the data and also the objects
are all working here so whatever
employee object which we were using
right so now we need to hit the rest
endpoint to see whether they are all
working via the source so this is the
spring MVC type of a notation for using
deep reactive steam so I'm going to use
the UI so the port which we had is 8 0 8
2 but also I'm going to use the red
slash employee slash owl so let's see
what happens yep so the data has now
reached our UI so see here we have the
ID we have the name we have the salary
as well so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to use this ID to retrieve this
particular data so I have a rest
endpoint ID so we are going to check the
mana as well so this should return a
single response yep it is working and
the last and the final one we have
created a list of events right so it is
going to return us events of data right
so there is one thing which we missed I
think I just remember that if I see here
we have created this so this is going to
be a list of this is going to be the
content type for this particular
response is a JSON right so they all
these three are the adjacent because by
default that is what it is but however
for this event I need to use the content
type ok I need to use the content type
streams right so I'm going to use the
content type text stream value right so
this is going to return a stream of
value so I just forgot to mention that
because we are returning a stream of
value right that basically means you
have to tell the receiver that this is
going to be a stream of value it is not
going to be a static value right so that
is why we need this producers
Media type as text even stream so that
this resistant point behaves like a
stream so that is what I have done here
so I quickly restarted the JVM so that I
can just show you how it is done right
so let the server come up and we will be
having new IDs so I'll use one of the ID
so that I can show you guys how to do
that so I'll just quickly pick one of
the ID and I'm going to add it here and
then see if it is working yeah so it is
coming Peter and I am going to add the
slash events rest endpoint so this
should return a stream of data for us so
if you notice here there is one row and
if you notice here after two seconds
there is one more row so the delay is
being added in the backend up you see
here I am NOT refreshing the page but
still the data is coming from the
backend so this particular page is now
like an event stream right so I just
show you with a inspecting the browser
so that I can show you what is the
response which we are getting right so
let's stop this and then I will refresh
this so that comes from the beginning so
if you notice here the status of the
events list point is 200 right so the
status got successful but still the data
is coming so that is what the event
stream does so it is going to use the
data frames so if you see here the data
is still coming in but still we didn't
do a refresh and the status of the rest
endpoint is already okay right so this
is what a reactive programming does for
the server so we are pushing a text
stream and it is going to behave like a
stream so it is going to get the data
whenever data is available so after the
artificial delay of 2 seconds we are
pushing the data so that is why we got
after those seconds if you see a date
and the employee object is received here
okay so this is how you create a
reactive resistant point where you can
push data in the form of reactive
streams right the form of streams
basically so in the India generalized
what equal to media type we call it text
event stream so that is what we added
finally right if you don't add this
produce text event
Street this is going to return only one
data right because it will become like a
normal restraint point since we are at
the media typist xt-1 stream so the UI
knows that the browser knows that okay
this is going to be event stream I I
need to just keep it alive and the data
will be pushed to the UI whenever it is
available right so this is how we create
a simple service or the server-side code
in order to create some reactive data so
that you can push the data
asynchronously all right so the reactive
programming is all about a synchronous
data push so you can use this type of
approach to push data a synchronously so
one more thing to know about reactive
streams I don't go for reactive streams
always so if your the framework or if
your project or the product is not able
to handle a synchronous programming they
never go for reactor program because if
you are going to have your core reactive
you have to do lots of checks and you
have to make sure that you're even
processing is all perfect right so that
is why I don't suggest you guys to just
like the jump into reactive programming
know the limitations of reactive
programming and go for reactive
programming only when it makes sense so
don't just blindly jump into it just
because somebody told that okay they are
working on reactive don't blindly jump
into it because most of the time they
tend to do that right somebody is using
something cool and we just say that okay
fine I will also go ahead and use it
right don't do that just know the
limitations of reactive programming and
then start off with reactive program
right so this is what I want to show in
this particular video so there are some
different functions which got introduced
in the spring 5 framework so right now
what we did is we wrote a traditional
spring MVC style rest endpoint right I
will just show you how to do that in the
outer functions which spring has created
recently so which is coming as a part of
spring 5 so that we will be seeing in
the next video so I am going to create a
similar example I am just going to
continue with this particular example
it's in so I am going to just remove
this particular employee resource or I
will just come on this employee resource
and I will just show you how to create
routes unction from the same code so we
are just going to create instead of
writing this particular restrain point
here we are the resource or there
controller we are going to see how to
use the router functions which are
coming up in the spring 5 framework and
see how that is different from the
normal traditional spring MVC style
because many people don't like this
particular style but I like this
particular style
so I'll just show you in the next video
what is that router some sense you can
check what is the router functions and
then if you feel router functions are
better than the string and AZ style you
can go ahead and use that so that's it
for this particular video me jog in the
next video thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
