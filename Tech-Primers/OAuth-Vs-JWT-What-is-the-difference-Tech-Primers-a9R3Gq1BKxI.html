and never miss any update from tech
primers welcome to tech primers in this
particular video we are going to see the
differences between our two and JWT some
of you guys have requested me to make a
video on this particular difference so
here we go so o2 is what we are going to
see first so imagine this is the whole
workflow of order so imagine or two is a
framework so over through is nothing but
a framework there you need to do some
authorization and authentication let's
see how does or to test that right as a
framework so imagine your resource
server is your third-party application
or the client where you are long going
to login so the client is what BR and
authorization server is something like
let's say a facebook login or a Google
login so most of the sites when you log
in right for example if you log into
Trip Advisor of glassdoor.com it asks
you to log in via the Google account or
the Facebook account right so imagine
that the Glassdoor website or the Trip
Advisor website as the resource server v
as declined and authorization as the
Facebook or the Google API so initially
what we do is we just open the glass
door website that is what a is we send a
client request to say that okay
authorize me so by the time the resource
server asks you how should i authorize
you how should I grant you permission
based on which API then you say that
okay
I will be using Google so that is C so C
is going to get redirected to Google so
when you click on the Google icon it
genuinely goes to Google website and
then once you log into the Google
website you will be prompted an option
saying do you want to allow this
particular application basically the
glass door or the TripAdvisor
to allow it to use your information
so and you say that granted so you say
elaborate so what happens is Facebook or
Google they send a access token to the
resource server so they send that access
shortened to glass door or the
TripAdvisor website saying that this
particular user can be authorized when
this particular access token right and
that will be now receiving the resource
server okay once it is received in the
resource server now receive the
authorization needs to be done right so
resource server will now record saying
okay give me all the user identity
details and then the authorization
server sends it there so server and the
authorization server will have its
communication already because they will
create a third party API the secret and
the public key so that Facebook knows
that okay glass door is a client for
Facebook and then they know that okay I
need to give you the correct information
so that that is an additional step which
it happens and finally once all these
authenticate city is like verified the
glass door up set allows you to log in
with the username and the email address
which you had used to log in to the
Google account so this is how the whole
earth to work so you can see that o2 is
a framework so it has this kind of
specific setup where you request the
request to the request goes to the
authorization server from there it comes
back and then it goes to the resource
over and stuff like that so this is like
a complete package so it is a complete
framework so that is worth two so now
let's see what is JWT right so Jade
ability is nothing but JSON web tokens
so basically tokens just the part of
what to write you saw what we did here
there is a token which is generated by
the authorization server to be sent to
the resource server so that it can use
that for any subsequent calls or
something so that is the token right so
same way Jerry ability is just a token
it's basically a protocol with which you
can use authorization and authentication
so basically you can see what does the
use case here so we just do a login we
give a username and password to the
server the server validation that okay
this username and password correct and
then it creates a token which is called
the JWT so which is using the Jade
ability protocol to create a token so J
is just a protocol with which a token is
created it's nothing but an encryption
mechanism or something like that to
create a token and the token is given
back to the user or the client from the
client it is going to use the same token
again and again for the next subsequent
request so that is it so this Jade
ability is just a part of the
authentication mechanism if you see in
what we had a whole flow how an
authorization of authentication happens
but in case of Jade ability it's just a
token which the server sends to you so
you if you have a application which is
that going to be very simple and then
you just communicate with the server
straight in a straightforward way then
you can use JWT to just have a simple
mechanism if you are having a third
party application you want to authorize
somebody based on some Google or
Facebook account which they already have
and you don't want them to create it in
your website or something then you can
go ahead and over to where you can just
delegate the authorization to the third
party and then basically the
authorization server basically the
Google Doherty case books and then you
can based on the grants you can use the
token generated by Google or Facebook
and then you can use that for
authenticating your clients so that is
the basic difference between o2 and Jane
ability hope you guys have a good
understanding now what is water and what
is a ability basically or through is a
framework and J TT is a protocol okay
that's it for this particular video if
you liked the video go ahead and like it

go ahead and subscribe to it meet you
again in the next video thank you very
