session we are going to see what is
spring data and what are the different
frameworks which are provided by spring
inside the spring data say P see here
these are different frameworks which are
existing currently inside the spring
data and this in this session we are
going to see these things JPA and the
rest which is nothing but the spring but
so the different or the other other
stuffs are spring data core neo4j
Couchbase Jim fire MongoDB Vegas key
value pairs key value stores solar
elastic search and Cassandra so spring
data provides a framework or spring
provides a framework inside spring data
for supporting all these stuff so and in
this session we are going to see what is
spring GPA and the spring it so JP is
nothing but the Java persistence API
so using this GPA we directly position
to the data beans we can retrieve data
from the database this much less hazard
so I'll show how it was so before going
into that we need to create a sample
spring booth application so I'm going to
show this demo using a spring booth
application so we can implement the
spring web and be springing jba inside
the spring booth application so I'm
going to create a sample application
from this print initializer from starter
Springs Ohio
so I'll just given the group ID artifact
so for the dependencies we need to
mention what is an SDC need so we can
directly mention the dependencies and
those will be added into the form butter
caramel directly so in our case we need
the spring whip which is going to give
these spring MVC and displaying that we
need the JPA and also we need ds2
database so we are going to put the data
into the sto database so has choosing
memory database which Java provides so
we will be persisting the data via the
Jaypee into this page to deposit so you
can click the generate button to
generate the project I have already
generated and opened it so you can see
here this is the example fresh project
it is there so inside the bomb you can
see we have these dependencies for the
h2 that start as web is there the thing
we're busy displaying data JPA is it so
that's it so let's get started so I'm
going to create a new controller
so the
we create a package called controller so
alcohol goes Buzzbee user controller so
the annotation which will tell spring
that okay this is the res controller is
the others control so this will tell
spring MVC that okay this is the
controller and it is having a rest
endpoint so now we need to give a
mapping so in that case what we do is we
add annotation called request mapping
and then we till spring MVC that okay
use this mapping to configure into your
and the mapping so we are we have
greater than users so that is the rest
controller so now we need to add a
method right so we need to let's say we
are adding a get method so I'm going to
do a get method here and also I'm going
to say that the path for does it all so
what happens is this will be another
mapping under the users which will be a
gate ok and I'm going to say give me all
users ok so right now I am not
implemented anything so there is other
way to implement this request mapping
inside the method level so we have
something called get mapping which will
directly do a get so we don't have to
pass the gate argument here like how we
do here so here I'm going to use that
because that's the latest what spring
provides so ok now how do we get the
data from B database so we will have to
create a repository so ok today
depositing and there is a method called
find all I will show you what it are
data so we are creating it user JP a
repository shall create a field called
user JP a supposedly
and will create that now so and this is
going to be an interface so I will
create this in under the repository
package so map this as a component so
that we can Auto wear this here so we'll
do an auto wise
so that I can inject the controller
directly without creating a new instance
oh and now what we need to do you need
to extend the JPA repository which is
provided by strings so here what we are
going to do is we are going to pass the
model which is the user and then we are
going to throw ID law which is nothing
but the ID okay now we need to create
the user model so create this under the
model package let's do not okay and this
is going to be an entity which spring is
going to use so I'll create this as an
entity so if we mark a particular pose
Oh has an entity spring we'll use that
for JPA or the hibernate if you are
using hibernate already you might know
that you use entity for hammer type that
so spring data uses the same of notation
so let's go and create D value so I'm
updating something already create name
team name create something called salary
okay now I'm going to general D in the
dirt for this there will be generate
options you can go to sleep
very cool okay
so what I am going to do is I'm going to
create the Gators and little okay so
these are the Gators and setup sorry so
these are the getters and setters so now
we need to marks the ID as ID and I am
going to generate these values by
default so I'm going to say generate
these are so generated value so what is
spring gonna do is it's gonna generate
an ID for every users value okay
which means so now let's go to the
controller we have it as well okay we
can directly edit of this so what does
this find all doing so find all is a
method which is implemented in the
spring JPA repository which will give
all these records from that particular
database using this entity so whatever
entity we have defined in Syberia user
JPA repository it will use this model to
get all the records from the database
okay so in our case we are going to use
h2 so it will take everything from that
so if you go to the user user controller
you see it this is going to do all they
require zombies that it is for that
particular entity so now we need to
create one more so that we can get
specific users so I'm gonna say I'm
going to say that if I give a name give
me that particular user and this is
going to be 0 right so find by name and
an order so there is a pot variable son
gonna say path beautiful Kingdom and
then we can use that so we need to find
by a name right so we don't have a
weather so ideally I create a method and
I can do that what I'm going to do I am
going to create this particular method
let me create this matter in this so
what this is going to do spring JC is
going to by default convert this find by
name into a Quay
so it what it does is it just creates a
query called collect a stick from user
name equal to that particular name so
that is what spring is going to do by
default is go to convert this particular
find by name into a query so this is the
string notation which we have to give so
that JPA can't directly created okay
okay so let's go back to the controller
so we have created a specific phone now
we need to load the data right so let's
give a post mapping so that we can load
the data into the database so load so
I'm going to create the code I'm going
to call this load okay
and also we need a we will be providing
a request body right so we have to mark
that as a request body so that this
annotation will help us in mocking the
data which we are providing as a body so
what we are doing is we are going to
provide user users model so that we will
load that directly into the database so
what we are going to do here is using
the repository we can directly say that
the you do is say and then give the
model it will directly save that into
the repository or the database and what
we are going to do is we are going to
return by using Sun we are gonna do a
find by name so that we can directly see
if it has got inserted or not so when we
do a load this is going to do a save
into the repository and then we are
going to find it again so that we can
return it back to the user
okay so let's get
start okay so I think that that we have
everything for us so did I miss anything
anything so AutoWorld whatever it stuff
and read a method okay that's it let's
go and start this over
so I'm going to start the spring boat
service so this is going to start this
application in the Tomcat and then we
will have a first endpoint so let's see
let's come up
let's go to the browser so we have a
local host 8080 I don't know if it has
come up yeah our application has come up
so if you see here let us come up here
the collisions come up at the 8080 code
what I'm going to do is I'm going to say
user slash all nucleated alright so that
is going to give us a little return int
row so there's nothing but there is
nothing right in the database currently
so we have not inserted in DHS so it's
giving in and terrorism so let's load
some data right so so I've already
created a JSON data here so that we can
load it so I just hit the send button
I see weather doesn't notice okay so I
read I see the response here if you see
the response has got an ID along with
the details which I passed so this is
the model which we have it the users is
modal which we had ID is what code
generated so now let's go back to the
new one and then hit the same users all
okay see that so we have got the data
now so what we have done is we have
destard the all part and we have dusted
the nose part let's just be named part
so directly querying by name so what I'm
going to do I'm going to give that a key
here right yeah and see if it is
attorney yep it is returning let's say
if I put any wrong value so I just say
wrong to not return anything here I'm
not getting in at it okay so that is
bringing jda so things appear is the
what you call the intermediate layer via
which you can query the database persist
into perfect eita into the database
retrieve them with a simplistic approach
so as you see here we are not writing
any select query or anything you just
directly lose the JPA repository and
then you can directly save the model you
can just use the model that's it
that is brings APA and the spring MVC is
used by the stress controller for the
string data rest uses the spring MVC and
these are the different annotations
which helps us in creating a simple
correct endpoint in just the or equality
with like 30 lines of code we have
created a database we can query the data
we can insert the data we can retrieve
data so that that's it for this
particular session so meet you guys in
on a decision thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
