blockchain technology why don't we try
creating a blockchain using Java
basically a custom implementation of a
blockchain let's try creating a java
application which can use the blockchain
technology concept now let's see how we
can create that in the next few minutes
let's get started
press the bell icon on the YouTube app
and never miss any update from tech
primers
I have my intelligent open right here so
I'm going to create a new project I'm
just going to create a basic Java
project
let me try creating an Avon project from
the archetype I'm going to name it as
comm tech primers blockchain and the
artifact idea is Java blockchain example
I'm going to use the existing maven
which is bundled with the project so I'm
going to name the project name is the
same let me finish it let's open it
okay we have our IntelliJ open here let
me maximize intelligence so that we get
to destruction people and our project is
ready here so I have a source main Java
I don't have anything else right now
here so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create a so by default I think
the class name is created as my mojo so
I don't want that particular class
instead I'll just delete that class and
I'll create a new class called
blockchain example
right so we have the class ready so we
will have a public static void main
where we are going to create all the
necessary coal meanwhile vini took
create some stuff what do we need it as
a part of the blockchain creation so
what is a blockchain if we recap what is
a blockchain blockchain consists of a
block which can have hash of the
previous block and the transactions and
these are chained together that's why
it's called a blockchain right as simple
as that so what do we need is a block so
we need to create a block I'm going to
create a block so as a part of this
block we need the hash of the previous
block so in our case we are going to use
the hash code so we are going to use the
hash function the hash code function for
creating the block so I am going to name
it as previous hat and finis a
transaction right I'm going to create a
transaction and this is going to be a
list of transaction and we're going to
call it as transactions now I'm going to
create a transaction class as well so
this transaction what do we need in a
transaction so I will say private string
source destination
and how much is the money let's say
right in our case let's consider a
Bitcoin case as simple as that we will
have a source you have destination and
we are going to say how much money you
want to transfer let's say we are more
there's some right and I'll create a
constructor which has all these I will
to create some getters and setters done
for the block we have to do the same
thing we need a constructor
we need guitars and settles
now let's go to the blockchain example
so we have created the block which has a
previous blog so let me do the creation
of block so now we can create the blocks
the first block in the transaction will
not have any hash function right so
because it won't have any previous block
so we won't have any previous half
instead we can call that as a Genesis
block so I'm going to name it as just
the first block and I am going to create
the block as 0 for the hash and I'm
going to pass that transaction so we
need to pass a transaction so create a
transaction new transaction
so let me get these things out so what
do we need in a transaction let's say
Peter is sending Sam a money money you
might say 100 right he's sending 100 and
this needs to be sent right this name it
we sent us it on watching and we need to
have this is a list so we can use lists
so what did I use away here we can use a
list what I will do is I will just
commute it as goodness
you
so that it is easy force so it can be
anything it's just going to be a list
like it can be any type of collection I
I prefer list over arrays
you
you
so we need to create multiple
transactions so let's say learn from one
injection - I am going to say I am
sending it in to plan
some thousand so I'm going to say array
is dot as list of transaction one and
transaction
now this is just a block so how do we
get the hash of the previous block right
so how do we get the hash so we can use
the function called hash code this is
going to print the hash of the block so
hash code if you remember hashing in D
hashmaps hash code will have a unique
number every time you create a block it
will have a unique number so when we
have custom objects so for example in
the transaction whenever we create a
transaction they do not override hash
hash code right so every time you create
a transaction you will have unique
hashed code so in order to have the same
hash code every time you can overwrite
the hashcode method so you can override
equals and hashcode if you notice here I
am just saying override it so my hash
code is created every time the same hash
code will be created every time whenever
I create a different object so let's try
printing the hash code right for
so I'm gonna bring the hashcode here
just for showing how how's that
different rate and create new
transaction be the same
but the hashcode should be safe
let's not do this let me run this
program so this is nothing but the hash
which is used inside a block so in in
our particular case we are you going to
use the hash code but if you want a
custom implementation of something else
you can write your own hash code so in
our case we are going to use the hash
code implementation and you notice that
we are using the hash code and since the
values are same the same hash code is
generated right for a particular
transaction however in the block you
have different transactions so I'm going
to use the transaction 1 and 2 in the
first block and what we are going to do
is we are going to create the second
block and in the second block we will be
passing the hash of the first block so
that way if a data changes in the first
block let's say the transaction 1
changes the subsequent block will be
altered because the signature has got
changed basically the hash code has got
changed so I'm going to say first block
dot cash code comma a raised dot I'm
going to have only I'm going to have
only one transaction which is the
transaction 3 so I'm going to say this
for simplicity let's try and see what is
the hash code right which is generated
let's remove this because we know what
is that and
second block tautological so let me run
this program so you will notice that I
am passing the hash code of the first
block to the second block that way this
hash code is dependent on this so if you
notice here this is the hash code for
these now I'm going to modify thee so
let me put a command here I'm going to
modify the transaction one which is not
related to transaction which is not
related to block - so if I modify the
first block the second block needs to be
modified as well needs to get modified
as well because the hash code is
different if you notice here it did not
get modified this is because they did
not over I the hash code of the block
method so we need to go to block and we
need to override the hash code so we did
that for the transaction however beta
don't do that for the block so we need
to go to D block class and then we have
overridden the hash code now if I run
this it should change right so that is
what I expect because they have changed
the transaction to be different so if
you notice here I have run it and the
transaction is different now let me
modify that again and then see whether
it is changing again
yep it has changed okay okay notice your
the hash codes are different so this is
how we have created a block so a block
has hash code which is nothing but a
digital signature and that particular
blocks digital signature event we used
in the subsequent block so if I create a
third one if I create a third block here
I have to use the hash code of the
second block and I can use the
transaction number for if I create this
I'll just create transaction number four
where I say Ryan is sending it into
Peter
I'm gonna say this third block so this
is how you can create blocks oh these
are blocks are basically just a POJO
so how do we link these blocks we need
to link them using the digital signature
which is nothing but the hash code in
our case so that is why we are passing
the hash code of the previous block to
the subsequent block that way every
block is tightly coupled with each other
and if you want to modify one block you
will go through the whole chain so if
you modify the transaction in the first
block it gets modified in all the blocks
that is why you cannot modify a single
block inside a block chain then these
are chained together you cannot modify a
single block because all the blocks
needs to be altered because the hash
functions are different whenever we
modify the data inside a block so this
is how you can implement a custom block
chain in Java if you want to do that in
JavaScript or Python you can follow the
same method you can create a block what
we have done is we created a block the
block had the previous hash which is
nothing but the hash code and the list
of transactions what would that were
matching consists of the transaction
consists of shows the station and just
the sum and you have two over it the
hash code because we are not relying on
the JVM to create the hash code we are
relying on our custom implementation to
use the variables which are in the
transaction and also we need to do the
same for the block we need to overwrite
the hash code and we need to use these
two so once we do that we create the
hash code using the hashcode method and
we need to link that in the subsequent
blocks whenever we create so this is how
you can create block chain using Java I
hope you guys understood how we can
create a custom lock chain in Java I
hope you found it interesting
mate again in the next video thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
