are you planning to prepare for one in
this particular series we are going to
see most common problems which are asked
in companies and we are going to solve
that problem let's get started with the
first question which is all about
solving the increasing longer suffer if
I press the bell icon on the YouTube app
and never miss any update from tech
primers
this particular question has been asked
by Cisco Facebook Ola and Bloomberg so I
have just chosen this problem because it
was more common let's discuss that and
then let's see how to solve that problem
so the problem is longest increasing
subsequence or longest increasing
sequence in an area so so the problem
statement is longest increasing
subsequence upper so let's take a simple
example let's consider this as our input
3 4 5 3 2 4 7 &amp;amp; 6 so if you notice here
3 4 5 is 1 suffering 2 4 7 8 is 1
suffering so these are different sub
arrays and we need to find the longest
length of an increasing summary so 2 4 7
8 is the longest length the solution
would be the answer for that will be 4
so we need to arrive at the solution for
write what are the different solutions
we have we need to consider the time
complexities what are the different time
complexities we have for this particular
problem so we have order of n because we
need to process the whole array 1 so if
we process it once it is order of n if
you process it twice then you will have
order of n into order of n which will be
order of n power right which is order of
n square if we process this element
twice then we need to get order of n
square so which is a bad practice so we
need either of the order of n because
that will be like an ideal solution
where you have the elements processed at
least 1 because we need to find the
longest increasing subsequence once an
order of also we have order of n login
we cannot use it because the elements
are already sorted for example binary
search uses order of n log n we cannot
use the binary search because we are not
sorting the elements it is already
sorted the other time complexity which
we have is order of N or of 1 sorry
so which is ruled out because we don't
have a single
operation to be performed to identify
this particular longest increasing
subsequence one so this is our feasible
time complexity which we can achieve so
let's see how we can achieve with that
by writing a solution so I have a basic
cradle project here so there is nothing
fancy I just created a new basic project
which is just a Gradle project so I'm
going to create a class here so I'm just
going to create comm tech primers
longest increasing sobbing
even the class name is long nice okay so
we just create a simple public static
void main I'll just create a integer
array right so I'll just create the
array saying new and with the elements
so let me copy the elements of the array
just paste it so that is the array for
us so what do I need I will create a
start pointer I'll create a end pointer
so that we can track the whole array as
a separate so that we have control over
the index and also I will have a
variable with which we can store the
length of the array which is maximum at
that point of time so I'll create start
end and then let's assign some default
values so the default value for length
would be 1 because by default you can
have only one element as well right in
an array so I'll just make it as length
as 1 the end can be 1 and start can be 0
so that I process them in a sequence so
I'll start off with 0 and 1 so I'll use
while loop in my in this particular case
because I don't need to start using the
index instead I'll use the start and end
point errs so I'll just use the while
loop the first basic check I will do is
if the end is less than the array arrays
length it should be less than that is
end up in the array index out of bounds
exception so I'll do that and I need to
increment the end every time right so I
will add that name what do I need to
check I need to check if this particular
element is greater than this particular
so I need to check if the array of n is
greater than the array of n n minus 1
right so if let's say this is the start
and this is the end I have to check
whether these two war whether they are
greater or not if this is done then I
need to check these two so start will be
stuck here so I can use only in so I
will just say n minus 1 that is why I am
using n minus 1 instead of directly
using start because start and end can be
at different points in a particular
array at some point so I'll do that if
it is not if it is not greater what do I
need to do I need to just reassign start
right because I need to skip that
particular element so let's say start
and end or here
and if this particular element is
greater than this element then I need to
skip this and then I need to make this a
stop right and then I need to increment
them so that is what I am doing here in
the else part it's simpler now in fleas
gator what do I need to do I need to
compare if this particular length is
greater than this particular length so
I'm going to check that if the end minus
start right plus 1 so because we we are
starting with 0 so I'll just add 1 if it
is greater than the length right so what
i'm doing here is end let's say this
particular end is 1 1 minus 0 ok plus 1
is it greater than the end so 3 and 4 if
it is if 4 is greater that means it
comes inside this particular loop and I
know that this length is now 2
so I need to increment the name so I
need to reassign the length test end
minus start last one
so did you get that point so what i'm
doing here is once I cross this
particular element and if it is greater
I need to check if the length of this
particular element which is the end is
it greater than the length of the one
which we already had basically the
default length so the default length was
one in case of in our case the start was
started with zero so we had to increment
it as one okay so that is why we are
incrementing it here as one so that the
length gets matched off okay so now I
think the solution is done let's see the
output right so I'll just print them
then let me run this so the output which
we expect here is four yeah the longest
increasing subsequence four right I will
also upload this particular project into
github I hope you guys understood it let
me know if you are not able to
understand I just took this solution
because it took this problem because
this was used or this was asked by Cisco
Facebook Ola and uber and also by many
of the employees that is why I took this
particular problem so I upload this into
github you can take the solution from
github as they do let me know if you
have any question which I want which you
want me to make which way you want me to
create a solution and then post a video
on I hope you liked the video meet you
again in the next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
