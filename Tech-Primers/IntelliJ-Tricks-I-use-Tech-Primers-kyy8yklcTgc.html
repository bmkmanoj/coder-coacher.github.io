six years now do you want to know what
are the different shortcuts plugins
settings and the intelligence which I
use daily let's see what are the
different tips and tricks which I use in
my day-to-day life with IntelliJ
press the bell icon on the YouTube app
and never miss any update from tech
primers for getting into the video let's
check what version of IntelliJ I do have
so that you can relate it to whatever
version I have so I currently have the
community edition 2017 dot 2.7 which was
built recently so I I just installed it
yesterday and I am just showing the
shortcuts which I am been using in this
particular version there is also a 2018
edition of EAP
early access program which is available
you can try that as well there are some
more features which are specific to
spring and Java 9 and lambda expressions
and streams
those are pretty useful but I specially
use 2017 dot 2 version till now so I
haven't started using 2018 version yet
let's see the different shortcuts which
I use let's go through the default
shortcuts which are mentioned here one
by one and let's see why I use them or
how I use them the first step is double
shift I use double shift when I want to
search something in the IntelliJ but I
don't want to go there by using my mouse
the typical example would be double
shifting and then searching for
presentation assist when I am doing
presentations I just use this
presentation option and I just say
toggle presentation and you can notice
that the IntelliJ is now zoomed in this
is basically the same presentation mode
which we have in IntelliJ you can go to
a view and you have an option called
presentation mode so we are enabling the
presentation more automatically by just
using the double shift option now let's
say I want to exit the presentation view
I can just do the same again I just did
the double shift and I just said
presentation and I'm just going through
the toggle mode and then say okay exit
the presentation window so this is very
helpful when you don't want to have
anything visible in your screen except
your code so that will be helpful when
you're showing some intellisense code or
when you are typing something for a
specific set of audience I'll show the
presentation mode in a while when I am
showing intelligence so that you have a
clear idea of what I am doing
with presentation and how you can use it
the next one is command one so command
one is useful when you want to open the
projects which is there in the left side
you can go and do that by our mouse but
if you do that why are the shortcut it's
much faster see that how quickly I'm
just toggling the project's window so
when you are opening a specific file and
you want to see the project's window you
can do that the next option is going to
a file so you can use the shift command
and oh in Mac they were relevant command
for the windows is command control shift
+ n so you can notice whenever I press
the shortcut you can see something below
that is the presentation assist there is
a plug-in installed for that I'll just
show you when I come to the plugins
section but for now the shortcut for
opening your file is command shift + o
and you can see different files which
are shown up here it shows all the files
irrespective of the language it could be
Java it could be groovy it could be a
zip file text file you see that it shows
everything so the shortcut was ctrl
shift and Oh for viewing all the files
the same shortcut can be tweaked to just
view only the class files you can just
do command o or ctrl n and just see the
class files alone see that it just shows
the class file it doesn't show dot Java
because this is B going to just search
for just the class files and it can
search for the test files as well that's
what you can see here it even searches
for the test file and if you just go
there you can just get into the file
directly in order to close a particular
window we just go and close it here so
let me open a file and I will do a
command W this closes the particular
file which is just open in order to go
to the recent file we can do a command e
if you do a command E or ctrl e in
Windows it is going to show the recent
files and you can directly go to the
file which you have opened if you want
to close this file you can do command W
and if you want to open a reason fine
you can do command E if you want to open
a recently edited file you can just do
command shift and E so this will show
the recently
edited files so let's try editing your
file and let's see what happens let's
add some piece of code here I'll just
add a null check I just added a null
check nothing else right so this is a
recently edited file if I just close
this file I'll just use the shortcuts
command W let me open ctrl e or command
e this shows up all the files which I
had recently opened but if I do a kernel
command shift and E or ctrl shift and E
it shows only the edited file if you see
that
singleton endpoint configurator has been
edited and it shows up only the edited
files so if you want to quickly navigate
between the edited files you can use
ctrl shift and E or command shift and E
and if you want to see all the reason
files you can do a command E or ctrl e
so this will be very helpful I use it a
lot because when I move to different
files and if I want to quickly move
between files I just use command E when
I want to quickly navigate between files
right so let me close everything the
other shortcut which I use extensively
is command shift and E if I let's say I
want to search for my font size I can
just do that using this option control
shift a I can just do a search for font
and if I go there it directly takes me
to be option where it is present so it
is present in the settings window under
the editor font so it directly takes me
there so we can use control shift a for
that if let's say you want to do
presentation mode again you can do
presentation mode here you can go here
and do it I'll just switch it off for
now so control shift a is going to
search across intelligence inside
intelligent double-shift is going to
search everywhere
I can even search the if you notice here
there is a run configuration here I have
a run configuration person which is
called the dashboard you can even search
that using this search everywhere but
with the control shifting you can search
anything inside IntelliJ the settings or
anything which is present inside
IntelliJ where you don't know where it
exists so that you can do let's say I
have lots of stuff open and I want to
have a clean window so if this is my
option right so let's say I have these
many windows open and if I want to have
my windows closed all my windows needs
to be closed so in that option you can
use ctrl or command shift and eft-1 so
this maximizes the file and removes all
the windows which were present so if I
just press that again it will just go to
the same state and if I just do that
again it just goes off so you can remove
these if I just have this also open
right some get sometimes this happens
right you have too many stuff and then
you have to manually do this one by one
instead you can do command command shift
left one or control shift f12
in order to remove all these options the
other one is let's say I have too many
files open and how do I move between the
files in that case we can use the
command and the open brace where it just
moves to the left command and rise base
right one move to the right so you can
use ctrl alt and right in Windows
however if you are using it in Mac you
can use command and left arrow sorry the
left open brace and command and right
open brace for moving to that particular
file and you notice that there are too
many tabs here
sometimes I even disable the tabs so
what what I do is I go to settings and
then I go to editor tabs and then I
disable it so you can have none so that
way the tabs won't even show up see this
side there is only one file here if I
just open multiple files it will just go
to that file and it won't even show that
in the tab so if I need to navigate I
can just use my shortcuts which I have
been telling you so that is another best
way of using IntelliJ if you if you want
to have clear and concise view of what
is happening then you can disable the
tabs unless or until you want to
manually navigate through the mouse it
is not productive now coming to the team
settings which I have I have currently
mapped my key map to
the OS X 10 plus 5 you can have anything
mapped so if you are in Windows you can
use that as well or if you are in a Mac
user you can use the Mac one or if you
are coming from Eclipse you can either
use Eclipse one or the Eclipse for Mac
or you can even use the Emacs or
whatever genome you are coming from but
by default if you are using Mac OS is
10.5 plus it has lots of key maps and it
is pretty good so that is the setting I
use currently the color scheme is
Dracula theme so I don't use in here the
theme here but I used to use blue for
esteem at office so I have the blue
forest theme which will have a black
background with a blue blue fonts and I
have customized it for my need so you
can even customize every text color
based on your need so you can do that as
well
how do I use intelligence so
intelligence is another way of reusing
stuff which are already present inside
intelligence for example let's try using
some intelligence right there is a
variable called full tweet and if you
just type dot it's going to suggest some
stuff and let's say I want to do code
point that I can just do see a and it
just shows character at and if I want to
use the code point I could have just
said CPA so this way you can directly
use intelligence from IntelliJ
out-of-the-box and if I want to let's
say to a null check on this particular
object I I used to use dot null and then
I press tab it automatically converts
that piece of code into a null check if
I just say not null I want to check not
Nullah you can just say not not and you
can do a tab it automatically does he
not much let's say I have an object
comparison so I'm just let's try doing
this right I'm trying to compare two
objects and now I need to rub this into
a loop I decide that after I do a equals
check then in that case you can do a dot
and you see bunch of options which are
there so you can use this to create this
code out of the box so you can just do a
if and then do a tap and it
automatically creates the if loop if you
want to be an else case and exclamatory
case then you can do a else so if I want
to have an exclamatory in the front and
then do it I can just do a else and then
do a tap this gets automatically
generated you can do the same with a try
block you can just do a dot try and
automatically get that piece of code
enclosed within a try-catch block so
that is another way of using it so I use
these kind of shortcuts or intelligence
which is available inside the utility
itself same way with a search you can
just do a dot assert these are different
options which are available by default
and it shows up what is there so if you
see here if you want to do an optional
you can just do opt and then you can get
the optional out-of-the-box so which is
very good when you are a fast typer and
you don't want to go back and front and
you don't want to use your mouse at all
so that is when it is extremely helpful
yeah
stubs are reusing this code so I don't
use control-c control-v I can I use
command D which will just replicate the
line or duplicate the Rhine the other
thing which I use extensively is the
terminal option here I extensively use
this terminal option when I want to do
something in the terminal for example if
I want to run any MAME and tasks I do
that here it is griddled so you can just
say griddle clean something like that
like in this doodle so you can do that
from the terminal you don't have to
navigate to a separate command prompt
you can directly do that here if you
want to commit some get you can use that
or in fact you can even use the version
control which is inbuilt from the
IntelliJ why not open the version
control from the intelligent you can
directly do a control V which will take
you directly to the VCS options the
version control options you can directly
do a push or you can do a stash and
stash whatever you want in fact you can
even compare it with the same repository
version so you can do that there without
even having to use the mouse you can
directly go to this window using the
shortcuts so you can use control V and
directly go there same with a show
history options you can directly use the
show history option and see who has
modified this project
the other intelligence feature which I
use in IntelliJ is with respect to
streams let's try searching for a file
and I'll show you how I use streams i
leverage intelligent for that so let's
say there is a list right see this is a
list which has sessions and I need to do
something over the stream and when I
want to do something I just rely on
IntelliJ to see what options they have
and looking at the interfaces here
notice that filter gets a predicate
supplier gets a collector for each gets
a consumer so even though if you don't
know what is a consumer or what is a
collector or what is a supplier you can
leverage that let's say I am doing a
peak and I don't know what it is doing
so I can rely on IntelliJ to just say
new consumer so that it automatically
writes the code which the consumer has
and now I can just write something
saying
is open is secure I'll just print this
so I'll just print this now that I know
it is going to get printed I can just
use this option alt enter to replace
this into a lambda so you don't have to
know the lambda expression exclusively
so this is the way where you can start
learning lambda expression you can just
do a new consumer write the code inside
the implementation and then finally
allow IntelliJ to replace that with a
lambda so this is a much better or a
cleaner solution when you are starting
off with lambda expressions so I used to
use it extensively now I am comfortable
with what is a consumer what is a
predicate what is a function etc so I
don't use it but you can generally use
it a lot so what are the different
plugins I use so I generally use the
markdown plug-in so markdown plug-in is
when you have a readme fine and I don't
think it is there here the other thing
is I use the git plug-in to get ignore
plugin which will automatically ignore
the keyed files and you can see what are
the files which are getting excluded so
this shows up what are the files which
needs to be excluded and we can't
configure that so then there is a
plug-in to this right so I have a
plug-in for that the other thing is
sooner lint
I used sonar lint when I want to track
violations in the code you can run this
one arlynn plug-in to identify the
violations which are present in the code
without even having to check after the
build is exceeded so you can locally
check the sonar violations using sonar
lint here the shortcuts which you see
here in the below the option which shows
up the shortcuts what kind of shortcuts
I am using the this particular option
right so that is nothing but the
presentation assist so there is a
plug-in called presentation assist and
you can use that particular plugin I
will just go to plugins
this is the plugin which I'm using the
presentation assist this helps you in
showing of the different options when I
am writing some shortcuts so if you are
working or presenting something to a
wider audience you can enable it so that
people know what kind of shortcuts you
are using or it is even helpful when you
are doing pair programming when the
other person wants to know what kind of
shortcuts we are using there is even
lots of customizations present in the
presentation assist so if you go to the
presentation assist option you can see
that what kind of key map can be
assigned so you can assign a key bap and
it shows up automatically same way the
alternative key map also shows up so you
right now I have configured it for
Windows and Linux that's how it shows up
you can reduce the font increase the
font align it whether to be shown in the
left right or Center or even in the top
so you can do all these customizations
in this particular plugin so those were
the different plugins shortcuts
intelligence and the theme settings
which I use I hope you found it
