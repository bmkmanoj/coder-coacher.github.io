are going to see what is groovy and how
is it different from Java and Cortland
and other jvm languages right so
recently if you know groovy has been
moved into the Apache ecosystem so
that's why if SAT website is now named
as Apache groovy so you see that here so
previously it was under the code horse
now it is moved to Apache okay so let's
see how groovy is different from other
jvm languages
the groovy website is that it is
powerful
optionally typed dynamic language so if
you hear about dynamic language it is
similar to JavaScript so you know that
in JavaScript you won't face issues at
compile time but you face issues or some
time so if in a way blew away something
similar so you want to be able to
completely make a sense of everything at
compile time because it is a dynamic
language and it works on the concepts of
reflection so it does the reflection
which our so imagine Java working with
reflections right so how tedious is that
so
groovy works in the way of reflection
and it was created before before even
Kotlin was born right okay the other
thing is the static type and Static
compare it has static type and static
compilations with compilation capability
for the Java platform aimed at improving
developer productivity thanks to the
concise familiar and easy learn syntax
yeah so the syntax is exactly same as
Java and it looks similar to Python a
little bit but if you don't know how to
write something in groovy you can
obviously you can write whatever you
know in Java so it supports whatever you
write in Java aspect so that is a good
thing about learning Ruby so if you are
learning groovy you already know groovy
so if you already know Java you know you
know groovy almost because you can use
whatever you use in Java inside a ruby
script just that you need to know a
little bit of preliminary stuff before
starting the groovy coding right so
that's what we are going to learn in
this particular video okay
another thing the other good thing about
Groovy's groovy had the closures and
lambda expressions before even the Java
8 world so before even functional
programming was introduced inside Java
so the lambdas and stuff came in to Java
8 so groovy created at beforehand so
even with Java 6 in Java 7 we were able
to create lambda expressions and
closures from groovy so you can write a
Java code inside Ruby which was using
lambdas and closures even though it was
running in a Java 6 entire set
Virtual Machines okay so let's go and
get started right so that's what we
wanted to see what how does the GUI feel
like right so I'm going to create a
small project with which is going to be
a gluey project and I'm going to show
you what you can do with Ruby so I'm
going to say groovy
it's asking me for the global library so
meanwhile I'll just to let's create the
program let it open so if it is still
not able to recognize groovy so we will
have to download the groovy library and
then include that library here ok so we
have the project ready so let's go and
create a simple groovy script right so
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to create a simple groovy class ok
before that let's make this project it's
nothing if nothing is there in this
project is not even a maven project so
let's see if it works out to creator did
we create a new Java class so I'm going
to create a new groovy class so you know
to that I just create a class saying
this dot group ok so yeah it looks like
the groovy hdk is not set up so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to quickly
download the groovy SDK right so from
where do we know that so there is a
download option here so you can download
the groovy library so I'm going to
download the SDK here ok so I have 2 dot
4 dot 12 which has got distributed so
I'm just going to download that SDK so
I'm just saving it ok meanwhile
you can also install from the command
line
if you are using a command line group
interface but since I'm going to use
IntelliJ intelligent is the groovy
library so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to give the the SDK for the groovy
to kick the kick start the groovy
classes okay so where the where will we
be using groovy a few frankly asked me I
have been groovy used I had been using
groovy for the past four to five years
now so we used to use a test cases
improve so we write tests in group so we
have Java classes which are in the each
other source code and then for the tests
we write them in groovy because it saves
lots of time so if you are considering
writing a Java test which is like more
than two hundred lines of code in groovy
you can write it in 50 lines or maybe
even less with less lines of code so
that is why we started using groovy and
now if you see the latest frameworks and
stuff which are coming up for example
pipeline as a code so the Jenkins
pipeline it's all using groovy DSL
okay so DSL is nothing but
domain-specific language so Jenkins is
using a custom DSL for creating the
pipeline so you can create your own DSL
for creating a pipeline okay so you can
use that from groovy so groovy has this
concept of DSL same way if you see
Gradle Gradle is almost arrived from the
groovy DSL okay so if you're familiar
with Gradle which is equivalent to maven
in our java ball turret for packaging
the jars and wires and stuff like that
so great deal is something similar but
it is more powerful and it is returning
the groovy DSS so it's much you can you
can ease it to it for much of you if you
don't have to learn the XML format like
how we do and even so that is why it is
called DSN so domain-specific language
there it is user friendly as it so save
a groovy as well so that's what we are
going to see now so yeah the SDKs
downloaded now so I'm going to unzip it
let me quickly go and unzip it
okay son Jigme let me go to IntelliJ and
now let's configure the library vault it
is that's what it was asking but I you
know yeah so I'm going to say groovy I'm
going to use the library to fourth well
that's what paid is right so we don't
know the to fourth wall library I just
unzipped it and I have just given the
library for IntelliJ to setup the SDK so
like how we had set up the Java SDK we
need to set up a groovy SDK as one
because that is the main code which is
going to convert the tower the groovy
code into the bytecode so basically a
groovy how it works is you create a
groovy class so that class is going to
get converted into a bike or ultimately
like how Java gets converted into
bytecode so groovy is also getting we
need to convert that also in the
bytecode so Berube is going to do that
in case of a project like how I was
mentioning right so being we're using
both Java and grooving the same project
then you can use a groovy compiler
plug-in to compile the groovy classes
along with the Java package so you can
use that in conjugation with Java okay
so let's go ahead and get started so I'm
going to start writing some groovy code
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
show you how we can write the different
types of code in Google like whatever we
do in Java
so in Java what do we do we write a
public static void main to create print
a hello world right
so in groovy you don't have to do that
you just say println and you just say
hello world so this is going to print
hello world for you right because the
groovy is going to convert this
particular X into a class so brooby
knows that okay there is no class
defined here and it will wrap
automatically this particular line of
code into a class and inside a public
static void main and there is going to
get executed over the box okay and since
groovy does everything by reflection so
it is little bit slower than Java
because it is going to do all the
reflections and it is going to scan all
the libraries if you had too many jar
it's going to scan everything so it is
not recommended to use the production
for with Clube but you can write the
test code or you you can type some some
other stuff into it but there are many
people who use groovy and in production
as well but you know the pain of using
JavaScript right in production right
it's a dynamic language so you will have
the same pain in groovy as well so if
you notice here the hello world got
printed we just didn't mention anything
we just in mentioned class we just
didn't mention public static void main
but still you can do that as well so
blue is not going to complain about
anything right so you can say let's
start avoiding and I'm just going just
for a more this particular piece of code
in to the function so this is also going
to get the same result so this is the
Java traditional great but you can use
this way as well but you can use not
really groovy residence so if you notice
your intelligence suggesting me that
there is no need of public because
everything inside groovy is public so
because it works on the principle of
reflection so it is going to expose any
everything right so that's why we don't
need to declare anything it's probably
right so that that also works okay so
this is how you create a normal groovy
class okay so let's go ahead and now see
how to create variables and stuff so you
can do def okay so you can do def and
then assign let's say what is the name
so you can now eliminate like ticks on
us
and then you can just print it this
works so you can do this as well
so in Java what we wrote down is you
wrote down this way rate should have
done like text timers so I think it
organized the string as also if you
notice here it did not give any compile
time errors because it doesn't know that
at compile time okay if you notice here
both these are seen and if I have to do
a integer okay they say some version
number right I say version equal to one
right here I can say silver gin equal to
one so I don't have to define any
different data file so I can use the
same data type called X right so that is
a major difference so you don't have to
type what is whether it is a string or a
integer or anything else so that's why I
say it is similar to JavaScript because
in JavaScript also you use a similar
kind of saw method you use var instead
of two okay
and if you notice the major difference
between Java and here is there is no
semicolon you don't have to mention
semicolon semicolon is connery okay so
this remove this so now that we saw what
is this so how do we define methods like
so we can define methods in the same way
you can say public static but public you
don't have to mention because it's
groovy so you can mention let's say I'm
going to create a traditional test
plastic I'm going to show you how to
that method so I don't have to do this
so let's say I'm going to create a
method called start right he started to
like semicolon because I'm used to Java
yeah so you don't have to do that so you
know to create a method you can create
this way because you are calling from a
static method it is asking you to create
static but if you don't want you can
just say it if and you say new test and
then say start okay this is going to
call this chart method as well so you
don't have to define whether it is a
void or a string or something you can
define
so that will automatically converted
into a void or any any return type if
you are returning string it will work if
you are returning an integer t work so
this is going to automatically typecast
into any data type which you are going
to put on so I am going to say let's say
I'm going to return once right and I am
going to print this there's going to
print up one because there is going to
return this yes okay in fact you don't
even have to say return also so if I
just say one this is going to return one
my so if I run this again so this is
also going to return 1 if we notice here
it doesn't end one because the last
statement does not require return so
because it is by default going to return
something you can define whatever you
want to return so you don't even have to
type reform so you see the number of
lines of code which we are renting it
it's getting reduced weight okay the
next thing is let's create a POJO right
that is be fun so let's create a POJO so
and is going to call it as a Poe Joseph
okay and I have a variable called name
which is going to be a string okay and I
have an idea pal call ID which is going
to be an integer so how do we access
inside Java so inside Java you you write
a gator under sister right so you write
a getter and a setter and then we access
it but in groovy you can do this so we
say POJO I'm going to say start it you
say for you
okay and you can assign variables like
this
I think if you notice their intelligence
automatically so the Samadhi is going to
be integer so you can do this and you
can just assign this to a variable and
then you can just print it you see here
how we can how we are defined this photo
so if you notice here you haven't done
anything here so you haven't created any
constructor you haven't created a
caterer or a sorter till you are able to
create it like this so how do you assign
variables like so from the folder you
can assign it like this you just say
Pozos or whatever objects we created you
can just directly access the name if you
notice here the name inside the poser is
a private but still we are able to
access this here so that is what groovy
does it's all reflection I as I
mentioned right it's all reflection so
you can use anything so there is no
privacy inside GUI so that is why I want
you saying that don't use kind of coding
production but it has been writing less
number of code so you can use it for
writing text so that's what we used to
do so that is one thing
thank you so you can directly assign
like this you can assign like this okay
that is what Ruby does so you don't have
to worry about anything so let me print
no forger right so we saw how to call a
star function so we saw how to call a
function so let me do a little string
here right and over to string so that we
see what is the new values which were
senses
okay if you see here the new value pod
changed even though we created a YouTube
here so let me do in there as well and
if you notice here this did not fail the
compilation did not fail but it fails
only other run time right that is why I
was sitting it is dangerous it's a
dynamic language so you will not know
where the code is going to break so that
is going to break in production of your
during a compiler okay so if you know
together this is purchased same way if
you are accessing it you can use the
same thing so you can say POJO dot name
and execute and if you notice here this
println i am just not doing this I'm not
doing this in fact we can do this so you
have a space and then you this is
treated as an argument to the particular
method so this is the method right
ventolin is a method ventolin is nothing
but system dot out dot filter you okay
the sentence so internal is a method and
you're passing this is an argument if
you have two arguments you can do comma
separated you can do like it okay for
any function it's not only for the
println function for any function okay
so you can do that so that is the other
way of calling functions or defining
functions include right the next thing
is creating loop it so lists are very
simple so you create an empty list like
this that's it
so it is an empty list so in Java what
do we do we say a less new ArrayList of
something something blah blah blah right
so you can do something like this and if
you want to convert this into a linked
list or something else you can just say
as linked list or linked whatever you
need link type set if you need a hash
set you can just say that so if you just
say ass and then give the specific data
type it gets converted to that
particular design and if you want to add
then we just say add and then let's say
I'm going to add strings rig I'm going
to say string one so I can add this way
okay and how do I treat it now right so
you can print it this way but how do I
treat it right so that is a much easier
way so it is going to use something
called closure okay which is new for us
in the jvm language so closure is like
passing a function to another function
so in if you are from the JavaScript
world you would have known functions
within a function so you pass a function
to another function as an argument right
so that is called closure so in groovy
it's called closure there is a language
called closure as it so that is close
your CLO J you worry but this is closure
so what we are going to do here is we're
gonna use closure so how do we use
closure this way you have to use the
open brace and close race in groovy in
order to pass the closure so it is not a
closure
this is passing an argument you have a
value and you are passing it if you want
a function or something you can do this
if you want to pass more than two or
three lines you can pass it like this so
this is like passing something else so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to say
println and I'm going to print it so I
will tell you about it right so what we
are doing sure here we are i treating
this list saying okay take each element
from the list and that corresponds to a
default object called it in group ok
inside a list right when you iterate it
it's correspond to a default value for
it if you want to have it at a specific
value so you can do this as it something
I can do this it is here okay
I'm saying that whatever value you take
out from the list put it inside the
variable call NCR and then you can use
them here okay so you can write n number
of lines of code here I mean
I screwed up something so let me be stay
lean on this so you can write a number
of length of codes here okay it was
still not Company P note is here it has
printed the value still right say it
also was and you can give it an email
sir so this is how you work within this
so you don't have to to a for each or
you don't have to do a for INT i equal
to whatever all those are not requests
in cases of you work with live map is
still more fun so how do we define a
empty map is this funky right so you
have a semicolon here which define there
is no key there is no value
so it's an empty map so key will be in
the left side and the value will be in
left side so if you want to have some
values in the map you can do this you
can say name colon and then you can say
you choose right so this is going to
have a hash map with one key value path
and the key is are going to be name and
the value is going to be youtube so if I
just do a friend let's see what's gonna
happen you can see here it's just
printing the same thing which is nothing
but a key value pair now we need to I
trade this site like how we enter to the
list when you try to read this so don't
worry there is a each for this as well
so it is going to expect the same
closure the only thing is here we will
have key and value both ways so in the
list we had only one object so we had
only one object so here what we can do
is we can do key comma value and say
that we can use them both they so I'm
going to say key and value I'm going to
put into all the keys in value so if I
say I'm going to add a few more objects
I'm going to add ID as a let's say one
two three and three
okay so this is also get quite a good
printer so in map you can do key comma
value and then those can be used as key
and values with key and value
corresponds to the key and value inside
the hashmap
okay you see here everything on printer
the key got printed the value could
print to the cake or printer the kind of
liquid Center okay so now when we use to
print inside the printer log statement
or something they used to use the
strings or formatted so you don't have
to use string dot format instead you can
use double quotes inside groovy so
single quote is the use for representing
a string which you which is going to be
immutable if you want to change
something or pass something inside a
string object then you use double quotes
so I'm going to say key equal to and
then I'm going to say to all of key so
which basically means all are the
persons that I need to use the variable
which is already defined if I just say
key equal to it is going to print the
same key equal to but if i say dollar
key it is going to take the variable
which is declared outside even though if
it is inside double quotes it is going
to take me to the value which is there
also if you see here the key and the
values are getting printer
whatever the key and the key name is
getting printer okay same way for value
we can do wrong so this is how we work
out with T print Allah all right so same
way if you have sit you can just say has
it you can just say as as effect and
then you can work around like it has a
 and then it will behave like an
action so everything is all reflection
so if you see groovy has their own
methods so all the classes inside Java
are all overwritten by groovy if they
use the concept of reflection there are
lots of good things about groovy
but we should be very careful in using
that there are lots of concepts and
concepts like serene and the boys and
stuff like that which we can see in the
next video but this is just the basics
of groovy so how we can use groovy and
stuff like that
so today here this is a closure so we do
claw closure so you pass a you pass this
whole thing into this particular method
so each is a method which is over it and
then this particular object okay
the other fun part is grouping supports
operator volley so what do you mean the
operator overloading a so I'll show you
what is operator role so a equal to
equal to B this particular expression is
equivalent to a dot equals of B right in
Java this is not equal but in groovy is
both is are equal okay
so Java we have we have the concept of
memory and then you say that okay if you
cannot compare strings and since string
is over it and sing as equal to no to
sing over it and it does something and
hashcode over it and it has all those
all those are found outside but in
groovy both these are saying because it
supports operator holding so why is it
useful is if you are doing a a plus B
right this can be translated as a dot
plus of B right so that is called my
operator already so which basically
means you can create a not equal a and
then say plus of B okay and the method
inside the method called plus inside a
will be executed even though you did a
plus C so I am going to quickly show you
that so let's create a class called down
a right and let's say it's going to have
some variable called I and there is a
method called flux
and that is going to expect some some
other variable right
so what I am going to do is I'm going to
create a variable called a
I'm gonna go in ten okay now I'm going
to say a dot so I am going to create a
another object okay
I'm going to create another object
called B which is of same type a okay
while this man cannot resolve simple
a-19 wise goodie it should work let's
see maybe did with the Falls and then a
+ of P ok so this is a concentricity
make let's make it a couple of makes
getting confused and getting confused
now so this sounds fine right so what we
have done is we have taken two objects
okay of Class A and named it as a and B
so a and B are going to be 200 different
objects so what I'm doing here is I'm
saying a dot plus of B I am passing be
here right so this is going to be an
object of sight it's right in general
what we do we do like this way and then
we say return a dot I plus I so what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to add
both of them this is dotted for example
right so what I'm going to do I'm going
to say println
so in general what is this going to
return this is going to return 10 plus
20 which is going to be 30 right so in
groovy you can do this in a different
fashion also see 30 K now I'm going to
do a plus B okay so this is also going
to return 30 you have no clue how tight
so that is what we are going to see now
how does it do so that is called
operator over so if you see here that
also has a 10:30 okay so that is called
operator over it so literally this class
has got translated into a method called
plus that is why a equal to equal to B
gets translated into equals method it
gets translated into equals method and
that is how it works so same way if you
have a minus B you will have to write a
method call a minus B and then you can
just proceed with us so that is the
other way of writing stuff in Google so
it's very simple right you don't have to
say it or eight or plus of B we just say
a plus B that is going to
the metaphors last so it is very useful
when you write instead we used to use
the idea self so you will have a Verity
kind of sign and then you can have lots
of stuff inside Ruby so you can write
you just say a plus B and then you can
literally concatenate two objects or
contain a two stars or if you say a
equal to B you can compare stuff stuff
like that
you can do all those things include so
that is called operator overloading in
fluid okay so that is another good thing
which you can use when you are writing
tests or writing the pipelines in
Jenkins five-nothing so that is what I
wanted to cover as a part of this
particular video if you want me to cover
any specific groovy concept do let me
know I can cover that but I just wanted
to start off with a basic concept of
what is groovy and how does it work and
I just wanted to show you a real flavor
of how the GUI works on how you can make
pro-v work i even download the library
and i showed you how to set up set that
up inside IntelliJ
ok so that's it for this particular
video if you want me to do any specific
topic do comment that in the comment
section below if you like the video go
ahead and like it if you haven't
subscribe this channel go ahead and
subscribe to it meet you again in the
next video
