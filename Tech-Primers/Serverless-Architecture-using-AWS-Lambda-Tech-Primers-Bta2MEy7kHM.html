are going to see what our surveillance
architectures so imagine right there is
no server and you want to deploy your
code your code is running there and
there is no server out there which is
running currently so how is that
architecture sounds right so this sounds
crazy isn't it so that is what Cerberus
architecture is all about so basically
serverless
architecture is the design pattern or a
day where your process will be running
in there your function will not be
executed until it is called or basically
it is triggered so if you notice here
currently I have the website from
Martine folder so if you don't know who
Martin follows Martin folder is a
developer like us so he's an octa
basically so he the visionary I would
say so he currently works in sort works
so he has a his own idea of how you
should design stuff how how you should
do a gen software development he has
lots of credits in taking sessions and
coming up with proposals and stuff so
I'm a big fan of him basically so that
is I am using his particular website to
just explain you what civiles
architecture is ok so he currently works
in thought work so if you want to follow
him you can check his website Martin
Volcom he has very good articles on
every topic if you notice he has lots of
videos design document related topics as
I related topics
refactoring related topic so he is the
one who created a book called
refactoring in in the 1990s and it
became famous and then like how we call
now write refactoring so that is how it
became famous
so let's come to the main topic for this
particular organization so it's the
service architecture so as I said
earlier service architecture is where
you will not be running a server full
time ok so your execution will be
triggered based on an event or or an
action ok so basically it can be called
as back-end as a service
basically you don't have anything
running okay your code is lying out
there if somebody calls that particular
code then it will be execute
okay it can also be called as function
as a service so basically you write
function and those functions can be
executed at that instance then there is
something coming and triggering right so
what happens most of the time in
production right if you had worked in
any company or 30 hi you know that okay
all your processes are running they're
in production but you never know that
then liquid comes into your production
machine right and it comes with re that
that's what we know right and then for
that we always keep on running and if
you know cloud is all about how much
ever time you are utilizing that that
measure that much amount of money you
have to pay right so that is why people
thought of serverless architecture as a
dead fit so basically what server logs
the service architecture says is you
don't have your server always running so
whenever there is an event or a action
which is triggered for this particular
function you trigger the function only
when it is required okay so basically at
that particular instance your function
will be spawned in a server and you have
to pay only for the time with which it
ran on a server so basically that is
that is the seventh architecture so
actually as the name suggests there is
no server but you have to use the server
at some point eight so that is then you
trigger an action ok so that is why it's
called server this architecture but
imagine that terror there are servers it
will be running on servers only but it
could be used only when it is triggered
so basically your imagine that your JVM
is down and then you a request comes in
your JVM gets alive processes that
request will get returns a response back
and then it goes for sleep so that is
how it what we called you can visualize
it okay that is how it works so there's
this big upset from departing follows
website okay is the article from the
martini follows website so there are
lots of information about why you need
and stuff like that so I'll just cover
some basic stuff so if you have worked
on applications which are MBC's right
the client-server architecture so you
would have noticed that we have a
browser then we have a back-end server
and then we have a database so we notice
yeah this is our current architects
other side so you have a browser you
have a back-end server which is
rendering the request from the browser
and then giving it back right and then
you have a database with from which T so
fetches the data and then sends it back
to the browser so in terms of service
architecture how we will design it we
will start splitting our service into
multiple micro services and we use
whatever we want as a function so if you
notice here there is a client browser
you have an authentication service
separately with which you authenticate
your server ok once it is done you go to
the Gateway
so gateway is where all our routing
happens ok the Gateway is go to route it
to a specific function so if you want to
purchase it goes to a first stage
function if you want to search the
retail store it goes to the search
function so that is why if you notice
here these are serving as architecture
so basically purchase function and
search functions are server love and
then you have a database so once your
function called the database you can
process the data and open it back right
so that is this is how serverless
architecture will look like when you are
splitting this particular architecture
ok so basically we are saying that split
based on functionality ok and those
functionalities can be put inside a
function ok so that there is no harm for
it to run independently right there are
lots of other things I am NOT going to
go through that but I will show a
typical example of where the serverless
architecture is already used and who is
the big player if you notice here I have
already opened the website so Amazon
provides something called a double use
lambda ok if you're familiar with AWS
area blur is a cloud in the next the
next story which runs on the
infrastructure as a service platform
right so it is the infrastructure and
service offering from Amazon so similar
to that Amazon provides AWS lambda which
is nothing but a function as a service
or a back-end as a service offering also
you can it's already live in production
basically so Amazon is offering that for
free it's not free but you can kind of
for free for some time but here so what
it does is whatever we is talked about
right so it provides you a functionality
to store your functions inside the AWS
lambda and
and it will be triggered based on an
action or event if you notice here that
is what they say so a WM a tobias lambda
lets you run code without provisioning
or managing service you can you pay only
for the compute time you consume and
there is no charge when your code is not
running which is a major advantage right
so most of the time our processes are
idle and you don't have to pay for that
right so with lambda you can run code
for virtually any type of application or
a back-end service all with zero
administration just upload your code and
the lambda takes care of everything
required to run and scale your code with
high availability you can set up your
code to automatically trigger some other
aw services or they're called directly
from any website or mobile name okay
that is what the lambda says aw is
lambda safe and if you notice here what
are the major advantages of features of
AWS lambda is more servers to manage so
literally you don't have to manage the
server so if you're if you're bugged in
an IT company I would I would say that
okay definitely we would have had a
chance to see a server log into a
machine manage that server make sure the
health of a server is good and make sure
that is not going down and solve is
available all these six pivotal maintain
right so that you don't have to do of a
variable yeah we don't have to worry
about the server management in the a SS
lambda would so it is all taken care by
D lambda itself okay cutting miscarriage
so you can scale your application so
let's say you wrote an you wrote a
function okay and that particular
function is taking triggered by thousand
people at the same time okay you don't
have to worry about that because a
double use lambda automatically scales
so literally it can spawn thousands of
threads or thousands of servers parallel
so that each request is individually
handled okay so you don't have to worry
about that in a traditional operating
system water we do we are running on a
server and if the memories out of memory
is like exceeding that limit we won't be
able to do it or we have to have a
global load balancer and then load
balance between two different servers
and different data centers are within
the same data center we have to split
based on that right and we have to scale
down later or we have a we have to keep
them
running idle in idle state because
always you might not be expecting high
volumes like high volumes or practice so
that we don't have to worry about in a
Douglas lambda because underneath the
lambda infrastructure it is going to be
AWS cloud so the spawning of servers are
going to be cloud thing so you don't
have to worry about T scaling as okay
and then sub second meeting so based on
the a success right so based on the time
you will be charged so that is what this
is all about ok so how does it work so
you just need to upload your code a
database lambda so currently
understanding what a doubly slam data so
you have to place your code in the end
of this lambda that is the only
restriction right now which I see
because your code is going to result in
somebody else's data center okay so from
there you can spawn based on and event
basically any rest endpoint call or
based on a file push or any mobile app
connectivity or something like okay so
that is how it gets triggered and then
you are lambda function processes the
data and then sends it back okay and
then you pay only for the processing
time for each function that's it okay so
if you notice here these are just some
implementations of their you can use
them X and lambda so for example data
processing you can use a to base a
lambda execute code in the response in
the X you decode interest in response to
a trigger such as changes in the data
ships in the system state or actions per
user so a taqueria the trigger point for
the a double is lambda would be changes
in the data or a shift in the system
state basically or any action by an user
basically any destined phone call or
anything okay and if you notice lambda
can trigger directly sugar can be
triggered by a delay services using s3
DynamoDB connects ssns and cloud watch
ok the Charro's used to directly call
the serverless data directly from the aw
isn't she okay so that is what they are
providing same a real-time file forcing
you can do that as it we can get the
file
push to to s3 and s3 triggers a at a
place lambda function you can process
the data immediately and then you can do
whatever
you want with that basically you can
upload the data back again or do
something with it so you can literally
have s3 as a trigger for a wh lambda
processing as well okay so the other one
is the real-time stream processing so
kinases is the real-time streaming
system which amazon has so you can push
the data there and then these lambda
functions are triggered and you can
store them in the DynamoDB and then
process that data okay so basically you
can you use it for ETL processes if you
know what is an ETL ats stands for
extract transform and load so most of
the places you would have noticed that
they have the our process will be dating
for a file and based on the file arrival
the process the data right so what are
what do we do we always wait for the
file and our process is always running
most of the time right so you don't have
to do that because all these aw is
lambda features are triggered based on
an event basically if a file is that I
automatically a function gets spawned
and then you do the X transform some one
load so you don't have to keep on
running your sources instead you can go
to serverless architecture and then a
formal Amazon provides AWS lambda which
turns up but in future I expect every
other company trying to solve this
serverless architecture problem and then
they come up with some open source
software which you can use and leverage
and try out okay so that is it so that's
all about PA SS lambda so I'll just
summarize what we discussed so a SS
lambda is basically an architecture
where you provide function as a service
so you don't have any servers running so
you just give some function which is
sitting out there so that will be get
triggered based on an event or a state
change or a file change or something
like that okay or a trigger so based on
that your aw lambda function will be
executed in case we saw were delayed of
those lambdas or a double is lambda
users functions so you just create
functions and keep it in the lambda
infrastructure and then they have
triggered by any event which you have
configured and based on that a server
will be spawned and your function will
be visited on the server and it then
goes to sleep
so you have
just pay only for the time when the
server was running and then your
function was using that's all that's it
okay so that is the server this
architecture okay hope you understood if
