see how to deploy an application to
cloud foundry
I have critical account in pivotal cloud
foundry instance so if you see this is
the console for the pivotal cloud from
the instance so that is called pivotal
Web Services if you see here this is how
it shows so I have two different spaces
one is called development one is context
timers you can see different domains you
can see the members the accounts which I
have been there is something called
marketplace so in the marketplace you
can add different services you can have
the cloud storage you can have the
database you can have different
analytics data you can you can identify
all these here in the market plain so we
are not going to see about the
marketplace but we are going to deploy a
simple application into the cloud
foundry so I have sample springboard
application which I have created so this
will be like a ref server so if you see
here it has different dressed endpoints
we can use them and then we can identify
how it is working so what I'm going to
do is I am going to defer that into
cloud 20 so so before that what we need
is a cloud foundry CLI so there is a
link which I have given below so you can
download the cloth on the CLI from the
link which cloud foundry provides so you
can use that and install it in your
system so here I haven't felt it in my
Mac so so that is this command so if you
see here see you have login and then I
have to give this particular command so
let's do that
and I will be prompted to login to the
club for games and so I'm going to do
that here
so this is going to be the API endpoint
which Cloud Foundry is motor on my email
ID didn't give my password so once I log
in it will be setting the organization
which is nothing but the tech primer
than it is asking me to set up space so
for instance now we are going to set the
tech primers space so I said it that
primers pain now I'm logged into the
Cloud Foundry instance so this is
basically connected to the console which
we are seeing here so we are now logged
in to be pivotal Cloud Foundry instance
by our command prompt now I need to
deploy the application so generally this
particular spring boot application has
created a jar so there is something
called manifest or Yama's which this
clouds all way so the deployment command
for the Cloud Foundry CF push that's it
so if you don't give any path to a Yama
file it will directly and defy a
manifest dot Yama so it will expect a
manifest toriyama file so this is the
manifesto DML file which I am giving so
internally inside the yeah multiple if
you see the application name I am giving
a string boot tech primers then the path
for the jar is this so inside target if
you see there is a jar and then I'm
giving the domain what is the domain
which I need this application to be
deployed to so CF app store Co is the
default domain which I mean it'll gives
gives for us so that is what I am giving
then you can use the memory and how many
instance of this particular application
I want to deploy so if you see here this
is just a simple list springboard
application which I have created okay so
let's do the deployment so I am just
triggering a CF push so if you see this
what DCF CLI is doing is its using the
manifest or thermal file which we have
here so this is nothing but this
particular ml 5 so it's using that and
identify that okay it means to create a
application got Springwood tech primers
under tech primer under the space tech
primers so it is created that
application and it's creating a route so
if you see here our web URL will be
pissed
bring more tech primers dot CS abs dot
IO so and it's also binding that
particularly you are you are a router to
that particular application so and if
you see here what's happening is our
application is getting uploaded so the
jar is getting literally uploaded here
upload is complete now so once it is
completed it's identifying a build back
so I think it's downloading the build
back so build back is nothing but Cloud
Foundry identifies what kind of
applications whether it is a war or what
is the jar or does it need any Tomcat or
does it need any anything else or
something like that so that is what's
the build practice and then finally to
create something called droplets so
droplet is like an artifact so based on
the build back and be jar it creates a
artists droplet basically their
artifacts for the cloud funky so and
that drop it can be deployed anywhere so
that is what is happening here if you
see here it's getting lymphoid and
complete disjoint container is
successfully destroyed container so that
they store whatever it has created so
looks like our apples up now so it's
just checking the hills of the app and
it is all good let's go to the space
here let me refresh the page and see if
we have yeah I can see that already so
deployed here so if you see here
springboard tech primers so we have the
application running here so you can stop
and restart here so if you want to see
metrics for that particular application
you can do that here so there is a URL
so before that lets go and check our
application so there is if you see there
is an app called route so you can go and
hit that so let me go and hit that so
our application is a-- so but we need to
use the correct rest endpoint so there
are some rest endpoints which i have
created so for example let's say if I
give the hello world it's going to give
me the greetings from the application
llaman let's do that welcome to spring
boot demo created by AJ so that is what
I had done so same way there is
something called users so what I have
done with this sample application I had
created an in-memory database so if you
hear nothing is coming so I get an
in-memory database so whatever we load
here it will be stored in the in the
middle database and then we it will be
retrieved so for example I can load the
data by using this using the load come
on so I'm not going to show that right
now but I had just created some
specification so this is how we deploy
our application to Cloud Foundry and
then the platform is create a pivotal
platform fee provides a trial account so
in between here this particular account
of the trial account so they provide a 2
GB of data
so which we can use so you can deploy a
number of applications in this
particular space so I have deployed one
so that is how you deploy the
application to Cloud Foundry simple
isn't it so you just need the CF portion
it automatically deploys the only thing
is you need a manifesto DML file using
this file close form the identifiers ok
these are the different attributes which
is request for deploying that
application so that's it for this
session materials in another session
