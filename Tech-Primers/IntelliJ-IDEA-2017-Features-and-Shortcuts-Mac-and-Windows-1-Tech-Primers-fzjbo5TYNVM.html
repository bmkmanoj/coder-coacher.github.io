are going to see the feature and the
shortcuts of IntelliJ IDEA so IntelliJ
IDEA is the software developed by Jade
ring and it is open source for even you
can contribute to it so this is the IDE
because replacement for eclipse so I had
been using IntelliJ for the past four
hundred to five years it's extremely
good and I think that it's great for
increasing the productivity so let's go
through some of the features inside the
latest version of the IntelliJ IDEA
along with the shortcuts so as of now I
install the latest version today so if
you see here the version which I am
using is 2017 but one which IntelliJ of
the JetBrains released today so I just
installed that and also some of the
viewers that requested me to add some
shortcuts related to IntelliJ IDEA so
that is why I had decided to create this
video so I will show you the different
so if you are not aware about IntelliJ
IDEA so this is how it looks so this is
nothing but a window so in Eclipse you
would have seen the workspace right so
in IntelliJ it is called the window
unfortunately you can have only one
project in a window but you can even
import them in D you can even import the
other projects inside so if you see here
this is how the latest version of
IntelliJ IDEA looks so if you see this
is all the project structure looks like
so the folders they have changed the
folders you can see my previous video
default or what I was shown in a
different color but right now it is
showing in a different color because
it's the latest version of intelligent
which has changed it so let's go through
the shortcuts which are available right
now I will go through a few of them I'll
cover for Windows as well as for Macs
so right now I have a MacBook Pro so I'm
using the Mac shortcut but I parently
tell what is the shortcut for the
windows so let's say if you want to
search the class file so you will have
to use ctrl M in Windows the same for
Mac would be control Oh so let's say I
want to search a particular class name
consoling boot so I will have to type
ctrl o in MacBook and ctrl n in Windows
so in my pocket is commando basically so
in Windows it would be ctrl n
okay let's say if you want to if you--if
you know that okay the file name is
starting with s and then your camel case
would be a boot so you can say s be so
intelligent america identifies which is
your relevant clan so for example let's
say and searching users and then i
decide that okay i want to go to users
repository i type r as caps it
automatically pops up that particular
class because i have caps so it is a
camel case sensitive as it so it can
easily identify your your clan okay and
then you can navigate to it so let's say
you want to navigate to a particular
line okay so you know that okay you are
going to that particular class okay you
know that okay you have to go to line
number four so you can do a column for
so if you do a colon 4 it will directly
for the line number forty fifty here
that's directly accountable line number
four
so i will show you once again so i just
say a class name and then i say i want
to go to let's say i want to go to line
number fourteen i just type that it will
go directly to realign number fourteen
okay so that is one of the shortcut from
the same control and option okay if you
want to search this controllin or the
commando option searches only the class
file however if you want to search all
the files in the current project you can
use command shift onion in windows okay
and then way it would be command shift
and o
so in windows it will be control shift
onion and in mac with beauty it would be
command shift and oh so if you see here
I search for app it is now showing me
the application Yama so it also says
that okay you can include non project
files to it which I enable the check box
it's going to search the files across
the library for the jar basically so it
can even search across the Jasmine you
can even now we get to be classified
also intelligent has the ability to
decode the class file so you can even
decompile this particular class file so
IntelliJ provides that feature also out
of the box okay so the next shortcut
would be let's say you want to navigate
to these windows right here so as you
see here the these windows here right
here are having some numbers with an
underlined
one writer you can use command one okay
for example I'm doing a command one
right now so it opened my project if I
do come on to it will open the favorites
if I do command nine is going to open my
version control so same way in Windows
it is by equal in command would be
control one control two same way till
the number which is displayed here okay
so also in college it provides the
terminal if you see here if you want to
go and do something in the command
prompt you can even open the terminal
directly do something here so for
example when I do development at office
Lee I just build the project and if I
want to push the application to the
cloud foundry so I just say CF push here
so I don't even have to navigate outside
the IntelliJ instead I can do it from
the terminal itself that is one of the
key feature so let's go through the next
shortcut so let's say I have a clot okay
I want to navigate through the class so
in this particular variable I want to go
inside this particular class right so
what you can do is you can do a control
B so control B will directly take you
inside the clip in the Mac it would be
command B okay so if you do that command
B and control B it will directly take to
the clock okay so now I'm inside the
class now I want to go back so how will
I go back so in Windows it will be
Control Alt + left arrow okay in Mac and
agree it would be command and open grade
okay if you do that it will shift your
focus from the other class to the back
to the class from where you are
generated from okay that is that is one
more shortcut so let us say let's start
typing something right so let's say your
you have a for example attend removing
this particular report okay IntelliJ is
going to give you some suggestions you
are automatically so if you see here
it's popping up some position so you can
do alt enter if you do alt enter it will
automatically show you what are all the
different options IntelliJ is going to
give you so you can decide whether you
want to create a new class you want to
create a new enum you inner class
interface whatever it is or make private
whatever you want to do or you can do
import if you will just click on the
import it is going to automatically to
the input
okay so the shortcut for that is odd
enter in match it would be option and
enter so option or the alt button and
then press the Enter
so then it will automatically two-way
import order to show up what it needs to
do okay so same way for example let's
say I have a method here I know that
this particular method is going to
return me some data okay I want to
create a variable name so you can use
the same shortcut alt enter an
intelligent will pop up an option say
introduce local variable we just press
Enter it automatically gives you the
option to name variable that's why okay
so that is one more shortcut so now that
I have never gated two different classes
I want to open the recent recently
opened class so in that case we can use
controlling in Windows and command e in
Mac so you can see the reason files on
you can directly navigate to the file
pin so you I just say ctrl e and then so
when you do lots of coding you want to
switch between files it it is easier to
use this particular cut cut command D or
ctrl e so that will show you the reason
Python you can just clip it so you don't
even have to use your mouse to now we
get through the classified okay so that
is one more shortcut so the next one
would be a very useful shortcut which I
felt that it is great I didn't see that
in any other ID so which is the base
history so let's say I'm copying some
pipe so I alerted I copied name I copied
ID but I want to pay his name somewhere
I decide I lost that so how will I do
that
so you can use ctrl shift and B so in
that case intelligent will show you what
are those the list of history which you
copied so it is basically store B it
will basically store the clipboard in
its history so it's basically a page
history so if you see here these are
different things which I copied okay so
you can decide and paste whatever you
want okay that is P shortcut so ctrl alt
ctrl shift V in Windows and command
shift V in D Mac okay so next one would
be for extracting some methods so for
example here I have I have written lots
of lines so let's say
lots of lines here right I want to
extract these two lines into a method so
what I can do is I can take control alt
em in Windows so that this will be
extracted into a method in the Mac it
will be command option M so then you can
name it method so you can go say some
method name it automatically extract
those lines into a separate method so
the shortcut would be ctrl alt and M in
Windows command option and M in Mac okay
so same way let's say I want to extract
a variable so for example here I have a
string here I want to extract this into
a variable okay so let's do that right
so here it would be contra control alt +
V same way in in Mac it will be command
optional B if I do that intelligible
automatically stop me and say what is
the variable name you want to have so I
said great in here okay so that is one
more shortcut so let me show you another
shortcut so you want to copy this
particular line again right so for
example you have a you have a line you
want to copy this and then you want to
change something inside alone so what
you can do is you can do a control D in
Windows or you can do a command D so if
I do command D it automatically copies
the line and then paste again so you
don't have to say control C control V
you just take on control D okay it'll
automatically paste using line again
Indian X let's say maybe if you want to
copy group of line you can select those
groups and then say command D or the
control D it will automatically paste
those legs so now we say if you see I
have a repeated strings here I want to
extract this into a variable so until
you see is so intelligent that okay you
just do ctrl alt and B it will
automatically ask you whether you want
to replace that particular instance or
all these servers
can you just say all the instances it is
automatically going to convert them into
the variable so this is one more shot
back okay
if you're writing some getter methods
all you are trying to do something again
and again and you want to extract that
up this would be you can easily do worry
place on okay so that is one more
shortcut so let's go through the code
completion so let's say I have a model
here right I have three different
variables I want to create the generate
a greater than the setter so you can use
the ctrl e or the command e to do recent
file same way you can use all the insert
ok or command n so if I did if I do
command then it will automatically show
me what I need to create either a
constructor or a getter or a setter or a
equal to hash code if I do equals RS
code I can even decide what type of
equals or hash code builder any team
either there IntelliJ IDEA default or we
hash code builder or the equals builders
from the Apache okay so the shortcut is
command and in Mac and it is alt insert
inside windows so you can even I can
just say even then generate okay similar
you can even override my cat Sophie see
here you can even override methods or
implement methods using that you can do
to sing override so anything you can do
so you can generate code out of the box
using this shorter okay so I think
that's it I will not go through inter
internally on the every shortcut but
there is an important feature available
in the help Kozik productivity guide so
if you go to the productivity guide it
will show you the different shortcuts
are available out there and how many
times your user use that shortcut and
when did you use lot so for example I
can start by used so you can see here
the basic completion I have used at 887
times variable name completion I've used
725 times
syntax over selection I'm used 622 times
so if you see here it also shows when
did I use it last so if you don't know
any shortcut and if you want to see or
check any shortcut which you can come to
this productivity guide anytime and then
it will show you the shortcuts and you
can even see how to what is the command
and what is over
the command for the the keyboard
keyboard shortcut for that particular
command as well okay so that's it for
this particular video meet you again in
the next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
