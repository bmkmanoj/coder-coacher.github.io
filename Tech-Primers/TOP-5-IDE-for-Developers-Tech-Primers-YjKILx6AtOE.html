very complicated let's see what are the
top five ids preferred by the current
day developers let's get started
the first in the list is from JetBrains
you might be familiar with IntelliJ IDEA
so if you had seen my previous videos
you would have noticed that I prefer
IntelliJ IDEA and I have been using it
for over 5 years now it's a very good
IDE
it has board ultimate and Community
Edition this is one of the most
preferred IDE
if you see in the current developer
circle let's see what is it providing
right so IntelliJ IDEA is a IDE provided
by JetBrains JetBrains is the company
which has created the language Scotland
it has lots of other IDs
it started off initially with creation
of theme city and other similar tools
they have created idea IntelliJ IDEA
with the aim of making our developers
like that is right
so if you come for eclipse with IntelliJ
IDEA IntelliJ IDEA is much better it has
tons of features and it is keyboard
centric ID and it improves the
developers productivity then you start
using IntelliJ IDEA alright so there are
other ID is provided by IntelliJ by Chet
Prince itself like sea lion sea lion is
an ID for C and C++ IntelliJ IDEA
provides support for Java Kotlin groovy
Scala Python and lots of other languages
apart from these JetBrains also has PHP
Strom depth strong web Stone has
complete integration to JavaScript HTML
and all the frameworks angular and
typescript and stuff like that so there
are so many ideas inside JetBrains so
the most preferred ones are the IntelliJ
IDEA which people use for Java and
Kotlin right in fact you see that ok you
can do dotnet Ruby Rae Ruby and rails
Django Python and Android the major
thing is Android so since IntelliJ or
the JetBrains created the IDE
intelligent they had created Kotlin as
well so they are providing the Android
the studio which is based on the
intelligence a idea platform so all the
ideas which you can see inside the
JetBrains is all based on the IntelliJ
IDEA platform the page based Ramdev
Strahm PyCharm the rubymine writer all
these are different tools which you can
use for editor as editors right so that
stands as number one so if you had seen
I'll just show you some of the minor
features which I can like give you
within within this particular video so
IntelliJ has an integration to the gate
you can see they get logs you can have
lots of plugins installed for example
there's a sonar plug-in I had shown as a
separate video as well it has support
for the this thing the markdown language
so you can have markdown files you can
have plugins for that also there are
rich support for keyboard centric
actions so everything can be done inside
shortcuts so you you don't have to use
your mouse you you can directly use
IntelliJ with just the keyboard okay
currently I am using the latest version
of IntelliJ to in 2017 dot 2.5 it has
tons of features there are lots of
features with the debugging you can do
debugging with streams so I might make a
separate video on how to debug with
streams so with the latest version of
IntelliJ IDEA you can now debug with
stream so intelligent has support for
Java 8 streams as well right so that's
what you want to know about IntelliJ and
how you can use it check my other videos
in the playlist called IntelliJ IDEA
where I have made lots of videos on
IntelliJ IDEA how you can use plugins
and what are the useful plugins in
IntelliJ IDEA the next in the list is
Visual Studio code so Visual Studio code
as the name suggests is created by
Microsoft so Microsoft if you see had
the traditional UI called Microsoft
Visual Studio right which was a
heavyweight UI if you had to install
Microsoft Visual Studio you had to close
all other IDs
your Windows machine and then you use
that particular ad right but recently
what Microsoft has done is they have
reinvented their traditional Microsoft
Visual Studio into something called
Visual Studio code okay this is
completely a new UI so if you see here I
use Visual Studio code for any of the
HTML changes or JavaScript or angular
changes so this is that new UI it's a
very lightweight UI this is one of the
most lightweight you I have ever seen
for an ID which has lots of features so
you can you can have a Microsoft Visual
Studio for free a Visual Studio code for
free so this idea is called Visual
Studio code apart from the Microsoft
Visual Studio still exist but this
particular version Visual Studio code is
completely open source and it's
completely free okay so there are tons
of features here you can see that there
are lots of suggestions which happens
when you start writing the code from the
IDE I have never made a video on visuals
she was true I can definitely do that
the idea is completely revolutionary in
such a way that you don't have to have
everything in one write if you want
JavaScript support you can install the
JavaScript plugin if you want Kotlin
support you can just install the Kotlin
plug-in if you want scholar support you
can install the car scholar plug-in so
whenever you need something you just go
and install that particular plug-in and
then that gets installed into the ID so
you don't have to get the heavyweight
IDE and then disable stuff so you
install whenever you need something
right
so which is why I like Visual Studio
code after IntelliJ IDEA where it is
very lightweight compared to other
varieties which I have tried which are
coming in the next sessions right so you
can give it a try if you are using a
HTML project and if you don't want to
shell out some money on IntelliJ IDEA
because IntelliJ IDEA provides premium
support for the Ultimate editions for
example if you want to have JavaScript
support inside IntelliJ IDEA you have to
go to PHP Strom Oreo to buy the ultimate
version of PHP strong in order to use
that right but if you want if you don't
want to buy any license and then you
want to use it
use the free internet IDs then go for
Visual Studio code which is which has
very good support for all latest
languages you can install a terse
plugins and people are adding more and
more plugins it's evolving right so I
have seen that it is pretty good in the
recent times and lots of people are
using Visual Studio code now the next is
the sublime text
this particular editor has been there
for quite a while if you have a Mac user
you pretty much know that ok this is an
editor which you don't want to miss
because the editor was designed in such
a way that it gives ease of use so you
can use it for IDs e IDs you can use it
as a typical text editor you have lots
of features inside this text editor
apart from text editor it can provide
you lots of things so before these IDs
came into picture sublime text was the
was the preferred IDE for web
development because of the themes and
the way it makes your editor feel net
right you can directly go to navigations
using the editor itself there is nothing
fancy there it is very lightweight as
well so compared to visual studio core
it is pretty little much heavier but it
can open huge files and it can know you
can go to the if you see here there is
an option you can navigate to the part
of the file bin and the files are huge
right and also it has a pretty much need
UI where you can use it right but I use
sublime text for editor I don't use it
as an IDE but I use it as an editor
right so if I if I don't like using
IntelliJ IDEA or if I don't want to load
using Visual Studio code and I prefer
sublime text right it has lots of
features as well just take a look at the
sublime text website if you are a Mac
user you know that you would have
definitely used sublime text but if you
are a Windows user you can still use
sublime text there are versions
available for Windows as well
the next one is Adam so Adam is another
IDE which is exactly similar to sublime
text in terms of the looks however it is
designed on a different platform so Adam
is a desktop application but however it
is designed using HTML and CSS code okay
this particular Adam software runs on
the platform called electron okay
electron is a node.js application which
runs on the chromium v8 engine so like
how your Chrome browser runs electron is
a frameworks which runs on the node.js
platform so Adam is designed on that
electron transform so the UI is pretty
much cool because of the HTML and CSS
integration inside the node.js
application the UI is pretty good when
you want to take a look at it okay
it is not lightweight compared to the
other two but it is pretty neat and then
you can do lots of web related stuff as
well so if you are a typical full stack
developer or a front-end developer then
you can go to Adam it is pretty much
good when you are using UI related stuff
like JavaScript but I've script for HTML
right so you can use Adam because it is
all based on the no J's platform so the
Adam IDE itself is running on the non
J's platform the last and the final one
is brackets so brackets is an IDE which
was created by Adobe ok so this
particular ID is also pretty much
lightweight but it doesn't serve the
purpose of a complete end-to-end
development forum even a front-end
developer so the disadvantage of
brackets is it is very good when you are
using HTML and CSS only because it is a
completely you I focused ID where if you
are modifying your HTML and CSS files
then this particular bro ID is extremely
awesome ok
but if you are coming back to the
node.js or the backend code then it is
not great because it doesn't have that
much tooling support which the other IDs
provide but in terms of the UI support
for the HTML on the CSS Brak
is the best so if you are working on
only HTML and CSS and if you are a
designer who creates only HTML and CSS
application then you can definitely use
brackets it is pretty good in terms of
the features of which it provides for
HTML and CSS because it has it
introduces the concept of Royal Library
note initially so brackets was the ID
which initially use this concept of Rive
a live reload then later on everybody
started using the live reloading the
grant and the Gulf JavaScript packages
so that's all these are the different
IDs which people are referring these
days so I know that I have not covered
Eclipse but Eclipse if you ask me
eclipses they come like a nokia w 1 w 0
mobile right it's pretty old now and
then I feel IntelliJ IDEA has more
features than Eclipse on the way
individual idea is moving towards it is
the protect code and if you are a Java
developer I would say that blindly go to
IntelliJ IDEA because it has tons of
features with lots of productivity tips
and then usages right if you're a web
developer go for visual studio code or
even the PHP strong provided by IntelliJ
IDEA if you don't have any ultimate
presence and if you want to have an open
society refer the next ones like Visual
Studio code or sublime text or atom in
that particular order right so that's
all I wanted to cover as a part of this
particular video hope you guys found it
interesting and found that there are
different IDs where you can use what so
that's it for this particular video hope
you liked it if you liked the video go
ahead and like it if you haven't
subscribe to the channel go ahead and
subscribe to it meet again in the next
video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
