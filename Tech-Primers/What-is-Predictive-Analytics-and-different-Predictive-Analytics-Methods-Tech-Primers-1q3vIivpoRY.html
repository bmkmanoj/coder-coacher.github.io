are going to see what is predictive
analytics and how is this different from
data analytics and also we are going to
see where we are using predictive
analytics and where it can be used as
well and also the technologies which are
used by predict and predictive analytics
and are added to come up with some
design solutions so what is this
predictive analytics really right so
predictive analytics is the area of
statistics around capturing the
relationship between explanatory
variables and the predicted variables
from the past occurrences and losing its
population so in simple words right so
collecting all the past day occurrences
of a data and then with that data you
come up with the relationship between
the object and then you predict the
future so that is predictive analytics
so basically you have to collect a
series of data over a period of time and
then you mind that data and then come up
with some external objects with which
you can come up with some predictions
saying okay this is what is going to
happen so in real-world entity right so
if you will see if you take horoscope
prediction so it is something similar to
the predictive analytics so how do they
predict the future right so it's the
same way so they see the past
occurrences they collect the data they
create relationship between the
explanatory variables and the predicted
variables and then they finally predict
something so that that is very much a
real-time example of their predictive
analytics is used so basically our
horoscope prediction is the predictive
analytics so what is using that
predictive analytics as I said earlier
data mining and automatically
discovering interesting patterns in the
data and finally applying that to the
unknown in the past present and the
future so there are different
definitions of predictive analytics but
this is something very basic right so
you
it's like collecting the past
occurrences you create some data out of
it and then you come up with some
patterns to predict the future so that
is in general the gist of what is
analytics finally the accuracy and the
usability vary upon the level of
analysis and the quality of assumptions
so then they ready to take the horoscope
prediction so not all horoscope
predictions are like perfect so
sometimes some people say that ok there
are some variation so that is what
predictive analytics is all about there
is accuracy and usability which can vary
upon the level of analysis and the
quality of assumptions we make so that
is predictive analytics at a higher
level so what do we need these
predictive analytics techniques right
so in order to improve our
decision-making abilities by enabling
learning from the past experience so in
general what do we do so in your work
life experience you you would have faced
lots of experiences in your previous
companies or previous job or previous
work right and then you try to improve
based on that particular previous
experience right so that is what
predictive analytics is used for so
improving decision-making by enabling
learning from the past experience ok so
we are the human we are able to do
predictive analytics team by ourselves
but if you want to do something over a
data you cannot do that automatically so
that is when this predictive analytic
tools help cells in predicting the
future ok
also why why predictive analytics is
related to big data because there is too
much of data and too many variables are
there for us to manually analyze and use
traditional statistic techniques right
for example if you consider our data so
we will be at the human we will be able
to process whatever created in a due
course of time right from our childhood
however still we won't be able to
process all the data which happened
right so we cannot remember all the
instances throughout our lifetime but
still we will be able to know only very
few so but in case of data we want to
analyze all the data and predict across
all the possibilities so that is why we
need some big data technology to process
that much amount of data because as a
brain is not like big head of system
right so that is very exciting big data
solution so brain is not able to process
that much so that is why we need
Big Data solutions same way for
real-world entity you can't process that
with the normal system so that is why we
need a big data solution okay so that is
that is the use of third predictive
analytics in in today's world so how is
it used a today so how is predictive
analytics used right so first is
detecting the fraud so if you see that
we a recent run somewhere wireless right
so you would have seen somebody hacked
the system so there are lots of falter
or what I called security related
algorithms which which will be running
in systems for big company so they
identify okay if there is going to be
any fault or if there is going to be any
failure and then it notifies the users
of the people who are monitoring so
there you can use predictive analytics
so you can identify patterns of failures
or patterns of security violations of
threats and based on that you can
identify the failure or the fraud okay
that is what that is one use case the
next one is predicting the sales of the
inventory so you can predict whether a
customer is going to buy your product or
not same way you can predict your invest
inventory let's say I have like 100 kgs
of sugar I'm going to sell more than 100
so I will predict that okay I need to
buy 100 more so that is another
predictive analytics next one will be
sick
taking profitable customers so
identifying customers you can you can do
so let's say a city peroxide low City
Bank can identify who are all profitable
customers and they can do some
prediction war that data and then that
is the predictive analytic next one is
anticipating customer churn so based on
the customer information you can now
anticipate the customer churn based on
the data the next one would be their
direct marketing so based on your
product all our marketing searching you
do direct marketing so that is
predictive analytics so how data and
it's different from predictive analytics
like now that you know what is
predictive analytics so how is it
different from data
so predictive analytics as we know uses
data analytic techniques to predict so
data analytics is nothing but data
mining information on creating strata
sticks out of the data but predictive
analysis is creating reusable patterns
of learning from the patterns and
identifying that okay this is how it
works and this is what is going to
happen so that is predictive analytics
okay so in general there is a cycle in
creating this predictive analytics right
so you in general that is a cycle
associated with coming up with some
predictive analytic solution based on
some data so let's see what is the
process cycle for that the first what do
we need to do is we need to define clear
objectives and what we are going to
achieve so for example let's take a use
case for example production failures so
we have a sort of application deployed
in production so we need to identify
failure or file delays into our system
before it happens so let's consider this
so this is an objective so you have to
design an objective saying okay this is
what I need to come up with finally so
next is data preparation so the data
preparation is nothing but so for my
objective what are all the entities
which meat which I need so for example
in a let's say we have 50 applications
deployed and production and my goal is
to identify failures or file delays in
the application so now I need to prepare
data so I need to collect information
about all these 50 applications which
are deployed in production how are they
evolving so how the files are coming in
daily so what time does the file come
daily we need to collect all these data
so that is the data preparation finally
modeling so modeling is what kind of
data do I need and what kind of data do
I extract from that data whatever they
provide so identifying the file incoming
time and the outgoing times or something
like that so let's say if you want to
identify if the file is going to be
delayed on a particular day we need to
collect all the data regarding the file
arrival time into our system
in the previous cycle so that is that is
how you model the data so you have to
model the data based on what you require
that is model finally you deploy that
design so whatever you have modeled you
have to deploy that into your production
environment
finally model monitoring so whatever we
have deployed now we need to monitor for
these kinds of patterns and we need to
predict so based on the file incoming
arrival time and the outgoing time so
our system should be able to monitor the
file arrival time and identify that okay
today this is going to be late or today
there is going to be a delay or today
the file came early and those kind of
predictions should be identified so this
is generally their life cycle or the
cycle involved in predictive analytics
okay so what are the different methods
to do predictive analytics right so at a
high level you can see I can just say
predicting data but how many methods are
there how are we going to identify how
to predict each type of data because
data as a set right it's so huge so you
have geographical data around Ecstatic
data you have like real-time data you
have sensor data so there are too much
of data so how are we going to identify
and predict patterns so so that is when
predictive analytics methods come into
picture so how many methods are there
that's what we are going to see now so
how do we help our how does the those
methods help us in identifying and
creating predictive analytic patterns so
the first one is this regression so
predicting the output variable using its
cause of relationship with input
variables so there are lots of
regression tools so for example OLS is
nothing but ordinary least squares of
the linear least squares so it is a
method for estimating unknown parameters
in a linear regression model so this is
one type of regression model or a
methodology now the next one is GL n so
GL M is a generalized linear model so
that is another type of model say a
random for
so random chorus is a similar to the
decision tree so you can you can create
decision trees basically you can create
a structure thing okay if this happens
to do that if this happens to do that so
so you can branch out and create
decisions based on the conditions so
that is and then finally it predicts so
that is that is how it works the random
forest next one is N and n n is nothing
but artificial neural network so as you
know artificial neural network is a
computational model which is used in
machine learning techniques and in the
research search area so which entails on
a large collection of simple units which
are called as artificial neurons so that
is why there is artificial neural
networks so these are different types of
methodologies which comes under the
regression so that is one type of
methodology the next one is
classification so classification pit is
when you want to classify items or
predict the item items based on a class
so you can predict items based on the
change geographical location or you have
a inventory data or customer data so you
just classify your classify them into a
class so for that we use decision tree
you can use logistic regression again
you can use the artificial neural
network then we can use the support
vector machine so SVM is support with
share vector machine which is another
machine learning technique and then
finally the Bears Mayo Bayes
classification so if you had a study to
come a computer science and engineering
you doe heard about this theorem Bayes
theorem or the new Bayes classification
most of the time people don't have read
this subject because it was so complex
but yeah now if you see you come eyes
coming back right so you have to learn
these to know what is predictive
analytics and you have to know these to
learn what is big data so ya neighbor
named after you as you know Bayes
theorem is something which is you're
just having us which has a strong
independent assumption between different
features so that is that is the Bayes
theorem so that is one more methodology
so classification is one more
methodology the next one is the time
series forecasting so predicting the
future time events
given the past history so as I said
earlier it so we took an example of fine
files coming into production systems so
predicting the future time events given
the past history so based on the past
arrival time of a file you can predict
the future arrival time of a file so
that is timeseriesforecasting so example
is the AR and ma so ma is a moving
average which which gets the trends in
the data data set so you you can get the
trends in the data arrival or from that
data so you can basically like a chart
kind of things you can arrive at trends
from that data set so our i'ma is
nothing but automated regression
integrated moving average model so that
is another type of time for testing
technique then triple exponential
smoothing or a halt water halt winter so
that is nothing but a forecast technique
to get the data points for repetative
data set so if you have repetative data
set then you can use that particular
methodology so that is time series
forecasting the next one is the
Association rule mining so if you want
to find items based on the occurrences
which are together so then you can use
that so you can basically create
associations and then mine the data so
for example the famous example is a
priori algorithm so and which is an
algorithm which is used for mining
frequent itemsets for boolean
Association rules so and also a periodic
or them if you know it uses bottom of
approach for determine so I think this a
priori algorithm
I remember reading it in such a called
data mining so at that time we we had
all these complex algorithms and we
never used to wonder about what is it
but now if you if I see it in my deal
one two key how I am going to use these
techniques in in my day-to-day life but
it's amazing that we already use these
techniques in our day-to-day lives and
we can see that for ourselves so these
are the different six different
methodologies using the predictive
analysis so next to the next two are
clustering and the text mining so
clustering is similar to
how you cluster your data or group your
data basically and then you mind that
data so for example k-means hierarchical
spectral density build algorithms can be
used so the final one is the text mining
so text mining is like you have a model
on the structure information in a
textual format or textual source so you
have literary text coming in and you
need to read those texts and then come
up with some statistical data and create
competitive analytics so if you are
aware about the natural language
processing or sentiment analysis so that
is the type of methodology which we will
be using for text mine so those are the
six methods which we are which we use
for analytics predictive analytics
finally the tools right so what are the
tools which are available out there
which can create or do predictive
analytics for us so he would have heard
all these tool names these are only a
few subsets there are lots of schools so
tableau ultrix MATLAB Apache Moffitt are
rapid miner
Alpine data lab so these are some some
subset of those which we are using for
predictive analytics but there are lots
of them out there but these are just the
tools so that is predictive analytics
and that is how you can't electric
predictive analytics to your real-world
entity or to your work life where you
want to use predictive analytics for
solving a big data solution so hope that
particular thing was helpful so hope you
understood what is creative analytics
and how you are using predictive
analytics in your day-to-day life so
that's it for this particular video so
made you again in the next video thank
