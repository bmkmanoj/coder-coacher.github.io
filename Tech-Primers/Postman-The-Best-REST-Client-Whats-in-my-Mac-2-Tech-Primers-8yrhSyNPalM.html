session of what's in my Mac we are going
to see the software called post postman
so what is postman
so postman is a rest client with which
we can do all the HTTP requests so you
know right the get poor sport all these
are all different HTTP requests which we
do so we can use this particular postman
as a rest line so what does postman
provide additionally to that so it has
something called history so you can have
all the history saved so for example if
I see a particular history it shows me
all the existing history of what
commands are used some time back so for
example from January 25 it shows all the
URLs which I had hit so so also it has a
sign-in option so if you see here if you
notice here you can sign in and sing
these particular options so these
histories will be stored there remotely
in the postman website so that also it
provides so let's check out how postman
Bach so I have a spine boot application
which has a controller called users
controller and I have different rest
endpoints so I have uses all you can
pass with name and you can load using
put so let's say I am going to search
for all users so if you see here there
are two different users are Jerry and
tech primers so once I hit all I got
that so let's say if I want to search
only for tech primers so I say tech
primers and then I get the response so
if you see here these are all recorded
in the history immediately also if let's
say I want to add some headers I can
even do that so I can set the headers
when I want to add it so for example
let's say I want to I create a new tab
I'm typing a get response so you can
have a header ie type content so if you
see here this automatically searches the
different keys and then the values as
well so if you see here it automatically
suggests the values so that's how you
can add the headers same way if you have
a post so you can add the body tag you
can add the body here itself you can add
a key value pair of let's say if you say
wrong
you can add the JSON directly here so
let's say if you want to add something
some response here I can I can do that
let's say I select all just copy this
and then I put it here I don't want the
ID so instead I say take Prime was 2
this is 1 so let's say I'm gonna load
this and suppose uh sorry I think in the
headers I have put so I should have put
application Jason I just say I'm going
to send the Jason it's going to return
me D ID vtec minus 2 so now let's say if
we go to the gate all users all and then
say all so it returns a tech times 2 so
that is what postman is used useful for
so I is it regularly at home at her at
office I have Firefox Firebug and the
rest client so I rest line there so
that's it for this video video guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
