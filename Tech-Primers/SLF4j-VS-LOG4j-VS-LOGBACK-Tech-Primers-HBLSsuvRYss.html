definitely written a logging statement
anywhere inside your codebase throughout
your career in this particular video we
are going to say what is the SL for J
log4j and log back doing in the log in
framework let's get started
before getting into the implementation
of what is this at four J what is log4j
and what is logged back let me write a
small logging statement and then I will
show you what the differences are
between these frameworks so in general
I'm going to use log SL for J so what I
do is in general we say that okay we are
using a cellphone but we are not really
using a cell for chain because SL for J
is just an abstraction which is provided
for us so I'm going to use the SL for J
logger interface there are lots of other
logger classes if you see Java dot util
dot logging is another logging framework
which is provided by Java and then there
is something called log4j provided by
apache there is something called log
back as well right so I'm going to use
the cellphone implementation here
directly okay and what we do is we use
the logger factory right we directly use
a logger factory and then we say get me
the logger which is configured in this
particular project so this particular
piece of code identifies what type of
logging is in this particular project an
idiot gets that particular logging
implementation so basically there is no
implementation provided by a cell for G
but SL for J is providing the
abstraction layer with the interfaces we
can use those interfaces to write our
logging so here the class name is
resource I am just gonna say resource or
class right and I'm going to log this
particular statement here as you say
logger dot info I'm just going to do an
info statement I'm just saying going to
find out it's going to find all right so
I'm just saying going to find out if you
notice here if I go inside this info
this info is nothing but err interface
ID the logger is an interface they
enforce a method here and SL for J if
you see there is no implementation right
now okay so if I click on this option it
is going to show me what are the
different implementations which are
available in this particular project so
if you notice here the implementation
which is available here is log back ok
so basically this particular spring good
project whichever I
I'm showing here is using log back as a
default implementation for a cell
fortune so I'm going inside and I am
adding a debug statement here so if this
particular implementation is hit this is
going to hit this particular debug
statement so I'm going to run a test I
have a unit test I am just going to run
this particular unit test in the debug
mode so that we know if it is getting
hit so initially I just put a breakpoint
here so that we know it is coming here
as well right so that I can show you
what is a cell for J and what is logged
back right so a cell for J is nothing
but the interfaces okay which are
provided for creating your own
implementation and in this particular
project we are using log back as an
implementation for in cell for chief
right if you want to write your custom
implementation for any command inside a
cell phone you can do that so that is
the basic idea of a cell for J where you
use the cell for J directly and you
don't have to change everywhere in your
code you use the logger factory which is
coming from a cell for chain and inside
the log of factory the logger factory
will be able to identify what
implementation is provided in this
particular code base right so here I am
using logger not info so it goes to this
interface so now the statement as break
has come here right let me resume this
particular statement okay
if you notice here it has now reached
the debug point where we have added it
for the log back class so if you notice
here this is the log flat class so
logger dot info has reached here so
basically the logging implementation of
log back has been triggered right in
this particular example so you can
notice that in the console my log has
got printed if you see here going to
find all this log has got printed so the
implementation which it is using here is
log back right if let's say you want to
use log4j right what do you do so you
can use directly the log4j library so
instead of this particular
class it what do we do we use a the
log4j smoker right so you just say lager
and instead of selecting the SL for J we
go and select the block for cheese right
I'll just remove this particular import
here
so we can directly select the locker
right I am going to give the same name
so instead of the lager factory what do
we do is we use the log4j dot get lager
right to do the resource or class right
and if I click on the debug option right
this is going to go to the info method
of the log4j implementation so if you
see here this is the log4j
implementation I just put a breakpoint
anyway it's going to come because if we
know that the class itself is completely
different it is not a self oj or the log
back it is directly going to the log4j
but notice here - exactly come to the
log for G so log4j is one of the
implementation of a logging framework
however if you notice here it is not
supporting SL for J directly right I am
not using a cell for jae-hyun right I am
directly using log4j only so log back
has direct support to the SL purchase or
log back is directly implemented from
their selfish
however log4j is not if you want to have
the SL fortunately supported you will
have to use a set for J over log4j
dependency right but if you notice your
log4j by default doesn't have support to
a cell for J you have to use a different
jar to do that so this is the difference
between what is a cell for J what is
log4j and what is it log back so log
back and log4j are different
implementations of logging framework SL
for j is an abstraction which can be
useful when you want to have a class
which is using all Excel forges and you
want to have the different
implementation in your project so you
don't have to come to every line and
change your code instead you just change
it at a single place right so log back
has direct support to a cell for J so it
is direct implementation of SSL for J
law for J even supports it but still if
you notice your if you can see log4j has
dependencies to SL for J internally in
the this is nothing but log back so if I
go to this so it has dependencies to the
SL for ship but if you see here it has
internal usage of SL for sure but it
doesn't use that directly so if you
notice we use log4j and V data info
internally it is
using log4j directly however from the
outside it it felt like okay you can't
use it right so that is the difference
between SL for J and log4j and the log
back frameworks which are there so both
as log4j and log backs our
implementation of SL for Qing they are
internally using a cellphone shake but
log back has a slightly flexible
approach when it comes to implementation
of SN for chains all right so it doesn't
matter which framework you are using you
should know how you are using it and
what they are okay
log back is the latest version log back
has additional features for itself for
the log4j so if somebody says what bitch
logging framework you are using you
should just mention whether you're using
log4j or log back not the SL for G
because SL for J is just the abstraction
Li which is providing just the
interfaces or the abstract classes right
so that's what I wanted to cover as a
part of this particular video hope you
guys understood what is log4j what is
this l4 J and what is log back if you
liked the video go ahead and like it if
you haven't subscribed to the channel go
ahead and subscribe to it meet again in
the next video thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
