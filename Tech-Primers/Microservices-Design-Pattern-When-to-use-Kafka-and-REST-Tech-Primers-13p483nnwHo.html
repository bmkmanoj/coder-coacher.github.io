have you used her messaging cues we know
why you use messaging cues and why you
use custom plates and where to use them
Burnham has asked me a question on when
to use the messaging cues like Kafka and
when should they go for direct
resemblance
let's see when to use that is an example
press the bell icon on the YouTube app
and never miss any update from tech
famously let's take the stock price view
of project which I had created as a part
of the designing microservices example
so I had created an architecture diagram
which we followed and we designed every
part of this particular architecture in
this particular example I had directly
used the rest template I did not use any
copper cues because it is on
straightforward synchronous requests and
I wanted the response immediately to be
pushed back to the UI or retrieved back
to the UI so that is the answer for the
question where when do I need to use
rest template when I want to have my
request to be synchronous I can use rest
templates if I need to use messaging
cues I will use them when I need to have
a batch processing system so let's say I
create a request and that till that
request point it could be a synchronous
message and once the request is
completed if I am processing some files
or if I am processing some sequence of
messages using some events then I can go
for queues so in case of Kafka when we
will go for Kafka is when you want to
have multiple publishers and you want to
split the load or partition the load of
the batch processing system into
different partitions that is when you go
for Kafka or else you can directly go
for any ActiveMQ or any messaging queue
Jamis rabbitmq or any any messaging
queue which is available in your firm
but you go for Kafka only when you have
batch processing system which are huge
and you want to use Apache spark or
as a strong or something like that you
can use Kafka in that case when you want
to partition the data and then process
them in a sequence so you can use the
Kafka topics when you have batch
processing systems if you don't have
grudge processing systems and you want
to have a straight-through processing
then you can use resistive Prescott's I
am NOT saying that you cannot use that
you can use
Kafka topics here but you won't yield
the full benefits of the Kafka queue
until or unless you do partition and
then process the message right if you
have very minimal message tone go for
Kafka because it will be useful when you
are processing huge amount of data you
are when you're processing huge amount
of events that has been Kafka queues are
useful if you have very minimal number
of requests and very minimal number of
flows then you can directly go for rest
cons right so that is when you decide
what so you can either use Kafka or you
can use rest so you can check out my
video on Kafka what is Kafka I have
explained what's Kafka so you can check
that that's it I wanted to cover
I just wanna turn so what Gordo had
asked if you have any similar question I
can answer that this is the new series
which I have created where I wanted to
answer each and every fewer question by
making a video so that you are able to
understand because if I make a Q&amp;amp;A video
I don't think everyone will be able to
get the sense of it because the
description might be different because I
am at answering more questions but I'll
mix more phone videos so that I am able
to answer each and every one of your
question so I hope that answered the
governance question so if you have any
queries do drop that in the comment
section below if you liked the video go
ahead and like it if you haven't
subscribe to the channel
go ahead and subscribe to it wait again
in the next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
