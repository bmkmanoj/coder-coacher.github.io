this particular video we are going to
see the top 5 cryptocurrencies which you
need to know about in 2080 let's get
started
bless the bell lichen on the YouTube app
and never missed any updates from tech
primers just for the record I have just
opened the G Dax exchange where all the
cryptocurrencies are traded majority of
the cryptocurrencies are traded in this
particular exchange so I have just
opened it just to see how volatile the
cryptocurrencies are this is the price
of Bitcoin the most popular
cryptocurrency if you see the market is
moving as and when we talk so we are
going to see how the market moves by the
end of this video right right now the
price of each Bitcoin is sixteen
thousand eight hundred and seventy US
dollars which roughly translates to more
than eleven lakhs in the indian ina
right you see how much both bitcoin is
so we are going to see at the end of
this video what is the current price he
as we as we were talking the price of
the bitcoin is rising and then going
down and in the last few days it has
gone down by 11 percentage yesterday it
was yesterday or day before yesterday it
was around $20,000 now it has come down
to $16,000 you see the volatility of
Bitcoin where the first one is Bitcoin
so Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and a
worldwide payment system as you all
might know by now it is the first
decentralized digital currency and the
system works without any bank or any
administrator so there is no central
body who's sitting and controlling the
transactions unlike any banks or any
regulatory body which is surrounded by a
back so there is no regulatory body
there is no central person who is
controlling bitcoins there are
distributed peer-to-peer networks and
you can do transactions across these
networks from one person to another
by buying or selling bitcoins it uses
cryptography to encrypt data and send
data across these peer-to-peer networks
it uses the underlying technology called
blockchain for transacting the
information from one block to another
block and securing across these
peer-to-peer networks if you had seen my
video on blockchain you will know what
is blockchain
bitcoin uses blockchain
the inventor of Bitcoin is named as
Satoshi Nakamoto but nobody knows the
authenticity or who's that either a
person or a group so that is why bitcoin
is more wallet and because people are
afraid that who has created it and
nobody knows who has created it Bitcoin
was initially found in 2009 and later on
it was widely spread and currently in
2017 which is volatile than anything
else in the world
and right now CMA has introduced the
more volatile product and the Bitcoin
which is the Bitcoin futures so this is
one type of cryptocurrency if you see a
Bitcoin dot o-r-g
is the official website of Bitcoin and
this is the first digital currency which
was created
well the next one is ethereum so
aetherium is another blockchain platform
so etherium created as a project to
create a blockchain application platform
and it also has a currency which is
using smart contracts so it uses smart
contracts and it has the same
infrastructure requirements as the
Bitcoin it is open source it is publicly
available it is blockchain based and it
is decentralized as well it uses its own
virtual machine called the etherium
virtual machine which can execute lots
of scripts using international networks
on different public nodes so it also
provides the crypto currency and the
currency name is called ether so it is
called as a token like how we call
Bitcoin as a currency so etherium has
currency called ether and you can see
that in this particular exchange so in G
Dax you can see ether here so this a
Korea and they claim that what all
Bitcoin has claimed it is smart it is
smart valid all those digital stuff so
I'm not going to explain everything
internally but know that aetherium is
also another currency a tourism currency
and a theorem is a project this was
initially created in 2014 and released
in 2015 it is written in C++ go and
asked it was proposed by Vitalik
Batarian so he is the creator or the
researcher of the etherium
cryptocurrency
the next one is the ripple so ripple is
another cryptocurrency which is a
payment protocol so ripple was a payment
protocol it is used in the real-time
gross settlement system and it also also
has the currency which is called ripples
it uses the ripple transaction protocol
for maintaining the distributed ledger
concept so it uses it is also open
source and it is using the distributed
protocol and also it uses it has the
consensus ledger has a native
cryptocurrency called X R P which is
nothing but ripples so it was initially
released in 2012 it is secured instant
and nearly free global financial
transaction of any size with no
chargebacks if you see Bitcoin has a
particular size each every block in a
Bitcoin is 1 MB however in Drupal you
can have huge or large size block in
that particular transaction
it has tokens which represent something
called fiat currency so create
currencies are nothing but which is
literally not present so for example you
have this frequent flyer miles in the
aircraft right or something similar to
boom by minutes or a pill as a currency
something similar that is how it is
different from did concurrency so ripple
is also based around a shared or a
public database or a ledger which uses
the consensus process which I said
earlier that allows payments exchanges
remittance in a distributed way it
doesn't use blockchain but it uses
something similar it uses the
distributed architecture however it does
not use blockchain technology
the next one is Bitcoin cash if you know
about Bitcoin you might be knowing about
Bitcoin cash as well if you have not
this is your time
Bitcoin cash is a fork of the
cryptocurrency Bitcoin it is just a
child of Bitcoin it was created in 2070
in August first the fork happened on
that particular day and all the
transactions from the Bitcoin have been
transferred to Bitcoin cash as well so
if you had owned a Bitcoin before August
1st 2017 you now own a Bitcoin cash has
been the advantage of Bitcoin cash over
Bitcoin is the same thing the block size
is increased from 1 MB to 8 MB in
Bitcoin you have 1 MB as the limit for
every block
however bit coin cash has 8 MB as the
block size
the next one is litecoin so litecoin is
another type of Bitcoin however it is
more lighter and quicker and cheaper so
Bitcoin cash is a fork of Bitcoin so the
performance security everything is same
as Bitcoin however like coin it uses
bitcoins technology but it is faster
quicker and cheaper than the Bitcoin or
bitcoin cash it is also a peer-to-peer
cryptocurrency it is open source as
there all these projects are open source
the creation and transfer of these coins
are based on the cryptographic protocol
and it is not managed by any central
authority like anything else so there is
no central authority in litecoin as well
but it is inspired technically from
Bitcoin however it is faster and quicker
and also cheaper than the Bitcoin
litecoin was initially released as an
open source project onto github directly
in October 7 2011 by Charlie Lee he is
the formal Google employee but icon
network went live in October 13th on
October 13th it was released on October
7th indeed hub and it went live on
October 13 in 2011 it is basically a
fork of the Bitcoin core client it will
icon also is a fork of that however it
has been modified over the core and that
is why it is faster so how is it
different from Bitcoin the right coin
aims to process a block every 2.5
minutes rather than the block change 10
minute cycle so blockchain takes 10
minutes to process the whole blocks
every block however litecoin does it in
2.5 minutes that is why it is faster the
developer also claimed that this allows
like coins you have faster transaction
confirmation
unlike bitcoins also light-cone uses
script in its proof-of-work algorithm so
proof of work is an algorithm which you
can see in Bitcoin so like go and use a
script in its proof of work algorithm so
light coins are generally more
complicated to create and more expensive
to produce than they are for Bitcoin
because it uses the sha-256 protocol or
the algorithm to encrypt the messages so
these are the
five different currencies which are
currently in the market and which will
be talked about in 2018
so let's come back to G tax exchange if
you notice the G tax exchange the price
of Bitcoin is changing every second I
don't remember exactly what was a price
when we saw initially but you can see
that every second there is a transaction
happening so this is the sell side is
the buy side which is green so there are
tons of transactions happening or the
Bitcoin people are selling on by and
effort JTACs is one particular exchange
where you can buy and sell bitcoins
Bitcoin cash etter and litecoin as well
and you who can notice that in the last
one day wait 24 hours the price changes
11 percentage those are the five
different cryptocurrencies which I have
encountered which I have seen as the top
five competitors of each other I hope
you liked the video if you liked the
video go ahead and like it if you
haven't subscribed to the channel go
ahead and subscribe to it maybe again in
the next video thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
