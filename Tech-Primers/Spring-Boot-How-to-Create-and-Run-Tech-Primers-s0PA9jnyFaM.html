to see how to create a spring boot
application and how to run it to make
our life simple spring has created a
started spring attire URL which is going
to create a spring boot application out
of the box from the dependencies which
we provide in this UI so if you see here
this spring initializer is going to
define all the variables which we need
for creating a web application or a
standalone application or a scheduler so
bitch is going to your spring boot as a
base so here you can select either a
maven or a Gradle project with the
version of spring boots so let's say I
select the stable version of springboard
which is 1.5 at one you can give a group
name here so let's say I like that
primals artifact or spring boot ammo so
here we have a dependency so for
simplicity I'm going to create only a
web application so I select that there
is also the full version of this
initializer where you can select the
packaging what type of packaging you
need either a jar or a wall what version
of Java you need 1.8 or 1.7 and say me
what language you need Java GUI or
coding also you can manually select the
dependencies here if you see here there
are a bunch of dependencies here
I'm not going through everything but for
simplicity we are going to use the web
application
let's click the generate project button
so once you click the generate project
button it is going to download a zip
with all the project structure so I
already have unzip it for our demo
purpose and I opened it in IntelliJ if
you see here this is the project
structure which it is going to kill so
you have a bomb dot XML so if you see
the palm dot XML this is going to have
the group ID which we mentioned there
artifact ID whatever we mentioned
version will be by default or the
package single type if you see there is
a parent tag so this is what is going to
define that our project is a spring boot
application so we define that we are a
child of this parent spring boot and
this particular version also the
dependencies are by default mentioned
here if you see here we are creating a
web application so you
already have the dependencies injected
automatically here so what about the
Java files so if you navigate through
the source main Java we have only one
Java file which is going to be the main
file which is unrated with something
called spring boot application
so this sanitation is going to tell your
spring boot framework that okay this is
my start so start from here we have an
application or properties file which is
currently empty but by default spring
boot when it boots up it launches and
add these application properties to its
context so let's start this particular
spring boot application so here how
starting is I'm not giving anything
extra I am just going to give the main
class and just giving what is the class
path that's it so this is going to bring
a web application basically a rest
endpoint under the port 8080 by default
so if you want to change the port number
we can go to the application properties
and then change that using a property
somewhat output so if you see here
Tomcat has started on port number 80 80
so let's see how's that so if you see
here there is no welcome page they have
not designed any rest endpoint so let's
write one so I'm creating a hello world
rest template also by default spring
boot uses spring MVC so if you are not
aware about spring MVC I will cover that
in the next video so see how
so if you see here this is going to
bring up a rest endpoint with the by
default /url let's restart springboard
application so this should return hello
from tech primers if you hit the same
you are we can also add different URL
paths just for checking how is it
working but yeah for now we'll just
check the default path so this has
started let's go to the URL and hit see
here we are we got the hello from tech
primers from this endpoint and this this
notation of writing a Java class is
basically coming from spring MVC if you
are aware about Jesse Jesse also has a
similar type of annotation related Java
styling but this is spring and easy so
that's it guys we saw how to create a
spring application and how to run it
let's meet in another video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
