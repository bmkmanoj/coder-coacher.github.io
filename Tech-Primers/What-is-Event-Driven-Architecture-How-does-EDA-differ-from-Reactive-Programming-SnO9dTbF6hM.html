are going to see what is event-driven
programming or the event-driven
architecture and how is it different
from the reactive programming which we
saw some time back so in few like maybe
few months ago a few weeks ago I had
created videos on what is reactive
programming and then I had created an
example of reactive programming using
vertex and also had created examples
using the reactive code or the Java Java
rx which our netflix has created right
so in this particular video we are going
to see what is the event driven
programming and how is it different from
the reactive program right so even
driven programming is nothing but so if
you see here the website I have right
now is e martin fowler's web site so he
has the creator blog post on what he
learned about what is even true in
programming and stuff like that so just
I try to summarize what he has done or
what he has told right so even driven
programming is where your actions are
taken based on the events okay so for
example if there is an event saying okay
new messages alright so based on that
particular event our actions will be
triggered so if there is a message that
got attacked you have to do process that
message so once you process that message
you can raise another even saying
processed okay so based on the process
there will be another micro service
which will be listening to these events
and then meat can be triggered so
basically there will be a message bus so
using the message bus all the
microservices can interact and based on
the event they can be triggered okay so
that could be like tens or hundreds of
microservices listening to the same
message but or the event bus there will
be even notifications generated on these
buses okay all these micro-services will
be listening to the events based on the
events the actions will be performed by
their corresponding microservices by
this way even you don't have to worry
about the server-side crash or the
client-side crash so if you see the
microservices
right when we saw microservices
architecture you had to be careful while
handling resiliency and scalability
right you have to be very careful when
handling the resiliency so when you do a
rest endpoint call from one micro
service to another you have to make sure
that particular micro service is up if
that particular micro service is not you
have to add some retry mechanism or EO
go ahead a circuit breaker mechanism to
retry it later or cut that particular
circuit right you don't have to do that
in even driven programming because
aventurine programming is all based on
events so the source micro service
doesn't have to know that okay the
destination micro service will be
consumed or not okay the source is going
to just create a notification and saying
okay see my job is done I don't care
whether it is processed or not I'm done
so the other side the consumed consumer
or micro services that will be like if
it is up it is going to consume that
event if it is down it's not going to
consume that particular message so and
there is there is no what you call
interdependency or just because the
consumer is down the producer doesn't
have to fail okay it just publishes
these messages to the event bus or any
message bus system and then the consumer
will consume these messages whenever
they are back okay so that is the major
difference between the normal
traditional micro service arrest calls
versus this even driven programming okay
so even driven architectures are
basically architectures which are
designed with events right so you will
generate events and based on the event
you will be processing the flow so
individuals my individual micro services
responsibility will be listening to the
even if the event does not make any
sense it will not do anything if they
even make sense then it will process
something and then it will publish
another event or it will just opposite
the data or it will generate whatever it
needs to do okay so that is the
event-driven architecture okay there are
lots of frameworks which has a created
based on these even driven architecture
so if you see recently Spring has
created something called spring cloud
stream okay I haven't used a spring
cloud strea stream but I see that okay
Spring has created a framework already
so it is called spring cloud stream so
maybe we can try the sprinkler
streaming in a way but it uses a Apache
kafka to strain the messages so what
happens is all these messages will be
published to the Kafka we produce it
will publish the Kafka and the consumer
will comes in from the Kafka queues ok
so that is the link loud stream so same
way for the reactive programming vertex
is there so how is the different as I
said earlier reactive programming is
there you will be you will not be
processing messages or events you will
be processing the data ok so in terms of
you enter in programming everything is
based on events okay so all the
handlings or the implementation will be
based on the events but in the reactive
programming in for example in frameworks
like vortex everything is based on the
data ok the major difference in the
event of an programming and the reactive
programming is data so we are in
reactive programming you will be taking
action based on the data okay so you for
example in the reactive programming you
trigger something and then you get an
acknowledgement and way you expect that
some data is going to come back but in
terms of even driven programming it's
not the case in event-driven programming
you will just trigger something and then
you don't know who will be processing
Intendant this guy will not even care
whether that is processed or not ok so
this is the source micros always want to
get care whether the destination has
process that message or not so that is
like an even joint programming in
reactive programming it is a subset of
honduran program but it it will be
processing the data so the major concept
of the reactive programming is the data
ok that is the major difference between
these two and if you are not aware what
about the vertex vertex is the framework
created by BN where and then it is now
moved into eclipse so the founder has
moved because it to eclipse now so it is
not directly up so I have made a video
on that as well you can check that also
so vertex also has lots of libraries and
API similar to spring and all these are
reactive taste so all the levels will
type more text or alternative ECBC here
they have all these libraries for the
Java JavaScript Ruby Ruby hot line color
etc so for all these languages they have
the library and then you can use the
okay here there are tons of library so
you can just cool keep on scrolling so
there are tons of libraries just play
around with vertex it is pretty good
actually if you are interested in
reactive programming you can take a look
at the libraries which are there inside
vertex so you can create microservices
with vertex s so apart from spring so
you would have seen me creating spring
spring discovery servers or the circuit
breakers whatever right so you can do
similar stuff inside vertex using
reactor program okay I haven't started
reactive programming videos spring has
created something called spring whip
flux which is a reactive programming
stream parallel to e string and be easy
in the spring plug the history so Spring
has also created that it is it is right
now in the release candidate phase so
they haven't launched it here so I think
by the end of the year it will be gone
but still they have 18-game lead
candidate we can try that out maybe in
some peaks I will just create some
videos on spring 5 which is coming up
with spring boot 2.0 which has this
reactive programming support ok so that
that's it but you know that's what I
want to discuss the event driven
programming biti reactive programming
and how how are they different that's
just for this particular video if you
like the video go ahead and like it if
you haven't subscribed to the channel go
ahead and subscribe me taken in the next
video thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
