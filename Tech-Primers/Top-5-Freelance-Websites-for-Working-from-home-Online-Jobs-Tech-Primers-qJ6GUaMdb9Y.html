freelancer or do you want to do
part-time work as a freelancer in any of
their websites
here are some of the top five websites
which I have encountered which I feel
will be a good fit for let's see what
are those top five in no particular
order press the bell icon on the YouTube
app and never miss any update from tech
primers the first in the list is
freelancer com
freelancer.com was started in 2009 it is
an Australian company the headquarters
for freelancer.com is in Sydney
Australia it recently acquired lots of
companies like vworker scriptlance etc I
initially before I started my career I
started working as a trail answer with
Bebo comm recently vworker comm was
acquired by freelancer.com I know how we
work or dot-com booked I have worked in
Mimi burka combat site for almost six
months as a freelancer I used to do
part-time work I used to go for courses
before I started entering my
professional life I had some time so I
joined we both could come and did some
freelancing so recently since
freelancer.com acquired that it is now
everything is on freelancer.com so I
personally have used the services of
people calm and there was no problem
with the clients there was no problem
with the arbitration if you don't
deliver project you will be charged
you'll be fined same way with the client
we'll be starting the project only when
the client gives the money to the
website so vivo occurred calm was very
good in that sense where if the client
doesn't respond to whatever you have
posted you will be getting the money
because the client has already given the
money to freelancer.com there are more
than 21 million users in freelancer.com
as of 2017 and it is one of the top
websites which people use for doing
freelancing job there are lots of jobs
about every type of category
I used to initially start off with PHP
because PHP was very easy I also used to
do logo designing or some internet
marketing sometimes they asked you to
write some script or something like that
I have tried all types of jobs but PHP
is very easy so you will have lots of
word work on the WordPress website if
you know about the WordPress website
which is written in PHP there will be
lots of jobs about that because all
these clients who provide these jobs are
mostly small
investors or maybe small small-time
shopkeepers or something like that I
have worked with like lots of people I
have noticed that these are not paid
shorts but they will be able to give you
enough number enough amount of money for
the work here doing so how things work
in fail answer dot-com is there will be
lots of projects you will have to bid
against those projects so let's say
there is a client who has offered you
some particular amount he might be
giving a limit and then he will be
telling you the requirements based on
the requirements you will have to come
up with an estimate of how much will you
charge and you will have to show your
portfolio portfolio or whatever you have
so that the client can pick up your bid
so it is not necessary that the client
will always go for the lower bit but he
goes for the quality bit so if you have
a very good portfolio built in the
freelancer.com website you can see lots
of projects coming in because I have
seen that myself
initially when I used to do when I used
to start off it was very difficult to
get a project but once I caught the
project it is very easy to get more and
more projects because the client know
that you have done lots of projects and
the client gave gave reviews as well so
everyone can see that review as well so
you can get easily hired once you start
off so that is how freelancer.com works
the next in the list is up book calm
upwork was formerly called as Elance
oDesk it was created as a merger of
Elance and oDesk companies Elance was a
company which was created in 1998 so
upwork got created as a part of those
merger it got created in 2015 when both
these brands merge together to form a
bigger entity they have the headquarters
in California and it is an American
company obviously because of that it has
more than 12 million registered users or
basically freelancers and it has 5
million registered clients and there are
more than 3 million jobs which are
posted annually which are more worth
more than 1 billion dollars so the
amount of money which gets in and goes
out is very high in a book usually
enough work the clients are allowed to
interview and then hire the freelancers
or the freelancer agencies through this
platform let's say you have a team of
five people who are going to be
freelancers you can create a tea trail
answer agency and then you can work with
up work clients so the clients have more
flexibility to choose their freelancers
as well the platform offers a timesheet
application that tracks the time and
takes the change shorts of the
freelancers book whenever the freelancer
is working so it literally takes a
snapshot of what is happening in your
desk because it can keep track of your
work because you will be paid based on
hearts apart from that they have
different types of accounts you have a
free account you have a pro and
enterprise even the freelancer website
has the similar account which I didn't
cover so you can start off with a free
subscription where you will be able to
get the basic options where you can
still get projects you will be getting
projects once you are comfortable with
the website then you can go for the pro
or the enterprise version once you are a
full-time freelancer or part-time
freelancer and you are comfortable with
it
next in the list is fiver calm
fiverr.com is a global online
marketplace which offers you tasks and
services similar to the other websites
however it does that for $5.00 and hence
the name fiber you can get a job done
starting at 5 dollars which is pretty
low right it is pretty good when you are
starting new so if you are a new
freelancer if you are a new developer
and you want to start off with
freelancing you can even start off with
fiber because the basic price for bid
can start with done' file so you can get
projects for all of five and there are
clients who will be giving you small
works and you can start off with those
small works and then you can grow
basically along with the platform once
you move to a higher standard you once
you build your portfolio then you can
move to a different website but you can
even stay with fiber if you are
comfortable with it it was created in
2010 it is still a startup it provides
various categories of the marketplace
like the other websites like graphical
graphics and design design marketing
your fun style programming and
Technology business music and audio
video animation writing and translation
etcetera
the next in the list is guru.com
guru.com is another free marketplace it
allows companies to find freelance
workers for commissioned work it was
basically created in 1998 in Pittsburgh
penance Libya guru.com has a smart
matched technology which can match their
resumes and other information about the
job applicants to the job they have some
smart algorithm which can match easily
so the companies can easily hire
freelancers based on their matching
criteria similar to how we have the
reviewing process in detail and SOCOM
guru.com also provides the same you'll
be able to rate declines and the clients
will be able to rate the users as we are
intern info return apart from that there
are lots of services which guru.com
provides for the free subscription
the next in the list is top ten
top talent that is what it means it is
another American company which provides
freelancing software engineers designers
and financial experts to different
companies it was founded in 2010 unlike
the other websites in the top town you
will have to go through rigorous amount
of process in order to get hired if you
notice their websites is higher the top
3 percentage of the freelance talent so
you will have to go through so many
amount of face-to-face interviews and
tests in order to get recruited unlike
other companies top-tall doesn't have
any office space it is completely
virtual so there is no physical office
place anywhere in the world everyone
works remotely even the employees of top
time they work remotely there is no
physical presence of top 10 anywhere in
the world that is something different
from the other companies so it is
completely virtual in number 2015 top
tile was also ranked to be number one
fastest growing talent marketplace in
North America by Deloitte in April 2016

bridge which is another online platform
for the freelancers and it got lots of
talents from there as well
