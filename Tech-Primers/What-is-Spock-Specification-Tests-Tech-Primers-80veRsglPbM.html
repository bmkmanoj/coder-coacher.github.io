latest trend
instead of writing a giant test people
are writing specifications using spock
Rimbaud hello everyone in this
particular video we are going to see how
to create tests using Spock framework
let's get started
so I have already created an example
some time back when I was showing some
example related to groovy test so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to use the
same project so that I am going to write
a new test for the same project using
spot framework so this might be the
groovy project which I was using
previously to write some test kits so
let's see if it is the same yeah so this
is the same class and the same test for
the project which I had used previously
for writing some test cases in groovy so
that I can show you girls how it was
useful so now what we're gonna do is
we're gonna create a specification test
for this particular class using this paw
print on sugars just nothing but a Java
class we're just writing your test case
in groovy you can even write it in Java
as well so in this particular example
I'm just go ahead and show it in groovy
because it's much easier to create entry
so instead of the groovy jail unit what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna mention Spock
here
so that IntelliJ can by default since
that I need Spock but before doing that
we need to add the dependency for Spock
inside our code base so what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna add Spock dependency so
this is the dependency which I have
already used so I have just created a
template life template that's why he
came quickly so what I'm gonna do now is
I'm going to create the best case so
using IntelliJ you can just say all
Tector do a create test and then you can
just select Spock and this automatically
creates these boxes for you so once you
save Spock what happens with the Spock
text is it creates a specification point
so if you notice here this creates a
specification file right so mean why I
think it is downloading the dependencies
for the Java a groovy version so let it
download but we can go ahead and get
started okay so we have just created a
specification yes so if you notice what
this is extending being specification so
this is coming from Spock
so you have to write this in that
function so when you run this for
supplies
test it will be running using be
offended right so I'm gonna use the de
da F so in this test I'm going to say so
you can see this is a phase pass test so
if you don't know what a space bus so
this is nothing but when you have
numbers in the count of three so if our
number is divisible by 3 then you say
this if the number is divisible by 5 you
say buzz if the number is not divisible
by either 3 or 5 please save his ass so
that is what it's all about
which again small game actually so I'm
gonna say short return please write
because you know a test case we want to
return it as this and then you can save
win so in the when you can mention what
this is going to signify right and
specification we've signify what is
event and the thing right so you can
signify we are going to flavor 3 right
and then we just say BEF first birth to
new whispers okay we just get a new
piece purse we don't need simple notes
and in the tenth part we're just going
to say should be this and we're gonna
say face not actually you can do that
here this play of three I'm going to
return this and store it in a name so
let's see what is the value here so we
need to do an assert I'm just gonna do
and I sort of play
so let's see if we can get this running
but meanwhile looks like the groovy
dependencies are getting downloaded but
let's check what is it can only document
to you why - I think this box came up it
is downloading it mother Tom finally our
dependence is quite downloaded now we
need to go to the tests and let's see if
we can run the test yeah we notice here
the dependencies are now getting
detected right yeah you can see these
patterns right these are nothing but
running as test so you can just run this
particular term as a test so IntelliJ
identified that these are tests and we
can just directly run them so this is a
specification test let's see how does it
show up in the UI in the IntelliJ right
because we have not annotated anything
with tests but IntelliJ identified these
as test and if you notice here the name
of the test is should return test should
return that face whatever and these are
just the specification you have the
better dead so you have specification
written so that way you can easily
identify what was the test written for
okay and here you have used the groovy
asset but you can use any other result
from the hamcrest or any other API all
right so this is how you can write a
specification test so using groovy
similar way you can write it for Java as
well so there is nothing big in that so
you instead of using the Java instead of
using the crew B notation you just start
writing the tape in Java
like you care you have to give another
name here with return type void and then
you can do the event and then you can
just start typing details and stuff like
that right so in general what is this
Spock righteous pork is as I said is a
framework so for writing specification
tests in Java and groovy so it is
slightly different from the JUnit
because you can write it in a different
way it it
explains your test so when you want to
write some specific tests which people
want to understand then you can use
specification in that case so internally
it has a genuine runner inside Spock so
that is why it is intelligent was able
to easily identify that this is a test
case right also the Spock is like
heavily inspired from the J unit R Spec
J MOC mockito Scala groovy and Vulcans
and other lots of framework so that is
why Spock is different likes boxes for
Spock has like almost mixture of
everything so right from groovy till
your J unit right okay to one stuff so
it is all there in side the Spock itself
so that is what Spock is all about so
one of the viewer has requested me to
create a test in Spock so he wanted me
to write a test for the spring boat
application in Spock but before that we
need to understand what is 4k so that is
why the I created this video so that we
can see what is this Spock framework and
what is the specification all about so
you can adjust write the specification
for a test case for example for this
particular test case you are writing
what is the Ben and what is he 10 so
these are the different specifications
for that particular test so this is how
we can write a Spock test so you can you
can do mocking as well internally
ideally you don't have to do mocking but
internally if you are writing a J in it
and you want to mock some external
service you can do that as well so in
the next video we will see how to write
some Spock test for the spring boot
controller or the spring good
application so that's it for this
particular video we do get in the next
video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
