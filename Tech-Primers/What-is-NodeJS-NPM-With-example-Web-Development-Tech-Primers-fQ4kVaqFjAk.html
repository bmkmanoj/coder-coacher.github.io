are going to see what is node
what is NPM and how these are the new
things in the web technology right
so if you notice previously we would
have used a web application right we
would've created at g2w application
people have created a JSP servlet and
stuff like that
we would have created a HTML page and we
use to use JavaScript for validations
only and then we used to write the
backend in Java code right so those
things that we see if you had seen the
growth of the technology those things
have changed in the recent times and
Java Script is now becoming not only the
client-side programming language but
also the server-side programming
language as well so let's see what is
this node and how is it letter to
JavaScript so if you basically see no
node the name itself suggests it's no
J's
okay node is basically a JavaScript
runtime server okay which is built on
the Chrome's v8 JavaScript engine so if
you see here the Chrome browser it has a
v8 JavaScript engine with which the
browser runs the JavaScript files are
not so node uses the same thing so no
DOJ's or no J's uses the Chrome's v8
JavaScript engine for running your
JavaScript code so basically you don't
need a browser to run the code so in
general what we do is we used to write
validation sometimes some like maybe ten
years ago or five years ago right so we
used to write validations only in the
HTML page and these are run only on the
browser so basically inside the browser
you have a JavaScript engine right so
because these are Java code right so it
needs a runtime environment so basically
chrome uses v8 JavaScript engine so no
J's uses the same Chrome's v8 JavaScript
engine to run the JavaScript code so
basically you can write a server code in
JavaScript itself right so that is the
new thing so no written node J you can
write JavaScript code on the server side
okay you don't have to write only the
client-side code okay you do not have to
do only validations in JavaScript so you
can do all types of operations on the
server side so basically this no J's
will act as the rest server or something
and then you can access the endpoints
via
some specialty P URL from the angular or
any other web application so any other
web framework or like from there you can
directly hit the HTTP URL and then this
back annual can be in no J's it's not
necessary that okay you have to write it
in a particular language you write it
only in Java or you are try to only in
Python or Perl or something you can
write it in any language and no J's is
another language so no J's is going to
be a like a server and you can write
JavaScript code in that okay and you can
access that from your browser or from
the client side basically so we will see
a small program with no J's implemented
on the server side and we'll see how to
do that so before getting into the node
J side we need to know about NPM so in
Java if you had worked with Java it you
would have known about maven so maven is
a build to write so and also it has a
maven repository basically so basically
you have a repository will all the jars
are there rate so we go to the
repository and pull all the jars which
we need for our project so save me for a
Java Script to function we have lots of
jars which are developed by open source
community and other companies which are
contributing these to these open source
communities right so they need a common
repository right so that is why NPM was
created so NPM is nothing but node
package manager
so this is going to manage all the
packages for the node of node
application so basically as any
JavaScript application so NPM will host
all the artifacts for the JavaScript
related stuff so all the UI and web
related stuff will be inside NPM and you
can use NPM to pull that out and then
you can use it in the node.js project so
we are going to see how to create a
simple node.js project so for that we
need to use node we need to use NPM
basically okay so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to say so let's see what
version these are running in right so
currently I have I don't have any latest
version but I have
NPM and node install so if you see here
these are both of separate installations
okay so no J's you can download them
from the
set here if is notice here you can
download the latest version of mode here
and also the NBN as well ok you can
download that so I have these versions
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a I'm just going to create a
package called a node example ok and I'm
going to go to node example it's going
to clear ok so if you notice here I'm
inside the node node example package so
I'm going to create my package so I'm
going to I need the basic skeleton stuff
right so I'll say NPM in it ok when i
initialize an NPM project it is going to
ask me some predefined variables which I
need to sit so it is a command-line
interface so it if you notice here it is
asking what is the name of the project I
am saying node 1 and it is asking me
what is the version I'll say 1.0 why
would I say 1 0 0 I will just say 1 not
0 okay but it is it is not allowing me
because NPM has a naming convention for
the versions ok it can have three levels
of versioning system so that is why if
you notice here even if I give 1 or 0 it
did not allow me so I'll say ok I'll
retain it ok in the description I can
say a simple hello world program ok so
the entry point so basically whenever
whenever you start your server you need
an entry point right in Java we have
some main methods public static void
main and that get started so same way in
JavaScript you have to provide an entry
point so in this case we will provide
the entry point as indexed or change so
by default it is suggesting the inductor
indexed or J I am going to say ok it in
it so tests come on so if there are
tests right written in your JavaScript
so you can write JavaScript tests as
them so what is the command which you
will be giving so what is the profile or
task name which you will be giving like
May when you run some tasks click there
contest so same way for tests it is
asking so right now we are not going to
do any tests so I'll just skip that part
save me what is the git repository so
basically every project in NPM is all
like most of the time it's all in get so
it's all open source right if you notice
all the gate NPM
these are all open so so anybody can use
it anybody is free to use it so I'm not
going to give any a git repository for
now and then you have some keywords
which you can say and just say hello -
word just for simplicity and then it's
asking for the author I'll just say tech
demos ok and then it's asking me the
license I'm not going to say anything so
once I am done it's going to create
something called package tour Jason
okay so package a jason is similar to
the form wrote XML in maven bold ok
so based on this package for Jason your
NPM is good to behave okay so if you
notice the the package or Jason is
present here so I'll just create the
touch and just a touch index for js5 so
that I'll open the project in the ID so
I have Visual Studio code here
okay I'm using Visual Studio code to
open the web project so I'm just saying
open same old example okay so I'm just
opening the node example project if you
notice here the index O'Jays is empty
and if you notice package so Jason is
having the data so whatever we gave here
whatever we gave as a part of our
variable right so as you zoom this a
little bit for you to see okay
now I think it's better just soon okay
so if you notice here the package
notation has the name the version number
the description whatever we gave the
main class or the entry point and then
there is something called scripts so
when you run your NPM command you can
basically configure stuff here so you
can configure test or you can configure
any custom tasks or the script which you
want to run okay
keywords are nothing but how do you
identify your package based on keywords
so nothing else author as you know it's
just author name and licensing what type
of licensing this particular package is
related to okay so let's go ahead and
create our index so Jason index which is
right so I'll just paste the code which
I already have so what this is doing is
it this is just a
basic HTTP server so if you as I said
earlier right so and nodejs is going to
be bringing the server and you can write
code in JavaScript so if you notice here
this is just basic JavaScript so what
I'm doing here is I'm saying that I need
the package called HTTP okay because I
need to expose this node.js over as HTTP
server okay so that's what I'm doing
here if you notice I'm just saying get
that particular module and I need to
create a server ok once I create the
server listen to the port 8081 okay I'm
just saying it isn't to the port 8081
and I'm saying if if somebody listens to
that port what should I do
so if you notice here this is just a
callback if you see here this is just a
callback for Hoover Liz over hit C port
8081
okay so what I'm doing is I'm just
sending the response back so basically
the question response is what we get
okay
so I'm just saying that responds right
back us 200 so I'm just saying that okay
make this a successful response okay and
I am saying that okay do a hello would I
am just saying hello youtube for the
front side so I'm just going to return
hallo YouTube and in the console and
just printing some log so that we can
see if this is started or not whether
our node server started or not okay so
how to start the node service so this is
the basic program to just return hello
YouTube for the rest endpoint 80 81 on
the port 8081 with a local local host
because we are running in in local and
then i have just a console oh so how do
we run this right so we can say npm
start so npm start is the generic start
command so what happens is it will start
the it will start the whole server but
if you notice here in the scripts we
have not mentioned that right if you
notice here what we have done is we are
not mentioned that NPM start right if
you instead we can mention that NPM
start inside the NPM start what we are
going to do is we are going to say node
and then we are going to pass the index
or chase right so I am just going to
save this file and I am going to run to
same command again NPM
start if you notice here it is doing the
same thing okay but it is saying failed
to do this is because we have not done
nvm installation Sam couldn't say npm
install' so npm install is like maven
install so what it will do it will try
to create dependency so if I had any
dependencies right now I don't have any
dependency in my packetization but if I
had a dependency here it will try to
download those particular modules from
the npm repository okay so I will just
done the npm install so that should be
able to get all the stuff which we
didn't have so I'm just saying no index
or JSON why is it feeling I think there
is a why is it so run handled error
event so I think this port is already
running so I am just running something
on the port already so what we can do is
we can change this to a different port
so what I'll do is I'll just change it
so 8080 to okay and then just change it
here let's run this again
so basically NPM start should do the
trick but I I think this is because of
the port port issue all right if you
notice here I just did a NPM start okay
and it is showing me de log so we're
running at 80 82 so this basically means
that my server is running on the port 80
82 or whatever port I decide whatever
port I change it is running there now
let's hit that port from the browser
alright so I'll just say T 82 if I hit
this 8080 - if you notice here
hello YouTube has come whatever we
printed here in the India response here
so we just say response on it it is down
returning the response for us okay so
this is how you start a node.js server
so basically if you notice here this is
a JavaScript code however it is acting
like a server for us and I am accessing
from a browser using a port number
because this node.js is running on that
particular port number and I am getting
the response back here so basically no
J's is recently been famous because lots
of companies are using node.js because
it's way
faster than other traditional
application service like up a batch of a
tomcat and other stuff right so this is
much faster because if you notice the
website right no J's so if you notice
here what they are saying is no J's uses
an event-driven non-blocking i/o model
that makes it lightweight and efficient
so no J's uses the package system end
game and it is largest ecosystem of the
open source libraries in the world
so that is why everyone is using no J's
right now if you see Walmart is using
eight instances of node.js or maybe more
now I don't know how many can use so
they have no JS instances so whenever
you hit their website the website
requests will be routed to the node.js
instant from the node.js it can
internally go to Java processes but no
J's is going to be the first part or the
first line of the entry point for any
requests coming in to the Walmart
Walmart server so that is the usage of
node.js in real time in Romans because
node.js is very faster lightweight and
you can write lots of stuff with the
chain JavaScript code which you wrote in
the UI side okay it's not that okay you
have to write a JavaScript Java Java
back-end only so you can write anything
in JavaScript as well using the node.js
so there are lots of other engines which
are coming up with similar kind of
concept but no J's is using the Chrome's
v8 JavaScript engine and most of the
angular apps and everything which which
we use we use this node for local
testing basically if you want to test it
locally so why do you need to start your
Apache server right so let's say I am
running locally from my IntelliJ or the
Visual Studio code right so why do I
need a heavyweight service if you notice
here this is so lightweight that okay
just started immediately and I didn't do
anything so it didn't do so many things
it's very lightweight and I'm able to
now get it up and running okay so that
is why people use node.js it is very
lightweight and it is very powerful and
it is very fast so people use that as a
entry point and then from there they
transfer to Java processes internally
but that is the usage of node
okay in these subsequent videos we will
be seeing how to create angular
applications but I just wanted to give a
heads up of what is no J's what is NPM
because we will be using these terms in
the angular world so when we are doing
web applications you generally seen that
we use NPM install and then you give
something the reason for that is NPM is
like maven so NPM is a repository for
all the open-source libraries so people
go ahead and pull those libraries from
the NPM repository and then use it so
internally in some companies they use
their own library on that repository so
like how we have for maven people who
have used this Nexxus repository
exciting company so same way for NPM as
well you can use your own repository and
inside the company you can use from that
repositories so NPM is just for the
external world but internally an
organization can have their own
repository and you can get the libraries
whatever you require only from that
deposit so that is a big big enterprise
companies work if they don't want to get
everything from the open-source
community they just take it from the
open-source community they do some scans
on them on the node modules whether
there are any vulnerabilities or
something and then they keep it
internally so that people can use it
internally okay so that is the node.js
and NPM so that is the relationship
between was NPM and what it is no J's so
