video we are going to see what our
microservices microservices our
implementation or a service-oriented
architecture pattern which with which we
design our application for a flexible or
independent deployable software so the
ideal solution of a micro service would
be a lightweight application which you
should be able to deploy independently
of the difference of this so let us take
a traditional monolithic application if
you see this particular diagram shows a
traditional application where we have
different sources connected to the same
application of the source so for example
website URL the desktop app the mobile
app everything connects to the same
back-end server and then we have a
database connectivity visit so this is
called a monolithic application so every
functionality is embedded within the
same service with which we have so let's
say for example let's take a website
called amazon.com Samba or flipkart.com
so they don't follow this particular
platen because every request is
independent right so for example the URL
particular will comes from the browser
but there is a desktop app and do you
have a mobile app so let's say if the
background back-end services John all
these different sources are affected in
order to eliminate those so they follow
the microservices pattern so how does
the microservices pattern look like so
let's say if I convert this particular
architecture into a microservices
pattern this is how it looks like so you
have different website URLs different
desktop app you have a different mobile
app all these requests converge into
different processes which are split into
basically smaller proxies so for example
here we have a separate web UI component
in you have a API gateway which connects
to different components combined one
component component a connect to
different database or data sources or
services so this is how we split
basically a monolithic application into
a my micro service so I'll reiterate
what is the micro service so micro
services are an implementation or a
service-oriented architecture which
provides us with Liberty in and
independently flexibility in deploying
an application independently so for
example if let's say you want to change
this particular component you can
independently just deploy this
particular component so that is the
advantage of micros
Microsoft simply these are all
lightweight components so you can it's
not a huge service or a huge process in
itself so if you see just bristles tcu
of Amazon so he follows this principle
of tupiza rule so what he says that is
the team which develops an individual
micro service should be fed with two
pieces so that is that is what his
strategy so everyone has their own way
of implementing or the idea of doing
micro services this is what I have
gotten oh come wata in you thank you for
watching
meet you again in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
