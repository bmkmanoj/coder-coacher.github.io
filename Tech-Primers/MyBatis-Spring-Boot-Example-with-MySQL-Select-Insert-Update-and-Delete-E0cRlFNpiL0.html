are going to see the remaining crud
operations involved mb database using
the mybatis
in a springboard application so in the
previous video if you had notice we saw
the insert on the select statement so
one of the viewer he requested for the
update and the delete statements also so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
quickly show that so before going into
the video so I will just summarize the
what we did as a part of the previous
one
so what we did is we added the my sequel
database details in the application
properties and then we added the mapper
ok the user mapper is the mapper class
which we will be using so mybatis will
be using this particular map a class to
execute the query
so mybatis is not similar to hibernate
hibernate is a ORM entity framework
mybatis is just a framework to do
mapping between the functions and the
queries ok you don't have to create
entities like how we do inside hibernate
ok instead you can just create any model
and then you can use that model ok if
you notice here I have created the model
called users which is nothing but a
simple pojo ok and also we have created
the mapper so mapper has select and set
we are going to add update in the delete
statement as well ok and these are just
exposed as rest endpoints so if you
notice here I'm using spring MVC to
expose these rest endpoints so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to add one more
restrain point to do one update so if
you see be said update but we are doing
an insert what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say that update users' I'm just
going to add a rest endpoint ok
so I'm going to say that update all the
data which had YouTube so let's say
delete users ok I'm just going to add a
simple one so that can get the response
back ok
so what we are going to do here is I am
going to create a new object okay so I'm
going to use the same name which is
YouTube which we used before
so users dot set me YouTube right
and the only thing now I am going to do
is I'm going to change the salary to
twenty five five okay
so that way we will know that okay
whether this already has got changed on
so we are going to give the same mapper
and we are going to do an update and we
are going to pass these users entity
okay and finally you are going to do a
find out right okay so this is what one
endpoint is going to do let's create the
update statement before that we are
going to create a delay statement as
well so we are going to do a delete as
well so let's do that so what I'm doing
is I'm just passing the name as YouTube
and I don't need this and I will say
delete and finally I'm just quitting
okay so let's go and create this user so
I'm just going to create this particular
method okay so what I'm going to do is I
am going to annotate this particular
method with the add update okay so add
update is an annotation coming from a I
better save it so you see here it a
goddess gives that so I batteries or my
battery so in fact my bet has got
renamed right that is but yeah it's
almost the same right so what I'm going
to do is I'm just going to type then
update query here so I'm going to say
update users users is our table so great
users I am going to set the salary equal
to hash curly brace of salaries that is
how you reference a value from the model
here into this particular query okay so
that is the notation inside my batters
okay so what we are doing is we are
doing an update user set salary bears
name equal to
me because we need to set the salary
only for that particular name site plus
what we are doing here right so the next
one is deletion so let us create the
delete method what did it we need to do
something similar so what we will be
doing is we will say delete and we will
be running the delete users that
actually should see Italy from users
where name equal to a stag name okay so
that's what we are doing here so what we
are doing is we are doing an update on
the name and delete on the name okay so
we are updating the salary for that
particular name and we are deleting all
the users with that name so and also we
have exposed that as a resistant point
here so there are no arrows right so we
are going to delete YouTube and we are
going to add so as a part of update we
are adding anyway with some other sundry
and then as part of update we will just
update users we will just update the
salary and that's what we are going to
see here so let me start this particular
project okay so if you want to know in
depth about what we did as a part of the
project creation you can check my
previous video so in that I have clearly
mentioned what each does but in this
particular video I am just adding the
update and the delete commands which got
missed in the previous video this was
coming up so yeah it has come up under
the port 9 0 9 5 so what I am going to
do I'm going to peruse so initially what
are all the users do we have knitted
fester HIV notice here I have Peter Sam
YouTube 23 23 so what I'm going to do is
I don't want you to buy I am going to
delete all the users with YouTube so I
have the rest endpoint continued right
if you notice here it has delete and
queried all so if I still say user slash
all it is going to give me the same
result so basically all the data which
was which were having their name as
YouTube got deleted okay this particular
my better my secure
databases running in my machine right
now okay so now we need to update
something up we need to add our users
database so I'm going to do update so if
you notice here we got the YouTube data
but inserted but now I am going to call
the update users it is going to update
my salary to something else if you
notice here the alter got changed okay
so that is what the update and the
delete commands are doing right now so
if you see here how to write this any
map errors we have to annotate them with
update or delete or the corresponding
crud commands then you can give a query
directly so mybatis is not like
hibernate if you see hibernate on the
spring JPA you do not have to create the
queries like this here you can just
directly use the repositories which are
there the credit repositories or any JPA
repository or any repository picture
which is there you can directly use that
and then all they find all and update
insert queries save queries are
automatically created based on the
repository which were created based on
the model and the primary ID which we
are going but here we do not have to do
that so you can directly map the queries
here so previously my bat is used to
have the XML notation so what we used to
do is we used to raise the interface you
have an XML file the interface on the
XML file is used too much but now it has
now moved to the annotation level so you
can add annotations like these and then
you can add the queries directly here so
that the values from the arguments will
be reference in society annotations and
that that will be used for computation
so you can see here what we have done is
eyo created users as a part of the
insert we have updated the users we have
deleted things and also we have finally
queried to users okay so this is what
we'll be doing this is how it looks like
when you use
mybatis insider spring bootie
application if you ask me personally my
vertices fastest
ten spring JPA I have used both my
batters and displaying there be a spring
JPA and if you use along with a minute
this bit slower but it gives us the
flexibility of modify not having to
write all these queries yet but apart
from that I feel my batters is faster so
if you if you have an application which
is a very memory intensive and you don't
want to use much of memory then you
you can use my batteries in that case
okay so this is how you create a mybatis
application used crowd operations for
interacting with a my sequel database
okay that's it for this particular video
meet again in the next video if you
liked the video go ahead and like it if
you haven't subscribe to the channel go
ahead and subscribe to it that's it for
this particular
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
