particular version of a particular
library
have you guys faced any issue with the
dependencies resolving those dependency
conflicts in this particular video we
are going to see how we can resolve the
dependency conflicts inside maven how we
can leverage maven dependency tree to
resolve these conflicts I am going to
have a demo project and I'm going to
show you how we can resolve a dependency
conflict when we upgrade a particular
version of a library let's get started
this is the basic maven project which I
download from github so this is not my
project but I just took a maven example
with a pretty decent amount of
dependencies which are in the inside
that particular project so so I'm not
going to show you what is done in this
particular project I'm just going to
show you how an upgrade can affect your
project so if we see here IntelliJ by
default provides something called the
maven projects window where you can see
the different dependencies for a
particular module so this is a
particular this is a project which is
using the Java EE 6 ok it has lots of
dependencies it has enterprise Java X
Enterprise it has spring both dependency
it has spring AOP dependency it has some
jo-jo pause dependencies also have any
dependence right so what we are going to
do is we are going to build this
particular project and see if this
particular project is building to make
sure that everything is perfect
initially right so this is the current
working project which is there which is
out there ok I'm just going to do a
clean install I just did a clean install
I just collect I selected the clean and
install and then run this particular
command if you are using command prompt
you can just say maven clean install so
there is no difference between these two
right you can do that as well so I just
never it's this particular UI true so
yeah if you see here the build is
successful
ok so M a1 dot war got created as a part
of this particular path so now I decide
that okay it is using springboard ok
and there is a new version of spring
boot and I want to upgrade this
particular project
who then newer version extreme right
let's say I'm going to do a minor
upgrade all right I'm gonna upgrade this
to 5.0 1.5 of 7 right it's just a minor
upgrade it's just one version of people
so let me do an upgrade right I just
I'll just do a maven tree input so that
it redownload the new package the
download is completed so I'm just
triggering the same clean install
command okay let's see if the project is
still working so what we did is we just
upgraded to the spring code dependency
with just one version but we don't know
what god affected right so if you see
here there is
over here right okay because this is
just a small version of good and if you
notice here there is no upgrade but
there could be side effects during one
time I'll show you a sample right so for
example this is a springboard version
which is wonderful at seven and
internally if you see it uses spring
version 4 or 3.1 right however if you
notice there is all also a jar called
spring AOP which is using four or three
good thing right so there are two spring
versions in this particular project so
that is 4.3 or 10 and there is for
torque ff1 and if you notice your inside
spring AOP right if you clearly notice
here right this is saying spring core is
omitted due to conflict with the folder
plate at 11 which okay because there is
a conflict of this particular version
which is there here since this is just a
small jump there is no issue right so
since this is just a small jump there is
no issue and the build cot succeeded
however how do you resolve this right so
either what we can do is we can upgrade
spring AOP to 11 okay once you do this
if you're a fish this maven 3 input if
you just limp or if you see here it will
not show anything you just say omitted
because it is a duplicate but it is the
same version or what you can do is you
can exclude this particular let's say
you want to use the same version right
for some reason there could be a case
where you want to use the same older
version of spring in that case you have
to say exclusions so you will have to
use the tag called exclusions and you
just say what artifact to be explained
so you can just select the artifact so
here I'm going to say spring AOP right
and the group ID for that is spring
framework right
so if you see here this is the group ID
and is it so this particular spring AOP
will be neglected from this particular
article so our spring core right sorry
the spring core was the one we saw as a
conflicted so I just did that let me the
import this project you will notice that
inside this if you notice that there is
no conflict for the spring clue because
we excluded that from the spring board
if you had not excluded this this would
have directly taken the 4.3 dot level
version which spring board what you see
here the spring contact is forward 3.11
so you can do this type of exclusions as
well so there could be some side effects
because we are exploding our higher
version however if let's say there is a
lower version okay if let's say we are
using a 1.5 or 6 and here we are using 1
or 4 or 3.11 the other way around till
this make sense sometimes right you
never know if there are any internal
dependencies that it might get affected
but still you should know that using
exclusions has its pros and cons
whenever you know that it is going to
work you can use exclusions if you are
not sure make sure you confirm that it
will work if with exclusions that is
when you you can use exclusions and this
is how you can work around explosions
right a workaround by exploding a
particular dependency which is coming
from a existing lately if let's say I
want to upgrade to a different version
right so here I'm going upgrade it to
let's say what was the version if you're
showing 2.0 to m3 right this might be
using spring 5 right this is a major
upgrade you can see this is a major
upgrade and this is not going to work
that easy right so if you see here let
me expand this I think m3 is now gone I
think the spring boat has got certified
right so it should be 2.0 let's see let
me be important so this is going to
download some of the dependencies I
think that also is more Derrick yeah
that's what do you saying so let's see I
don't know if you build snapshot is
still available
let's try it out yeah looks like it is
available and if you notice here
internally that will snapshot is using
the spring version 5.0 dot built right
which is completely irrelevant to these
spring AOP here right so what we did
here is the Explorer the spring core and
we are using the spring core from the
EOP right what do you think if I build
this particular project will it work you
never know it might work as well but I'm
just going to build it let's see right
it might work it might not work but this
is one of the major scenarios which we
face today when we upgrade one version
from one version of a library there are
chances that the other libraries which
we are used might get affected see where
it didn't get affected maybe because
there are no tests in this particular
project that could be a reason but when
you use it at runtime you might know
that ok this might not work right
because of the version context so see
this late spring context is 5.0 however
the spring core is 4 or 3 dot length
okay
same way spring beans nu ok so in this
case as I said earlier you can use
exclusions or the other base instead of
using explosion directly up create
thesis so if you don't want to have
nasty form exclusions you can directly
go to the 5.0 so this way you keep on
upgrading everything that is the major
reason people say that ok upgrade your
projects or upgrade the versions very
frequently if you don't do frequent
updates this is what happens because
most of the enterprise systems face this
kind of problems where you have a very
legacy system and you have lots of maven
problems and you will have to use
exclusions to have these kind of issues
so one other way if let's say you are
not using intelligent right how will I
identify my maven dependency tree so
this is the maven dependency key that it
shows very neatly so there is a way
which maven provides this tree right
you can just say maven dependency : 3 so
if you have maven installed in your
machine you can use this if you don't
have maven you will have to install it
to get the dependencies by default I
think most of us have maven because we
build our projects
so if you give the Maven dependency free
this is going to automatically scan your
form and come up with a graph so this is
the graph it's not like a giraffe but it
just shows what dependencies are coming
from there if you see here it shows ok
springboard 2.0 it has dependency to
Spring Corps 5 of 0 then that internally
has dependency to spring JCL so if you
see this this shows the child hierarchy
right same way the spring but directly
has spring context internally that has
expression then AOPA or P has P so that
is how it shows the dependency so this
is the dependency tree so if you want to
see a dependency tree of a project you
can run this particular command maven
dependency tree right and you can see
the dependencies and how do you resolve
the conflicts you can use the exclusions
all either update for that right you can
either use exclusions or upgrade 40
projects and this is a way to identify
water all the dependencies used in
different process I just showed with an
example with two different libraries but
if you have an enterprise application
which is huge you might end up resolving
lots of more lots of dependency
conflicts right so just make sure that
you guys are aware that if you use
exclusions there will be runtime
problems even though there might not be
a compile time issue there will be a
runtime issue so just make sure that you
are aware of this particular warning
right so I think I hope you understood
what is a dependency conflict and how
you can resolve the palencia conflict
and what is the tool available in maven
to see the dependency tree and how you
can identify what version is coming from
which particular leg so I hope you found
this particular video interesting if you
liked the video go ahead and like it if
you haven't subscribed to the channel go
ahead and subscribe to it if you know
people are searching for maven and how
to resolve these problems you can share
this particular video for them I hope
you understood something from this video
meet again in the next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
