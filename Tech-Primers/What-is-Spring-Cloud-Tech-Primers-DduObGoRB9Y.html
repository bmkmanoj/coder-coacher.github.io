we're gonna see what this sprinkler so
spring clothes toys lots of tools for
developers for fits quickly building our
application so if you use sa if you are
working on a distributed system
environment and you want to build
complex applications and if you have
something which you can reuse across
different microservices are different
across components then string cloud
services helps in that in those places
so if you see here these are the
different components of string cloud
server resources just a small set of
what what is the right now in spring
closes but they people are adding lots
of more stuff into the spring class so
you might see more of these getting
added more of the functionalities or the
common patterns which we can reuse so
for example configuration management so
how do we manage our configuration so we
can manage our configurations externally
in towards you trip or so or emergent
configurations so any version the
configuration management system so
spring cloud provides capabilities for
that then we put service discovery so
how do you want to discover our
microscope is it in the indie platform
so there are different ways to do that
so you you can use your rake also keeper
there is something called cloud for
declaw congestion pin baby so could
break a pattern so for circuit breaker
sprinkler provides hinchik so next
accelerated districts so they made
spring cloud integrates packages for
routing we we can use dual so spring
cloud uses old to i do intelligent
routing across micro-services
the next one will be the micro proxy TM
a dual you can act as a proxy and then
router applications based on the proxy
URL which you have configured then we
participated the session there's there's
a spring clock fuels which creature
internally uses the common sense it can
hit resonant for the for the logs and
stuff like a semi for clusters it's a
punch card for bastard the repeated cube
is provided by a spring clubs but so
finally for the leadership selection the
hazel cards cause you're it isn't silky
like for sprinkler classes so what
internally sprinkler does is it's going
to remove all our boilerplate code so we
are going to follow a declarative
approach for writing our application so
we don't have to rewrite stuff again and
again so if let's say that in different
micro services they have different
externally configurations so we can't
reuse the configuration menu provided by
spring cloud you know across the very
minimal code so you can use annotations
to do that they report the current
discovery so you don't have to write
lots of code to register your app find
your app stuff like that so dqp it is
all done at the annotation level see you
add an annotation and space takes care
of that out of the box same way for the
circuit breakers and all other
functionality so sprinklers is going to
reduce these boilerplate code so that
you can write very very less code and
then make sure that your application is
v using the comments patterns across
microservices because when you start
writing a distributed system right so
you when you have lots of Micra services
then you you will find it difficult to
reuse the same components across the
micro services so that is the pink cloud
helps us in solving that problem so
that's it for this video video grid in
the next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
