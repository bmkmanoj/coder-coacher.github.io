creating your UML diagrams or the
deployment diagrams or the class
diagrams or any diagrams whatsoever
are you using PowerPoint or are you
using Microsoft Visio let's see what is
the open source tool which I am going to
say which we can use for creating these
diagrams for free let's get started
press the bell icon on the YouTube app
and never miss any update from tech
primers drawer dot IO this is the
website where they provide lots of
diagrams which we can create for free
let's go and try creating one of the
diagram let's try exporting what are the
different options and let's see how we
can use that in our day-to-day life so
the moment you go to draw dot IO you can
see that you have an option to say save
save diagrams to Google Drive or github
or Dropbox or onedrive or Trello or or
the machine which we have right so this
is just asking me whether I want to
remember something so I'm going to say
decide later so that I can choose that
whenever I want to save a diagram so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a new diagram right so when I say
new diagram this is going to pop up with
this particular option where I have
different options to choose from so the
initial one is the blank diagram so I
don't want any blank diagram I'm going
to create some template so let's say I
want to create a deployment process
diagram right so I want to create a
deployment process diagram so I'm going
to choose what diagram I need right so
if you see here these are some distance
diagrams there are some charts here I
don't need a chart so if you want to
draw any chart you can do that as well
from this website there are some
engineering diagrams for example if you
are a college student and you want to
draw some diagrams based on your circuit
boards you can do that here there are
some flow charts here there are some
layout diagrams there are some maps here
there is a neural network or the network
diagram there is something called other
which has some miscellaneous diagram
here there is something called software
so software has the different class
diagrams component diagrams and stuff
like that tables in the normal tables
yeomen has the UML diagrams right and
the last one is the Venn diagram so if
you want to draw any
Venn diagrams you can do that as well
right so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to choose a basic pipeline diagram
right so this is going to have something
like this let me fix the window right I
don't need anything else so as I start
initially I'll just have this so I don't
need any tests so let's say I want to
create a diagram which has only the
stages of my build right so let's say
I'm going to create a Jenkins pipeline
right
so I'm going to say this is my build
process so I'm gonna just highlight this
right I think I just did a control
result process so I'm just saying that
is my build process I can just say unit
test right integration test then I say
deploy okay then I run some automated
tests okay and finally I deployed to
prod okay so let's say I want to export
this particular diagram okay for
simplicity I just created this
particular diagram but you can use lots
of options for example if I let's say
want to change the color of this I can
do that here right so I can just change
the color of the boxes and if they say I
don't want the boxes I can just remove
that as well
and you can add additional boxes so if
you want to start off with a blank
diagram you can do that if you see here
this UI is similar to the Visio UI if
you have used the Visio for creating UML
diagrams you know how awesome that
particular tool is and this particular
website draw dot IO provides something
similar so if you want to create
something similar which is equivalent to
the Visio
standards you can do that from here
right obviously it is an open-source
tool the only dessert
disadvantage I see is you are creating
this particular diagram in in a
different place so you are going to a
website and you're just creating it but
if you're open source developer or if
you are working in startups and stuff
like that where there is no restriction
as such for you to create something
externally so you can use this tool it
is very helpful if you are working on
college projects you can do that as well
so you can see that you have been
diagrams you have some diagrams for the
circuits and stuff like that right so
this is pretty helpful when you want to
create these diagonals like the UL
yeoman diagrams or charts or something
like that so how do I export them I can
just save these right I just click on
this option and then I can I get to save
so I'm going to say this is going to be
my deployment okay so I'm going to save
this as a image right so you can choose
what type of image you want so you can
either choose PNG jpg SVG PDF or
anything right so let's say I'm going to
click on the PNG option show this you
can choose what type of zoom you want
you can include a copy of my diagram
transparent background so if you say
transform diagrams is going to give you
transform background so let's say you
want to have a diagram for the transform
ragam you can do that as well right so I
just say export once you say export you
have different options to choose from if
you click on the Google Drive this
directly saves on to the Google Drive
right so let's say if I click on the
download this directly downloads the
image here if I click on it let's see
how does the image look like right just
for checking it out so see that there is
no watermark here there is nothing it's
a transparent image and whatever we
created we got it exported right so this
is the beauty of this particular tool
draw dot IO it is completely open source
you can use it for any of your diagram
creation right and it is free so you
don't have to worry about paying anybody
you don't have to worry about getting
the license and stuff right there are a
bunch of different options you can add
layers you can arrange the layers you
and bring stuff to the front like take
back things to the back and stuff like
that you can just play around with it
with this tool so I use it most of the
time if I want to create a particular
image or if I want to create a
particular diagram and I want to use it
I mostly use draw dot IO all right along
with that I use Google Drive if you had
seen my presentation which I create I
use Google Drive most probably but I use
draw dot IO as well okay I hope you
found this particular tool interesting
and you can try it out as well
there is no login required you just say
draw dot IO it just takes you to this
particular website just try it out
like let's see how it is helpful for you
in creating diagrams of week okay hope
you like this particular video do share
it with others who are in need of this
kind of videos if you like the video go
ahead and like it if you haven't
subscribed to the channel go ahead and
subscribe to it may taken in the next
video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
