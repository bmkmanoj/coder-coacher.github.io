minutes that's what I think let me check
if I have any notifications in my mobile
yeah I see some notification saying okay
there is the nicest if you guys can give
me to let me know in the live chat there
was some problem with my live streaming
software so right now what I have done
is I am I'm using Google Hangouts to
live stained the same so previously I
was using on the software that was not
working and what was the problem but I
right now I'm using Google Hangouts I
hope it should be okay let me know if
you guys can hear me so that I know that
you guys can carry and then I can
continue with you
just checking my mobile nature yeah I
think I can okay she was is he's able to
hear me hi Shiva sorry for too much
delay there was a problem at my live
streaming software because of that I was
not able to come I was not able to
stream properly and before that there
was a power out what was happening was I
was not able to even log in to say that
okay that is the problem and there is
heavy rain here in Bangalore and because
of that there's too much of traffic and
I was not able to reach my home at the
exact time and also there is a no-cage
of power right now it's back that's why
I'm like so if you guys can have any
that's actually where you can share with
me
so I'll be able to answer that Shiva if
you have any questions do drop that in
the live chat session I'll be able to
answer that so as a initial start I was
answering some questions from Prakash
and others I don't know if they will be
joining because I obviously I came and
went and came and went that's what
happened in the livestream but yeah
whoever is there do let me know if you
have any questions I can just answer
that right so Akash was asking a just
start of a Turkish was asking a question
on how to start with micro services in
Java and there to start what are the
different tools and technologies so
there are some videos which I have
created so you can check the playlist
section for a spring micro services so
there are some tail videos on that so
you can see videos on micro services
Netflix Oasis what are the different
discovery service what is service
discovery
what is his tricks how to log how to do
logging inside micro services you can
check out these videos they will be
helpful when you start with micro
services and then you can start off with
these promote application to create
myself there are different applications
I prefer springboard because I had
worked on springboard a little bit so I
know about spring boot so that is why I
prefer spring boot if you are using
vertex you can you're free to each
vertex as well so you can check vertex
on how vertex is helpful in creating
micro services Adam I have done a couple
of videos on vertex but if you are
interested I can do that as well because
I also haven't done much in vertex but I
have just dated sample applications and
tried out vertex and how I have compared
how vertex is faring velvety spring boat
term as a framework right so that
is that so you can shadows which also
generally check about the different
design patterns in micro services
because micro services as the term might
be simple to hear but in order to deploy
your applications on to cloud and then
make sure there is reliability there is
resiliency handle there is scalability
all these are handled you should make
sure that you follow those design
patterns so that your application is
suited for the Microsoft's on the cloud
right so check that as well
correct so as the street associated
wants me to make some videos on earth-2
JWT authorization under source server
and zone and Arica if you see in micro
services we need to learn what is zone
and you write car these are different
frameworks from Netflix Netflix has
created Zul and Eureka Eureka is used
for discovery service so you can use
your across the discovery service
framework and zone is like the API
gateway so you can have Zul as the
gateway and then in behind the sole you
can have your record historic line so
that you don't have to expose all the
micro services to the end user you can
just expose one rest endpoint and why
are that people can route it to
different restraint points okay so yeah
so I think I have got a got the first
question from Shiva so she was asked in
here I have spring boot experience just
wanted to know how or where to start
learning about spring cloud like what is
Eureka and it makes an or yeah
so as I said there are some videos which
I have made so you can check my playlist
so I have made some videos on this a
separate playlist called
big cloud I believe so yeah yeah so you
can start off with this sure so you can
see what is rain cloud and then there is
a playlist I would have made lots of
videos on sprinkler example if you see
here I have made you on spring cloud
context server here comes Eureka hystrix
zone so you can take a look at my
channel yeah there is a playlist called
sprinkler you can check that playlist
if you want I can just share this link
there is the mystery I don't know if
this comes to be haha this doesn't come
there may be he doesn't come in hangouts
I'm not sure
Jahangir says but yeah let's check the
playlist which is spring cloud ok and
start off from there you should be able
to start off with spring cloud and
whatever if it stops from spring cloud
ok the next question is I'm seeing some
videos on videos from you could guide us
how sprinklered works and how it's gonna
work with a database and once you for
some other clouds business yeah sure so
see it spring cloud is just a imagine ik
as a framework or a library okay so
these are provided by spring so that you
can use it on a cloud so irrespective of
whether it is AWS or assure you will be
able to make spring cloud work okay so
you don't have to worry about how your
application will behave on the cloud but
for the platform to support for the
application to support the platform
which is nothing but the AWS or Azure or
whatever it is cloud founder whatever it
is you will have to do some minor
changes to your application so that
these work on those platforms but in
general what happens is in a spring
cloud framework you will have lots of
tools so if I go to spring but io /
cloud and think
or the dust cloud let me go to spring
bottom and then I will just go to
projects that will be a clone so if you
go to FX dot spring at i/o slash spring
cloud you will be able to see different
frameworks which are provided by spring
ok so if you want I think I don't have
any the question so I can cover this now
right so if you are interested so there
afferent libraries inside spring so for
example spring cloud config what spring
cloud config does is you can have a
micro services you can have different
micro services deployed in your cloud
basically imagine these micro services
have a small process ok it does some
functionality that's it it's a basic
service okay how do we configure
property files to this country to these
services right so what do you generally
do so you create a application or
properties for something then you go to
plugins and application right but if you
want to change something to one of the
service right what do we do we will have
to redeploy that by repackaging them
within your efficient correct so spring
cloud config solves that particular
problem
ok you don't have to repackage your
application with new properties
ok you you have a central process called
config server you can create a new micro
service called config server and that
context server they point to a git
repository ok that kicked repository is
nothing but your properties properties
project then you can have application ml
or application properties or any other
property file ok
you can modify that particular property
and you go to the config server ok and
hit a refresh option so this context of
a will refresh the information from the
git repository and it will have it so
all the micro services will cause of the
conflicts were to get the configuration
so you don't have to restart your
process without even restarting it it
automatically fetch with new
configurations so obviously for database
connections you will have to restart
your process but there could be some
configuration where you want to enable a
feature or you want to enable some
particular flow on the flag
even having to restart you can use Fink
load config in that case spring cloud
Netflix if you see here these are the
set of projects you have it Eureka hist
exude and okay so I know what you reckon
is Dixon soon I'll just tell you what
these are right so Eureka is useful for
service discovery so if you have heard
about zookeeper or any other service
discovery frameworks Eureka is something
similar but what spring has done a
spring has created a what you call a
wrapper around that Eureka which was
created by Netflix and Netflix has open
sourced it so Spring has created
something called spring cloudy Erika
okay you can use a spring cloud Eureka
to create service discovery pattern so
so discovery pattern in the sense you
have multiple services in your
environment right you have multiple
micro services so from one service to
another you will have a call net so if
you want to call that your hard code
your URL your hard code your poetry you
don't have to do that in the you recover
in the service discovery world
so these will be registered in the
service discovery which is a which is
another central process where all the
client micro services will register to
the service discovery and the server or
from where you want to call the clients
you can just connect to the service
discovery and then it will route to load
to the respective micro services so that
is what you record us so it takes care
of service discovery basically it takes
care of routing you to different
different micro services based on what
is registered and you don't have to
worry about the URL or the court number
which has got changed because it will
all be there register to Eureka on the
fly that particular instance so you
don't have to change your application
and there is a poor change when the new
micro services alright so that is Eureka
so next one is hystrix
so what is hysterics right so hystrix is
a what do you call fault tolerant
framework okay all our library basically
it's a library okay so if you have heard
about circuit breakers okay mystics is
the circuit breaker implementation so
circuit breaker in the sense if
say there is a short circuit what
happens in the power in our if what
happens to the electricity right circuit
breaks basically it opens right it opens
the circuit so basically our fuse what
happens to the fuse the fuse breaks
correct so that is what this hysterics
does let's say we are calling a third
party rest endpoint or a database
connection or something like that right
when you are connecting there when you
are recording some rest and one if let's
say that endpoint fails with some error
right they can handle a fallback so
instead of directly throwing the
exception back to the UI or back to the
place where we call we can handle the
fallback so in the fallback what you can
do you can either call to some other
service or you can handle the fallback
saying okay the service is down or
something like that you don't have to
you don't have to throw the exception
that again you would just sell fallback
okay with hystrix you can you can
consider a circuit breaker times so
let's say if there are 100 that was
coming into your application and all the
hundreds are going to fail right it is
costlier to call 100 times and then fail
hundred times right so if you are
failing you all have to fail fast that
is the concept of microservices right so
in order to do that restricts what
happens it helps you in identifying how
many times or how many times it has to
go and call the direct service and check
your filters up or not so let's say if
you are calling thousand times first
time it will go and check if it fails it
will open the circuit basically the rest
all 98 times will be failing so it won't
even call the Western point it will
directly pay so that is the circuit
breaker so it literally breaks the solar
and let's say you have configured as a
five-minute delay or something after
five minutes the new request will go and
check if it is really up or not so that
way you don't have to query the
third-party service every time right
because you know already that it failed
you don't have to recall that again so
that is his tricks that is another
library provided by Netflix and spring
cloud Spring has written a wrapper
around that called spring cloud hystrix
you can use that you can even use
Hastings in the normal application which
is not even in cloud or it's not even
following micro services is in fact you
can try that
okay the next one is so Zul is like api
gateway as i said earlier so it is the
API gateway there you can proxy requests
so whatever I mean by proxy requests you
can proxy requests from request from
which is coming in and then you can read
directly to different port numbers so
that is what zone is because you don't
have a expose all the internal port
numbers or the application names to the
exposing application right so that is
what Zul helps us you can have a union
which says let's say google.com or
something slash some port number right
you you give like 8080 and in please can
put it into a different port number or
at event occurs so that is where Zul
helps us in so it acts as a gateway
gateway and then you trouts request
internally inside e in front because you
might have hundreds of micro services
right but you don't want to expose all
these micro services correct you want to
expose only one restrain point so that's
what Julie helps us in do that if we see
Facebook if API is the graph dot
facebook.com that also this is
internally using the I don't know if it
works because I am NOT talking to
Facebook but I can use the graph see if
you see here right which is supported
but this kids this is the API gateway so
you will use everything with draft atif
a.com slash ABA or something like that
but in the backend say book might be
using n number micro services all right
so those all helps us in doing ok
there is something called spring cloud
bus you can create one bus and then you
can use it for messaging between the
micro services that is what spring
cloudburst is the maturity of
application which people use or unique
artistic son soon okay I don't know
about Argos
I've never used it spring cloud for
Cloud Foundry this is specific to the
cloud for free which is similar to our
or a radius or Google Cloud pan platform
right so that is another there is a
service broker for the Cloud Foundry
there's something called cluster where
you have different memory implementation
the in-memory implementation which is
example like in zookeeper returns his
last console etcetera right so you can
have that so if you if you're not sure
about what is the wreckage and hazel
cast I have made videos on that as you
can take a look at that take a look at
at that particular thing okay contoso
console is another implementation like
Eureka okay it is also a service display
the check ring cloud console if you're
interested in using console split cloud
security is nothing but words to
decoration and other integrations for
the cloud libraries so someone are
asking made it I think trainer or
somebody so he had asked me to make
videos on quad 2 for the zoo on Eureka
and this is what I will be using such
things all security will help me doing
that all right split louts load so if
you want to track logging across
micro-services what kind of framework we
use right so so for example Shiva right
so what what kind of in Ramat you are
working in like to do are you working in
Microsoft or what kind of a moment are
you working ok yeah just drop that in
life say live just that it can be
interactive right so the spring cloud
sleuth is useful in tracking or tracing
your logs across microservices okay so
that is what spring cloud slow to us it
can had a header which is which could be
a trace ID and then you can trace idea
if they call it trace IP and span ID and
you can track that across microservices
ok so I have made a video on spring
cloud sleuth as well so if you are
interested in seeing how to create or
how to log in microservices you can
check that video sling right spring show
data for something new which I have not
seen I think it's for deploying your
cloud application on the cloud anything
if you see here it's easy to use da tell
tractor of you I just API just
orchestrates
I think it is this is for managing your
applications which is basically the
microscope is this in one go Schumer
says he uses microservices okay nice
Shiva so I think you might these might
be useful for you whatever and IJ is
covered right so
you have any questions on what I covered
also just let me know I can just go in
depth or if you have any use cases which
you want to check I think about that as
well
all right similar to that there is some
constant cloud strain so it can stream
using Apache Kafka or any other
streaming what we call messaging system
so you can use the cloud stream for that
do you want to have some integration or
floor later think you can use that okay
so Allen is asking are Heinen and I was
asking zookeeper wasn't clear can you
explain once so zookeeper is similar to
ear Ekta so zookeeper was a framework
which was created by Google I think I
don't know it was Google it was created
long act 5 to 7 years ago I think right
so if what Joe keeper does is it can do
the discovery service again same as you
Rica so if you know about do you know
what your discovery so service annan so
you if you discovery service or service
discovery what we can do is you can have
it send on process ok you will have
different micro services all your micro
services will register to a central
process ok and if you want to call any
of this micro service you'll go to the
central process only and that will route
you to the different micro services so
you don't have to directly call the
micro service because all these micro
services might be in different port
numbers or different hosts so you don't
you don't have to hard code that into
your source process you can use civil
discovery to do that so that is what
zookeeper awesomeness so you reco also
just the same thing zookeeper also does
the same thing right ok enunciates yes
yeah so if you understand what is a
service discovery that is what
zookeepers ok so the next question he is
asking is how Joe keeper is used in
Kafka so if you know about Kafka is a
what we call a messaging queue where you
can stream different
messages onto the cube okay that a
different level okay when you are
deploying kafka you will have different
types of cues where you can have
parallel processing or you can have a
single cue or you will have multiple
cues right so you can use zookeeper I
don't think you can directly use
zookeeper on to the cough-cough use
because from the kafka clues you will
have to consume messages right so what
you do is you will know to set up
different processes to consume these
messages and then from the process which
consume if you to call another micro
service you can have no keeper there
okay you can use the router you can use
ooh keeper as another router when you
use ooh that's that's what I think so it
was that clear and then okay so if you
have any cones you can drop that in the
light chart I can answer that like how
an island shape is asking so don't
hesitate and post any question so it's
okay I can answer any type of question
even if it is basic one all right so
apart from that do you have any a
question Shiva or Nellie
there was
if you guys are if you guys know about
the pipelines I recently found out that
there is a there is something called
pimp archetype line so bifurcate
you know but bitbucket it is similar to
github so bitbucket is putting something
by plane there you can run your build
and these will run on docker later you
can use your docket images you can
either interesting docker images to run
your build so I will be making a video
on big packet pipeline maybe today or
tomorrow I'm not sure and I'm free I'll
try to be so meanwhile stress ask the
next question when should we go first
thing cloud so you can go to a string
cloud when you are using micro services
and you are on the clock
okay so that is the second thing so if
you are in club and if you are going to
use micro services in pattern then
definitely go for sprinkler because it
helps in lots of these issues where you
will have to have hot bags handle you'll
have to have these discovery client
setup
so in that case bimcloud is very helpful
so you like a hystrix and soon will be
very helpful or handy you can check out
my videos if you want to see how spring
cloud feels like you can check out my
videos so for example this same inside
attending micro services using spring
boots then Claudia record video there
are two videos in that if you check that
particular video you will get an
understanding now to explain the
architecture like I have created
actually so this week so I would have
explained the the architect should I get
him there I want to create pattern for
an application ok for example I can
example of a stock price viewer I want
her to retrieve some stock price from
Yahoo Finance and I have showed that
example in this video so you can see how
I use my case officers design pattern to
use soon there for micro services to tie
them up together right you can share
that video as well so how I have used it
I ever shown by deploying that in the
um laptop but you can you can do that in
the cloud in moment there you will see
the real benefit right so that's when
you use string out okay
so an ins next question is why should I
use docker and why I deploy the same way
as in local okay so docker is not cloud
okay so the major thing which people can
unfused about docker and closes doctor
is not cloud docker is that a just a
containerized platform
okay so docker is a container literally
if you see any cloud platform for
example as you or AWS or cloud foundry
so they might be using containers okay
I'm not sure about a tow place in a suit
but cloud for me I know that they use
containers internally an application
onto cloud they will run inside a
container okay so basically it creates a
sandbox environment for you to run
inside the hardware okay
docker is doing something similar
talking what it does is if you have
heard about the concept of a hypervisors
OOP people need to create machines worse
they create a let's say there is a Linux
host okay
there is a let's say there is a 32 GB
RAM in that okay so there will be always
on that particular host and they
partition this this into three or four
different hosts with different Ram sizes
let's say be partition 32 gig on to
three hosts with 88 gig right another
ending let's say for about voice of
particular hypervisor on the machine
let's use it so literally there will be
different oasis in the same machine so
since you create the a gp41 OS adb
father and the same way further you will
have different OSS running on the same
tree and you created three different -
also on the hypervisor you created three
different virtual machines literally
these act as a separate machine in in
itself like units you will have your own
wrote permission you will have your own
ways and everything so what happened was
like you will have to buy the OS like
this for all these three
new instances right so what docker saw
as a benefit was that why to create new
new images and reinstall the voice again
why can't I use the same machine with
the same ways to have different
containers okay that's when this docker
came into picture yeah you would have a
OS you will have a hardware or that
that'll be a single layer Condor engine
which is similar to the OS n gin voice
but there is a pelican Tucker engine and
in the docker engine you can create
containers like a JB h-e-b so you can
create for and inspect a TV a TV a TV
and you will use images so there's
something called talker images like how
you have an OS image you can create a
docker image so for example if you want
to run maven you create a museum even
image if you want to use JDK one rotate
or 1.9 you can use that particular image
and inside the container it will run an
image so if you have a spring boat
apllication you will have a spring boat
image that image will be running from
the docker container okay so that is
what docker us
okay so docker is not club you can have
to occur installed in a standalone
machine if you see my laptop I have
doctor I have a docker if you see here
instead of right so I have the aqua and
if you if you start that it will start
at the Hawker engine and then deploy my
image djokovic on to that engine so like
how creative are here you create a
docker engine just for you talk image
okay so you create a docker image and
that talker image can blow down to be
your engine so that is what octopus okay
hope you understood and let me know if
you still didn't get it or you have any
other question right so shortener is
saying great job tech tech promise your
thank age goodness hi welcome to the
stream so if this is your first time you
can ask questions I can answer that
let's see I was supposed to do the
session at 9 o'clock but due to some
issues I was not able to connect and I
had to reconnect using the Google hat
out now
so she was says sure thank you so much I
got good insights from you all the
companies are using sphincter so there
are some companies which are using spin
cloud like everyone is moving towards
spin clock okay not everyone is going to
out but cloud is going to be the future
you have heard this it from everybody
cloud is going to be the future and this
is going to come one day or the other
okay so this is going to come anyway so
it's better to move now itself because
you will be the leader with spray in
cloud and stuff if you are not doing it
definitely at some point you will be
forced to do it by that time you might
not know whether you will have the body
called tank money or interest to learn
the technology so it is better to learn
now itself so I'm waiting for somebody
to push saying you will have to do this
you have to do this or something okay
Swapnil is asking better you based on
how much corporate experience you have
you are doing a really good job so I'm
in Bangalore Swapnil so I am in
Bangalore right now so I started my
career in 2010 February to be exact
okay so I have over more than seven
years of experience right now so right
now I work for an investment bank so I
worked in telecom industry for over two
and half years then I moved to
Investment Banking so I am still there
yeah so I have more than seven years of
experience the next question from
analyst we can deploy in local without
docker right why can't we do the same
introduction very good question so why
do we need docker basically you're
asking why why do we need to talk about
so in fact I have even asked that
question many times I'm not a
talkin but I'll tell you why people take
a docker and why people are crazy about
it so there are very good catenaries
platforms which are available out there
as I said right if you want to test your
stuff in local and pod
what do we do in broad right so let's
say you have a bar okay
there is already Tomcat installed inside
your Devon Brahman and you have trodden
wrong
correct you don't deploy the Tomcat
every time isn't it
so since these are Tomcats are dependent
on the environment you don't have
control to what you deploy correct so
when you test something in your local
let's say in your local you have 7.0
version of Tomcat in production you have
some other version right how confident
are you with whatever you tested in
local right
so that is why docker came up with this
concept of image okay
so when you create an image you will
give what version of Tomcat you will be
using and what version of the jar or the
bar which you are going to use okay and
you create a final image and that is why
it is all locked right so literally your
version of the Tomcat is locked in the
same version will be running in your
local and the same will be running in
prod so that is why docker is slightly
popular but if you ask me personally
with spring boot you don't have to worry
about docker or image or which version
of Tomcat because with spring both you
your Tomcat is embedded inside your jar
itself you don't have to create a bar
like how we used to do right so I don't
see a point in going to docker as such
but many people use docker if they don't
want to go to cloud and they want to
have a controlled environment but lots
and lots of companies are moving to
docker in order to use them for
continuous integration or for testing
okay if you want to do continuous
integration or testing people are using
docker so for example a few minutes back
I was just telling your big packet
pipelines I will simply need to see why
so bit bucket pipeline uses docker
so bit packet pipeline is something
similar to Jenkins pipeline but it uses
dock and it is for free so I am going to
create a video in a day or two on that
so you will get to know what is that if
I'm trying I was testing it right it is
good and it is for free like I was like
amazed they are providing a build
I can have my repositories in me bit and
I can create a pipeline and it just runs
my build
I don't even have to install Jenkins
like how I have installed in my nation
right now
so okay so that is the that is why
people say testing the same of neukÃ¶lln
Tron okay I hope I have answered your
question onion so next question is by
Shankar - per so any good platform or
calls for machine learning so formation
learning there are different channels I
don't know the exact channel names there
are some channels but the problem with
machine learning is everyone is learning
right now if you see machine learning is
still evolving even Google is trying to
worry crowdsources and if you see
everything which is coming up right now
it's Allah it's all on AI if you see
yesterday's Google event everything is
all on a like cool pixel - is also on a
I already iPhone X - Tenzin's yeah and
everybody is trying to leverage this
time to make the machine learning better
and better because machine learning is
not done right see if I talk in a
language if I talk with grammatical
mistakes still your dryness brain is
able to process that and you will be
able to understand that right
but when you write some programs the
program should be able to do the same
thing that is what people are trying to
create now using machine learning and
stuff okay so any good platform I don't
know that is there is a there is a
tensorflow
I have a tried tensor for so if you know
Google has created this black Tom called
tensorflow
just take a look at that and to try that
also but I have tried a Stanford core
NLP if you seem videos have tried a
creating machine learning library
natural language processing like we saw
machine Ling assess what it's a natural
language processing library which is for
a Coronel P from Stanford so Stanford
use the core NLP so they have got a
library called coronary I was using that
to see how we can do natural language
processing but formation learning I
think you can try out tensor flow I
don't know if it's free or how much they
queue for flame but
try that out yeah because it is from
Google so you can give it a shot right
Allen says yeah controlled and warm
coded things yeah it's a controlled
environment nothing else funnel yeah
right questions you guys have
I don't see any new questions maybe I
can check an answer what people had
asked Stern was asking me to minute ago
that how to create a docker image for
spring MVC application so it is similar
so like how we discussed right how we
can create a spring boot you can hit the
spring MVC application using you you can
get a bar and then you can create the
image along with the Tomcat and that
talked about image you can deploy on to
the occur well see if I can make a video
on that I will try to do that
yeah shankazute Thanks yep my pleasure
Shanker so shiva is asking will you make
the banking to my knowledge to get
domain level experience for beginners
banking there are so many things in
banking if you ask me personally there
are insurance don't mind there are
securities domain there are banking
there are flex what he called front
office back office middle office there
are too many things if you've been keep
on talking about but in general I would
say there is a website called
investopedia you can go there are lots
of good explanations on different
concepts but if I make a video on that I
don't think it will be helpful this one
website called money after all I think
there is one channel called money
control I used to see her very videos
control I think many control control was
some other money it was related to
something with money but yeah so they
made a very good videos on the concepts
of like futures options equities
shares bonds all these are banking
related stuff banking and finance
related stuff so you can check that ok
so I mean is asking can you explain
just-in-time compilation in Java I I
don't have much knowledge on that island
unfortunately I'm sorry but let's see
what still down there should be somebody
make me something you definitely like
yeah there are some videos just take a
look at it but I don't know I'll also
try I'll also making out of it I'll see
how they work because I also learn lots
of things from you guys it's not like
okay I know everything right not
everyone knows everything right yeah
shun-kun is asking a silly question
sorry for that but any different
component service repository controller
restaurant upload application good
question let me tell Jay quickly I know
if my internship will come up in the
time so I'll tell you the difference
George Anka so all these are almost same
so if you see component right component
is is the super second it's like you add
a component or a beam so component is
like single done in spring okay service
internally if you call the serf
sanitation it internally uses component
only okay so you annotate to it but
service you know how to know that you
enough for you to identify that it is a
service that is the only reason apart
from that there is no other reason for
you to your service okay internally if
you see service if you go to the service
annotation you can tell me use this
component only okay controller and rest
controller so controller is like if you
want to have a wake on a central class
which from which you want to do so many
things for example from a controller you
will have a service cone okay
that is the general pattern of a VC rec
so you will have Model View controller
so that is when the controllers come
into picture so from the controller
class you can have different components
or services so whenever you write a
class and you wanna take into the
controller that means that class will
internally have services services or
components injected and you might have
service calls or component usage so that
is when you use controller for a class
press controls are basically you will
have these controllers exposed as rest
endpoints that's why they call they are
called as rest controllers instead
respond to us you will have services so
that is when you use press controls the
next last one is a repository so a
repository is used when you want to do
database operations or you want to do
some external operations for example
elasticsearch repository or you want to
do database repository like database
could have seen JPA repository mom
bodybuilder posickey elastic opposing
team all these are different external
what he called storage medium so that is
why they are called as repository so you
you literally have something over there
and you are it's like a repository type
repository is a place where you store
something so if you want to store
something and retrieve from that place
that's when you use repositories that
way you have proposed
patience okay so if you see if you have
seen my videos I don't generally
sometimes I wouldn't have followed this
pattern of having a risk controller and
in Cyprus controller you should use only
service but I would I would have
directly injected repository and I used
but in general a good practice is to how
controller inside the controller have
some services inside the service have
the repository okay that is it it'll
good practice okay I hope I answered
your questions Juncker onions next
question is I already tried few sources
but couldn't understand just-in-time
compilation so sure definitely and
chicken and I'll also try I also know
you have opened my eyes so I'd love to
check the waters gently just in time
companies and how they work right
because that's how Java works today we
know Java but we never learnt those
things so yeah let me try and then I if
I'm comfortable I'll just make a video
so that everyone if it's I seen that
okay
shall I switch signs yep my pleasure
so any other questions guys any other
questions I can just answer meanwhile
I'll just open the annotation and I'll
show you
what do you guys generally do like where
are you guys from oh yeah it's it's
always like you guys ask question why
can't I ask ocean hi laughs um question
so let me go a little since PLC resource
read Shankar because it this is the rest
control array if I go inside the rest
controller yeah add controller here rest
controller is like a child and add
controller is at the inside limit okay
so that is what controller is so if you
go inside controller you can see a
component so that is what I was saying
so component is like a singleton stuff
so whenever you have different
annotations it's definitely going to be
a component so shunka say screen is not
visible sorry I don't why but yeah I
just show you again so rest controller
if you see inside there is control
controller you have a controller so
controller a controller looks like a
base then rest controller is like a
child and if you if I go inside the
controller it has a component
okay so component is at a higher level
okay
same way with what is the other one you
asked service rate shape you go to
service so if you see here inside
service we have a component that's what
I was doing it so component is at a
higher level so so if you use service
not nothing but a component but you
aren't ending it with service just to
make your may make your system
understand that it's the service that's
it nothing else but for controllers
there are some implementation based on
controllers that's why we have it as
canola or a scroller so you can have
some implementation based on service
that is why you annotated service and if
you see depository and the positive also
has the add component nothing needs
suppository is just to identify that you
are going to store something in that
that is why it is called another tree
where it will store some stuff okay so
hi she washe was is a cheese from
hyderabad and working for intellect
design arena limited close to six years
of experience in the java and full
development
night suit Nashua
I am from Bangalore right now so I am in
Bangalore
so I am Becky from Chennai but I'm I'm
Bangalore right now so yeah I have more
than seven years of experience that I
think I would you guys okay so I think I
am out of questions right now so that is
it if you guys have any other questions
do drop that in the comment section
after that I don't say his analyst
working in Hyderabad and working it's
been eight months oh nice and I'm your
fresher than eight months there is long
way to go then
okay nice great hi bum she won she
welcome to the stream so um she is
asking any idea on Spink or
certifications certifications for spring
course I have seen certifications for
Cloud Foundry and Amazon and off but
spring cool I have never seen okay
in programs right okay yeah I list from
paper tonight so definitely they will
create certifications but yeah I have
never tried that it's been too much
changes now icon okay there are lots of
sprinkles being certifications I would
fanfictions I have some supplications on
our jato plea but when I did
certifications I was like learning and I
just got a certificate but when I really
meant it
that's when I realized that
certifications are completely different
and whatever I did was completely
different so I'm not a fan of
certifications but if you have too much
money you can go for it there it's just
about the knowledge right so you just
gain knowledge from what you learn and
it should be good enough I faith right
because the do I need to consider before
choosing a platform or technology that
is playing or no J's etc right
so yeah let's say you're gonna design
stock price
okay stock price viewer itself let's say
that a particular example right so what
is the stock price viewer so I want to
use some stock price into my system okay
so let's say I want to design a UI in
this case a because it's a stock price
so what I need is a UI okay so in order
to design the UI you need to come up
with some technology right you can
either choose angular or you can either
choose react.js okay you can based on
what type of application you are going
to design you can decide that so in our
case I'm going to design an application
for viewing the stock price and it needs
to be as quick as possible right and
that might be n number of stock or
thousands of stock which I want to see
right so I would go to our personally
ask me I would go for react.js compared
to angularjs because angle ajiz are
slightly heavier and it is slightly
slower why to react and react is the
library okay so you can use angular JS
and react yes together so you can go go
with this particular polyglot kind of
thing there you have multiple frameworks
okay you can create an angularjs
application with the react.js inside and
that is what the UI you can choose and
the platform obviously you can go for
cloud any of the cloud platform should
be okay based on the type of application
you are going to design so for example
let's say you are going to
create a spring boot apllication so in
my case I would say for this you don't
have to create a spring boot of musician
you can just create a node.js
application and that no J's will
directly get the stock price from Yahoo
Yahoo Finance API and then just push us
to the UN it's straightforward right you
don't have to go to any back-end service
back in the technology on but if let's
say you are creating an enterprise
system okay in that case you can use
sprain boot because Java is widely used
and everybody needs Java right so in
that case you can use it okay so you can
you can choose based on your
implementation that is what I would say
and the platform you can use either AWS
or closed foundry or as you that is that
time like it's your your cot whichever
works out for you so I think I answer
that question so next one is the saying
thanks Kaylee chops hurry up my pleasure
handle so sweatin is asking I'm not
expert in Springwood but how can we
configure or know the number of
listening threads for accepting a break
was ok so by default there is the there
is a counter 50 or something I I
remember somebody was asking me the same
question but I don't think you can see
that but dr. Chris has there is a tool
called anaphase if you had seen my
videos I would have created that has
been so there isn't a ton cotton er
trees which monitors your applications
so you can use that I think and also
there is what there are some actuator
endpoints I'm not sure if that training
point shows that number of connections
for the resting point right I am not
sure about that you can check the
actuator so if you are not familiar
about actuators actuators are way for us
to identify what is happening inside the
springboard application ok you can
expose some resting points are using
those rest endpoints you can see how
many tread threads are running level the
database connection is up or not
how is my JVM performing how much space
is left in the JVM and stuff like that
you can check with that ok just sticker
try the turtleman she was asking movies
for a lot
Swapnil has already answered a question
so polyglot means multiple languages yep
so I'm a polyglot developer if you ask
me so that means I have different I know
different languages and I can work on
different languages for example I know
angularjs I know yeah I know
groovy I know Schuyler I know something
like that so if you if you work on
multiple languages and if you know
multiple languages and you can work on
any on you office then you are a part of
the program
ok it is something like a full stack
developer so why do you call somebody as
a full stack developer right you have
experience in UI you have experience in
middle-earth similar way polyglot is
like multiple languages you know my
pleasure so clean so one she is asking
like Jaguar here how do you deploy your
angular 2 code in the server ok so you
can deploy it as a char itself so
angular 2 if you see if you have seen my
video on the microsensors design pattern
right so I would have created video on
let me show that right this part with
you in this particular video I would
have shown how I create an angular 2
angular 1 application angularjs
application and embedded inside the jar
itself okay so in Springwood
you have a way to map the and you have a
folder for static and instant particular
static you have your angular JS files
like HTML files and you can package them
along as a VAR or jar itself ok you
don't have to have separate cage you can
have embed in the in that itself and you
can deploy that so that you were back
and will be your springboard obligation
your front-end can your UI that is one
day or if you are using angular 2 or
angular 1 or anything right which you
don't have a jar or war in that case you
need a web server anyway in that case
you can use node.js
so no J's is a JavaScript engine so if
you if you see the scroll
so whatever browser and showing up here
this is a Chrome browser right this
Chrome browser runs on an engine called
v8 okay which is a JavaScript engine
okay this is based out of no J's so no
J's is a similar thing so no J's is
nothing but a application server for the
JavaScript code so if you and you
couldn't have your Java code there is a
shim go there okay so you can use that
so you will be deploying into node.js
application if you have only the UI path
and only then go change but if you don't
have any power or char year--what
etcetera right okay so I was asking just
Eve is a swagger so Jesse e-business
walking you cannot come back Josie is
just a J you can comfort Josie vs.
spring MVC okay Josie is the book may be
inside Jessie you have a resting point I
know I'm not sure just there is like
a UI there from where you can get the
rest endpoints okay it is just the
documentation for your UI okay I would
have made a bit on swagger as well so if
you had seen but I would have maintained
that it's a API documentation so as the
lesson in survival is the API
commentation okay it just throws up a UI
from there you can trigger your rest
endpoints so the rest endpoints could
have been written in jest or string ABC
or anything else okay
Jeff C is an implementation where you
can criminais ssin of your jax-rs the
jet Cyrus is a standard created by 80mm
catify the forest right so in Java so
the jacks are created in Java which is
J's of specification so Jeff C is
implemented that right so similar way
spring of MVC is a frame-up from Steam
right so you're asking what is just see
Rachel yeah so jesse is that that's what
so it is equal to spring MVC so if you
have seen all my videos I would have use
spring MVC only so whenever you use a
crest controller ad get mapping at
request mapping these annotations are on
and VC okay if you want to know about
Jesse Jesse uses ad kit at post then act
produces ad consumes those are just a
related there's a related notations
okay those earning body less related
jax-rs implementation from JAMA okay
from the Java standard so shrapnel is
angular 2 or 4 can be built using
angular CLI and place the output in the
static folder offspring movie up you can
that yeah certain is answering for your
question as l1 she so yeah I think
answered the paternal next question is
from up she again so either skin can you
explain a partial response or partial
response what do you mean a partial
response there's nothing called partial
response but there is something called
reactive streams which is kicking up are
you mentioning that
MC reactive streams so she was just
saying it is full service implementation
EP yeah
jesse is another this is nothing but an
implementation of rusty rest restful web
services spring MVC is another just sees
another okay so you're asking the next
question gypsy or spring MVC which is
better okay if you want to use spring
MVC okay when you start using
springboard applications and when you
have lots of spring related stuff it is
better to go with spring related
libraries itself because managing that
means is after a while is a is a hectic
thing because I have seen application
development for the past few years right
so it is very difficult to manage the
dependencies if you have the same
ecosystem it's easier for you to upgrade
and you'll be seamless if you are in
Jersey separately it's like you have to
upgrade your CJC might bring in some
other dependency and spring MVC my your
application might be using spring boot
and spring what will be having different
differentiy and there will be a clash so
I would suggest go with T if you choose
to go with spring if you mix and match
you can mix and match
there is no how but it is it is it comes
with a cost little bit right so yeah so
that is the one so high Baldridge
how to use the jmeter in delta and to
performance testing so i have never used
2 jaemin jmeter frankly but let me see
if I have time I can show you guys I
have used
J visual VA or debugging to use J meter
from what I heard you can it should be
straightforward you can just load your
iterations in TJ meter and you just
trigger the jmeter to sync it can inject
whatever data you want and stuff like
that okay but IA factly I am never used
to boil ranch unfortunately yeah so any
other question barrage I think you are
new to steam right
no no any other questions guys from G or
I mean or Swapnil or Shiva once he is
saying I
it is a design pattern in cloud it is
not a design pattern as such you can
design anything in cloud like you can
use any library there is no design
pattern for these Jersey and on JC is
just a restful implementation of jax-rs
nothing else okay you can use ping this
MVC as well which is going to serve the
same purpose nothing else you can use
you see Austin moon bTW
okay I think Chantal is answering to
Baldrige you can use jmeter to send
multiple requests simulating multiple
uses yeah
so then is asking what is J max so JMX
is I don't know the full form using
gimmicks you can export some quotes and
then using those ports you can connect
to the JVM
okay so that is what JMX is useful I
think it is for more thing or something
exposing for something I don't know
their exact full fun but you can use jmx
to expose export some ports or expose
somewhere you can connect to the JVM
remotely or locally and then you can get
your relevant information so it is
basically like opening some clips right
that is what J mixes so flippin and says
performance monitoring can be done in
Vita using perform perfmon plug-in so
yeah you can try panel dodge yeah
whatever Swapnil is suggesting one C
says no G so for what no G I don't in
patterns in code design patterns in
cloud we just covered right in the end
start of the acuity like you can check
one of the species in pattern the one of
the major thing is playing cloud they
show not some design patterns here like
design different term libraries for the
same patterns and the other one is a
vertex chicken go to vertex anybody work
on vertex here
so meanwhile earnings is not clear
objects I'll tell you one in one month
give me a mint so if you see here vertex
is something similar to this spring MVC
but it can run on the languages it shows
yeah if you see here a vertex also quite
so many stuff for the clock libraries
like Mambo typically in British blind
RabbitMQ nkp eventbus authentication and
all these are reactive okay even you can
use reactive in vertex okay and all
these are for maker so is a cutie here
but it's also provide services for my
services break a config all these are
there right the vertex is also becoming
like spring they are getting work some
vertex it's good to hear great yeah I
think so
explaining the nature using mix you can
expose em beans bits are nothing but
methods that can be invoked by the more
Givi in Brussels yeah that's the clear
explanation onion for some methods or
inputs from the g-give you okay and then
you can connect to those remotely and
then access them so that is what J mixes
usually generally what we use J max for
is for remote debugging I have used
extensively DJ Max for remote debugging
to connect from the J visual VM or to
connect directly from IntelliJ or
eclipse and then remote debug your code
yeah so you can get real-time addition
from the processing so that's what
surfing also mentions here so that
desert any other questions guys we can
stop the stream I don't know if you if
you guys want any stream tomorrow maybe
I can do one tomorrow as well because
for some of the people who join
initially I just said that I'm to the
stream tomorrow but yeah we'll see what
millas
J max for real-time monitoring from the
JVM right miss she was asking
in question so how vertex replace is the
thing so the vertex is not going to
replace a string vertex is a parallel
thing like spring so there are so many
things that if you see there is a there
is Hadoop there is Park there are so you
like minded things like lesson cars
there are threads there is like in
memory a grid there is gem fire you have
multiple versions of so many things
right vertex might not replace spring
because ping is a trending vertex is a
different thing but vertex is much
powerful watch that's what does and it
is using the reactive programming and it
is using reactive Kristine support right
so that is what a vertex is good at
spring is almost similar but spring is
much easier for you to code
comparatively to works if you see a
glass shrapnel will do the same thing
okay see he's doing this and he's doing
the same thing I don't think vertex will
replace spring vertex is a toolkit which
can be used in spring but if you want
yeah exactly
Oh vertex can be used anywhere but
spring is a framework vertex is the
library okay so yeah but that is the
exact thing so spring is a framework and
vertex is library you can use so many
spring libraries in such spring because
it's a framework you can use different
libraries and you can use vertex in them
like how you can use just see another
stuff inside spring you can use vertex
so mom she says yes listening and a
session tomorrow so yeah sure mom she I
can do one yep oh nice
so plane so you're in the vertex in your
spring good application very good I can
try that as well I have tried a couple
of programs in vortex but they I didn't
have extensive usage or something so I
never tried using vertex in the spring
good application network also but yeah I
can fry as well how to retrieve pilots
from AWS s3 bucket there are SDK
libraries Baldridge so if you go to our
website they provide some Amazon s3 SDK
so you can use a string so it is like
our differences okay you can use the
steroid dependency and then you can use
that to download from Amazon s3 you just
need to configure your bucket URL and
stuff factor a you can use a stick and
then you can retrieve e from the s3 okay
I'm in CERN okay what is real-time
monitoring so real-time monitoring is
and let your process is running in
production okay there is something wrong
in the process and the process crashes
okay how will you know that or there is
coming in and you want to identify
what's happening to the request where is
it going and you want to trace it right
how do you do it so that is been
real-time monitoring here so real-time
weren't in tools for example you can
check my video on trace so then I trace
is 1 then you can monitor the
application using planetaries that is
one use case so you can use you can have
custom monitors returned because before
these dynaTrace or app dynamics are so
many other tools are there before this
came into picture we used to have custom
monitors in place okay
they you should act like we need a TV
man then we used to check the process
flow or means to do that right so
nowadays any new tools have come but
that's when you can use real-time on you
you want to monitor right in production
if something crashes you want to get a
notification you want to fix it
immediately right that is why we need
real-time Monte I'm not lost so Cabana
logs both are two separate things
separate things it so Kim aligns the UI
okay from elastic so if you're not
familiar what elastic is a company which
provide the elastic search right so they
probably banana swim so Cabana is
nothing but a UI which is over elastic
search okay and logs Cabana logs are
nothing but your personal log stash so
keep one our logs are nothing but lost
lobster so yeah you use Cabana right so
use the key planner to search the logs
it not nothing but your log stash okay
long stance uses the keep an IUI okay to
view to show you the logs it might be
either log stash or it could be passed
plunk what Lotus right so the Cabana is
nothing with a UI part like a picture st
has given elastic is the company niches
reading that paul rod is asking please
provide some session on alias claudia
pal garage before you came in we were
just discussing that I want her to learn
aw yes well I'll just give some session
as well so do you guys have any
experience on a two-place how is it
right and really like if I want to
create an accountant if I want to do
something how easy is that
is that like easy or what do you guys
think like you guys use a fork or
something is there any questions I can
answer
- then was
can you use heavy SQL queries on my back
yeah you can use heavy SQL queries on my
part it is faster that is it okay so
what Nell uses ugliest nice whatnot so
it is very easy to set up a table second
reduces okay is that okay let me try I
can try that then then I can do some
Bailey stands for people so Swapnil is
saying and then that you can DQ l time
status from the process and girls is
real time monitoring yes there are so
many tools yep
active includes this term the real-time
messaging platform you can it's the JMS
implementation so you know not aware
about what is that cantaloup that is ID
I also I think I made a video an actor
and Lucas will get that yeah okay they
have a free time as well okay sure so
polite I'll just take a look at it yeah
just that I I'm not getting time because
I also work like you guys are you also
look for company I'm getting page right
I have to work it as well so yeah I come
home and then during my free time I make
these videos so yeah it's really tough
to get some free then for yourself
really nice you all have a youtube
channel nice woman but you're not very
active on it nice great man yeah but
it's a good thing but allah and i
started the channel like in february i
learned lots of things I shared
initially whatever I learned then people
started asking people like you guys ask
her ask any questions and then I started
learning it's it's pretty good it's it's
like sharing and learning right okay
okay
that's it I not hold you guys for more
it's already almost 11 plus right so
that's it for this session guys I hope
you guys got some knowledge I hope you
enjoyed the session it's difficult to
