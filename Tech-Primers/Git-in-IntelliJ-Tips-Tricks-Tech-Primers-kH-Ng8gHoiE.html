when you are working with gate projects
do you use command line or do you use
the different options which are
available in IntelliJ IDEA in this
particular video we are going to see
what are the different options with
which you can work around without using
get commands let's get started
press the bell icon on the YouTube app
and never miss any update from tech
primers if you have worked with it
you know that you will have to do lots
of command related stuff when you want
to do merging when you want to do
raising a pull request when you want to
pull some changes from your report
repository or when you want to merge
some stuff from the develop branch to
your feature branch so let's see how to
make that simple using dicket's internal
the gait features which are available
inside the intelligent right so how do
we create a feature branch right so if
you have say for example let me see
let's think that I want to create a
branch from master so let's say I'm in
master so how do you check out a black
branch so you can go to that particular
branch let's say I want to check out a
remote branch if you want to do that you
can just directly click here and you can
create it as a new local branch ok so
you can directly go to this option here
which will be available here so if you
have the git project by default
intelligible identify this kit if it is
a scene it will show SPN in our case it
is kit so it is showing up kit and then
it shows the different branches local
branches are the one which I have
created locally so these branches are
not there in the remote repository so
basically github is my remote repository
in this particular project there is just
a sample project which I have opened if
you notice here there is a remote
branches option it shows what is the
remote branch which is available so
there more branch which is available
here is the origin slash master so
previously I had created a local master
what I am going to do now is I'm going
to create a new local branch and then I
am going to name it as develop so if I
say master it already said that there is
a local branch already available now I'm
going to create a new local branch from
the remote branch and I'm going to name
it as develop right and I'm going to say
ok so this is going to create a copy of
exactly the master but it will be inside
local right and if you notice here this
develop is linked up with the origin
master that basically means whenever
there is a change in the master I will
just when I just pull
from the remote repository I'll be able
to sync it with a develop so let's say
there is a change in the master so how
do I pull it right so you might be using
the git pull command so if you want to
work with kid commands you can directly
go to the terminal and then you can do
it as well so if I say git branch it is
going to tell me what branch I am in
right now right now I'm in the develop
branch and get by default IntelliJ by
default shows up what branch we are here
if you want to go to a different branch
you go here go to that particular branch
and do what check out right so this way
you can do that as well
and if I say git branch say if I am now
in the master but if you want to do that
from the command prompt you can do that
as well so you can type the
corresponding command and then you can
do that as well right there is one more
tool which is available here in IntelliJ
so this is called the version control
where you can see the logs of the
different branches and you can mix and
match and you can see when when each
commit was made and how the merge
happened so this is I don't have any
more feature once I think I have only
very few feature branches created and I
have not done many comets but if you are
working in a huge project right where
different people are working on
different feature branches and you want
to see how is it progressing you can see
that in this particular place so
basically you have to come to the
version control and go to the in log
version control log so this will show
you different branches so for example
here this is going to show me all the
branches but I can just select what
branch I want if I say develop it is
going to say these are the commits on
the develop if I say feature enclosing
this it will show what on commits are
there if I say all it is going to show
me the both T or sorry all the feature
branches on the branches which we have
and you can see that there is a tag here
right it shows see this commit is made
on this particular feature branch this
commit is made on master this come it is
made on include filters feature then
there is one origin and develop so these
are the different branches it shows and
also you can filter out by user so you
can say me and it will filter out only
your commits it will remove all the
other comments or you can even select a
specific user in
in this case and you can select by days
as well not 7 days 24 hours and you can
even select the path basically the
folders right and this is what shows up
the option to have different branches
see this right this particular option
shows that there was a different branch
which had a commit called initial bucket
and then it finally merged into master
so this is how a branch flow works and
if you have seen the gate branch
workflow generally that's how it is
right and this particular SVN log sorry
the version control log it will show up
in the same pattern here okay so this is
one way you can easily see which track
which changes are where right so without
having to do any gate log command it
will automatically do all those git log
and then it will show you all right ok
so one other thing which I have seen is
if you go to the history so you say
right and there are two history there
are two history things right now I want
to compare these two so I can just
select these two and then I can do a
command D or control D in Windows if I
do that it shows the diff and you notice
that you can do it if you can have a
side-by-side or you can have a unified
viewer I I prefer side-by-side I know
that so that I know which one is what so
left side is what is there in the first
commit sorry the last commit I mean the
first commit the older commit and then
the right side is one is there then you
overcome so it shows the diff and you
can compare it right you can use the
ctrl D command or the command D in Mac
to get that triggered now let me go and
create a new branch way so like how we
did from the remote branch you did a
check out as a new branch here you can
directly create a new branch and when
you create this new branch this new
branch is going to be branched off from
the master so if I say I'll just say
feature slash new branch right I'm going
to save it as new branch and by default
I have the check out branch enabled so
after creating the room branch it gets
checked out see this side after creating
the new branch gets checked out and if I
go to this log it will right now I have
not done any commits so it shows it
doesn't show up let me do some commit
right so I
change this file now I'm gonna commit
this file so how do I commit so what you
can do is you can go to get and then do
a commit file right you can do a git and
then do a commit file so I'm going to
say show for demo okay and it's going to
add a show for them and you have
different options one is creating a
patch creating a patch is like creating
a default of that particular change and
you can ship it to somebody else the
patch can be shipped to somebody else
and they can apply the patch like how
normal patch is created from IntelliJ
so you can literally have the changes
the tips you have the changes you have
done it just creates a patch out of the
change and then you can give it to
somebody else they can apply the patch
the changes will be reflected in their
code base so that is patch that you can
either create a patch or you can do a
commit and push I am NOT going to push
this particular project to the github
repository so I'm not going to commit
and push I'm just going to say commit so
when I do a commit it just commits into
my local repository so if you notice
here I created a branch called a new
branch and it is having a commit called
show for demo right so that is what
shows up here because I have a different
branch and I branched off from master
and that is why this is there and this
is my branch okay this is some other
branch which is there with somebody else
committed right so that is how you
create a branch and then you can commit
it and if you want to create these
branches in the remote repository what
you can do is you can do a git push
right you can do a git repository and
then you can do a push and if you notice
here this gets created so you see this
edge showing new that means this branch
is going to get created new leaf on the
remote repository but I don't want to
push this but you can do that like you
can create a local branch and you can
create the remote branch automatically
by pushing it from intellij so you don't
have to go and create a remote branch
and then pull it or fetch it and do do
something else you don't have to do that
you can just create a local branch from
the local intellij the new branch you
can use the new branch feature created
from there and then push it when you do
a push it automatically gets created
right now how do I merge branches right
how do I merge branch from
branch stolen right so for example now
we did a change in the new branch but
master is very old right master is a
little bit old so let me go to master
I'll just check out master okay and I'm
going to merge the new branch so what I
can do is I go to master and I want to
merge so much' branch into this branch
so I click on that particular branch and
I say merge
ok if I do this it is going to merge the
feature new branch onto the master okay
so if you see here it got mushed so
master on the feature new board merge
they are in the same one here right if
you see here they are the same taxi
master feature branch both are the same
commit now and you would have seen this
image has got changed
comparatively right so that is how you
merge a branch to another branch okay
this this is without any reviewable or
any process as such but if you are doing
a review you can go to bid package
create a pull request or if you are
using github you can raise a pull
request you can raise a pull request and
people can reviewing it review it and
once the review is successful you can
just merge this so get bitbucket as the
same thing in the background ok whatever
intelligence so that is how you merge
stuff if you want to pull changes from a
report repository for example I have
master here I want to change I want to
pull the latest change from the remote
repository in that case I can go to get
I'll go to repository and I can say pull
ok this will pull my changes from the
origin master see this way it is going
to pull my change from the origin master
so origin master is nothing but my
remote repository which somebody could
have pushed as well so that is why we
need to pull so you can do a pull it
will just pull the latest changes onto
the master ok that is how you pull if
there is a conflict IntelliJ will pop-up
window and will show what are the
conflicts you can open and merge it or
you can either pull yours or pull theirs
or you can do a merge where you can
modify or pick up only few changes from
the remote repository changes and skip
the others and you say apply and then it
will get most ok that is one more
another way of merging stuff right so
apart
from that what else do we have so let me
go and check once if I have covered
everything right there is something
called fetch okay what is this bitch
right this fetch is nothing but it is
going to sync up your repository with
you more repositories let's say there is
a new branch created okay in the github
or in bitbucket somebody get at a new
feature branch or no new batch okay if
you do a fetch in your local repository
that new branch will be reflected onto
your repository but your code will not
change to any extent unless you have the
same branch but it will immediately sync
your local repository with an amount
repository so literally it will get the
updates it will fetch the updates from
the remote repository and it will update
your local repository if there is a new
remote branch created it will show up in
the remote transactions here right so
that is what the fetch does okay it
doesn't do anything else it just sinks
up to our complete repository and then
it shows up in the remote repository
section remote branches section okay
there are other options you have a
option called stash changes and unstack
changes stash and understand changes are
nothing but let's say I do a change okay
I just show you one example right so
let's say I have this change now if I
click on the local it changes here it
will show what change I did and now
let's say I want to pull some changes or
I want to go to a different branch right
I want to go to a different branch but I
don't want to lose this change okay
what do I do I just do a right click and
then I can do get repository stash
changes so when I do stashes I am going
to say stash example one okay this is
going to create a patch basically this
is going to create a patch and keep it
somewhere that's it and you see that the
change got better and it doesn't show
any change now what you can do you can
go to a different branch or you can
merge from different branch and do all
those stuff and then finally you come
back and understand it so unstitch is
what when you can do after you stash
right you are done with your changes and
now you want to apply those changes back
and when you do that understand if you
notice here it shows up on master be
created and stash file called stash
sample 1 that is what we are going to
apply now so when you do a apply stash
you can do that directly and that
particular change will be now reflected
see this in court reflected here ok and
now you can commit our work on this
particular branch so stash changes and
unstressed changes are useful when you
want to do something on the branch but
you don't want to do anything to your
uncommitted files but you want to retain
them after doing some operations so that
is when you use stash changes and then
finally unstitch them so that you can
get it back and then you can now commit
or post or whatever you want you can do
right so I think those are the different
features which are there in IntelliJ all
right you can use this option you can
directly click on if you see any gate
here you just click on it you get this
particular window so if you don't know
what to do you can just go to the
interaction the control shift a or the
command shift a right if you do that it
pops up this window and you just typed
it and it will show up what to do right
you can either revert you can do
comparison with the different repository
same repository you can commit the file
go to a different branch or tag more
changes or stash changes and stash and
all those things you can do that's it
for this particular video hope you found
it interesting I hope you learned
something from this video on intelligent
may taken in the next video
