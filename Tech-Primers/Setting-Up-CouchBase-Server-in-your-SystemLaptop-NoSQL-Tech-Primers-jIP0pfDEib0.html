install Couchbase let's see how we can
download an install Couchbase in your
laptop let's get started press the bell
icon on the YouTube app and never miss
any update from tech primers I'm in the
home page of couch based comm what you
can do is you can go to the download
option and you can download the
respective version of the couch space
which we need so I have just clicked the
download option let's see what pops up
right so there are different versions of
couch page available here the first one
is the server version the other one is
the mobile version inside the server
version there are two options the
enterprise on the community version so
what I have done is I have just
downloaded the community version for Mac
OS because I have Apple laptop here
which has Mac OS so I have just
downloaded this particular version if
you have Windows you can just select
Windows and then just download that so I
have just hit the download option and
then I have already downloaded this let
me open that frame so I have it
downloaded and I have it unzip so let's
go through the installation process
right so usually I don't take the video
on the installation process but many of
you guys have requested me to do the
complete video on how do we install a
software and how we can start it up as
well
so that is why I am making this
particular video so that I can show you
how we can install Couchbase and then we
can get it further so in this particular
video we will see how to install
Couchbase and how we can get it up and
running there is a readme document
document here so meanwhile let this come
up right so I just went through the
readme dot txt it says that ok we will
be able to install Couchbase in the
laptop and by default after the
installation the server will be started
and we can access it from the browser
using the port 8 0 9 1 so that is what
they
say you can do let's see where is that
so the server automatically starts after
installation and the web-based console
is available at port 8:09 one default
okay so that's what they say
so hopefully the server should come up
after the installation
so let's see what is inside this package
right so what I have done here is I just
started the coach base server right so I
just double-click and open the Couchbase
server option here and then it just
started me the server so I think in
Windows you should be able to directly
install that particular software but I
think in my windows in my laptop it was
not allowing me to open because it was
saying that okay I have it downloaded
from the internet so it was just not
allowing me to open it however I just
went inside the contents and then I just
opened the server so this is just
started I don't know if this would have
started my server instance right for
example let's go and see oh yeah it has
started right so it's just asking me to
set up a new cluster or join an existing
cluster so I am just going to say new
cluster just provide a cluster name so
let's say I'm gonna provide the cluster
name as tech primers and the admin
username is admin let's see password
let's say I'm not going to give anything
ok it's asking me for a password it's
saying 6 characters is the minimum so
I'm just going to say admin 1 so I had
made one so I'm just saying next so let
me save this I will just say accept
finish with default it is in submission
in memory the requested quota is talking
the maximum all of quota for the Norris
ok it's trying to install some
particular node configuration but we are
not able to set it up because I don't
think I have enough space in my laptop I
think there is only 100 Gig or something
which is available but still I think it
should be fine let me disable some stuff
so that we will be able to
so you can finish let's see what happens
right yeah it has set up the server so
that node is there and this is the
dashboard so you can add buckets so if
you notice here when I said we can
create buckets you can hear it buckets
here so you can literally add these
buckets provide a name for that
particular bucket so let's say I am
going to add a packet called users so
that we can use it for our example so
I'm just adding a bucket called users
I'll just say add the bucket
alright and if you notice here this
bucket does not know created so it has
created a bucket called users with a
memory of 1.4 sound gig right you see
the you see the RAM usage and you see
the quota that is accused is whatever
right now right so that is what cow
space can do so couch pays by default
provides you a dashboard using the
dashboard you can configure the
different buckets you can use the
indexes to query so right now there is
no data so you can create query so if
there is no query node formed on the
server and the only server which is
available right now is ours right
it just shows some statistics out of it
right so this is a very good dashboard
it is open sourced that is why we are
able to easily see it right and if I go
to the buckets I created a bucket called
user so this is the same bucket which we
are going to use it when we are going to
create a program using this promoter
plication right so this is how you can
start a Couchbase database right right
now the couch pay stub is a started beta
order and we just opened the couch based
database and we have also setup a user's
bucket right I'm going to use this
bucket in the next video in the example
which we are going to create using
spring break I hope you guys understood
how we can download it on how we can set
up couch base hope you liked it if you
liked the video go ahead and like it if
you haven't subscribed to the channel go
ahead and subscribe to it wait again in
the next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
