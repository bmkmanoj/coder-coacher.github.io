are going to see how does spring MVC
books so if you are aware about MVC
which is nothing but Model View and
controller if you are aware that JSP
uses this model view controller
framework then this particular session
will be a cakewalk for you so spring
internally is using the Model View
controller which is adapted from the JSP
servlet framework so if you see here we
have a dispatch of servlet so ideally if
you see a MVC framework so it will have
a dispatcher servlet so this is the same
dispatcher failure which spring is using
so the first part how the request comes
is this request reaches the dispatcher
servlet from the dispatchers level it is
sent to a handler mapping so handler
mapping has the list of mappings which
you have created for RS controller so
for example let's say you have a rest
endpoint saying slash rest slash search
so that particular mapping will be
registered to this Handler mapping using
the controller so what we will be doing
is the green parts if you see in this
particular diagram so these are the ones
which we will be creating and spring
will hold those so for example in this
case we create a controller call let's
say search service so you have a rest
endpoint you are all saying set flash
rest slash search and that will be
registered to a handler mapping so then
spring identifies it identifies that
okay I have a controller which is having
a path a slash slash search and that
will be inside the holla mapping so the
next part would be loading the handler
adapter so the handler mapping just had
the mappings to the controller however
the holla adapter is the one which is
going to route it to the controller so
when we hit this particular rest URL
then it will automatically route to the
controller using the handler adapter so
that will be the step 4 so once it hits
the annular adapter then it reaches to
the controller so from the controller we
do whatever processing we need for
example let's say if you want to query a
search server so we query the database
using some JPI repository or hibernate
or whatever it is so we query the
database and then we can return that
back so whatever we will be querying
and we will be creating a model right so
obviously when we do a database query we
create a model out of it so which is
model is nothing but a plain old Java
object so that is going to be the model
which is displayed here in this part so
that is the model so how will we display
it back so there is something called
view resolver which there is dispatch a
servlet uses so that is going to route
the model back to the view so whatever
result we got that will be displayed in
the view back using the view resolver so
this is the high-level view of how
spring works spring MVC books and the
green parts whatever we have displayed
here that'll that is what we will be
creating as a part of our development
the others are all provided by spring
MVC so that will be out of the box
available for us so we don't have to
worry about how to route our servlets
like how we do in JSP right so you have
to have a mapping your to create a
handler map in your decorator after you
have to plug the servlets manually into
the web dot XML so that you don't have
to do it spring MVC takes care of that
the only part which we need to work on
is the controller the service the
repositories or and the view so that
that is what we will be doing so that's
it for the spring MVC overview let's
meet in the next session for creating a
spring MVC application thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
