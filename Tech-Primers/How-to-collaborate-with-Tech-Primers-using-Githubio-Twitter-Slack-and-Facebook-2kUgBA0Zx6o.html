this video we are going to see how you
can collaborate with us to identify how
and what we can learn next okay so if
you are familiar with my blog channel
you already saw that there are lots of
different videos and there are lots of
different examples right so I have
created a web page in github okay so
from where you can download all the
repository so if you notice the web page
is called tech primers short github so
this is hosted inside the github website
which I oh okay so which is under
github.com slash tech primers so
basically what I have done is I have
created a web page okay from here you
can see all the repositories so whenever
I add new projects you can see that here
automatically so right now I if you
notice I have 26 public repositories
from where you can download the code so
basically these are links to the code so
for example if I open this project right
so excuse me so if I open spring
security DB example you can notice that
this is directly taking me to the github
website under tech primers so as you
already know we have a profile in github
so that is where I host this website as
well so you can use this particular
website to navigate through whatever
example you need and download that
respective code from there directly out
of the box so it's all open source
basically so whenever you see a video if
you see in the description I have a link
for the github repository you can go
from there directly or you can go to
tech primers short github high off and
get the suppository link anytime
whenever you need so that is one means
of sharing the code right so I have
shared the code wire kit up so you can
know that so if you are not aware what
about what is gate and github I have
made a video on that as well you can
check that the next medium is the
Twitter so you can contact me on Twitter
so if you are not aware what is Twitter
just take a look at Twitter so Twitter
is another social media platform to
communicate with people okay so this is
my official Twitter handle tech primers
so you can go there and then tweet me
also there are a couple of fans
who used to speak within Twitter okay
the next one is Facebook so as you know
already everyone uses Facebook right so
there is a Facebook page you can go to
facebook.com slash strike primers so you
can collaborate with me offline there so
it is all private shared there so you
can give me so lots of videos I have
made based on Sam solutions for example
the recent spring security video I made
out of fan suggestion so you can go
there and then speak with me from there
as well
the next major thing is your YouTube
homepage so if you're not aware you can
directly come to my channel using
youtube.com slash tech primers and do
subscribe to my channel and then press
the build like on so that you can get
notifications immediately then and there
so that you don't miss any video okay
the next major thing which I have
started is the slack website so as you
know slack is a collaborative tool where
you can share with your team members so
basically you can create a team so what
I have done is I have created a team
called tech primers or slack comm so if
you go to tech primers or slack comm
it'll ask you to sign up there you can
sign up there or you can give me your
mail id and I will invite you personally
so that you can directly come into the
team so what I do is I can collaborate
with people here so you can post in your
questions and people can reply even I
can reply so you can create a community
for people to learn so if you are not
aware about slack go to slack jawed
forum and then check out what a slack so
these are the different mediums with
which and you can collaborate with me so
I will be able to help you in taking
further steps of learning or your career
as well okay so that is what I wanted to
cover in this video thank you very much

these collaboration mediums and then
