are going to say what is git and github
so if you are familiar with the
repository system so we store our code
base in a repository right so give me
the repository okay and github is the
place where all the codes reside so it's
like all the open source codes are
indicate hub repository so if you see I
have a profile here called tech primers
and I have uploaded all the repositories
or the code bases which every here did
right so I have done lots of videos all
the videos I have posted the code
samples into the github repository so
notice here I already have 24 apposite
orys so these are basically 24 different
code bases so if I go let's say I select
a particular code base I can see all the
files which are there in the code base I
have some documentation as well and you
can see the branches you can see commits
you can see how many contributors
committed contributed you can fork from
here so basically get is the repository
version controlling system and github is
a place where all the open source
projects are hosted using the github
gate version control system so why gate
is so powerful right so you know one add
one major difference between the gate
and the SP and the C CVS communities are
there scheme in CVS you have to commit
the code directly on to the repository
right however in gift
you basically clone the repository
locally so it's a distributed version
control system so let's say you have a
repository so for example let's take
this particular repository so I have
this particular repository in github so
what I will do is I close this
particular repository locally ok so
basically what happens is you will they
create a copy of this particular
repository locally and you can work that
locally so you don't have to have
internet or something to push the code
to the mains opposite instead you have
the code in the local repository you can
do all the changes in the local
repository and then whenever you have
internet or whenever you have
connectivity with the internet you can
push that to vary more suppose it so
that is the powerful thing about git and
since the repository is low country
and it is running in your mission which
is there in your machine it is very
powerful and very fast ok so it is so
fast that ok whatever comments your
branch creations and everything you do
it's like super fast compared to SPN
comment ok and you are going to push to
the remote repository I'll pull from the
remote repository once in a while only
ok so let's see how github works right
so I will show you I have already
installed it in my machine ok so we are
already in a in ok I'll create one more
directly so that I have I was previously
trying it out so I'll create a directory
called gate demo ok so I'll go to the
gate demo so basically if we see there
is nothing in this particular directory
ok so what we need to do is in order to
create a git repository let's say this
particular report in this particular
folder I want to create it as a git
repository so before that let's check if
gate is working yeah I have gate version
to resolve for ok now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to say get in it so get
in it will create a repository for us ok
so this basically creates a repository
called get underscore get - demo ok this
is like locally if you want to create a
repo and then you want to push it you
can do it but if let's say you want to
clone a particular repository you have
to use some other come on so I will
clone and I'll do that later first but
first let's see how to create a deposit
in it so we have created a git
repository ok and if you notice here
there is a folder called dot kit which
is hidden so all the stuff which are
related to kit will be inside the DAAD
kit is get folder so currently there is
nothing in this particular folder so I'm
going to create a file called raid me
dot MD and inside that I am going to
just say that hello ok I'm not doing
anything else so I have one file now
what do I need to do is I have the git
repository initialized so I need to
commit this particular file in
the repository right so at present there
will be a branch so that branch is
called master branch so if I J say get
status if you see it says on branch
master so there there is always one
branch which is the which is the
ultimate production branch it is the
master and you can create develop
branches or feature branches so in
general what people do is if people
follow different branching strategies so
there is a branching strategy by
branching stretch it means see so that
is a branching successful branching
strategy by vincit let's check that
particular branching strategy right so
how how people branch so if you
basically see this is the branching
strategy so let me go to the PDF CG had
created so that we can have a full view
so this is the one okay
so let this load so
on different branches if you notice here
down upon the master are the major
branches so master is always a copy of
production or basically whatever is
there in masters it is production ready
and ready to be released to production
so that is the master so develop has
been where you do all your development
so master is where your production tag
is production releases the production
versions and develop is then you do all
your local changes or your trunk base
changes so you all your feature changes
and all those things so whenever you
work on any feature you can create a
separate feature branch if you notice
here in this strategy what this is you
so developed has all the changes which
are there currently so you can branch
out different features so if there is a
major feature of feature future future
release you just crunch it out from
develop you finish the feature Lee and
then you again Modi to develop okay so
by that way develop is always the latest
on it all all all has the changes so for
wants to commit something on to the
develop branch or on to the repository
they create a feature branch work on the
feature branch and then again merge it
on to the develop branch okay that is
what they do and if you want to do a
release
they cut a release version from the
develop branch if you see here we cut a
release version from the develop branch
and we create something or release
branches and from the trolleys once you
merge it again to master
actually these are like different
declarer bug fixes right after you cut
the release branch etcetera but bug
fixes then you can do that in the
release branch and then you can push
that to master so once you push this to
master the same needs to be pushed to
table because you have done some big bug
fixes right so those needs to be pushed
again to develop and then finally this
release branch can be deleted so same
way with feature branches so once you
are merged everything to the develop
your feature once was gone
so you can delete it so get mostly books
on this concept so people what they do
is if they are working on a separate
feature they create a separate feature
branch work on the feature branch merger
to pull merge it to into the develop
branch and then delete that particular
teacher burn so that is how everybody
works on
it and that is how gate works as well
because it is easier for you to create
branches and then merge start to the
develop rather than working on develop
may always on the run
okay so that is the word gate so let's
so you got the concept I so we will have
a master and they will append if you'll
notice here in our project we have only
masters right now because we just
created that repository right we just
initialize that repository but you can
create your own branches so that is what
I'm going to show how to create branches
and stuff so right now we created a file
right now we need to add this particular
file so before committing this
particular file we need to add this
particular file and say that okay this
is the valid file and I am going to add
it or commit it okay so that is why I am
just doing it add so then later on what
we need to do is we needed to commit
okay so I am just giving a comment so
I'm just saying readme commit so you
have to say get commit - M and then the
file and then D comment me so what it
will do is it will commit all the files
which are pending to be committed in
this particular project okay so if you
notice here it is how quickly it did
right so it committed basically to the
master and there is only one sign okay
so the git branch command will show you
which which branch you are in currently
so it basically shows all the branches
git status shows which branch you are in
and what are the pending files which you
invent to commit so let's say I create
one more file okay you test dot txt okay
and if I say get status it is going to
tell me that okay that file is added but
you have not added it as a gate act so
that I can commit it next step okay that
is what is the same so we need to say
git add and then that finally okay and
then you need to say git commit - M
commit no ok that way that gets
committed and if you notice here the
body files are there if I do LS and if I
just say get started
nothing is pending see it says nothing
to commit working directory clean
and if I say get trance it is going to
say show me what all the bandages are
there so now how do I create a branch
from this master branch right so I need
to say git branch okay - B and then I
need to give a name for it so I'm going
to create a develop branch we don't have
a develop branch a story I need to say
it check out not branch so I need to say
git checkout - B so what happens is it
creates a new branch from the master
branch because we were there on the
master branch so you know if I say get
branch I see that there are two branches
develop and master okay and they
automatically checks out the develop
branch and changes to the development so
you saw that it is saying that switch to
to a new branch called develop now if I
want to create another branch as they
get check out B features let's say one
that I'm just saying something so I will
just say that I created a new branch now
if I do a git branch it is going to show
me three branches one is master one is
development feature okay
and it got changed to the feature branch
so if you notice the feature branch if I
say git status
there is nothing pen there is nothing
pinning me up I see that these two files
are there automatically okay and if I
now modify this new file let me write
this file was empty okay hi YouTube I'm
just going to modify this file okay and
I'm going to come at this file and just
say add all of the things and I'm going
to say commit - am updated okay this is
going to commit the file which got
change which is nothing but he noticed
so now if you see we have three branches
okay we have three branches one is the
feature branch one is the develop branch
one is the master branch so inside the
master branch we did not modify this new
test file but inside the feature branch
we modified this new test file so now
how do I push this particular code into
the github repository right so let's see
how to do that so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to create
new repository in github so I'll just
create with the same name called get
demo ok so that you guys can go and also
this particular opposite if you notice
here the repository was created and it
shows some predefined commands what you
can turn ok so what we need to do is we
need to add what we did is already we
did they get in it we added that file we
committed that file now we need to do
work git remote and so basically we need
to link our local repository with the
github repository so that is why we need
this particular come up ok and also I'm
just going to tag it with my username
here so that it won't ask me my username
because I have already logged it ok so
if I saw do a git remote add origin this
is going to add my remote repository
with my current local repository ok so
remote repositories were all will always
called origin so whenever you notice
there will be origin develop origin
master or origin feature whenever you do
a push so basically your remote
repository is called are called origin
origin repositories and whatever you
have are called local branches so it
basically branches so you have origin
branches from the local branches so that
is how it is differentiated so your
repository your local repository is
differentiated with either both
repository so if you notice here we have
done a remote add origin now we need to
push all these branches on to the remote
repository right so if you notice here
there is nothing here I just just so
fish it if you notice it is empty
repository that is what is showing some
dummy text here if I do a push rate I
need to the word push basically I need
to push all these branches from my local
repository to the github repository so I
am just going to say git push - oooh
origin master so if I do this it will
push the master branch from here to
there okay I have just done a git push
origin master so let it push if you
notice here the objects are getting
pushed ok I see that there is a new
branch which God created which is called
master - master let's go and check this
out here right
yeah if you notice your two files got
created so inside the readme I have a
hello okay inside the new text I don't
have anything it is empty now I have
committed one branch right I have pushed
basically one branch now I need to push
the other branches okay if I do a git
push it will by default push all the
branches so but we have different
branches that we have developed branch
we have feature branch so what we need
to do is we need to do the same thing so
we need to do git push okay I have to
say origin I need to say feature 1.0
I'll just push the feature branch once
and then I will push the develop branch
so in general this will not happen
because the first time you created a
branch so you need to push them manually
so I'll just say git push icon you
origin develop so we have develop
branches alright so I am going to push
both develop and the feature branch on
to the repository so you can go let's go
and check how it is so if you notice a
that is called push so if i refresh it
it should show here how many branches
are there so if you notice here there
are three branches and there are two
commits if you see here there is a
feature 1.0 and i just showing something
called pull request so let's come to
that pull to question a moment but let's
go and check how many branches are there
yeah if you notice your default branch
is called master so as I said earlier
master is the production branch okay
that is what has the production : that
is the default branch and then you have
develop and feature branches okay so you
always the daughter changes onto the
develop branch so by by doing a feature
branch by doing a feature branch cut and
from the feature once you merge it to
the develop touch so now we are going to
say how to merge the feature branch
change on to the develop branch so
inside the feature branch if I go to the
code base right I have modified this new
test or txt to have an hello hi YouTube
right I need and if you notice in the
develop branch that is not there if I go
to the develop branch it is not here
nothing is here right so what do I need
to do is I need to raise the pull
request so basically so currently I'm on
the develop branch and raising a pull
request to
merge from the feature branch on to the
develop branch so that is what I am
doing here if you notice here I'm going
to say base branch is developed and I'm
going to compare that with the feature
branch okay so if you notice here it is
asking me to it has identified okay okay
there are some change so if you see here
this is the change
so it has identified that I have updated
the new test or txt file with some
content and I need to give some pull
requests name right so I am going to say
updated the new test file okay so once I
create a pull request I can add people
to review it
so basically a pull request is used for
reviewing your changes so if I give this
so for example if you notice here it has
created a pull one okay this is the
first polar cosine rate so anyone who is
contributing to this particular code
base or repository they can come and
review they can give comments they can
come and review the coaching so if I
notice here if I go to commit it will
show what committed it like and people
can see what are the file changes if I
click on the file changes if you showing
me what is the change I did so if it
notices this is what I have done I can
give comments if here if I click the
plus button I can give comments here so
that people can respond so once I say
that ok all my files on the changes are
good so what do I do
so I need to merge the pull request
right so this pull turkish nation merge
on to develop okay so whoever reviews or
over raises the politicos they can click
on the merge option once it is done so
if I if I see I say confirm merge so
once I say conformers this particular
feature branch is now washed onto
develop so if I go to the repository
okay if I go to let's say code it shows
what all branches are there if you
notice here I have feature branches I
have master branch if I go to the
develop branches and if I go to this new
test or txt it has the change here okay
so what happened is my pull request has
merged the changes from the feature
branch onto the develop branch so this
is how we make the develop this is how
we push the data or the code from the
feature branch on to the develop branch
so
the develop branch to the master branch
you can do it maven trapeze if you have
maven or something you can do a maven
release or we can take again a boulder
post emerge from develop branch to
master so it is not absolutely mandatory
for you to have master and your develop
branch but it is generally advised to
have a master plan so that you have a
production ready version there okay so
that is how you basically push data on
to the github repository okay so let's
say if I want to clone a repository so
for example I am selecting this
repository so I have a repository URL so
what I need to do is I need to do a git
clone command okay I had to do a git
clone and if I do that this particular
repository will be cloned okay and if I
notice here this particular folder has
got created so if I go inside and see
and if I say git branch it is going to
show me what branches are there and
there is only one branch called master
okay if you notice here this particular
repository has only one branch called
master so that is where there is only
one master and you can see all the
coaches and I can do all my code changes
here I can just just the file and then I
can do a push if I do what's the F push
it will come here directly and I can if
I create a separate branch I can do a
pull request I can raise a pull request
and ask somebody to review that and
merge it or else I can directly push
down to develop if I am comfortable okay
that is that is how or even the master
basically so in my case I had only
master I taken directly push it too much
so that is how git repository book so I
know it is slightly confusing in the
initial part if you try to read
recheck what I have said from the
beginning you will be able to understand
a little bit but you will get used to it
only when you start working on it so
github is a very good place to work with
get so github is a open source
repository you can create a number of
repositories you can come come to thee
you can have private repositories
ourselves you can just create an account
on the github website and then you can
play around with how to do how to use
git you can create projects you can push
project you can try to create pull
requests we can modify stuff
we can play around with it and IntelliJ
has very good support forget so let me
know if you want me to make a video on
IntelliJ on how to use git but yeah
hopefully you understood the what gate
is and what github is so that's it for
this particular video if you liked the
video go ahead and like it if you have
any comments or doubts go ahead and drop
that in the comment section so if you
haven't subscribed already go ahead and
subscribe as one so that is for this
particular video may again in the next
video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
