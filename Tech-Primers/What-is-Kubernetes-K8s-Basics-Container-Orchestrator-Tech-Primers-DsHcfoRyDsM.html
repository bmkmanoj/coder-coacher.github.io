are familiar with water containers then
you need to definitely know what is
kubernetes let's see what is kubernetes
and how does it play with containers
let's get started press the bell icon on
the YouTube app and never miss any
update from tech crimes let's see the
agenda for this particular session we
are going to see what is containers this
will be a brief introduction about the
containers if you want to see in detail
about containers I have made a video
already about the containers you can
check that out but we will cover what is
containers because that is the basis for
the kubernetes then we will be seen why
do we need orchestration in the
containers then they will be seeing what
is kubernetes and finally how powerful
kubernetes is
so what are containers containers are
basically a lightweight component or a
lightweight image which are standalone
executable packages which you can run
inside a sandbox and on
it is platform-agnostic and it can
isolate software from the surroundings a
typical example of a real-world
containerization is shipment where you
want to ship your products from one
place to another
however you don't want to get it damaged
that is why we containerize it right
similar to that beacon denies our
application when we are doing the
deployment along with other deployments
our deployment shouldn't get messed up
that is why we have separate containers
to safeguard our application
why do we need orchestration the
containers are already separate why do
we need an orchestration still this is a
typical architecture of a container so
we have a hardware or a server then we
have the host OS and then we have a
containerized engine I have I'm just
showing the docker engine so this is a
typical docker architecture where you
have a docker engine running over the OS
and then over that you have the
different docker containers inside the
docker containers you have applications
if you have a single server this is how
an architecture looks like let's say you
have more servers you keep on adding
more and more servers what happens to
your container container set so if you
notice here we already have nine
containers and if these keeps on
increasing right we are not able to
manage the containers we will have to
have the configurations to deploy to
different nodes and how do we know what
is deployed to which machine and which
application is running in which server
that is when we will be getting the help
from kubernetes so what is kubernetes
kubernetes is nothing but a container
orchestration platform it is an open
source platform which was created by
Google in 2014 and they have now
contributed that to the cloud native
computing foundation which is managing
kubernetes currently
why everyone is talking about common it
is because it is very flexible and we
will be seeing their features in the
next slide however how kubernetes works
is it can group containers that create a
single application and it splits into
logical units for easy management and is
good that is how kubernetes identifies
how many nodes are there so kubernetes
has this concept of pods pods are
nothing but nodes which are nothing but
servers where different containers can
be deployed in a bar you can have a
single container or a multiple container
so how powerful is kubernetes is I have
mentioned this k8s
right what is this k8s in the olden days
they used to have an abbreviation Pat
and where they take the first letter
they take the last letter and they
mentioned the number of characters
between the first and the last letter in
between that is what k8s means so let's
see what are the features of kubernetes
the first one is horizontal scaling it
can scale horizontally let's say you
have deployed a pod or different
containers your containers can be scaled
when you have it configured
automatically the next one is
self-healing which is what I completely
liked about kubernetes it restarts the
containers whenever it fails and in
three places and release can use these
containers whenever a node dies it
automatically kills these old containers
which do not respond to the user queries
so they will be immediately removed out
of your network these are done based on
the health checks which kubernetes does
internally
the next one is a load balancing and the
service discovery there is no need for
us to modify our application code in
order to make us familiar with the
differences service discovery mechanisms
kubernetes gives containers their own IP
addresses and a single dns name for a
set of containers and they can do load
balancing across them similar to other
platform alice services or any other
deployment platform of the cloud
platform kubernetes can also do the load
balancing and the service discovery stop
the next one is the automated rollouts
in the rollbacks kubernetes
progressively rolls out the changes to
your application and also its
configuration while monitoring the
application help and it makes sure that
it doesn't kill all your application
instances at the same time so if let's
say you have 4 different scale de
publication so you have 4 instances of
the same application running common
interest releases these deployments one
by one and make sure that your health of
application is maintained and that's how
it rolls out if there is a problem
terminators will roll back to change
automatically for you the next one is a
storage orchestration communities can
automatically mount the storage system
based on your choice whether it could be
a local system all it could be a public
cloud storage provider like AWS or
Google cloud platform or any other
network system such as NFS or cluster
the next one is the batch execution in
addition to other services which
kubernetes provides kubernetes can also
manage your batch and also the
continuation integration workloads it
can replace the containers whenever it
fails which answers in having these
batch execution seamless the final one
is the configuration management
kubernetes has the flexibility which
provides deploy and update secrets and
the application configurations without
even rebuilding your image and without
even exposing the secret data from your
configuration stack so you don't have to
redeploy your application when you have
to change any configuration in your
kubernetes inmate's so you don't have to
rebuild your image you can have a
configuration outside the image which
will be inside the kubernetes platform
and you can change that whenever you
want and you can redeploy that
particular image in a different
container so these are the different
features of kubernetes I hope you guys
understood what is kubernetes let's see
what is a summary which we saw we saw
what are containers we saw why do we
need the orchestration and also we saw
what is kubernetes we also saw how
powerful cabinet is is with its features
so these are the basics of kubernetes I
hope you guys understood what are the
basics of Cobie notice this is not an
in-depth video I hope you liked the
video if you liked the video board and
liked it if you haven't subscribed to
the channel go ahead and subscribe to it
mate again in the next video thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
