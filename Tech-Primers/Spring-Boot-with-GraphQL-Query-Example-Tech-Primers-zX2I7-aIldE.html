implementation you would have recently
heard about the graph QL and how
Facebook has used graph given in
implementing that mobile application if
you don't know about the graph given you
can check out my video about graph QL in
this particular video we are going to
create a spring board application with
graph here and let's see what kind of
magic graph QL provides let's get
started
press the bell icon on the YouTube app
and never miss any update from tech
primers just to set the context graph QL
is a query language similar to rest it
is not any database
the names sounds something different
because it is named as graph QL however
it is just graph query language it is
just another language for your API
similar to how we create a rest
implementation or the rest platform or
the architecture graph QL is another
architecture or the specification which
you can use let's see how we can use
graph QL in the spring Buddha plication
and what it provides this particular
example which I am going to create was
provided by buzzient I have used his
particular code which he gave me I'm
using his implementation I'm not going
to use exactly his project but I am
going to use a different implementation
he had provided me with the movie's
implementation so he has a movie
database and we can query the movie
database with the graph key one in a
sprin good application what I am going
to create is I'm going to create a book
repository so we can query that book
store and we can see how we can use it
in spring Boop Thank You button so he
saved most of my time in exploring about
crop cool he had created and given me a
repository Apollo that it into github so
I have been using that so this is the
repository which he had created so I
will give the link for this in the
description as well
and also I'll give the link in the
description for the project which I am
going to create so let's start off by as
usual we are going to go to spring
initializer I'm going to use the spring
boot 1.5 dot nine the group ID for our
project is comm tech primers which I'll
just say comm tech timers crafty one
the artifact I'm going to name it as
spring boot graph cue one example
the dependencies which we require are
I'm gonna use the rest controller right
so I'm gonna use a spring MVC so I'm
just adding them so there will include
spring MVC in that if you model web has
the spring MVC along that you don't get
so this is going to have an embedded
Tomcat because it's just being good
application I'm going to use the hsql
database for storing the book repository
I'm gonna use Lombok Laubach is the
compiled I'm annotation processor I'm
going to create a model called book for
that I'm going to use the Lombok
annotation that's it from the spring
initializer we need to add the spring
boat graph QL dependency that I will add
it directly in the project
let me unzip and open this in the
intelligent meanwhile the project is
unzip let me open it in IntelliJ
the project is getting importer
meanwhile let's see what is there in the
format some of the palm has the web I
think I also need the JPA right so let
me include this bring boot JP as well so
I need the JPA because I'm going to use
JP a to access the data from the
database the hsql database so I'm going
to add the JP as well so I'll not
include the version so let springboard
figure out what version it means so we
need the JPA we are going to use the web
spring boot start of it we are using
hsql database and we are using log book
and there is a dependency for test
that's okay now we need to add the
dependency for the graph QL so I already
have the graph QL dependencies injected
into my life template so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to select my life
template and this is going to add the
dependency so these two are the
dependencies which we need to add for
supporting graph q1 in spring booth so
this is created by graph QL graph QL is
a query language created by Facebook and
this jars are created by graph QL
themselves so let's go and create the
project so this is the project structure
as we already know I'm going to use some
other port so I I don't have the default
port as free so I'm going to use the
port let's say 8 0 9 1 I'm going to use
support eight zero nine one eight zero
eight zero it's already used by my
Jenkins which is running in my machine
so I'm not going to disturb that let's
go ahead and create the packages like
what packages do we need Abby need a
repository obviously for storing the
data what else we need we need a model
package we need a resource basically the
controller and I'm going to call it as a
resource so I will just say resource
because it's chalice resource and we
need services right I'll create service
so let's start off with creating the
schema for the graph you will database
so I'm going to create something called
box dot graph QL
so this is going to have the schema
which we need for exposing the rest
endpoint so what is a schema right so
there are different concepts inside the
schema of a graph QL so we have queries
and we have mutations we are going to
see queries in this particular video
let's create some schema we need to
define them as types so we need a book
type so we are going to create a book
repository right so we need a book time
so I'm going to create a type called
book and I'm going to have some
variables or basically these are data
for the particular book or the metadata
of the book so iesson let's say Ison is
the metadata for which I wanted and this
is going to be a string so I'll just
define it as a string we also need the
title I'll just say try tool also a
string we need the publisher and we need
the author so author can be more number
of people right so I'm going to define
it as an array so I can define the array
like this I have authors and also I need
the published deep I'll just make it a
string for me so I have I need the isand
title publisher authors and the publish
date so I have these as mine so now I
need to expose my final query right I
need to expose my query so I need some
type of message which the user needs to
send me so what type of query the user
needs to send me is the user can select
either all books right I'm going to say
the user can send me all books and this
should return me list of books and also
the user should be able to send me a
book which can be expecting an ID and
this could be of type book so we will
see this in detail once we create that
query so what we are going to do is this
gets converted into something like this
in the graph QL if
see this right so this is the final
graph QL language for the query which
the user will be providing and in order
to create this we need a schema and this
is nothing but a scheme so we have done
the query now we need the schema so we
need to define the schema saying what
type of scheme is and I'm going to
provide the schema as query
Dondre so we have created a schema which
is going to have query so we need to
provide the query to this particular
application and what type of queries we
can provide we can provide either all
books or we can provide a specific book
and what type of data the book has these
are the different type of objects the
book can accept
so let's now create the resource right
we'll let let's now start off with the
resource I'm going to name the resource
a book resource like how we do this is
going to be a rest controller as usual
using the spring MVC
and we are going to map this as request
mapping as let's say books so I'm just
going to say as breast lash books like
I'll just say red slash books that's it
I'm not going to add anything else here
I'm going to add some post mapping and
this post mapping needs to return
something let's see what is that it is
going to return and never need the books
right I'll just create a book so we need
to get the body so it's going to be the
question body
and this is going to be the query which
the user is going to provide right and
let's fill this later on let's come back
to the model we need a model we have the
book model I'm going to create the book
model and I'm going to use the Lombok
before that I'm going to mark this as
stable and entity because we need to use
the same model to persist into the
database I'm going to use spring JPA so
I'm writing it as table and entity let's
add some fields the ID field is going to
be is n so we also have other fields we
have the title we have the publisher
we also have the author's
you
we also finally heard they published it
now I'm going to use Lombok for
annotation processing I'm not going to
create that getters and setters I'll
just going to say I need in our
constructor
I need the all arcs constructor I need
some getters and setters
so I'll just say getters and setters
that's it right I don't need anything
else I've added all my guess
to create a repository or the JPA
repository I'm going to create it as
book repository and there's got to be an
interface and this is going to implement
JPA a repository wit book as my model
and what is the primary key the primary
key is going to be a string because it
is ID and be a market a string that's
why repository is done our model is done
our resource is also almost done now we
need to create different services so
there is a concept of data pictures in
the graph queue so we can write a graph
QL service so I'm going to write this as
a service this graph QL service needs to
load the data all right so we need to
initialize the graph QL service or the
graph QL with water whatever we added
here so whatever schema be created we
need to inject that into the graph QL so
we need to have a resource here I'm
going to create a resource
I'm going to add the
you
you
though clasper bookstore draft keyword
yep the name is correct so this would be
loaded as a resource now what else do we
need so we are going to add a post
construct which is going to be called
when we have the graph QL service
initialized so I'm just going to name it
as a load schema what I have done here
is I have already injected that into my
life template and I'm going to just say
load graph t1 this is going to add me
the code which I need for loading the
data into the graph tool so this code is
going to be the same for any graph QL
data load so let's see what this code
does so I'm going to use the resource I
need to get that file which is nothing
buddy graph QL resource of the schema so
this is the graph QL schema we need to
know the schema into the graph QL
service once the file is retreat we need
to use the file to parse it so what we
do here is we have it named a schema
file that is a schema parser provided by
graph q1 so if you see here this is
provided by graph q1 API and we are
passing that particular file and loading
it into a type definition register which
can be used by graph QL so graph QL will
refer to this registry which has the
data of this particular file and it will
keep track of what all objects are there
and what all objects you are requesting
so based on that it will provide I keep
a track of it so that is what happening
that is what is happening here the next
time next one is the runtime wiring so
we need to wire these schemas right what
needs to be mapped to what so that they
will be happening in the runtime wiring
which we need to implement now so I'll
just create a runtime wiring method
let's implement that in a while
meanwhile once the wiring is done we
need to provide the wiring and the
registry to the graph QL schema and make
it executable the same schema is should
be built finally and we need to build
that as a graph q1
so let me create that growl
so graph QL is a public API this is the
public API fuel go inside this is a
public API provided by the graph QL team
for our usage so we need to execute any
query on this particular API so this is
the API which is exposed to everybody we
will have to use this from our core
source so let's see how to provide now
the runtime wearing it so runtime wiring
is having a API called new runtime
wiring dot build so this is going to
build our runtime wiring however we need
to provide what type of wiring we need
to add so we have provided two types of
objects right so we notice the bookstore
craft you will be have two types of
queries right all books and books so we
need to add some data fetches so how
does the API or the graph you'll know
which table to get what data from right
that is what we need to map in the
runtime wedding so now we need to add
the schema type and we need to add these
all books and books to that particular
schema type right so we are going to add
that into the runtime wearing here I'm
going to say it type and we are going to
use this particular method where we can
pass the type name and what type of
cooperation we want to perform and it is
basically a builder so we need to have
query that's the schema which we are
going to use right schema type and we
need to provide what type of wiring we
need so I am going to say type wiring
and this type wiring we need to provide
different data features so in our case
we have two types of data features one
is the all books so I'm going to say
data features we need to provide a data
feature here so data picture is another
class which we need to provide here
along with what type of name being had
so all books is the name right so if we
go here all books is the name which we
have here and we are going to provide a
data feature here so I'm going to say
all books data feature
we need to write this particular
implementation let's do that later and I
also need the book that's what we have
right yep the book 1 so I have a book
and I'll just say book data-feature
finally I need to build this so that it
can be returned
let's say returned but I think I can
replace this as like this I need to
create these data features what I'll do
is I'll just create these data features
I'm going to call this as all data fetch
on and this I'm going to call it as book
data fits on and these we need to inject
it here these can be created as a
service so let's create that I'll just
do one out of wire and then we can go
ahead and create them
you
so once I implement it you will know why
you rate the data feature so for now
understand that we need to provide the
mapping for the schema to fetch the data
if somebody calls all books if somebody
is providing all books in the query how
does it fit the data that is what we are
going to do here I'm going to create a
new package inside service call the data
feature
let's create this class since idols
you
and these data pictures need to be
component
they need to implement ready to
implement the data feature interface so
this is the book one so I just need to
provide the book here I'm going to
provide the book and let's implement
this data feature let's go to the all
books same way this needs to implement
say in the latest data feature but here
we need to provide the list of books if
you notice here
we need to provide the list of books
right so we will provide the list of
books here so list of books
because this can return a list let's
implement these methods so first let's
go to the all book data feature so what
do we need in the all book data features
basically it needs everything isn't it
we need to inject the I'll make it as a
component and we need to inject the
repository here so that we can retrieve
the data from the book repository so we
will use the book repository directly so
this will act like an abstraction to the
repository so the data fetches are like
service component which is going to
interact with the repository and it is
going to get the data for us so using
the book depository I am going to do a
find off so in respective of what type
of data fetching your enrollment you are
setting it is going to retrieve all the
data from the database and how graph QL
does that is based on the parameters
passed from the schema it automatically
filters up so let's go to the book data
center now we need to do the same we
need to author by the book repository
because we have the single repository
right we have a single repository using
which we are going to get the data
notice here in the book repository we
are going to find only the one which is
based on the ice in number right which
is based on iesson so how will we get
that so from the data fetching
environment we can retrieve it using
gate argument we can get it using the
gate argument and this ID is nothing but
the value which we have ported here so
we had mentioned that provide a book
heidi and we will provide it and that is
what is here and there is going to be
the isin this will be a string
and using that Ison we are going to core
the book repository and we are getting
it because the primary key is a string
which we have defined in the book here
right now we have created the all book
feature we have to look at that book
Facebook data feature now we have to
okay we what we did okay we don't need
to build it here alright okay so I have
built it already so that is it me have
created the runtime wiring in this
service now we need to provide this
service for the resource so I like just
expose our gate method get' okay so I'll
just expose this graph q1 so I'll just
make this private so that nobody knows
that it is there so this particular
graph QL service can be exposed to the
resource mouse over the books resource
now we'll be using the graph q1 service
so from the graph keyword service what
we need to do is we need to provide thee
we need to get the graph QL and we need
to execute that so we can directly
execute it and we need to provide what
query this that's it so we are using the
graph QL service to get the graph QL
public API and using the execute method
to provide the query the query will be
nothing but the query which we will be
providing from the postman so let's see
that I think we are almost done right so
we have okay we didn't push the response
back isn't it so we get the response in
an execution result from this execution
toussant we can directly push it so
either we can extract it out so we can
do a get we can do a get data and
extract it out or we can directly give
that so if let there are errors right we
won't be able to track if there is a get
data what we are going to provide is we
are going to provide the whole the whole
execution result we are going to wrap
that into the response object we are
going to use their response entity let's
it has an object of type we need to
provide the execution result and also
what type of response it is so we are
going to say his shady piece a status
okay I'll just say okay and let me
change this to response type of object
that's it so we need to you can remove
this now so what we have done in the
resources we are using the graph QL
service to get that particular public
API and execute the query which we
received from the res slash books using
that we get the execution result and
that execution result we are wrapping up
into a response entity so that we can
get that back in the UI or the client
side so I'll just summarize what we have
done here we have treated a model called
book we character JPA for storing this
we have created a book resource there we
are using the graph QL service inside
the graph QL service we are loading the
schema into the graph QL API this is the
graph QL public API where we have to
load the schema in order to load that we
need to wire it in the runtime using the
runtime wiring provided by the graph QL
API we need to provide these schemas and
inject the data features which fetches
the data we have to get to data features
one counter broke data picture which
will query based on a particular ice in
the other one is the all books data
fetcher it is going to query all the
books from the database and also we need
to unload the data back into the
database side they have not implemented
that let me write one more method here
so what I will do is I will do load of
load of low data into it just cure let
me load the data into the hsql into a
word we need to get the I'll just auto
wire the book repository
because we need to load that a tie-in to
the Book Depository isn't it
let's load some book information so I'll
just use this stream API I'm going to
use team dot off and we need to provide
different books from the books I am
going to stream I'm going to do a for
each for every book I'll just save it
into the book repository so that is what
we are going to do but we need to
provide the book right what is this book
what is this we need to provide the book
and just create multiple books let's
create some books right I don't know the
name of some books let's go on to worry
some books here let's do some cloud
books let's get some name of the cloud
books so that we can use it okay let's
use this book okay book of clouds pour
out this we need to provide a nice in so
the Ison number we can provide let's say
as one two three for simplicity I'm just
provided we need to provide the title
didn't try query it okay then the
publisher it is Kindle let's do it as
Kindle edition now we need to provide
the author's I'll just add the author
name what is author author is let's add
water so there is only one author so I
am going to leave that as is
the publish to date we need to give the
published date where is the published
date of this table
let's make it simple right I'll just
going to I'm just going to add it as a
November 2017 similarly I'm going to add
some few more books for simplicity I
just create some more I'll just say ice
NS so on to floor let's say I'll just
say cloud architecture and engineering
I'll just say oh really
for simplicity I'll just add some names
which we can relate it let's add one
more book let's add three books okay so
Bihar create we are creating three
different books and injecting that into
the repository here so before loading
the before auto wiring the graph q1 we
are going to load the data into the hsql
database notebook books into 0 positive
so that's all I guess apart from that we
have created the books schema for the
graph q1 which can be loaded into the
graph QL API and also I have chained the
port number here server at port as 8 0 9
1 so that the Springwood application
runs on this particular port let me
start the spring boot apllication ok
this is showing an error because I have
Java 9 configure to let me change it to
Java 8 let me do a clean install so that
I don't have anything the bill to fail
due to some test case but my clean
install got succeeded let me run this
particular build so I'm going to run
this spring port main class so that it
can start the Tomcat so this is using
the embedded Tomcat as you guys know it
is a spring good application so let's
check
if you notice here there is an error
here let's check what is the error the
error says there is a schema problem
which is 1 which is 1 let's check what
is happening the schema I think I know
what the problem is here we have put
books instead of book so let's try this
once again now yep the spelling buta
plication is up now and it is running at
our age 0 9 1 and you can see hardware
standpoint is registered let's go to
postman so I am going to use postman to
query the post so the URL which we are
going to access is localhost colon 8080
puts our book let me go and check its
called books
I'm just saying books and we need to
provide a body and it's going to be a
wrong message and it is going to be text
we need to provide text and we need to
create this graph QL now so based on how
the schema is defined by how to create
something similar so we need to provide
a query and we need to provide something
similar so let's add the schema here
initially let's go and get all most we
need all books right for the first time
inside the books we need to provide what
all fields we need so inside the book we
have ice and title publisher authors
like let's do only iesson and let's say
a title if we query this this should
return all the books there are three
books now it should return all the three
books which the corresponding iesson and
the title let's do the send now and if
you notice here we got the response and
this response
things all books whatever we said we
wanted and it is providing Ison and
Titan I also need the author's right
let's provide authors here notice here I
am not changing my rest in point
however I am changing whatever I am
posting here based on whatever I am
posting my response is going to change
notice here the author's is now present
same way if I need the publisher I can
provide the publisher and also the
published date when I say all these all
those information are going to get
populated if I don't want any
information I can't remove that so let's
say if I don't want anything else I just
want is an unpublished it it can do that
as well right
now we got the all books they tested the
all books and all books is working fine
so this is what graph QL can provide so
graph key word is powerful because you
have a single restraint we did have only
one dressed in point but he controlled
the responses based on that now we can't
Lloyd the book as well if we need to
query based on a particular is and do
you know what is an is n we know and I
sell of a book we can't do that as well
so we can provide the book we can
provide it like this we can't Reuter
iesson
what is the iesson let's say one two key
that's it if we provide this we can
still provide what I want from that
eysan so I want it title of the book if
let's say I want only the title like in
this eighth item and let's query this
and if you notice here it provided the
title of this particular book which is
one two three I also need the author's I
also need the publisher let's see what
happens notice here the book information
came as we saw let's change this to 1 to
4 there is going to return the book
information of is and 1 to 4 notice here
we have not changed the rest endpoint
the resource is still the same just that
the value which we provided for the
schema which we provided is completely
different so this is crab key 1 so this
is the graph query language now I wanted
all books along with the books what do I
need
can do that as well since we have
greater the schema in such a way that we
can provide all books and books at the
same time we can do this we can provide
this as well you can say title and let's
say authors what is here all books is
going to return all my books along with
all books there is going to be one more
block called book that is going to
return a specific book so with a single
rest endpoint you can control the data
which is coming in so the data model
which we get is controlled based on
whatever we pass here this is why graph
QL is very powerful
if you don't know graph QL is used by
our Facebook application the mobile
application inside your Facebook has
only one dressed endpoint and graph QL
is the technology which is powering
Facebook so this is how you can create a
graph QL in a Springwood application
so I'll just summarize what we did in
this particular video so what we did to
create a springboard application with
graph QL we created a graph QL schema
which is nothing but this keema we
created a schema which has a query we
are going to use query type to query the
graph QL database and there are two
different query types one is all books
and one is book so those are the two
different types book is going to have is
and title publisher authors and then
published date we are going to create a
model called book we created a model
called book book repository is used to
query the book we are using the JPA
spring JPA here and we are going to
expose the resource as the rest slash
books inside that we have a post method
so we have a post mapping here in the
post mapping we are going to get the
body which is nothing but the message
which may pass here there is nothing but
there is a request body and that
particular request body we are getting
as a query that particular query needs
to be provided to the graph API in order
to create a graph API we are creating a
graph QL service inside the crop QL
service we are automatically loading the
data into the hsql database we have
loaded some three-book information into
the hsql database using the book
repository then we need to load the data
into the graph QL not the data assets
but a schema we need to parse the schema
so we are passing that using these
statements we need to build these kemar
now inside that we are creating at
runtime wiring then we create the
runtime wiring we map that with the
graph QL schema which we created and
they provide what type of data fetches
we need to add for each query here we
are providing different data fetches for
what type of wiring so for all books we
are creating a all books data fetcher
which is going to retrieve all the
repository information so which is going
to fetch all the data from the book
repository the other one is the book
data fetcher which is going to query
only the particular is n number so that
is what we have done in the graph QL
service we have exposed a gate graph QL
to provide
API back to be associate
so that is all we did apart from that I
just created a different port for this
for input application and they started
off with this using the postman we
created a body we created a request body
here for this particular rest URL with
post mapping we do not add anything else
we just added a raw text with this body
and based on this if a query we can see
that
but let me modify this I think I had
added something here so let based on
this epic query we can see the response
which is successful here
so this is how you can create a graph QL
versus spring integration so I hope you
guys understood what is a graph QL and
how we can use graph QL in a spring good
application do let me know how whether
you guys understood or not or let me
know what I need to do in the next video
what I will do is I will try to create
data into the graph to your database or
greater into the hsql database in this
particular video we did only get on
weighted only the fetching part from the
graph q1 in the next video I'll just
show you how to do create and delete or
even the update that's it for this
particular video I hope you guys liked
the video if you liked the video go
ahead and like it if you haven't
subscribed to the channel go ahead and
subscribe to it meet you again in the
next video thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
