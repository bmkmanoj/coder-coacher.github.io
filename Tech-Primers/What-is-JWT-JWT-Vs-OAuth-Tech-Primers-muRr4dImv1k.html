are going to see what is JWT and how
does it compare with oauth2
so many people have requested me to
create videos on spring security and
Jade ability but frankly I was not aware
about J ability until that moment so
when I saw that many people have been
requesting for Jade ability I thought
it's a UI framework or something like
that then I went ahead and saw and read
about JWT and then I got to know what is
Jade ability so what I'm going to do now
is I'm going to share what is JWT and we
are going to compare that with oauth2
and how is it different or what is it
really what these both are and how do
they compare features so previously I
have made a YouTube video on earth-2 so
if you're not familiar about also you
can check that meanwhile let's see what
is Jade ability means Jade ability as
the screen says it is JSON web token
okay so it is basically a tokenization
format okay in which you can pass your
credentials or the tokenization in a
single format okay so basically if you
want to communicate between a server and
the client so as a part of Earth - if
you remember we had been saying that
okay we will communicate with a token
every time so we will be communicating
with a secured access token which both
both is closed client and the server
knows and then for every subsequent
request we will use only two tokens
instead of the username and password so
J ability is something similar so you
wrap everything as a token so even the
content is now wrapped as a token so
it's like a more secure way of
transferring the packet so in R 2 we
were using the token for every request
we're in the part of the header
but however durability is like you
tokenize all your messages as a part of
your HTTP request okay so basically JWT
so the website which I am seeing now is
table JWT dot IO you can use it to
decode as it says you can use it to
decode verify and generate the date
readability message
so basically generate abilities split
into three major parts the first one is
the header okay the second one is the
payload and the last one is the
signature so which basically is a
secured or encoded message of the header
on the payload okay so the signature in
is nothing but the merger of the header
and the payroll which is the encoder
okay so what do they really mean so if
you notice here the right side one is
the decode message so that is how the
message looks like so you have a header
which is algorithm so what type of
hashing algorithm we are going to use to
encode our message and then what is for
example here there is a customer switch
away is saying that the type is JWT
okay so that is the header so the header
is going to tell us what type of hashing
methodology you have used to encode a
message okay so here we are saying that
okay HS 256 is our hashing methodology
okay in the payload what are we doing so
in the payload is where we have the real
message so you can put whatever message
you want okay that's what we are going
to do in the payload and finally the
signature which is the last part okay
that is where we are going to encode the
header and the payload and then merge
that along with a secret okay that's
what we are doing here if you notice
here that's what we are doing as a part
of it so the real encoded message looks
like the one in the left side below okay
you see like you can't next see anything
right so you just see that okay there is
a message it says dot and then there is
one more message it says dot and then
there is one more message so these are
their basic blocks so the first block is
the header block second one is the
payload and the last one is the
signature so after it is encoded this is
how it looks like okay so we have used
HS 256 algorithm to encode this
particular message okay so this is what
jadibooti is so JWT as you see is just
tokenization format with which you can
secure your message with some hashing
algorithms or hashing techniques okay
bye durability is not completely secure
because anybody can see this message in
your network so when you're transferring
packet from the client to the server
side right
so anybody can see this particular
message with you we'll be passing it in
the header
okay so durability is not completely
secure it's just a way in which you can
ship the packets from the client to the
server okay so how is it different from
the OAuth 2 right so o2
basically is like a standard or a
protocol or a framework okay so or 2 was
a protocol with which we used to
communicate between two processes or two
or more processes using your
authentication mechanism with which you
authorized your system and then you
decide whether you have the authority to
continue or not so we saw a typical
example of Google or 3 so you log in to
any machine or you take a typical
example of a application installed in
your Android phone right so whenever you
install your application so it is going
to pop up a Google is going to pop up
saying ok are you ok to allow these
people to use your information so that
is worth over this so Google is asking
you to give permission for the
third-party website ok which could be a
client or a server ok to give permission
about your information okay so that is
what Oh what was okay so Jason JWT is
just a tokenization format over this is
just a protocol or the framework with
which you can secure your application
for authorization so you can manage
authorization with work easily so every
subsequent ruckus you don't have to give
the username and password for every
request you just get the token and then
using the token we will be able to
proceed with it further records so that
is the basic difference between the over
than the GWT so I have just started
learning about junior ability so I will
be making videos about spring security
as with Jade ability and also I will be
integrating walks too with the spring
security in a springboard application so
I will be doing that in the coming days
so that's it for this particular video
so if you want me to do any specific
video or any specific topic just drop
that in the comment section below so I
will be able to explore that and I'll
also try it out and then it we can
discuss that and then we will see how I
can
make you understand easily okay so
that's it for this particular video if
you liked the video go ahead and like it
if you haven't subscribed to the channel
go ahead and subscribe to it maybe okay
tin the next video thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
