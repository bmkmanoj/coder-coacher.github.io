wrote is of good quality let's see how
we can use sonar lint to identify the
quality of our code let's get started
so now Lin is an extension or a plugin
which you can use in any of your IDs
which can give you on the fly reports on
bugs which you have created in your code
with respect to the quality so these are
not bugs which you have introduced in
your code but these are code quality
bugs as such so for example you would
have assigned a variable and you
wouldn't have used it so these are
quality bugs right so you have created a
variable but you are not using it so
what do you want to create a variable if
you don't want to use it at all right so
these are some similar or easy bucks
which we can identify ourselves and
intelligent identify but soul Arland can
identify something extra so let's see
what are all those so in this particular
example I'm going to show the usage of
sonar length inside intelligent so you
can try it out for Eclipse or any other
IT ID which you are using right now so
let's see what is shown Arland so I'm
just going to go to the plug-in section
and install this on Ireland so I don't
have this on Ireland installed here so
there is there is a plugin called sonar
lint you can go to the Browse
repositories and then you can identify
so you notice here this is the plugin it
got updated two months ago I just click
the install button so the plug-in is
getting downloaded let's see so let it
get downloaded and then I'll restart
IntelliJ so yeah
I'll restart ontology and let's come
back after the IntelliJ comes up
so IntelliJ is back up right now and if
you notice here there is a new window
which has popped up here which is called
the sonar 'land so this is the plugin
which we just installed right now so
right now the plug-in is automatically
enabled and then our files are
automatically scanned right so if you
notice your no scanner is done on the
current open file you can trigger this
option so this will do analysis on the
current file which we have opened right
now I think I don't have any bug on this
file because I have very few lines of
code
I am NOT doing anything fancy right so
let's introduce some bug right so that
we can see how sonar lint is behaving
let's say I'm creating a constant right
and I am sending it to some constant
right
let me run the if you notice here it
automatically ran before I ran and there
are some bugs which have introduced here
see it says unused private feeds should
be removed and renamed icons filled to
match the regular expression so it says
that you should not have variable name
with this particular pattern and also it
says that remove this unused variable so
these are just some quality issues which
it has identified in our code there is
something else as well so for example
let's say I'm assigning the number as 4
so you are getting a value of the number
to the function and you are assigning it
to 4 if you notice here it has got two
more bugs it says this condition change
this condition so that it does not
always value it to false so if you
notice say this first if condition is
always false because we have assigned it
to 4 right Intel in the sonar lint
identifies automatically that ok there
is a problem here and then you need to
fix it same way with the introduction of
new so it says that introducing a new
variable instead of reusing the
parameter so it says introduce a new
variable instead of reusing the number
parameter which somebody is passing
you're overriding the value right so
these are some simple examples of
code quality bugs are the issues which
we have introduced in this particular
file and solar Erland can immediately
give you the results on what are all
those bugs also let's say if you want to
configure them you can go and configure
as well so if you see here you can see
the properties and then you can see what
are the configure configured profiles
which you can enable so if you have
sonar cube in your in your firm or in
your machine as well you can configure
or bind it to the sonar cube so that you
can get the same profiles and then you
can use it alright so that is what sonar
lint can do alright so in the next video
we are going to see what is sonar cue
and then we can see how to integrate
sonar linked into sonarqube but for now
I know that ok you can use sonar lint to
identify the code quality issues in your
code locally without even having to
commit it into a into your repository or
without even having to push it into a
repository alright so this is how you
can get the reports then inthere from
this one our cube from your favorite IDE
itself that's it I wanted to cover hope
you found it interesting
let me know if you want me to make video
on any specific topic I can go ahead and
do where you do that drop that in the
comment section below if you like the
video go ahead and like it if you
haven't subscribed to the channel go
ahead and subscribe to it we took it in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
