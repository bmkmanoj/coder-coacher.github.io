are going to see what is the difference
between static and companion objects in
Conte so let's get started so I have
opened my project this is the basic
Kotlin project so there is nothing much
if we see there is just a folder called
tech primers this is just a package so
let's go ahead and create a Java can so
I will show you how we write a static in
Java and let's compare that with
companion objects in cotton so as you
know Cortland doesn't support static
giver so there is something called
companion object so they let see how to
use that companion object in Kotlin to
achieve what we did in static in Java
okay so as I start I will just create a
main Java class so what we are going to
do here is let's create one more club so
I'm going to create a user's class ok so
let's say I define a variable called
private static in let's say string
company ok and then let's say we have
done YouTube to it ok so this is a
static object and in Java what we do is
we access it using users dot let's say
prior public right this means for me
okay so we access users of company and
then we get it but how do we do it in
court yet right so let's create a
coupling class so I'll just split this
into two so that we can get a hang
around the core cleaner and we can
compare cuddling class so in Cortland
main mean Kay let's say I'm going to
create a file called main key okay so in
Cortland how do we write function is fun
main and we are going to get the
arguments one of the arguments it sparks
the string okay and so how do we write
the same thing in Cortland so let's say
user Kay let's say I create a class
called users key okay I'm going to say
class users Kay okay here if I create a
variable with Val company equal to u2
nothing
let's see if we are able to access it
from the main method here okay so let's
say the skin dots if you notice here
nothing is coming so basically we can't
access this variable objects instead we
can use the companion of the source
companion object is nothing but a group
of basically a block of code where you
can mark them as companion and those all
will be exposed as a static via the
class okay so what I have done is I have
done companion object okay and then I
have created a block of command here and
then I have put to be a variable company
inside that so if you notice here I am
able to access the company object here
directly okay let's print both the
classes and just close run just for
checking right so first let me run
cotton
it takes a while though I think it's
just building it from the beginning
because I just open the project I didn't
try it before but here hopefully it will
be some yeah okay if you notice here the
Kotlin object has come the YouTube so if
you are on Java as you know Java is
going to print it right normally do okay
so this is how you access a static
variable so let's say I want to access a
static method so what do I do
so in Java what do we do we just say
public static get company right and then
go to this returning this is returning a
string you say return company just for
namesake right so this is how we write a
public static method right so and you
directly accessing it company here so
how do we do that in copying so in
Kotlin since you created a companion
object block you can write the matter
here directly so I can say get company
my return type is going to be string
right and I'm going to return company
that's it
okay so let me move this out
actually wait a second then this move is
in looks like we're not able to access
the company object here right let's try
doing this users K taught company right
if you notice yes still we are not able
to access right I don't know why but
this is weird
let's do remove this variable and then
just say we are going to return some and
testing
actually the problem is not there the
problem is with here these impacts of
the function so yeah but that's what
Gupta hot sauce is like so if you see
here the variable is here and now the
function goes like this you just put it
here okay so now if you notice we can
access the variable here but what is it
a platform declaration slash the
following declarations have the same JVM
signature they get company because
Kotlin by default converts the company
advocate so this is what I wanted to
show this you notice in Java we were
able to do that it we were able to
create a static mother would get company
right but in Cortland by default it
creates a gator and setters for this if
it is a if it is a valid creates a gator
if it is a ver it creates a set of
automatically and that is why we are not
able to use the same property with a
gator okay instead if you say just get
we will be able to do that so if you
notice here get works so I can directly
get this and that is a static method so
it behaves like a static method so that
is the difference between Kotlin and
Java like in terms of accessing static
objects if you notice here what we do in
Catalan is we create a companion object
and in terms of Java what we do is we do
just ecstatic with it so let's say I
want to access the Catalan objects from
Java right so how will I do that so
let's say from main Java but these both
are in the same project way so I am
going to access this particular users
Kay company from the java code let's see
if we can do that so I am just saying
users k dot you can see here i don't
have it i can't do anything right so
this is because Kotlin doesn't create
this particular object as char as a
static object instead it creates its own
or equal type because it doesn't support
static it doesn't know static so in
order to make start Catalan know that
okay this is static and it is running on
the JVM so we can add an annotation
called JVM static so if you merge this
particular annotation now Java code will
be able to identify okay this particular
variable is a static variable so now
let's try users
if you notice here I just added the Java
static and then I can see yeah get
company okay this is because your
company object is automatically
converted into a gate company as I
showed earlier right we were facing an
issue where I was not able to create a
gate company ok that is why you see now
the gate but if you see just the gate
get a particular method is not it
because they have not marked that as JVM
static now let's see let me mark a
particular function of nose he is
chatting and we should be able to access
it now so I just say get if you notice
here the function is now available for
us to access and you can directly to a
rent of it so just show just on this
once just to show that ok from Java you
can call a cup of coffee glass okay
and the only difference is if it is a
static variable you have to mark it as
static so that Java can access it if you
see here this u capital u Y is coming
from the cot in class ok so that is how
you access the Java classes from Java to
cotton or cotton into Java so from
Cortland you can say then we already
have a static that you just say users
dot if you notice here you already have
company and get company whichever we
created here okay so you can just use
that I just say good company and then if
I run it it should be able to give us
the data which was coming from the Java
class ok so this is the difference basic
difference between static in Java and
Static in cutting basically it's not
static but it's a companion object so
that is what Kotlin calls it so this is
how you access the variables and if you
want the java classes to access the
static or the companion object you have
to mark that as JVM static so this is an
annotation coming from Kotlin so you
have to do that or I'll see you on who
you won't be able to access it so that
is what I wanted to cover in this video
so that's it for this video if you liked
the video go ahead and like it if you
have any comments or something if you
have any doubts or clarifications go
ahead and comment that below I will try
I will be able to answer that meet again
in the next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
