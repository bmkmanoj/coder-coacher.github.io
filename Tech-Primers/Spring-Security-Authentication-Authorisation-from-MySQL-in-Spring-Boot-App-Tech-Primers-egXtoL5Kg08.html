are going to see how to use spring
security in a spring board application
to do authentication with the data from
a database so what we are going to do is
we are going to create the spring bootie
application but spring security inside
it and then they are going to
authenticate user name and password by
connecting to a database and using
spring security to do that okay so let's
get started so I'm going to create a
application called security DB example
so as usual I am going to the spring
initialize the web site where I can
create a spring boat application
out-of-the-box so what do I need is I
need a dependency for the web and a
dependency for security I need the JPA
and I need the my sequel connector so
that's it right so I need security API
yeah so I have added dependencies for
the spring Dib which is a spring MVC and
then I also added spring security
dependency along with that I'm adding
the JPA and my sequel so this is going
to use hibernate for connecting to the
database and retrieving our username and
password okay so let me generate the
project so meanwhile I have created some
tables already so I have a user table
okay this user table is going to have
user ID active flag email address user
name last name and password ok so right
now I am NOT going to use any encryption
mechanism for the password but you can
use any encryption or encoding technique
for storing the password so I will show
you how to be that as well so and then
there is a role table which has a de
roles which are there in the current
current system again then finally there
is a user role which is going to be a
relationship between the user and the
road so that is just another table okay
so let me save this one it will just
send up this project so that we can open
this in IntelliJ Walker
you know yeah so let it open mean one
I'll just give you a brief understanding
of what is a strange security so sting
security is a framework which is plotted
by spraying again so it uses some
authentication and authorization
mechanism to give you control over how
you access the web pages and control the
web pages or the restrain points okay or
your basically your web server okay so
it can control the authentication of the
authorization part of your web
application so Spring Security provides
that so if you are not using a spring
boat application you can use directly
spring security and then go ahead and
secure your application so secure web
server if you are using spring good
application it is much simpler because
spring both provides easy support for
spring security okay so that is what we
are going to see here now but you can
leverage this knowledge whatever I am
going to share here to create a Sling
security application which is not a
spring board application you can secure
any existing web server with spring
security okay so let's go ahead and
create some classes right so I'm going
to create a resource so that is the rest
endpoint which is going to be secured
and we are going to see how to secure
that as well so let's say I'm going to
call this as hello resource okay I'm
just going to annotate it the rest
controller and I'm going to annotate it
with gesture mapping I'm going to call
it rest slash hello okay so I'll write
one rest endpoint which I can expose
some case saying get mapping I will just
say this thing on just for simplicity
okay I have one leg so let's get one
more recent point with saying secure
slash all okay
I'm just going to physical the hello
secur hello okay so I have basically
Taurus 20.1 as all and one a second on
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
add security configurations so before
going to doing that we can create the
model which we require so basically they
use the tables which are this right I'm
going to say I am going to mark this as
entity somebody else bring have an H a P
a sing GPA okay I'm just saying table
and I'm going to say table name as usual
okay
so I have already created some template
lie template in IntelliJ so that I can
easily write the code so I will just
import tables ago okay so we have to
create a rule I mean we'll align this so
what I am doing here is I have created a
user ID okay which is these are all
columns basically so these are all
column names user ID email password name
last names and actors these are the
column names which we saw in the
database here okay so this is a test
database which I have so we are going to
connect to this database and then query
the user details from this table okay so
this is a different piece and I have
created our old relationship so I will
create go ahead and create this query
actually I should have greater the users
inside model put it in Sun modem I will
create the role as well so role is
another entity and that is a table as
well so table name is grown so what
about films in role
let me check what is the fields so we
have a role ID and also role IDs integer
and role is string so we are going to
say a full 90 I am going to rotate it it
with colum and this is going to be the
ID and this is generated rate generated
value I'm going to say start at leas
opal so those are so that this will be
generated automatically by cabinet the
next one is the user right ear it rolls
okay basically this is a roll
okay so we have created all the
necessary classes so I will just create
our constructor and the Gators and
Thetas so done let's go to the users so
let's go to the users and make the users
perfect for users we have greater the
classes we have care to the variables
basically and I will now create the
constructor which is one you don't need
any constructor and then I'll create
dick eater consider okay I think that's
it so we have created the model now so
now we need the repository so we need to
create the repository so let me go ahead
and create the repository now we'll
create a new package now I'll create a
user's repository for the user class so
based on this repository will be
querying the users class and then
retrieving the information I'm just
saying is a suppository extends JPA
repository and there is going to be
users the primary key what is the
primary key is it integer via it isn't
it so I'm just saying integer so that is
our repository is ready now once our
repository is today we need to in check
these repositories to the Springwater
plication so let's create a config so we
let's create a config class called the
security configuration synthesis it's
going to have all security little
configuration eliminated with that
configuration and this is where now I
need to enable the JPA repository
Sensoji enable JP repositories I'll say
big base packages classes so I'll just
mention the class name because we have
only one repository I'll just say users
repository dot class so this will now
inject all the classes which we need for
the Jaypee repository so this is done
now so what do we need next so next we
need to secure our applications so we
need to enable the web security so we
need to enable enable web security
now this is going to enable this bring
security for us okay
so as a part of that we need to make our
application extend the web.config errors
adapter so we are going to extend this
web security configure and after so what
we are going to do is we are going to
override some key things from spring
spring security and upend our
implementation into it so what basically
we need to do is we need to make it load
the data from our database instead of a
spring maintaining the username and
password information we are going to
allow a create and implementation so
that spring can use it so if you will
see let me go to the override say if I
need to overwrite there are lots of
functions which the security configured
at the provides so what we are going to
do is we are going to override the
authentication builders so here in the
authentication builder so if you say
auth dot so you here you have lots of
options so we can provide our
authentication providers we can provide
the user detail service so you can
provide JDBC Connaught indication you
can throw in memory authentication if
you had seen my previous video I would
have done in memory authentication so
here I am going to show you an
authentication with a service so that
service is going to connect to a
database and get the data so that is
what we are going to do here so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to say I'm
going to append I use user returned
service ok so let's create this user
easy written server so we need to create
this you take a user return service
because you need to Ottawa 80 ok we
haven't created this user at a service
because this is an interface so we need
to implement this particular interface
so let's implement this interface I am
going to create a package console
I'm going to call this a custom user
details so okay
and I'm going to implement the use a
little force so along with the
implementation we are going to overwrite
this the load user by user name better
so this is going to be a user name okay
so what we are going to do here is we
are we need to authenticate now and
provide a object of type user details
okay so basically what we need to do is
we need to create another model for us
to convert it into easier details so if
you notice your user details is another
interface we need to use we need to
create another model out of this so
let's go ahead and create a model out of
it so I'm going to say custom user DT
okay I'm going to get our destination
packages chrome tech primers security
dot you can click example I am going to
create a created under model itself
because it falls another model so it's a
model basically why is this saying the
destination vacation phone I'm not sure
so let it create outside of that they go
in navigate
okay so I don't know for some reason I
think it is try and since I created from
spring it is happening like that but I
will just go ahead and directly create
this way I am just creating custom user
details for us to create a user details
finally when we need to implement this
particular class so what we need to do
is we need to provide some information
here so what I'm going to do is I am
going to make this custom user details
extend our users class okay but so by
that way we will have access to all our
users because our users model is the one
which is going to have all the user
information which we retrieve from a
database type so we are going to use
that so that this custom user it is can
leverage data from that particular users
table so for example here I'm going to
say super dot gate password so I can
directly get that so and same way for
username I am going to say super or
Katie's on it it named okay so I'm going
to make the other things as true so is
account non expired yes true
so is account not log yes true is a con
and so on as my true I'm going to enable
s I'm going to make it is true okay so
the so to this part I will let come
later to the gate authority so meanwhile
so I will create a constructor here so
whenever we create a custom users I need
to provide a user site users information
so that I can sell so that I can do a
pen so if I call the users now I think a
constructor is not there let's create a
user's constructor in the users ok so
inside this consider what we are going
to do is they're going to assign all the
values for T variables so I am going to
say you go start create active so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to create a
copy constructor basically from the
child class I'm going to use that to
copy the values it is super clean so I'm
saying
I'm just going to copy everything of the
field so what are the fields of this
user story they sort name okay the sort
last name what are the things appended
but also the empty
so this thought ID to users okay if they
have anything else really email password
then last name actor password within
good puzzles okay okay I think that's it
we have copied all the variables okay
that's it
okay now let's go to the server so let's
go to this service now finally what we
need to do here is we need to create a
new custom is at retail and here if you
notice I we need to pass the users so I
need to create this user so I will just
create the user so how do you get the
value for the season so we need to load
it from the users repository isn't it so
let's notice from the users repository
okay so we can we can use auto where or
we can use constructor injection so I'll
use the auto wire in my case for
simplicity so I'm going to say user
suppository talk find by user name right
so I'm going to say find by name and I'm
going to pass seasoning so if you notice
here this method doesn't take this so I
am going to go ahead and create that
okay
and if you notice this is going to
return some users so I am going to mark
this as optional or fuses because what
if the user name does not take this
check it can happen so I'm going to mark
this as optional so I'm going to use the
Java it optional to wrap this particular
return type into an option so that it
will you give for me to handle
and null cases here so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to wrap this into a
variable called optional I'm going to
say optional users okay so I don't have
to do a null check but I can do
something I'll show you what I can do so
I'm going to say if that particular
option L is present all right if the
optional is present then do something
and if the optional does not present is
empty basically so actually what I'll do
is all right so what I can do is I can
throw an exception so I'm going to throw
an exception new users username not
false
okay saying username not form so i'm
just throwing an exception so if the if
the database did not return me any value
and just throwing an exception so that
the spring framework will know that okay
the username doesn't exist and we can
handle the exceptional scenario however
what if what do I need to do if it is
present right so if present I need to
get that correct so I'm going to say
give me that users and I need to create
a custom user details using that users
okay
so this will be something like this so I
need to assign this actually I can do
it's not required actually bucktail but
is this guy you know throwing exception
why would count is all so what I will do
element is to a variable
okay so I'll just move this guy up so
that we will not have any issue so what
I am doing is I am going to use the
optional users and say if it is not
having any value throw this exception
and if it has the value okay I am just
saying it to return something so I'm
just saying it to do something there
okay so in this case what I can do is I
can use map okay what I can do is I can
use map to get that right
so this one I will return it into some
custom data in fact I can play refactor
this again to make it in line again I
can remove this return type as way we
right you can replace this with a King
Randor functions and I can do this okay
so what we have done is we have created
a new custom detail customize irritated
detail here if the value is present okay
if the value is present that's when this
map will be called so we are safe here
and then based on that we are returning
their value again find okay this one's
wicked touch back okay so this is going
to return a user detail objects and
customers were either a tale object is
off type user details okay this is an
interface so that is what we saw and if
the user did not take this so we just
directly through the exception thing
username not form okay that is what we
have done here right so this is T class
which will be used by spring here so we
have created a class which will be used
by spring okay and we have created this
other service for Miko so just going to
say so so this particular class will be
now used by spring so that we are doing
in spring security so we are going to
tell spring that okay this is the class
which I want to inject so that you can
use it for authorizing okay so that is
what I have done yet so I am saying that
okay auth dot user dated service I am
writing a custom user details over and I
am providing that to the authentication
provider and then now I need to provide
a password and code okay so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to create some
custom implementation and I am not going
to do any encoding I'm just going to say
just gonna say return the same thing
okay that is what I am doing here you
are not doing anything I am just
returning it into one so I will extract
this into a method so that okay so that
it's easy for us to see
okay so I just create a custom password
and encoder so you can use another any
other existing one but right now I'm not
using any possible and calls you instead
of you instead of creating this you can
have your own password encode there is a
bcrypt term password encoder which is
there in java by default you can use
that as well okay the next one is we
need to create some security for the
HTTP 10 point so that is what I'm doing
here if you notice this Creator the
creditor implementation or basically I'm
overriding the implementation of HTTP
security so what we are doing here is we
are going to disable the cross-site
reference and we are going to authorize
all the requests which are going to have
secured so I created some secure right
so I'm going to say authorize all my
records which are there under secured so
I'm just going to say star star if
anything had secured okay
authenticated so what spring will do is
spring MVC will now know that okay for
this particular URL I need to
authenticate it and you go to spring
security and ask okay where is my
authorization so that is when it comes
to the user little service and it is
used and it uses the username and
password to route and also the one more
thing is if let's say there is an
authenticated request and if it did not
have anything authenticated already it
will move to the login page so that is
what we are doing here so we are using
the string Security's default login page
so I am saying form login that will have
the string Security's default login page
if you need any if you have any custom
login page you can say login page and
give the URL folder okay so that thing
can get the data from that page and then
crowded but for now I'm going to use
spring securities login page because I
am not doing anything so I just a form
login so this will have a default login
page which spring has so which will
expect expect me to provide our username
and password again I'm saying that
permit all for that particular login
page and for any other request which is
not secured then I am just saying okay
all of it so that is what is
statement me so I'm saying any records
which comes to the HTTP server allow
them summit on if it is secured in
behavior standpoint and then I indicate
it okay so I have authenticated it here
now I need to provide some role right so
I right now have a role called admin so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
assign this particular rest endpoint
saying something called pre-authorized
so if you notice three authorizes
something which spring security provides
as an annotation so that you can use it
for method level authorization so for
example like this so what I am doing
here is okay I am adding a notation
called pre-authorized I'm saying
authorize this method to be called only
when the user has the role admin okay so
in order to enable this we need to add a
conflict so in spring security I need to
enable add enable global network
security I need to say pre and post
enable astute by default because by
default it's disabled so I need to
enable so I enable that using the
annotation thing and now this particular
method in a particular controller is now
authenticated or authenticate and
authorize using this particular hold so
authentication is when you allow
somebody to use anything authorization
is when you say that ok you do you have
the authority to use that particular
method so I am saying that only admins
can use this ok so this particular
restrain point will be now secured with
admin so if I don't have a
admin role then I won't be able to
access this ok that is what we are going
to see now all right so if somebody
accesses this URL called secured slash
on spring security is now going to play
their cue to the login page once you are
logged in it is going to read our cue to
this particular page only if you have an
admin role ok if you again access that
you want when you have the same session
so you will still be redirected to the
same URL so that is what we are going to
see in this particular example so what
we have done is we have created our rest
endpoint ok with different
in point so I'm just saying rest hello
all as opened and I am authorizing test
hello
secured / all with this particular role
okay
and in the spring security so we are
telling spring mode application that
okay I'm going to use my custom user
detailed service and I am going to
secure my rest endpoints with secured
call and this is my password encoder so
I am not leaving anything in the
password encoder apart from that I have
created the custom user details class
which will be used by spring security
okay now one thing we must write so we
didn't provide any rules here we didn't
forward any we didn't create the granted
authority so kind of authority is
something but spring security uses this
particular authority to identify what
authorization rights you have okay so
the admin is the one of the authority
right so what we are going to do is we
are going to provide that from the
implementation to restrain so that
spring knows what are all the different
roles which are they so that is what we
are going to implement here so I need
the gate role so I already have the
roles here right in the form of get role
I am going to get those roles okay and
I'm going to assign them so what I need
to do is I need to create a new custom
new simple granted Authority so simple
grantor Authority is already there in
spring security and I am going to just
pass a role name so I'm going to say
role dot get oh okay
in general spring actually has a notion
of role underscore so I am just
happening that because I my roles names
are different so I'm just appending that
here okay
and this is going to be granted
Authority so what I'm doing is I'm just
using some stream API to create a new
role and I am going to just collect
electroscope tools and just going to
because it will s the roles are list so
that is why we have
okay so now once you have collected we
need to now return this directly so this
is nothing water a list of granted
Authority so we are not in we are now
going to return the directly I am going
to say this distal stone just to do a
good business okay I can do that
perfectly
in fact okay
so what we have done is we have got all
the rules which we already have injected
into the custom user detail and we are
getting that and then creating is
granted authority for spring security to
understand okay that is what we are
doing here I think that's what we have
filled all the other details right so
another thing we you need to do is we
are using my sequel to connect to the
database my sequel database to connect
from this application so may need some
properties right so I have already
created some properties here so I
already created some property
I just populate that is in the template
okay so I already have some properties I
am just giving the JDBC driver details
nothing else that's it so let's start
our application
in Vanessa run
open
so already the notice here I have the
database open here there is there are
user written so there is one particular
user called IJ with password as a thing
okay and then the email is there and the
role which is assigned for that
particular user is that control okay
that is what we are going to see you
know so let me shift E and let me check
if the process is up the screen good
application is community I have also
enabled the sequel commands for so that
is it shows equal I made it as true so
that we can see what query its I am on
the my sequel database to confirm that
okay our authentication is being
triggered okay so the server is up so
it's running on 8080 put this is go to
be 8080 now I need to say this / hello /
all right so a red slash hello / on is
going to give me hello YouTube because
that is all exposed to ignore it so
there is no permission involvement so
there was something called secured / on
which had some permission so when I say
secured / all if you notice here
immediately redirected me to the login
page okay so this is the page where I
need to provide the user today so I am
going to say if let's say I provide a
wrong user treated okay so let's see
what happens so if I provide the wrong
user it is it is showing me that your
rectum the login item was not successful
try again bad criteria that credential
okay let me go and see the logs if you
notice here in the law I can see that
spring JPA have a net havenÃ­t used a
query to query our database
so basically string security is now
using our query to authenticate us okay
so basically spring security is using
our roles and tables to query that and
confirm that okay we are giving the
correct to deny manag so now I am going
to give the correctively so I'm going to
say another if you notice here if you
notice here it's now we are at the URL
hello secure all and they think secured
hello okay that is what we expected
right so we have a username with the
admin tool
that is what we saw so we have been got
redirected to the correct character
standpoint if you notice here we have a
list hello on and we have a secured on
and be authenticated with the username
and we are able to now authenticate by a
spring security and we are able to now
see that if I click on the restrain
point again if you notice here I will be
rather directly redirected if I say
login I will then be prompted for the
login ok so notice there is no rest
login basically so I will just go to
login in this case now I will be if I
enter some other credential it won't
allow me ok it will not allow so I'm
going to say it AG and it has because it
did not have any so I had a secured
hello
secured all so this is the recent one so
if you notice here i authenticated using
my credential and then it is now
allowing me to access system so same way
if I have a new username if I have a
different username let me try that right
so I don't have a I did not try that
before but let me try adding a new
username okay and we don't have any role
for that particular user so let's see
what happens to that I'm going to say to
and let it let the email be same and I'm
going to pass a different name for it
let's say YouTube and password also
YouTube ok I'll just stay in so this
query and I in this check it I am NOT
going to assign any role for that
particular user let's see what happens
right
YouTube YouTube with the password so let
me go ahead and login say no I'll just
go to the login I'm going to say YouTube
and YouTube so this is logged in now but
it didn't know where to go that is why
it is showing as it is now let's go to
risk - hello / say Q God let's see what
happens if you notice we got access is
denied it
okay we we're allowed to log in but the
access is now said previously if we
noted Bieber redirected when we with
methi don't log into the web server
it was redirecting us directly to the
login page right so if you notice here
the reset now let's say really fast
hello sick to God if I if I hit that I
see that access is denied because I
already logged into my YouTube so if I
now login to my older credential right
so I'll just say Jenny okay and I'll go
to the rest endpoint or slash hello -
she kills a song if you notice now I'm
able to access it
okay because my username is different
and if I came from the other username
okay we are not able to access that is
what this pre-authorize is doing so
pre-authorize is now authenticating that
is me has this admin privilege anak and
if you notice here in the law how many
of our time we did the authentication
that many queries obviously so so that
is how we tell spring security to access
using our database credentials so I will
say summarize again what we did so
initially what we did is we wrote a rest
endpoint okay we secured one rest
endpoint with a roll call admin and we
added a annotation called pre-authorize
so if you notice the authorize is coming
from spring security and I am giving a
role saying okay has anyone if you have
multiple roles you can assign something
like this so you can add multiple roles
here okay so you can do that so right
now we have only one from so I am saying
that okay secure this particular in
point with admin and allow them only if
it is a good ok or else do not allow now
we go to the secure string in a security
configuration so we need to tell spring
boot that when you bring it up next
spring security understand that it means
to know the custom user details also we
are creating a custom user little
service and we are overriding the node
user by user name method from the user
details so again we are now querying our
database here so the database query
which we are doing we are querying based
on a user name and we are telling that
ok and we are basically telling spring
that okay these are my youtube user
so if the username exists it will give
the same username either a temp if it
doesn't exist it'll throw user more form
that is when when you see that Brad
credential some stuff right so that is
one net to happen okay so this
particular implementation is now
provided to the string security
framework using this particular web
security configure doctor and that is
what we are providing here and we also
provide the password into encoder right
now I'm not using any password encoder
so I'm just giving an empty
implementation of TV password encoder
I'm just returning whatever character I
got the next step is authenticating are
basically authorizing our rest endpoint
so I we are going to say that okay they
should tip in security do these stuff so
go ahead and allow everything apart from
secure so if it is having a secure URL
authenticated okay if it doesn't have so
for example I will show you one more
example so let's let's add one more ok
one more get mapping I will not add
pre-authorized okay and I will use that
for the YouTube YouTube video
so whatever the YouTube username right
so alternate I'll just say alternate I
just done that we'll show you how this
particular admin role is now controlled
so so let this guy come up okay even
though we did not have reauthorize this
will be authenticated because in this
bring security we are telling spring MVC
that okay secure this particular URL and
then allow spring security to
authenticate it if you not check it for
any authorization but it will
authenticate it okay and we are also
appending the form login so for any
authentication redirection we are going
to use strings form if you have any
custom form you can just say form login
and then use that particular you are so
these are the configurations which
string security requests also we need to
provide the annotations to enable spring
security in the spring boat application
so we need to say at enable web security
and also we need to enable the global
method security for for that Act
reauthorized stuff right so for that we
need to enable it manually so another
thing is the JPA
as you know already in all my JP
examples I would have used it back so we
just need to say at enable JP a positive
and poverty JP a repository package or
the class and I have some method this
the other thing is we need to create a
custom user details which will be used
to buy spring
so if you notice inside the service
which we created they are custom details
service we are going to provide a custom
user details and inside that we are
going to extend the users which is the
entity for our database table
relationship okay so we are just
extending from this guy and then
creating a custom user details and
inside that we are providing some
authorities so we are going to create a
granted authority which says thing
security liquid I am just going to I
trade water all roles are there for that
particular user and then create a simple
granted Authority and then I am going to
return that to string so that spring can
use that force as our authentication or
authorization deck okay now my swing
boat application is up again so let's
just double check the YouTube login
right so if you notice here I am going
to secure all and it is going to ask me
the username and pasta I'm going to say
YouTube and YouTube right and this is
going to tell me that access is
forbidden right because we authenticated
but the authorization is not allowing
because the page has admin rights right
so I don't have anything for this
particular user so but we created one
more called alternate right so I'm going
to click that alternate and if you
notice I am able to access that
alternate from this user alright so that
is what spring security also spinning
security secures with secured resistant
point and using the pre authorize it
allowed us to check the authorization
however I do not have any authorization
here only authentication if I are this
play here only authentication so it
allowed me but it is not check for any
row so that is that is how you use
playing security inside the spring but
application to leverage your database to
get the credentials and validated ok so
that is it guys so that's it from this
