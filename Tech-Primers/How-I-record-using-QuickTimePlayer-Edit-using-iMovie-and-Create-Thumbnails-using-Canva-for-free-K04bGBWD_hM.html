are going to see how I record my video
and then how do I edited with iMovie so
I'm going to basically show you how I
literally record the video and then I'm
going to show all ready recorded a video
few minutes ago and I'm going to show
you how I did that particular video and
how I upload it to YouTube and how is it
how does that happen okay so I use this
software called QuickTime Player so this
comes by default as the media player in
Mac's so I use that for recording all my
video so I use the option screen
recording so that I can record the
monitor view as well along with the
voice recording so if you had seen my
initial videos I used to use the I never
the audio of the video used to be a
little bit lagging because not laggy
basically a little bit noisy because I
never used a mic or something so right
now I'm using my headphone mic so I use
the boat headset I use the mic in that
particular headset so that it is better
now so comparatively to what was it
earlier so people used to say that okay
they are not able to hear me properly
because I never had a mic so I used to
use the inbuilt macbook mic so that is
why the audio quality was not that great
so now I am using a mic using the
headset but yeah so there are other
options as well for recording so you can
record along with the video camera and
also you can do audio recording as been
so it can just do audio recording as
well so right now I am doing the screen
recording that is why you see this
option disabled because I am recording
this particular video along with what
I'm going to do okay so I'm going to
open the iMovie so I use iMovie for
editing my videos there are lots of
other softwares like Final Cut Pro as
well so I'm going to use the iMovie so I
create a new project say movie
I'm not going to apply any team I am
going to call it a collaboration final
so I just made a video on how you guys
can collaborate with me for any any
ideas or anything which you want to do
in your
carrier or something like that so I have
just made a video on how you guys can
interact with me and stuff like that so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
show you how I did my video so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to add some
intro so I created a intro last last
night so I just created an intro video
so I just imported that video along with
it I need the main video so the main
video I had put it under collaboration
so I'm just pulling it from there and
then finally I have some end credits
elven so where is the end credit let's
come to the end credit later right so
initially I will show you how I added so
you can add the video directly so let's
see I'm going to add this intro directly
because I know that okay this is going
to be fine okay I add the intro here now
I need to have my video so I take the
video but in the last I I would have
added her so I would have gone and
stopped with the video recording so I
need to cut that part so what I do is I
just check what where is that okay
before I scroll the window I just cut it
cut the video till here and I say add it
to my darling
okay so what I did basically is in the
last faith I need to stop this video
okay so when I take my mouse and go and
hit and stop it takes a while right so I
just cut that part so that you have a
clean short video with all the content
in it and as I'm showing me record and
stop and stuff like that so that is why
I cut that part and then finally let me
go to the wallpaper section so I have my
wallpaper so I I don't know to the
particular video from my mobile so I
created some in screen credits so I just
kicked up some new in screen create so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to add
those two as well along with okay I have
one shipped it so let me go ahead and
add it so it is under the wallpaper
section so where is my wallpaper yeah
the wallpaper there was a folder
Drive downloads and I'm going to add
these two and now they would have got
imported yeah they got important now I
need to add this into the video so I
have added them so I need to just put
this before this so I just track up so
I'm not going to show you how I do
technically internally but I just show
you how I do it so now I have them down
almost I just combined my videos so
let's go ahead and play and see right so
what I will do I'll just so if you
notice here this is the video which is
playing bitty audio I'm not sure if you
guys are able to hear the audio of the
video if you notice here the top has got
cut so I need to check what happened to
the video I just need to crop it
properly so let's see how the end screen
credits have come right so I added this
particular section very recently just to
add it in the end all right okay so
looks okay so what I'm going to do is
once I see it is good but we saw that
there is a section which is quite right
so I I just see that okay there is a
crop here so what I'll do I'll just say
reset okay now it should look fine
let's check one yeah it's it is looking
good so basically these are links to the
code okay so what I will do is now I
will just save this particular video so
I'm going to save this video in the
recording section so I'm going to call
it connotation finance so the main video
I call it collaboration
I call it collaboration and the edited
video along with the introduction and
the end screen credits so I'm just going
to add it here so I will just go to
documents click play moves recordings
collaboration or this named
collaboration fine
so I'm just saving it here so notice you
are generally it takes around the 15 to
20 minutes for the video to finish but I
am not sure this is a small video so I I
hope it will get completed very quickly
but what is it showing okay it's showing
me still it is showing me 15 minutes
okay so I am NOT going to show all the
15 minutes I will just cut the video cut
this particular edit this particular
video bend it is done so that you guys
can continue from there I'll just not
make you to wait okay so I'll just cut
cut my video so don't worry okay guys we
are back the export is successful as you
see iMovie sends a notification saying
okay the export has been successful so
let's go ahead and see the video how
would have come up so I'm just opening
so I'll just reduce the voice so that
you don't get overly on it
just read the last section
because we have added that newly yeah it
looks fine okay I think we are ready to
push our video so the final is the one
which I am going to push so I am going
to what I'm going to do is I'm going to
open the channel website and also I am
going to only this thing so I'll just
click on the upload option here from the
channel so I saw that I can directly
upload the video so I am going to drag
and drop the video that's it
so this upload is going to take few
minutes so main why we'll just fill in
the details for the title so I'm going
to say to collaborate good using Twitter
using some say github dot IO Twitter
slack and Facebook okay I'm just also I
have integrated Twitter tweets here
directly so all the dates will be pushed
to hear directly from here directly so
once I publish the video so I will be
able to do a push so one thing we forgot
actually so I need to create a thumbnail
right so I use this software called
canva.com okay so what I do is I create
thumbnails from the from there so
basically I create custom thumbnails for
every video so I am just going to show
here what I do so I have a couple of so
what I will do will just open this so I
had already a channel art so I just need
to convert this into a thumbnail right
so just open another copy bear I have
all the different thumbnails which I
have to find if we need to here there
are lots of thumbnails so I'll just
create a copy so I already have a copy
here it right
so what I do is I just at it and just
creating a new sub name so that we can
use it for our video so I need to add
some images right so you already have
created some major slips of code that
image so we have our channel art right
so I'm just going to take the channel
art so that we can use that so let me
take the channel art where is the
channel art yeah so we can take just do
it oh I will take something to this okay
it is getting uploader let it get
uploaded meanwhile I you need some text
right so I will check this I will just
copy this guy list it here
okay so the video is uploaded and I'm
going to just send this back okay so
that we can get a clearer view you're
right so I think that is it let me give
this different color okay just give
something for now and I'll just make
this green I'll just expand this image
as well a little bit okay this looks
fine so what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to download this page number two
ones and they're saying download so I
just need to save this thumbnail so that
I can upload it into the video so let us
say this I should have created this
already but I just realized that I need
to do that so that is why I just showed
you this how quickly I design a
thumbnail since I had the images already
I had done a tour as I used to go and
search for images and get them so I'm
going to say Dom name oh collaboration
so now my video is uploaded but I need
to provide a thumb name so that it makes
easy for you guys to understand what
this video is all about so I'm going to
use this okay so let it get uploaded
meanwhile I'll just add the content here
this video covers how to collaborate
with text timers using different social
media accounts okay
I think that is it so also one more
thing I need to add some audio credits
I'll add this later but I just started
it for so that I won't forget it
okay so I think almost done we are done
I just need to add some tags so I just
add a collaborate with take time you can
add different tags so for this
particular video I'm just going to add
it as collaborate all right so I'm just
going to say in Colombo tech primers and
how to contact tech snack a little I'm
just adding some tags medically okay so
that's it I think we are done we don't
have anything else I'll add the audio
credits later I just need to identify
the audio which we added the intro part
right so we are using a open source of
free audio library which you are which I
which is there in YouTube so I just need
to give some credit to the person who
created that audio to that music so I
just added later once I go Blish it so
that's it then I just need to hit D so
publish button that's it right yep I
don't have anything else yeah I'll just
hit the public but publish button so our
video should be live here in this
particular video in this particular link
so let's go ahead and see our video
right so if i refresh my dashboard it
should show it is showing my new video
here I'm just going to the new video and
I click on it they should lower load my
new video and if you see it is loading
gap yep it is loading so that is it guys
so this is how I usually upload my video
ok so that is what I wanted to show I
want to show you how I record and how
how much time it takes for me to just
upload one video okay so that's it for
this video guys mate again in the next
