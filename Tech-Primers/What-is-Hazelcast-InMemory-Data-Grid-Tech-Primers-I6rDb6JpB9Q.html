and never miss any update from tech
primers welcome to tech primers in this
video we are going to say what is hazel
cast so as you guys already know hazel
cast is an in-memory distributed caching
mechanism so there are lots of
distributed caching mechanisms in the
previous videos we saw what is the gem
fire and his in this particular video
we're going to see what is hazel cast so
hazel cast is exactly similar to gem
fire but hazel cast is for the JVMs
right so hazel cast can be used in Java
because his we will see what is that
next right so same way for similar to
how other in-memory data grids exist
hazel cast has the persistence the
scalability the reliability all these
are there so it has a data grid as well
so like how we had in gem fire hazel
cast also has a data grid so you have
like lots of nodes connected in the grid
and then data data is shared across
these nodes and all these data is all in
memory persistence so all these are in
the memory itself okay hazel cosmo knows
this masterless architecture approach so
it is similar to cassandra so there is
no master slave concept you have like
every nodes which are a master for the
particular request okay so the if a node
receives the request from the client
that particular node will be the master
so if a new request comes in there will
be a different master so there is no
master slave concept that is why it is
called masterless architecture so Isis
which is similar to the concept in
cassandra okay if let's say one of the
node goes down the hazel caste framework
or the architecture it automatically
rebalances the grid so new nodes will be
spawned or the other nodes will be
synced up automatically and these are
highly scalable so
you will not see that the nodes are down
so you will have seamless integration
with the rebalancing architecture okay
so you can add or remove nodes anytime
from in the cluster on the grid okay
so data partitions are done in the form
of classes so obviously similar to other
in-memory
frameworks data partition is done across
the cluster so the data will be stored
in all the nodes in the cluster okay so
they are partitioned basically across
the cluster in the different nodes okay
one more thing about the in-memory data
accurate is in the hazel castis you
can't have maps sets list queues
multiple apps basically you can have the
collections framework implemented using
the in-memory data plane okay the other
major feature about hazel castis hazel
caste is for the JVM as I said earlier
so you can share data of a hash map
across the JVM
so how do we solve our current
day-to-day problem with the hash map
CPUs concurrent as Maps for sharing the
same hash map across the thread across
the threads but if you want to say share
hash map across the JVM right now we
don't have any way to do that right so
hazel caste
Souls that particular problem so you can
share the hash map across the JVM so you
can create a hazel caste instance and
then you can access the hash map port
the hash map get the hash map using the
hazel caste instance across the JV so
that is the in-memory data critter
so basically hazel Cass provides the
data across the gbm's right there's also
publish a subscriber model or the
messaging channel which every in memory
data grid provides so hazel caste also
has that so you can have a publisher and
subscriber model and then you can
publish messages from the hazel caste
instance and then the subscriber can
consume messages by other okay
there is also cluster level locks inside
hazel Cass so let's say you are writing
the data in a specific cluster you can
have cluster level lock so you can lock
the particular cluster
and you have lots of concurrent utility
so you don't have to worry about
querying from a different cluster so if
you are querying back from a different
cluster that cluster might not be long
and there are lots of concurrent
utilities which haze in Casper events
okay there's also distributed executor
service which Hazen Castro hides out of
the box which which also runs as a
executed distributed service basically
okay as I said earlier we can share
collections across the JVM so you can
have my apps list and all these which
which can be shared across the JVM so
you can have one JVM with single hashmap
and you are populating that in one of
the JVM the other JVM can use it so you
if you use hazel cast you can just put
it inside his little cousin that the JVM
can use that particular cache so this
solves the problem of caching so that is
why it's an in-memory data grid right so
that is what I wanted to cover let's see
why what is there in the website I don't
think the website has so much of
information but there are lots of
documentation which you can go through
where people are using hazel castle
already lots of investment banks are
using hazel cars for synchronizing the
data across the JVM so they are using it
for caching for product caching pricing
all those they are using easy they are
using hazel custom ok so there are other
jvm languages or for example Scala's you
can use that in scala as well so if you
see here the client language is for the
hazel caste is Java C sharp either and
Scala and no J's okay so you can have
those as the client from which you can
retrieve the data okay so that is what I
wanted to cover about J hazel cast right
so I'll just summarize once again what
is a circus Oh hazel cast is an
in-memory persistent storage or cash
which is scalable and reliable
it has masalas architecture so it can
automatically rebalance the data
rebalance the nodes in the cluster then
when you add and remove the nodes in the
cluster
it is highly scalable there are lots of
data partition
across these clusters so the radar gets
partitioned across these clusters the in
mobility record supports the collections
framework so you can have mapped setlist
cube and multi maps and you can share
them across the JB knows right so there
is also publisher subscriber modeling so
you can have a publisher subscriber
messaging so you can use hazel casts for
that as well
there is also cluster level locks so
when you are writing data into the hazel
cast instance so you can have locks for
the particular cluster there is also
concurrency utilities provided by hazel
Cass which you can utilize for
concurrent behaviors there is also a
distributor to executor service which
with which the data gets written to the
different nodes in the cluster okay and
you can use hazel Cass in the cloud as
well so hazel cast is now getting
integrated with pivotal Cloud Foundry
and other cloud infrastructures so you
can see hazel Cass usage in the cloud as
well okay so that is all about hazel
cast so hope you understood what is
hazel cast and what mean how was it
created so if you liked the video go
ahead and like it if you haven't
subscribe to the channel code and
subscribe quit if you want me to make a
video on any particular topic do let me
know in the comment section below I'll
be able to do that whenever I get time
right so me talkin in the next video
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
