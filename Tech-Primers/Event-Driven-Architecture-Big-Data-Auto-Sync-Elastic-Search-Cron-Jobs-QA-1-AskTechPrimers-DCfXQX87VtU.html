am going to answer to a few of your
questions which you guys have asked me
so before going into the questions I
would like to thank every one of you who
had been motivating me with the comments
in each of the videos which I make so I
really get impressed with all your
comments and then that's what motivates
me to do more and more videos and I
would like to appreciate you all and
then I like to thank you all for that so
let's get started with the video so I
had received four questions so I will
try to answer those four questions so if
you have any questions to be answered if
you have any clarifications to be
clarified you can post that in any of
the comments section below so I would
like to consolidate that and then I'll
make a video next week so well I'll do
that every week so that you have a
weekend to go through the answers with
with what I have got that particularly
okay so if you have any questions don't
hesitate to put that in the comments
below so I will be able to answer that
during the end of the week okay so the
first question is from Leah prefer so he
is asking can you please make a series
on big data so I have already started
making some some videos on big data
leader so I have not worked on big data
as such but I still try to learn Big
Data I have uttered lots of webinars so
if you are not aware there is a website
called meetup calm so what I do is I
register in the meetup.com for different
webinars and then I try to attend
different webinars on big data so there
are lots of good trainers there who
train on big data
so they give lots of webinars so based
on that knowledge I had already created
two videos so I had created what is Big
Data
had also created what is Apache spark
and I have also installed a project
spark in my laptop and then I tried
bringing that up and then I tried
querying Apache spark so if you have
seen on those videos and that that is
just the start so if you have not seen
those videos go ahead and see that
because that will be helpful for you too
it what is a big data and what what is
it all about so you can check that
meanwhile whenever I get time I will try
to make videos on big data as well okay
so the next question is from animal so
humans are sahaja I would would like to
see some videos on event ruined
architecture so definitely enjoyment so
I I also want to learn aventurine
architecture more because then I started
learning vertex so I felt it is good now
if you see spring is also introducing
staying there flux as a part of spring
side which is also based on the
event-driven architecture so if you see
my previous videos I have made two
videos already based on even driven
architecture so one is the vertex and I
did an example with vertex so I wrote a
small hands-on program so you can check
that particular video so that is just
the start of the even driven
architecture right so I just started
with that same way for the civiles
architecture using Amazon AWS lambda so
that is also an even drawn architecture
so how da W slender I just gave a brief
introduction about how aw and that works
so you can take a look at that that is
it but I will make more videos on vertex
if you think that you have any other
framework or if you have anything else
in mind for event-driven programming
mention that to me so I will make a
video on that okay so the next question
is from Abhishek so firstly amazing work
buzzer thank you owe me so can you
please entertain us how one can auto
sing the elasticsearch ad document
created JSON with a database so I assume
that you wanted the data to be real-time
right so whenever you post something
into the database or the a DBMS database
the relational database you want that to
be sinks into the elasticsearch right
see most of the time what happens is
people if you want to maintain two
databases it's it's an additional
overhead right so most of the time you
use elastic search has the read only
database and you use it only for
searching it and your search needs to be
faster so that is the major reason we go
for elastic search right so most of the
time what we tend to do is we to load
this elastic search only once in a day
because you
not the real-time processing let's pour
the databases or what you have to do is
you will have to purchase the data both
in the database as well as into
elasticsearch database so it's like you
have to do two-phase commit
both into the relational database and to
the elasticsearch database so which is
like a additional overhead right because
why do you want to do persistent two
different data stores at the same time
right so there are different approaches
to this so I would say that you can have
periodic syncs so instead of having a
birthday sync you can have periodic
things which will sync your data if your
data is huge so let's say your data is
going to be more than thousand records
per minute or something like that right
so if your data is going to be huge then
every you can sync every one R or
something so that your elasticsearch
database will be in sync with the
database it's it's not in sync but it is
near to be in sync so you can do that or
the other approach would be as I said
earlier so you can do two-phase commit
you purchase both intra database and to
the elasticsearch so that will be a
two-phase commit so you do that whenever
you post something into the database or
whenever you delete something from the
database so you do that in both the data
stores okay that is another approach or
you can have some other way of
triggering from the database so you can
have a triggers written from the
database to insert into elasticsearch or
something like that but which I which I
don't think is a good thing right now
people are moving away from triggers so
it's better to do a periodic sync or go
with the two-phase code okay hope that
answered your question up shake so the
final question is so if you are
wondering waters this tool I just
revealed awaits its Evernote I just used
Evernote for storing it okay so that is
the last question is for mentioned so
when should has been following me from
right from the start of the channel and
he has been in sync with me for most of
the times in facebook so he used to ask
indie tech primers page for different
videos I have done lots of videos based
on his suggestions and his
clarifications okay so he has posted a
question on
how to auto backup databases and upload
files to other directory so he's acting
can I use schedule crunches so yeah most
of the time we tend to use scheduled
cron jobs so there are different tools
available for scheduled cron job so in
my work experience I have used auto sis
so Otis's is designed by CA so that is
an automation cron job management tool
where you can load your cron jobs based
on some job definitions so all your
scripts can be triggered based on that
particular job definition so you can
configure it and it is in your control
so you can configure that particular job
to be around at a particular time okay
so you can use either use auto so sorry
you can use a quad credulous or other
schedulers which are there okay so that
is one that is the best way of taking a
backup because you want to do the backup
it will be run at a particular time and
so that is the best way to do it you as
you suggested yeah you can see how to
use scheduled cron job but it depends on
what type of tools and what type of
technology you're using and to know that
take the backup and then upload the
files okay so that is it guide so that
is it for this particular session so if
you have any other questions mention
that in the comment section below in any
of the video I will be able to get back
to you so I will be doing this Q&amp;amp;A
session every week so this is the first
session so I will be able to interact
with you using this Q&amp;amp;A if you have any
questions you can just post it so if you
see there are lots of people they have
posted their errors and stuff like that
and I was able to help them out in
resolving them so don't hesitate to post
any errors if you had tried out any
program which I had created and still if
you are not able to bring that up you
can still approach me so I will be able
to help you with that okay so that's it
for this particular video meet you again
in the next video thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
