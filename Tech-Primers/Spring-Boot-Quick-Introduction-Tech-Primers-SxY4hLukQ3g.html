my first video on YouTube without any
further delay let's get started in this
video we are going to see about a quick
introduction about the spring boot so
what is spring boot spring boot is a
suit of framework which brings in lots
of dependencies for bootstrapping your
application and making it faster for
production ready usage so why do we need
spring boot so spring boot reduces these
boilerplate code which we write in
creating our application with the
configurations and tying that back to a
production ready code it also manages
the dependencies for the best of its
interest so what else can spring boot do
so spring boot can act as a webserver so
you can create a rest server with a rest
endpoint configured in in built in the
spring good application and use that
from a UI it also act can act as a
scheduler so you can schedule some
functions to be run at a particular time
also it can access a standalone server
similar to how we run a single JVM and
we run our application along with other
JVM with inter process communication so
Springwood can do all these so how do we
create a spring boot application so
Spring has come up with a URL star dot
spring dot IO which helps us in creating
a spring board application if you see
this spring initializer it is going to
help us in creating this spring boot
application so you can give your group
artifact dependencies and stuff so hey
we are not going to see how we are going
to create this spring boot application
however just know that this is the page
where you can go and create your spring
board application out of the box from
spring so it is going to create a
project with structure along with the
dependencies injected automatically
based on the configurations which we
keep here in this UI so we will see that
in the next video
however just know that okay there is a
UI which is provided by spring for
managing or creating spring boot the who
manages
spring boot so pivotal is the company
which manages spring boot so along with
the spring boot they have Cloud Foundry
they have written so all these are
managed by pivotal so that's the quick
introduction about spring boot met you
guys in another video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
