primers adapter design patterns are
generally used when you want to bridge a
gap between two different interfaces
when they are not in sync or when they
are of different types in general
adapter design patterns are useful when
you have legacy code and you want to
write a new interface which needs to
work with the legacy code
a typical example would be a client
talking to a legacy code where you don't
have to touch the legacy code but you
can do something to your client to make
it work with the legacy code typical
examples of the Java API would be the
collections API where the arrays were
implemented first and then later on the
list was implemented so in order to
convert the list into the array so there
is a arrays dot as list so that is a
typical example of a adapter pattern or
you can even see the i/o streams in the
adapters you will be seeing lots of
adapters for the input/output streams
where you can see that the usage of
adapters is more that is a typical
example of the adapter design pattern
so let's see how we can do that in real
time right so for simplicity I'm going
to use a similar for example if you had
seen my other design patterns I would
have used T for example right so I'm
going to use a similar for example what
I'm going to do is I'm going to create
two different phones I'm going to create
two interfaces called iPhone and Android
and these are going to have separate
charges okay
there will be chargers there will be AI
phones same way with androids
Android will have a separate charger we
are going to now bridge or we are going
to create an adapter where you can
charge an iPhone with an Android device
what we are going to do is we are going
to see how we can use an after I design
pattern to create a bridge and tilt
again so I'm going to create some
interfaces here for that so I'm going to
create a iPhone interface and I'm going
to say since it is for charging rate I'm
going to say just charge
say where I will create an Android phone
you
they say charge method his name is same
however I just wanted to have a
different interface so that I know what
is an iPhone and what is a Android phone
so I'm going to implement the Android
phone for simplicity I'm going to call
this phone as one plus file I'm going to
create a 1 next iPhone which is going to
charge so I'm going to say inside the
chart I'm going to say charging o P Phi
so this shows that ok the 1 plus 5 is
getting charged same way for 1 plus 4
these are either for the iPhone I am
going to create an iPhone 10
and I'm going to say
charging a form
ten right Nobby need charging so we have
the phones however we need be charged
inside so let's create charges for
iPhone ie will have an iPhone charger so
what this charger is going to do is it
this charger is not going to implement
any interface or anything instead I'll
just create a method a public method
which can be called from outside and
this method is going to just charge the
iPhone so it is expecting an iPhone to
be charged so you need to pass an iPhone
and that particular iPhone will be
charged so this is the typical charger
for my phone same way for the Android
charger I'm going to get an Android
charger public void charge same way
Android phone and I'm going to say
Android only not charged right so how
are we going to call this so let me
create an adapter example I'll just
create a public static void main and I'm
going to call the first let's call the
Android charger first I'll create an
Android charger
and I need to create an Android phone
and the nerd phone is going to be one
class file I created a phone now I need
to charge the Android phone so I'll use
the charger to charge the Android phone
I'm just going to pass the phone to the
charges so this is our your charger and
that phone same way for an iPhone I just
use the iPhone charger to create an
iPhone charger next the iPhone itself
I'm going to create an iPhone 10 and I'm
going to charge the iPhone 10 using the
iPhone charger so I'm going to say your
charge and an iPhone Claire right so
these two are separate interfaces they
don't clash with each other they have
their own types they have their own
implementation they are done
independently now I need to create an
adapter to make it work with each other
right so what I will do is I will just
create a new adapter so this is where we
will be using the adapter design pattern
so I'm going to use an adapter called
Android 2 iPhone adapter so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to pass an
Android phone to a iPhone adapter so
that way I can charge an Android phone
with an iPhone charger that's what I'm
gonna do here so I'm going to create
this class so now this particular
adapter needs to be charged by an iPhone
so in that case we need an iPhone
charger in order to use an iPhone
charger we need an iPhone right so we
need to implement the iPhone interface
so this adapter is now going to behave
like an iPhone so we need to implement
the iPhone interface that way it will
convert itself into an iPhone kind of
thing and what we need to do is we need
to pass the Android phone to this
particular adapter right that is how you
make this work as a Android iPhone right
so I need to create a constructor so
what I am going to do is I'm going to
create a constructor and I am going to
pass the android phone here so I'm gonna
pass an Android phone and I'm gonna
store this Android phone here there's
not an odd phone equal to and that phone
so what I'm doing is I'm going to pass
the Android phone to this particular
adapter and I am storing the Android
phone and whenever somebody is calling a
charge I am just charging you the
Android phone so this particular adapter
is now like an iPhone or an Android
phone implementation however I am
passing an Android phone inside that but
it is it can be charged using an iPhone
charger so now let's charge it using an
iPhone charger right so I am going to
create this adapter
now we need to pass something here the
thing which me need to pass here is
nothing but an Android phone so I'm
gonna pass the same Android phone which
we created here which is nothing but one
plus five I'm going to pass the same
phone and now this adapter is like a PI
phone because it has implemented the
iPhone interface right you can even make
this like this right so we have created
a new adapter which can be converted or
which can be used to charge using the
iPhone now we are going to use the
iPhone charger and then we are just
going to say charge and we are going to
pass the adapter that's it so now we are
passing the Android to iPhone adapter to
the iPhone charger and we should be able
to charge the 1+5 device so let's see if
it gets charged yep if you notice here
the first message is for the Android
using the Android charger this is using
the iPhone charger and finally it is
using the iPhone charger using the
adapter so this is how you can use the
adapter to create a bridge between two
different interfaces so what we did here
is we had two different interfaces one
called the Android phone the other one
called the iPhone we had separate
charges the Android charger and the
iPhone charger and using the Android 2
iPhone adapter be converted are we
passed an Android phone and be charged
to the Android phone using the iPhone
charger so that is what we did here so
this is how you can create an app
adapter design pattern so when you want
to when you don't want to touch and
legacy code and you want to convert data
type or you want to convert stuff on one
form to another then you can use the
adapter design pattern the one thing
which you need to make sure that you
don't overdo is the decorator design
pattern so apart from using what is
there inside the existing implementation
we should be we should not be adding new
functionalities if you start adding new
functionality then it becomes a
decorator design pattern so we should be
very careful while creating the adapter
design pattern because we should not add
more features and make it as a
design pattern there it violates the
adapter design pattern principle so what
are some of the disadvantages of adapter
design pattern there are very less
disadvantages of design power of the I
wrapper design pattern the major one is
what I said and no new functionality
should be added to the adapter design
pattern that we need to make sure but
also you can have multiple adapter so
when you use multiple adapters
there are chances that it is very
confusing so if you notice here this
itself is slightly confusing right what
how how it did it get adapted to one
another right so if you have multiple
adapters then it is more confusing so
that has been adapted pattern really
doesn't do well so that's all about the
adapter design pattern I hope you guys
understood the adapter design pattern
I'll just upload this code to the github
repository you can take it from there
meet again in the next video thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
