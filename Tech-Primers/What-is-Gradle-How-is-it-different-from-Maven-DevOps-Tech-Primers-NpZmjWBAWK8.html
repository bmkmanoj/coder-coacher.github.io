probably already know that what Gradle
is if you are not don't worry we are
going to explore what kredel is let's
get started Gradle is another build tool
similar to maven and ant but Gradle has
taken the advantages of both ant and
Mayman and also it has removed the
disadvantages of both ant and mavin and
created a first-class build tool so that
is greater so if you are using Android
applications if you have developed
Android applications you probably know
what is Gradle and how griddle works if
you are not using Android applications
still many people use griddle but not
everyone has moved to griddle because
there are lots of applications well
which are still using maven because they
are self-sufficient and they know what
they are doing with maven however
understand what is named or what is
greater and how is it different from
maven so in this particular video what I
will do is I will create a small Gradle
project like how I did for a maven
project we will create the Gradle
project and see how the Gradle file
looks like and what are the different
stuffs Gradle has additionally apart
from what maven done and provides that's
what we are going to say in this
particular video so first of the
documentation so the documentation is
pretty good in Gradle it is something
similar to maven but it is not exactly
like maven the first thing which you
will notice from grating versus me
awareness Gradle is our based on groovy
groovy scripts so whatever you're right
inside Gradle is all groovy code ok it
is not like an example so in maven Bay
right XML so XML is not like a language
right you define a configuration file
but Gradle whatever you write inside a
build out Gradle file is a it's like a
language so it's like a what I call a
scripting language you can write scripts
which can do something similar to what
we do in ant right so inside your and
file you have done lots of steps you do
create a task see one
you would have added some echo
statements you would have added println
stuff like that right but in May when we
can't do that isn't it you have how to
define some predefined XML tags and then
maven daemon but will automatically run
based on the XML tags which you have
defined but in Greybull Gradle you don't
have to do that you will have to write
your own tasks if you need an additional
stuff and there are lots of additional
tasks which are provided by grid like
how Mabel provides but the additional
thing which Gradle provides is you can
plug and play lots of plugins which you
can write on your home so literally on
your own in the sense you can write your
plug-in with Java code so basically we
connect groovy code or Java code and use
that as a plug-in so I'll give you a
typical example where Gradle will be
very helpful let's say you want to
deploy something into your machine right
into your Linux machine or you want to
push something into your remote machine
also after the deployment is completed
you want to do some specific tasks right
so what you can do is you can create a
plug-in which will do a deployment and
you want to do some additional tasks but
you have to control that from your
codebase so you can give control of that
particular post build execution or
something which is which you can create
as a task and then you can give control
to the task in your code base so you can
have multiple projects so based on your
project you can decide what kind of task
you want to do so for example if you
have a tomcat project you want to stop
the tomcat deploy and start the tomcat
you can control that in your code list
and if it is a different project let's
say if it is a moon project you have to
stop your mule server deploy and then
start your mule server if it is a verse
you have to do the similar stuff same
way for spring boat application so you
can do that in a single stream plug-in
but you can keep control to the code
visits so you can give complete control
to the for base and you can overwrite
what you can do apart from what is there
in the plug-in right so basically you
can extend stuff and then write okay so
the other good thing about grow Gradle
is it uses groovy DSL so if you know
about domain-specific language group a
DSL provides some predefined set of
commands or basically user friendly way
of notation not
like for example if you have a
dependency you just say dependency and
then you just say open place closed
place your turn so you don't have to say
dependency open a tag and then you use
the group ID and all those things so
I'll show you that in a minute
right so that is another good thing
about grid so you can write lots of code
inside cradle and also if you want to
create custom tasks you can do that
inside your Gradle you can easily create
your custom task you don't have to
create a plug-in as such you can create
your task internally I'll show you that
as well right so let me go and quickly
create a Gradle project and and if you
notice the Gradle has a very good
support from IntelliJ because Android
studio is developed by IntelliJ
basically JetBrains and Android
applications are basically based out of
build or Gradle basically the Gradle
deployment to the build tool and same
way internship provides first-class
support for Canadian project so I'm
going to create a new project so here
I'm going to select a gradient so I'm
not going to select maven so if I have
to create a maven project I will select
me one I need a Gradle project I select
gradient I just wanted a Java project I
don't want groovy or cotton so I'm going
to select only Java I just say next same
way you have to give a group ID so I'm
going to say comm Trek primers and here
I'm gonna say Gradle example right so
next is I'm just going to use the custom
the default a grater which is going to
be installed so I'm gonna say in next if
you have our custom Gradle home you can
give that there but I don't want
anything custom right I'm going to use
the default Gradle version which
IntelliJ is going to provide me right so
the Gradle project is created and if you
notice here the Gradle build is getting
triggered right and similar to how you
had the maven project created so for
comparison I have opened the maven
project as well that they closed
everything for a second and let's look
at the structure right the structure of
a maven project was like this right you
had a target folder where all that class
files got generated so in maven there
will be different folder called Bill
okay where all the files will be
generated there are
two or four files here right there is
something called build.gradle setting
store credit okay Gradle W dot bat or
cradle W which which you can decide
based on your platform so if you have a
Linux placed platform you can use grid
LW to run your build if you have a
Windows based platform you can use
griddle W that Pat so built or griddle
is similar to palm to take someone
so in maven we had only one file which
is the palm cortex Emmett write in
Gradle they have built out credit and
that is a setting store credit where you
can keep some general settings which you
want to use across your projects so if
you have multi module projects you will
have multiple filter cradles and you can
inherit stuff from the setting store
trailer
I'll cover the in-depth coverage of how
the multimodal projects work in a
different video but yeah first let's see
what is built or played right the moment
a built or Gradle is seen IntelliJ or
time Attica identifies it's a Gradle
project and it shows up this icon right
it also says or do you want to cop
configure something ok I just say apply
suggestion this is just going to link my
DSL with this particular file so the
first line in the file is the group so
which is basically the comm tech primers
this is the package which which I need
to ship my project to right the next one
is the version number so this is exactly
similar to what we had here you had a
group ID artifact ID packaging version
stuff like that right but if you notice
here it has a much simpler notation
right this is the DSM so if you say
group this will have a notation so this
will be internally if you see here I
just did a control B and this is
directly going to a Java class which is
project dub Java which is inside cradle
right if you do a group it is internally
doing a set group so if I go inside it
if you notice here there is nothing but
a method and groobie if you if you know
about groovy it has it uses reflection
and it runs on the JVM it's another jvm
language so that is why if you say the
project is still named as Java right but
still you can access it from a guru B
file so the inter compatibility or the
interoperability is good between groovy
and Java and Java
right it is basically literally like a
Java file right so whatever you do with
Java you can do in this fact I'll just
show you in a minute the next one is the
plug-in which we are integrating so here
I am saying that apply the plug-in Java
so if you want to have a groovy plugin
you can just say groovy if you have a
C++ project you can just say C++ CPP so
similar to that you have you can add
plugins directly so if you have maven
what we do is in the mail in the maven
project you would have had a plug-in
plugins and then you would have added a
plug-in tree so instead you just say
here apply plug-in and then just mention
the name of the plug-in that's it so
great in does the import of a plug-in
and this plug-in is could be a java code
base which you had written as a plugin
so you can write the code base in java
the plug-in as a java project and then
you can just apply the plug-in here we
will see that later in some other video
if you want me to make a video on how to
do plug-in development named credit do
let me know I will just do that
next one is the source compatibility
what is the Java version which we are
going to use the next one is the
repository so this is nothing but the
maven repository bits which we will be
using in this particular project to
download our artifacts right so if you
notice it this is nothing but a function
right maven central it's a function if I
see what is inside that function this
goes to a function class called
repository handler torch our so this is
also coming directly from the Gradle API
see this is the DSL which I was
mentioning so these are nothing but DSL
so da cells are nothing but
domain-specific language so if you say
maven central somebody has implemented
it so griddle has already implemented it
so it directly goes there so that is
what is happening here same way for
repositories or repositories also easy
if I see here it's a closure so it
directly goes to this project so
whatever we have defined outside it's
all up it's all inside project and
whatever you have defined inside it's
all inside that respective analyst the
next one is the dependency so this is
similar to the dependency management
which we have inside maven so you need
to do what dependency is then you say
dependency then you say group ID then
you say artifact ID and stuff like that
right so you don't have to do that
can directly do something like this so
if you say let's combine this particular
dependency will be imported only for the
scope which is test so if you see here
here we had something called scope here
you directly have a test compact if you
don't it don't want it for a test you
wanted to have it at the compile stage
you can do this let me do this so you
can do this also if we hate these group
ID the artefact ID and the version
number you can still do this you don't
have to mention that if you know what is
what you can get rid of these stuff so
you can do even this so Gradle knows
that okay the first part is the group
the second part is the artefact ID and
the last part is the version number you
can still do this right much simplified
so how much line of code is this like I
think 15 lines of code here how much
line is it it's like almost 40 okay so
that is the difference between maven
uncrating majorly so it's it's very easy
for you to read so if you if I need to
read this particular file I can easy to
understand what it is because of the
Grove a DSL which little uses maven is
something different maven is a build
tool it just it is like making your
neighbor understand so whatever you
write here
maven should have had it already and you
have to write it only in XML format and
you cannot do any processing here
however here in maydel am able in in
Graydon right I can create a custom now
so let's say I create a task right I am
going to create a task called let's say
a tech primer said I'm going to create a
task called tech primers just for usage
right and I'm going to say just print
print me hello youtube this is just a
task right I just created a task and if
I see in IntelliJ there is something
called great helper Gradle projects like
similar to maven projects my own
projects will be empty right now because
there is no pom dot XML so once there is
a cradle project you can see the
different tasks
so these are different tasks which are
by default present right and I have
created a new task right so let me open
everything and show you that this dead
Primus task is not there first and I'm
going to do a input right and if you see
here my tech primers task has
immediately come under the other right
so if you have a custom task it comes
under other so this compile Java artist
Java process resources tests resources
these are coming from the plug-in right
so that is why these are under other if
you write your own custom plugin all
these will be coming under this other if
you have a custom task it all will be
coming in the other
so when you want to build a Gradle
project you can run the Gradle build
okay if I just double click on it it
runs the Gradle build here and if you
notice your intelligence a very good
support it has very good way of showing
up the Gradle build right but first time
we want to learn what is created right
let's not do this I'll show you by
running the griddle so there is this
great ill W since this Linux this Mac OS
is based on Linux machine I am going to
run the Gradle coupling if you are using
your Windows machine you can use the
griddle wo fat ok I am going to run this
I am going to give it some tasks so for
simplicity I'm going to give you the
build task right and see let's see what
happens so when I gave the build task if
you notice here my task ran already
right my task ran and it gave me the
output as hello youtube because I had
given a println here called hello
YouTube so it automatically ran that it
did a compiled Java data process
resource it did process classes jar a
sample compiled test Java these are
different tasks which the build is
dependent on so basically these are
different tasks which needs to be run
before this build task that is why all
these ran so if I want to run only the
task called tech primers it will run
only that right so if you notice here I
ran the task called cradle W tech
primers it ran only the task which I had
if you see here it showed only this task
right so this is the major thing about
cradle you can write lot
of things you can write lots of Java
code you can read for loops here you can
do whatever you are here right so that
is the difference between a Gradle and
maven so in maven you cannot do that
right now
right it's a hex a month inside the
bount of taksim on what can you do you
can't write any language you can but in
terms of Gradle you can use that so if
you want to do any automation you want
to validation you can do automatically
inside build or credits so for example
after your build is completed you want
to write some tests right as a part of
the test tasks you can overwrite that
here so let's say there is a if you
notice your test is already a task if I
click on this it is already a task which
is there right so I'm going to write
some custom message test message so this
is going to get printed as well so as a
part of the test test this will
automatically turn so you can overwrite
tasks so you can override your custom
tasks so you can do that as well right
so if you notice your test message also
came right because it's it's by default
there as a task if I create as a task it
might not run because it is created as a
task okay test is already a default
implementation so why is it throwing
another code otters are the tasks with
that name already yeah so if you see
here right
I created a custom I could add a new
task called task Gradle is not allowing
me saying that okay that is already a
task which is existing because you
cannot override that task you can you
can't extend the task using the same
test but you cannot override saying okay
I am defining a new task because when
you say task you are defining a new task
and registering him with the Gradle
Damon right so that is about cradle I
hope you guys understood so what else I
can show I can show you by I say so
after I built right you can see here
there is this folder called build so
similar to target inside maven you have
build and there is something called libs
where you will have the jar the final
jar Thames will have the other basic
stuff right nothing else then you have
the Gradle wrapper so greater using the
Gradle wrapper you can
use the Gradle version or the Gradle
distribution so if you see here this is
using the cradle' version 3.5 rc2 right
using this little distribution you can
give you a custom Gradle distribution
okay if you have your custom definitions
you can have that here so definitions
are nothing but something similar to
here what you may have to turn here
right you can have your own custom
Gradle definitions and use that so for
example like tech primers I can write
some tasks called tech primers put it in
my Gradle distribution and use that in
this particular project and that tech
primers will automatically run so you
can use it for deployment and stuff like
that like if you want to deploy or you
want to automate something for all your
projects you can create a common
distribution and use that distribution
in all your projects so which is very
useful so you can define your DSL aspect
so you can create a custom DSX alright
so I think that is what I wanted to
cover in this particular video hope you
understood what is created and how is it
different from you so we saw maven is
xml-based language so it's not language
as such you define an XML maven is going
to read it if you want to have something
working you have to use the
corresponding plug-in and make it work
but in terms of grading you can write
whatever you want you can write your
custom plugin you can plug it in you can
write it in your language you can write
it in Java or groovy you can write it in
your language and then you can plug it
in alright so that is the difference
between cradles so Gradle has taken the
good features of and anti maven and that
is my griddle is powerful and Gradle is
being used in all the Android project if
you are going to an android project you
will definitely have to learn in cradle
or at least understand creator it's not
difficult to learn grater it's just easy
to learn Gradle because the syntax are
all neck very easy the good part about
Gradle is I I found the documentation
very good the documentation is very nice
the API which the griddle provides is
very good they use a manual which you if
you go there to the Gradle website it's
very good they have covered all the DSL
switch you can use like DSL I mean is
they these are the diesels so you say
apply it's a TSN I go inside it's a Java
class right it's an implementation so
that is that is it about credit let me
know what you want me to cover in detail
in the next week
I can do that hope you guys liked
everything if you liked it go ahead and
like it if you haven't subscribe to the
channel go ahead and subscribe to it if
you find this video interesting share it
to others as well who wants to know
about stuff not only create the video
about cradle but for any video in this
particular channel hope you liked it so
you get to see you again in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
