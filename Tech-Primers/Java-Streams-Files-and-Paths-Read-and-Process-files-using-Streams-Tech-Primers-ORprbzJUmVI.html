are going to see how to do stream
processing while reading a file and when
we are processing them line by line okay
so I'm going to show you an example of
how to read a file using strings and how
we can use streams the power of streams
to process the files line by line okay
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
read the Palm Court XML in this
particular project and I am going to
print the line which has name in it okay
that is what I'm going to do here so let
me copy the path so that take it a
useful for me while encoding so let's
get started so I can use the files API
so files is the API which is going to
give me something called lines so it has
lots of different utility I'm going to
use the line utility which is going to
return me a string if you notice here it
is going to return me a stream of
strings so this is going to read a line
from a file in order to read it we need
to give the parts so we need to use the
path API to get the part of the file so
I am just giving the path of the file
here so I need to add D right so this is
going to give me a stream so if you see
here this particular file dot lines okay
so I'll start line it's going to give me
a stream of string so which base
basically a stream of lines
so using this stream again you can do
stain processing like how we use the
streams inside collection so I can do a
filter here because we need to filter
out the lines which we don't want right
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
say for each line check if the line dot
if the line contains the string which
has name then move ahead so what I'm
doing is I'm filtering out the lines
which don't have the name in it okay
then now let's say what we can do we can
do some map again so we can just
transform that particular line into a
into something else right
so for example
in the poem we are going to get this
particular line object right so what I
can do is I can just rip this off I can
just remove the name like tags we can do
that in the map or you can do flat map
and then do some processing again over
that okay so you can use any of the
features from that particular stream
processing API because it's using
streams right so you can do whatever you
want here so what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to use map but I am NOT going
to do anything else I'm just going to
return the same just for simplicity
right and finally what I'm going to do
is if you see here the compiler is
saying what are you using it if you're
not doing anything so let's say I'm
going to do substring so I'll just do a
substring or I'll do a replace okay hi J
I'm just going to Roo a replace so that
I'm just removing all the string within
a right I just worry place all
okay I'm just going to replace always
empty and now again finally I need to do
some more things right so I'll do
replace all of this also with this
and also this also with this I'll
replace slash also with this right
okay this is this a sample program so
don't get offended if this code is not
great okay so what I'm going to do
finally if I'm just called the
collectors into a list right so I can
use the collectors or to list so I can
move this okay
cool now once we have collected we need
to know 28 right so we have to store it
somewhere I just tore somewhere and then
I will just see print this guy so let me
run this program so what this program is
going to do it is going to read this for
vertex 1 and it is going to traverse
through each and every line ok and it is
going to filter only this particular
line and we are stripping of these name
and the name tags and it is going to
print us only the Java 8 ok I'm going to
run this particular program now so we
should see only the name which is the
Java 8 which should be listed out right
yep we got it here we notice here we are
just getting only the Java 8 which is
inside the list right since we had some
space I think the space is coming in the
front so we can do a trim if you need so
we can just say dot him right and if I
read on this it should go away the space
should go away right so this is how you
read a file ok if you want to read
multiple files what you can do is you
can give the multiple file path here so
you can go ahead and include multiple
file path for the paths gate API so it
will read multiple files in a line ok
and it is going to process them as a
stream so you can use that use the
stream API to do whatever first thing
you want you can use Maps you can use
for a flat maps and whatever whatnot
right and then finally you can do some
color tour if you want to do any
processing here if you want to pass the
line do something you can use that in
the map and then convert that into a
destination transformed object so you
can do that here and then this is how
you use the streams API to pass a file
and then proceed with it ok
hope you hope you found that interesting
so if you want me to make any particular
video on any particular topic insight
stream I can do that
so this topic was requested by one of
the users so that is why I had done this
particular video so hope you liked it
so meet again in the next video thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
