able to see what is firebase and how we
can use firebase in a single-page
application so if you are not familiar
with what is firebase so firebase is the
cloud database which Google provides so
if you are familiar with the Android
apps so you can easily use the firebase
database for Google Cloud messaging so
let's say if you want to push a
notification to your app from a web page
or from some other source from the
server side you can use firebase to PI
that so whenever you fire a database
even that will be pushed onto your
Android application via fiber so
firebase is a cloud database which
Google provides so what we are going to
see in this particular example we are
going to see how we can sync the
firebase with other application so we
are going to use this particular option
there we are going to create a single
page application using angularjs so we
are going to see how we can pull the
data from the firebase so whenever we
update anything into the firebase
database the web page will be
automatically updated without having to
refresh the database having to refresh
the web page so that is what we are
going to see so let's get started so in
order to work with firebase so you will
have to install the firebase CLI so I
will drop the link for the file by CLI
in delay in the description below so I
have always have already installed
firebase here so the 5 days as a CLI so
if you see here 5 days is the command so
like how you have CL eyes for NPM and
the Bober so firebase also has a CLI
command line interface so you can use
that to do some things around so for
example these are the different help so
the commands which are available for
firebase so what I'm going to do is I am
going to create a file based project so
I'm going to say firebase in it so
before this boots off right so you have
to login to the firebase console so 5
bytes of the console to consult out five
days or google.com so you have to log in
there and create a new project so I have
already created a new project called
angular underscore - firebase so as you
see here this is the project ok I have
also added
authentication to a email address and
also I have created a database so what I
have done is I created a database called
angular and inside that I have two
objects okay so I have an angular
firebase as a project and then I have
something called angular as a database
and internally I have two values okay so
this I have created initially so you can
also add values here we just say plus
and then I you can add values
okay just straightforward to add values
into the five-page database so if you
see here once I hit the five ways in it
option so it is just opening up the
command-line interface this is just the
logo which of firebase so what is it
asking what firebase CLI features do you
want to set up so I want everything so I
am just saying proceed so you can host
the database or you can even deploy your
application there so now what is the
tasking is select a default file based
project for this particular direction so
I have already created this particular
project at angle of Phi they say I want
this particular database so I'm going to
select that and then say enter then it
is asking me what fun should be used for
database routes so I am asking you to
create a new file called database or
closed or JSON so it will be created
automatically then it is it is
automatically created the functions
package so it is asking me do you want
to install the dependencies so I am
going to say yes so this is going to
just install the dependencies for the
firebase so this will automatically be
downloaded based on the package or jason
which which is coming with the file so
this five days in it is going to set up
a project for us by default with all the
required dependencies installed
automatically so this is by default you
see here it is doing npm install of that
particular package projection and it is
getting all the dependencies okay so let
this get come completed okay so the
installation is completed
if you see here there are lots of
dependencies which fiveaces brought in
okay now it is asking me what do you
want to use as a public directly so I am
going to say app as my public directory
so then it is asking configure a single
page application yes so I want to
configure a single player application
with index dot HTML so that is what I
need so the installation is completed so
if I see here these are the different
folders the cheetah created app dot apps
in the folder which is which is high in
the index dot HTML then database roles
are Jason then fibers or Jason then
functions functions another folder so I
have opened this particular folder
individual studio code you can see here
this is the visual studio code so
whatever we created now this got opened
here so if you see the 5 is Jason it has
the hosting details over there is our
public folder and what is the
destination same way for the index dot
HTML same iterated database rules has
got created so I have said that give
read permission for everybody so that is
what is the difference and this is the
default index dot HTML page which which
is being created by Phi this okay so
what I will do is I will just remove
some content here so that we don't need
these these are some yeah or delete this
and also this is not required I believe
ok so what we have is a simple index of
XML file so what we are going to do is
we are going to create a JavaScript file
for integrating D Angelo to angularjs so
I am going to create a abs or GS so I am
going to start writing a writing the
angular class so I'm just saying
module so let us name this module app
and also what are all the dependencies
for it so this is where we mentioned the
firebase dependency so firebase is the
dependency module which we are going to
add to the to our angular application so
the next thing is the controller so we
need to register a controller so from
the controller we can get the data from
the firebase at open so I'm going to say
firebase controller okay I am going to
use a particular object called firebase
object okay so this is an object
provided by PI base so there are lots of
other objects provided by pie plate
this is one of the object so we are
going to use this particular object in
this particular example okay so I'm
going to close this guy okay now what we
are going to do here is I am going to
create a create something called an
object okay and I am going to assign the
dollar fibers object and we need a
reference to this particular object so
what we are going to do is they are
going to create a object called
reference here we will do a firebase dot
database dot side of angular so angular
is the database which we have created if
you see in the console we have created a
database called angular so what we are
doing here is we are using firebase to
get the database and its child call
angular so that is what we are getting
here so this particular reference is got
here and using the turbulence we are
assigning whatever is there in the
database to this particular object and
this particular object we are going to
use in this table page so this
particular restaurant page we need to
now link this with the angular J so I am
going to say ng app so our application
name is app or angular module name is up
on our
controller names so I am going to do the
ng-controller there are two firebase
controller and I'm going to say use it
as controller so here I am going to use
a pre pre tag so that we can show
whatever JSON this guy returns
so I am going to just print the object
so controller dot object I am going to
say show it as a JSON so this is going
to print the controller object which is
there inside the controller so if you go
to the angular application so you have a
firebase controller and we are storing
the firebase object results into the
object container object in this
controller so that is what we are using
it in the index so that is it now we
need to add the angle of fire library so
I have already copied by copying URLs if
you see here we need the angle J's so I
have put one dot 5.7 angular and I am
using this leader 7.7 and five days and
also the angle of fire module to the
trader zero so you can even use the npm
install to install these modules or you
can directly use these urls like how i
have used here okay and also finally we
need to link our advertised five
okay so what we have done is we have
integrated this particular index or HTML
to the app dodger angular application
and be using the controller we are
showing the object so inside the
controller we're pulling the data from
the firebase database and showing it
here okay that's it so now in order to
start our test our application so what
we can do is we can do a firebase so so
firebase so we'll start the firebase
server locally in the port 5000 so this
is going to start our single page
application which is pointed to the
index dot HTML into the 5,000 port so
let it bring the application so we can
check so using that index dot HTML it is
going to automatically pull the data
from the firebase database so you see
here the server is listening at 5,000 so
let's go to the local O's 5000 so if I
go to the 5000 so if I see here I am
getting the controller object JSON so
there is some problem so let's debug
this so the controller is not getting
integrals properly so the angular up app
is not getting loaded properly
let's see what is the problem so I have
not mentioned I am NOT if you see here I
have not created the firebase or I have
not initialized the firebase database so
for that we need to go to the fire fan
base console and if you go to the undead
universe they go to the overview so
there is an option saying add firebase
to your web application so we have to go
here and copy this particular
configuration so this is the
configuration which we need to provide
to firebase so that it will link to our
application which is hosted there so I
have created and login under my name and
we have a we have these API keys using
which five days will be accessing our
application so just save this file so
let me go ahead and restart this kind
so the five is service running
let's see once it is up we can again
write better this is all dance you
hopefully it should okay this over is up
let me refresh the webpage so it is
saying PI based what it weighs or child
is not a function so I did a syntax
mistake I think so firebase database
door shine is that the rights impacts so
let's go to the documentation
this is where the documentation is there
so you have lots of functions firebase
are storage database so what I have done
is I've used database so using the
database I need to get the child
information so I don't have anything
mentioned here so let me open the app
which I had already used so let's see
what mistake I did
so this is the app which I had used so
okay I miss the reference function so we
need to let me open the examples which
we were using so under the database we
need to use the resumption so we need to
say it let's restart this over again
okay so five ways on a wedge water then
child angle loss okay so the shows up
let's go and check out okay let's see
here these are the data which is coming
from the firebase one source so if you
see here the tech primers demo is one of
the value which I had entered let me go
navigate and show you so to see here
this is one of the value so let's say if
I'm modifying this particular value I
don't think I can modify so let me add
one more value under the angular so
let's say test and I am over and add
text so you can see here this particular
page I'm not going to refresh so let me
pull this guy out
let me show in Paris right
okay so what I'm doing is I'm going to
show you how the single page application
is getting updated without even having
to refresh the page so you see here this
is our webpage and this is our console
so I'm going to add the new value called
test new name called test and value for
value as test so if I do a click at if
you see here immediately it could this
contact so I will show one more so just
to mail access to if you see notice here
this is this webpage is not getting
refreshed or nothing is happening so I'm
going to say add and immediately if you
see here this is getting pushed
so what firebase is doing is five is is
automatically pushing the value to the
existing registered web application
which is already running so this is how
Phi this pushes the data so if you are
using any Android application or iOS
application firebase is varying the pull
when you work when you want to push data
from the backend to all your
applications which are registered to the
firebase database so it does
out-of-the-box so it is a cloud database
which Google hosts so if you see here
this is hosted by Google and you see
from the URLs from Google so whatever
you push it to this particular database
will be pushed to your web application
or your Android application or your iOS
application automatically and you can
show the data back to the UI so this is
just a simple example of how you can
push the data from the firebase database
to your UI but you can use it for any
other functional purpose there you want
to show any data from the database
example your cab information or
something which is specific to your
application okay so that's it for this
particular video meet you again in
another video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
