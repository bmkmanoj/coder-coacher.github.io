technologies into your application when
you want to process some data are you
using any frameworks or are you using
your design patterns and you have
written in any custom code in order to
process them let's see what are the
different enterprise integration
patterns which are available and what
are the different frameworks which are
currently present and which are popular
and we can see how we can use them or
which one to choose based on your
current application usage
press the bell icon on the YouTube app
and never miss any of it from tech
primers so what I enterprise integration
patterns let's consider an application
in order to process data in an
application we will be consuming
messages of a database or from a file
system or from messaging queues or even
from the HTTP URLs generally we have
connectivity to the databases using JDBC
connections or any different adapters or
if you want to process files such as CSV
files or XML files we have different
custom implementations for all these
components for example for queues in
order to connect to ActiveMQ you have a
different implementation in order to
connect to RabbitMQ you have a different
implementation in order to connect to
enterprise messaging buses you have some
different implementation similarly these
are different flows which we integrate
into our application and we have
different code specific to these
implementation after we consume messages
of these flows we transform these
messages and we process these messages
once we process them again we need to
push these into a flow right either it
could be a database or creating files
again or pushing it to another queue or
publishing messages via some rest
endpoints or HTTP endpoints this is what
a small micro servers or a small
application does right even if it is a
monolith it is going to do the same so
if you see the life cycle of an
application it is going to consume
messages of a particular flow and these
flows are specific to different
technologies like database is a
different technology file system is a
different technology queues are
different and it should it be protocols
are different so we have different
technologies which we integrate into an
application and every time you integrate
these flows into an application we need
to write some custom code for doing that
let's say for database we write or we
use the JDBC template which is there
provided by differ
framework's same way for files we have a
different framework for queues we have
different framing for every each and
every technology we have a different
framework and library which we had been
using it what if we combine these
together that is what integration
frameworks are integration frameworks
are something which provides flows and
libraries and api's out-of-the-box for
integrating applications with different
technologies these are called
integration patterns there are lots of
tools available or lots of frameworks
available to be precise which we can use
for getting these integration
out-of-the-box instead of writing
libraries or custom code in order to
plug in our flows or different
technologies into our application we can
adopt to these frameworks which are
already written by enterprise companies
to make our workload simpler so that we
can concentrate only on the
transformation and the processing logic
rather than concentrating on the flow
integration so there are three popular
frameworks which we are going to see in
this particular video and we are going
to see how that will fit into our
current use case where you can use it
whether it will make sense to use in our
current flow the first one is spring
integration if you are already familiar
with spring integration spring
integration is doing the same thing
which we showed it is providing lots of
api's and libraries by default to
connect to different technologies you
can directly use either the Java
configuration in spring boot or the XML
configuration the traditional spring
spring framework you can either choose
jvm languages like you can either choose
Java or Kotlin because all these run
runs on the JVM so you if you are using
a java application and if you want to
use spring integration you can choose
the java configuration or the xml
configuration and you can choose
languages like Kotlin or java or even
groovy and Scala the next framework is
the immune mule is an end
price service bus unlike spring
integration which is just a framework
for just integrating the flows mule is a
enterprise level service bus component
which has integration of these flows as
well along with the integration it
provides the enterprise service bus
functionality as well so mule is a
superset of spring the last one is the
apache camel apache camel is another
library which we can use similar to how
we use the spring integration so apache
camel provides lots of integration flows
which we can use directly and you can
plug that into any type of application
irrespective of the implementation if
you want to integrate spring integration
you have to use spring applications if
you have to use spring frameworks but in
case of apache you can use any framework
or any library or any language and then
integrate apache camel into that so
these are different frameworks which are
available currently all these three
frameworks provide a UI lots of ID's
provide support for visualizing the flow
like how we saw the diagram with the app
and the D integration the incoming flow
on the outgoing flow we can come up with
this for each of these frameworks for
the gesture drag-and-drop functionality
and the xml's or the Java files are
generated out-of-the-box by these IDs
so which framework to choose and when
right the major question arises when you
have multiple frameworks when do we need
to choose one over other the first one
is the spring integration if you are
already using spring projects if you are
already using spring boot or any spring
framework you can easily integrate
spring integration into that because
spring works very well with the existing
spring framework so it takes very less
time to just configure spring
integration into an existing spring
project and you can get your application
up and running out of the box and if you
are comfortable working with spring then
you can directly go for spring
integration the community of spring is
bigger as well after the adoption of
petals integration with spring spring
integration is managed by pivotal like
how any other Spring Framework is
managed by them Spring has recently
improved lots of stuff for spring
integration in order to provide
integration with the spring bootie
applications initially spring
integration used to have xml-based
configurations however now with the
adoption to spring boot and opening it
at frameworks spring integration
provides how Apache are used to provide
the Java based D essence so in spring
integration you can do the functional
programming style DSL out-of-the-box and
all these connectors for HTTP connection
or ActiveMQ connection or RabbitMQ or
the momo database or connecting to any
type of database or any type of
enterprise connectivity is provided by
spring integration out-of-the-box you
just need to use that particular
connector and then use it the next one
is the immune mule is an enterprise
service bus as I said earlier it
provides more functionality than the
integration flows it also has a UI and
you can see enterprise level support
from the mule soft the company which
manages mule mule is like a server you
will be deploying applications onto the
mule server you have lots of monitoring
options as well in order to
differentiate spring spring integration
works
like any other JVM it you can integrate
it with an existing spring boot
application you can get it running out
of the box
however mule is an enterprise service
bus so you will have to deploy into an
mule server which you will have to
install in your Linux machine or in your
cloud infrastructure like how you deploy
Tomcats mule applications run run on the
mule server so that is a slight
differentiation between the spring
integration on how mule works spring is
completely open source spring indication
project is also open source you can use
it without even having to worry about
any licensing however for mule soft if
you want to get enterprise grade or
enterprise level monitoring or API usage
then you will have to upgrade it to
enterprise certificates which obviously
comes with a cost the next one is the
apache camel apache camel is another
open-source library since it is under
the apache foundation it is open so
similar to how spring integration is the
additional stuff about apache camel over
spring is there are lots of connection
connectors available in the apache camel
because it was created just to solve the
problem of integration spring provides
lots of libraries but they don't have a
dedicated team who works on integration
separately however apache camel was
created just to solve the problem of
integration so apache camel has lots of
connectivity with enterprise-grade
applications like for example you have
connectivity with JIRA or any
enterprise-grade applications but spring
integration you have a limited set of
connectors however apache camel provides
more than what spring integration
provides apart from that there is no
difference between spring integration
apache camel opposite camel can be
easily used in any standalone java
application which even if it is not
using spring you can directly use apache
camel into that however spring boot also
supports apache camel integration out of
the box but if you are already using
spring boot applications or spring
specific frameworks it is better to go
with spring integration however if you
don't have any spring usage in your
application currently you are good to go
with apache camel in that case
so those are differences between all
these three frameworks which are
currently popular in the market recently
one of the viewer had requested me to
make a video on Apache camel that's when
I realized that I need to make people
understand what is an integration
framework first that is why I have
created this introductory video where I
just compared these three different
integration flows hope you guys
understood what our integration flows
and why do we need the integration flows
or why do we need the integration design
patterns to be used in our application
so what we saw in this particular video
was what our enterprise integration
patterns so enterprise integration
patterns are nothing but common
technology integrations which we do to
our application in general
so and we also saw what are the
different frameworks which are available
there are three popular frameworks one
is the spring integration the next one
is the mule server or the mule the last
one is the apache camel all these solves
the problem of integration by providing
predefined connectors which are already
implemented and we don't have to
re-implement or reinvent the wheel of
integration how are these components
chosen based on the usage and the based
on the type of application which we are
going to write or which we have written
so we can choose our comfortable
framework hope you guys understood what
our enterprise integration patterns if
you liked the video go ahead and like it
if you haven't subscribed to the channel
go ahead and subscribe to it made again
in the next video thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
