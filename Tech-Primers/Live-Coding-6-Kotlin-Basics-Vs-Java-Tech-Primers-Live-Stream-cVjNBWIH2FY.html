so let me check YouTube in my mobile if
we are able to see it live so give me a
moment I am just checking in YouTube if
our live stream is lime and I'm checking
the audio if it is on good also the
video as well how is it looking
give me fill moments I can hear it well
as well so I see the audio and video is
good so let's get started so if you
haven't subscribe my channel to
subscribe so I welcome to tech primers
so in this particular session we are
going to see what is Cortland so just
for the introductory sake right so if
you're new to Java so Cortland is just
another language which is running over
the JVM so as you know Java is a
language which we use patience in
something called JVM Java Virtual
Machine so that is the runtime in Roman
so if you are from C language or
mainframes or any any any language type
so you will have a runtime where your
application will be done all right
so Java has something called JVM so same
way code Kotlin is a new language which
is created by jet drinks so JetBrains is
a company which creates IDs and stuff so
IDs build tools and stuff like that so
they have come up with a new language
called Kotlin which turns on the JVM
so which basically means you can write
and interact with each other so you can
do similar stuff like how you do in Java
but it has some additional benefits over
Java so that is what we are going to see
you know
so while why Kotlin is gaining so much
popularity right so last week in the
Google i/o so there is an event called
Google i/o which is a developer
conference which Google has every year
so as a part of that Google launched
that
Kotlin will be the official language to
support or hand price so if you see here
this is the coddling websites so
Cortland Lang dot or she or even go to
Cortland dot jet friends cough so and
this is their webpage so if you see here
they have uh norms that no official on
Android so if you go to the block so
they have clearly mentioned that Google
has announced that Cortland is the
official language supported by Google on
Android so you can create cutting native
applications on Android without even
having to use Java so cotton was
previously supported as well so you can
write as similar to how you write in
Java in Android but now Catalan is an
efficient language which android
supports as that Android is the written
in Java as well so for just a point for
paws if you if you didn't know that okay
Java is use you can drive okay so
Cortland is a think of cotton as another
language which is running the same
runtime environment as Java but what is
it going to health so if you see here
what they have mentioned mainly is the
statically typed programming language
for modern multi-platform applications
so Java is statically typed as well
however if you see the new dynamic
programming language is right for
example Java Script or groovy let's say
so you don't have to define a type so
for example if you create a string
variable there you want to source a way
where you want to store some string so
you don't have to do any you don't have
to do any type check or you don't have
to tell the compiler that this is a
string so those will be taken care
dynamically by the compiler electron
type however in Cortland you don't it is
not that this you have to define the
type statically basically during compile
times you will know that okay what type
of object shatters so it is a statically
typed programming language like Java
okay so scholar if you take groovy young
JavaScript they are not statically typed
so they you don't have to define a
specific type saying okay this is a
string or this is an integer
I'm going to use only integer values or
something like that
however Kotlin is a statically
programming so you have to define that
so they're going to see that in the code
but in general that is the difference
okay so but why correlated so you see
here Kotlin is used in creating if you
see here build applications for the JVM
you can build applications for Android
and you can build applications for the
trouser I'm looking forward to see how
that that comes up will so so they have
confirmed that Cortland if it Kotlin you
can type javascript code for the blouses
so basically you can design websites
with Cortland as well and finally the
native applications basically these are
the hardware support like objective-c or
something so how the how you can
interact with the hardware from the
cotton so it just coming up looks like
that is what we see so why do we need
cotton Thanks so the first major feature
is that it's concise so basically you
don't have to write lots of code you
don't so you see here that's what they
mean drastically reduce the amount of on
a plate code so in Java if you are
familiar with Java so you will have to
write lots of unnecessary ceremonies
right so you have to write lots of
things which Java may understand so you
know that it's not required so those are
not actually important so basically the
boilerplate codes are not there in
quality cotton so you don't have to
write lots of code to make the code
functionality to works okay so that is
the major feature next one is safe so it
is type safe so basically you are safe
within all pointers and null handlings
and the error handling in cottage so if
you're coding in Java you would have
faced these null pointer exceptions
right so they kill you at runtime right
so it's safe there is a production issue
you see a null pointer exception and you
go mad
whereas there is there is a fail because
you don't know where your variable is
null and you are doing so many
operations without even doing null
checks and you go mad
checking that value again and again
checking your code again again again so
that is not required in quatrains so
quarterly this type safe during compile
time it is going to throw you exception
saying okay this is not an unsafe you
have to handle so they are going to see
that as when in this example so what
will be code next one is
interoperability
so like JVM you can run on any any
machine or any Linux machine or nexpaq
form or Windows platform or Mac platform
or any any platform on the browser or
the mobile device so that is because JVM
already provides that so since you are
writing in Kotlin and converting it into
byte codes which can be run on the JVM
you do not have to worry about the
problem okay finally the tooth friendly
path if you see here if you see if you
have seen my videos all my IDE I would
have used IntelliJ IDEA so which is
designed by Chet friends the company
which design the Courtland
so basically the tooling support is very
good we are going to see that as one so
we are going to use IntelliJ to see how
we can create content application so and
the tooling is very good because the
idea is so tightly coupled inside the
chip trains and also you can use other
IDs at solo so how does it look like
right how does the code look like in
Cortland so this is how a typical hello
world looks like in Kotlin so you don't
worry about what each these are I'll
just explain when you start coding just
try to understand what court line is and
what how is it different from Java or
how is it different from your language
from berry or coming from okay there is
a use case to try quatrain online as
well if you see here there is a try
online link so you can even write code
in the browser so if you see here you
can write the code in code and try out
here and you can run it and then you get
the result out here so this is just a
typical HelloWorld program so I just ran
it and the put comes up here so you can
write typical Kotlin code here if you
want to try out Catalan without even
having to use any browser or something
okay so in our case we are going to try
intelligence so yeah as you see here
these are the IDE browser supports for
code length so IntelliJ IDEA is a major
ID so as we are going to use IntelliJ
IDEA today the next one would be the
Android studio so under to do also is
designed to by jetbrains which designed
IntelliJ so it is going to have lots of
support inside Android studio asset so
if your
many of an Android programming so you
would have used Android studio to create
your application so Kotlin gives
flexibility to use the same Android
studio which is bundled with the studio
3.0 so you can just install it as a
plugin and you can start writing Kotlin
code statements without even having to
do lots of setup ok next one would be
eclipse so eclipse is I don't know I'm
not using Eclipse for the past 5 years
or more so I don't know how Eclipse as
they've all right now but I feel
IntelliJ is better in every aspect but
let's not argue that here so if you are
using eclipse
you can install the plug-in for rÃ¶tteln
as well ok same way a command-line
interpreter is also there so like how
you can compile Java code with Java C
command so there is a Cortland C command
as well which you can use to combine the
Kotlin code so that is it who's using
Cortland currently like you see here
Pinterest the app where you can see the
fashionable items so that is using
Pinterest grad and let me know deeper to
which right now is using groovy as it's
a DSL is introducing quarterly as a
language for writing the Perl scripts so
next one would be Evernote so Evernote
is using Cortland and they recently
integrated into their Android
application say by over so many of you
have used overnight so what is using
Cortland for building internal tools in
their company so next is called a so
coda is an open source distribution
ledger so that is a platform which is
used by lots of pants so they are
building the platform entirely on coding
ok there is something called Coursera so
course arise an Android application
where you can go and see some tutorials
and stuff you can read tutorials and
listen to the e tutorials created by
different people so that is also written
in cotton the other major thing is the
pivotal the company which develops
spring boot spring and all those
playbacks so they are using catalan as a
one of their language along with java
okay finally ecclesia Atlanteans new
mobile app called hello is
is designed in Kotlin so Atlassian is a
the company which which has designed
your jeera crucible all your big packet
and all those code management of the
version control instrument stuffs so so
they also use Scotland's in productions
okay so that is it about Cortland so I'm
just excited to use Scotland in my
day-to-day activities so I won't have
any opportunity to work with Kotlin it
at my workplace but still I want to try
Cortland and see how it is better than
Java because everyone is like going
crazy with Heartland and also Android is
now says that okay cotton is an official
language so I wanted to see how
Courtland fares with with Java there is
one more additional thing so if you see
this is the website you would have seen
in all my videos so I usually go to this
particular place this is nothing but the
spring initializer where I can create a
bundle of fronting the project frontals
basically which creates a spring boat
project actually fascinatingly
Springwood provides an option to select
korklan as a language so if you see here
there is an option to select java groovy
and Kotler so you can select any of this
language and you can generate your
project so right now I am NOT going to
do that it is too much of an overkill
right now to use at length with
springboard I don't want to do that
let's take baby steps so let's go step
by step so I'm going to create quarter
length from the integer because
intelligible if all supports cuddly but
I'm just saying that spraying boat
already has integrated cotton and long
back use 2016 to create an application
using correlate directly so you can just
use this generate option and then you
can see that like a java application
Cortlandt application is created which
is one a little bit spring book okay so
that's it for the theory part so now
let's get our hands dirty with the
coding part right so let's see so I have
opened IntelliJ here so I am going to
create a new project so I'm just
clicking the new create project option
so if you had worked in IntelliJ already
you would have noticed that it asks for
different application or the project
type site so for example here it is
asking me
the Java project of flex project or
JavaFX or a got your name and electrical
project or a GUI project for a griffon
or finally code length okay so this is
where Jen brains is smart enough they
have everything integrated inside the
IDE itself because they developed it and
the language is also their own so when
once I click the Kotlin project I have
two different options one is to create
an application which runs on the
JavaScript platform or the JVM platform
so we are not going to see the
JavaScript part so we are going to see
the JVM parts how we can run our
application inside a JVM so I'm going to
select this option I'm going to say next
so let's give a name to this application
so I'm going to say Cortland learn
Cortland so we are learning Catalan by
I'm going to say learn Catalan and the
library which quatrain uses is by
default Courtland one time Java and time
so it has already got selected on the
and the Java version which I am using is
1.8 so by default I'm using 1.8 so the
SDK which is selected is 1.8 ok I'm just
going to say finish so this is going to
create a new project using caught
lengths and it is going to just open it
up okay so the Intel J IDE is open let
me maximize it okay so if you see here
it is a dummy project it's nothing is
there literally so if you see here there
is an empty source folder so there is
nothing much so if you see the external
libraries if you see the external
libraries here there are two runtime in
Romans one is the Java 1.8 the next poll
is the Catalan runtime there are just
two jars and just amazed to see that
there only two jars for coupling okay
yeah it's just a new language right so
you can't expect lots of things
initially but yeah so let's go go ahead
and create a package so that you can do
something inside the package so so I'm
going to create a package for that
primals combo I can just say FRMS for
simplicity okay I created a package
called tail primers so I'm going to
create a
Kotlin file so I'm going to name this as
me for her simplicity so this is going
to be a main
so this is something similar to the main
class in Java so this is going to be the
main file way which I'm going on okay
and if you see that the file has an
extension dot Katie so if you are
working in Java the file extension is
dot Java so any file name dot Java in
court length of filename extension ends
with dot Katie okay so if you are
working in groovy it is groovy if you
are in the Scala and starts car life ear
and C language it to start C so
similarly courtland's extension is dot
katie second so how do we define a
function so in Gatlin you can define a
function say lick fun ok let's start
with the fun thing so I don't know why
he named it fun but it looks funny but
yeah ok so I'm going to define the
function as me so that is our main main
function try to some other Java class
here so that I can show you how
Courtland is different from Java ok I'll
just create our main Java so if you are
using Java so we use this I public
static void mate and then we have an
argument here so this gets translated
into this so I am going to say that I
need an argument of type array okay
which is the string okay if you see here
this is the string from cotton so and
this is equivalent to this so if I need
to show you let me show you here so if I
show you this is the right side part is
Java the next part is cotton so in Java
we load public static void main string
args something but in court language is
saying main and this is a function and
this is an argument which my function is
expecting basically if somebody is
calling this main they need to provide
some argument ok
that is what this says and if you see
here this K icon so this is nothing but
a cotton icon so you can directly click
on it and run no debug or run with
coverage this particular class so
IntelliJ is smart enough to identify
that ok this is a Cortlandt project I
can run it directly here so same way if
you see in Java you can turn
here directly using this option you can
run main or on a debugger on the card
show here for cotton as well it is
showing up automatically so now what we
are going to do is we are going to just
print a message called hello world opens
a Java and Kotlin so I am just saying a
word or we can say hello YouTube it's in
here on YouTube let's try to change the
formality deines so in case of Java you
does it system dot out dot println and
then say hello YouTube
from Tao I'm going to say from Courtland
okay
so let me run this but Ziggler got the
only thing which is different from Java
and courtliness the compilation takes a
while because everything is done at
compile time if you had used groovy
groovy does everything at one time
so basically if you screw up something
in your code you won't even know until
it is there in production which is
dangerous right so so that is now not
there in Cortland because cotton is a
statically typed language basically it
is going to check everything as a
compile time so during the compilation
phase it is going to take lots of time
that is the only difficulty I have faced
when running my first cotton project so
you can see here just this particular
program has arms and I can see that it
has printed hello YouTube from Cortland
if you will see here you can see this
here now can hello YouTube from cotton
if I basically run it from the Java so
Java is will go and do the same thing
just that if you see the number of lines
of code which I have written in cotton
versus Java it's completely less right
the number of lines in Java is 9 if you
see in cotton is fine and also the
number of texts which you can see how
much ever I have typed in quartering was
a shallot every lesson cotton if you
compare this with Ruby right you don't
even have to do any of this you just say
println and hello youtube it just spins
but the only disadvantage with groovy is
it is not a statically typed language so
it checks everything at one time only so
it's a dynamic language so you won't
even know
what is happening so it's like it fades
only in production most of the time so
it's but that's what happens in
JavaScript right so you write your code
you pray that it works in the browser
and then you go and check it works if it
rains it rains so but yes that's the
advantage Cortinas giving you it's a
statically typed Czech language so
everything will be identified at compile
time itself ok so as you see here yeah
the Java output has come as well so
hello YouTube from Java ok now there is
an advantage in Cortland so you can call
Java classes from the Catalan classes as
well so now what we're going to do is we
are going to create a plain B Colin
podge or a plain old Java off so
basically what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create something called users
so I'm going to create first in Cortland
so once I click on the new Cortland file
I can select a class so same way how we
have class interface object in them
everything is there
in Cortland as well so for simplicity
for the initial video we are going to
create a class so I am going to call it
users so if you are seen my all my
videos I would have use this use 100
times yeah and it goes to your shirt so
what we're going to do here is I have
created a user's plain old Java object
basically but in Cortland ok same way
let me create that in Java
ok I am going to call it users shower ok
so in Java if I had to create a POJO
let's say I have a name and salary let's
for simplicity purpose think that I have
only name and Sunday I'm going to create
some Gators and setters
okay now just created so this is the
main poem basically in Java right you
have a name and salary you can put the
name inside it you can put the Celtic
inside this object and you can get it
using these functions so basically you
use this object to put and get stuff out
of it in Cortland we have to use
something called a bar or a ban okay so
bad is used to form all the types of for
everything for all the types of
variables okay and Val is used to power
and Brandon seems to fold all the types
of constants basically you would define
variables with private final and stuff
right so that is in Java so that is
equivalent to Val in Cottenham so in
this particular find what we are going
to do is we are going to create the same
mean you have to do this so in Kotlin
your could be fine their name as a
strength okay what I'm doing here is I'm
creating a name variable and defining a
type so this is called statically typed
so I'm tying up a name but strange so
Java also tests that but if you see
groovy doesn't do that so you don't have
to do something like this you can just
say therefore check you can just say
different name that is a groovy works
but in cotton you have to do the same
way like how we do in our but it's
slightly different and if you see here
there is a compilation error
it says the property must be initialized
or be abstract so in Scotland you have
to initialize every object which you
create or your to mark it as abstract
okay so yeah so in this case I'm going
to say for simplicity I'm going to say
which will speed up so the users name is
Peter so you see here the compilation
error has gone okay
the right now it's just complaining
saying the name is not used at all so
but yeah and also if you see here I
don't have to put a semicolon in called
cotton so in Java we have to end every
statement with semicolon but in Cortland
we don't have to do that okay so next
next up is the salary so I'm going to
say salary and I'm going to say in so NP
is equal to integer so I can see here is
coming from Kotlin so and then same way
I have to initialize something here so
let's say I'm going instruments 10,000
here okay so this is the Catalan
representation of a particular podium
and this is a Java representation of a
particular project if you see here the
number of lines I have written is just
eight out of which half are just
commands if I remove these comments
right it's just six lines of code and
you can see in Java I have written
twenty three lines of code already I
just don't even start processing
anything I just created some dummy
objects okay so that is the difference
between Cortland and Java it's removing
all your boilerplate code which is not
required
let's now let's go to the main Partridge
how do we create these objects okay so
in Java in traditional Java what we use
to do is you define that object users
and call it users you can say new users
and you say this so we are very much
used to this new write new operators so
this new operator creates objects every
time you create a new right however in
Kotlin you don't have to do that so you
just say var users you know that it's
going to be new so you just say users
yes wait so actually this is users Java
basically so this is the if you see here
I use the users still taua was allowing
me to use it basically uses is a Cott
link file but still I was able to use a
Kotlin object inside Java for but
further our example let's not wrinkle
that here so I'm just going to say use a
shower that is our users tower a trunk
and let me know any transcend some
variable values so here I'm going to
assign the value feeder
okay same way I'm going to say salary
for Peter is ready mm okay
this is how you write in tower right you
create an object you do when you
operator you set the name and you set
the salary
however in Cortland you can do this
since we didn't have any getters and
setters you can directly access the
object here so previously we had
assigned Peter we can assign Sam here
same way I'm going to say losers got
salary I'm going to send some 3,000 data
assign 3000 is 9,000 okay I'm listening
6000 if you see IntelliJ by default was
suggesting all these options
so the browser support is very good
actually that is that is that is another
thing which I see with IntelliJ
supporting Cottenham so same way with
Java as you know Java is good in
IntelliJ than any other idea right now
and same way content is good as well so
I don't have to switch my ID just for
this purpose
it is a physics JavaScript right I used
to use a visual studio code as well
sometimes because I'm not comfortable in
IntelliJ sometimes at home because I
don't have a Ultimate Edition but yeah
that happens but that is not required
for Cortlandt so Courtland supports
IntelliJ as well so I don't have to
mingle between two different IDs for my
code development so if you see the
difference between these two you have to
write lots of code here so same way set
your writing asset you are writing a set
survey and if you see in the photo you
have to implement that's it and if you
have if you also get that route to take
you to use that kit again and you have
to test all these things which is a pain
right so if you don't test it your code
coverage will be down on your manager
will be coming if you're back and saying
why are you not testing it but that's
what happens most of the time right so
that is not going to happen incontinent
because you wrote less course if you are
writing less code you don't have to test
it isn't it so that's what is he major
difference I see if you write less code
you're safe actually then that is what I
I feel I don't know how you feel but yet
now let's print these objects right so
how do we print a job right let us say
println and you just say users equal to
and then we use this plus operator isn't
it and then I say users start get name
is okay so we use this right so that the
pickle usage in inside court renders I
can do this dollar and then you can say
users dot name if you see here including
one stills other thing may what should I
do
so that is the level of support from
intelligence so if I run this particular
class now it should print may users then
it shipped in the name Sam if I see here
there is no concatenation required here
if you see in Java this particular line
is uglier isn't it you have users and
then you have some concatenation so most
of the time when there is a production
issue and you don't know which class is
that log file from you go and search for
the particular log file and you end up
ending up with no results all right so
that is because most of the time you use
this concatenation operations under your
browser will not even be able to and if
I wear your Textus in case of Kotlin if
you see here this is very simple for me
I can just read it
users and this is just printing from the
users or name it it's just another way
of representing the values inside a
string inceptions so if you see here it
has printer users cell Java will also
print the same theme but if you see here
the number of lines of code or the
number of words I have written in this
particular line it has drastically
reduced and I don't have to do this a
concatenation again okay so this is
another way of doing stuff in
courtland's now what do we do the next
feature which people said is golden
Kotlin is null checks right so let's do
some null assignment right so I'm going
to create a variable called null check
okay and let's call it a string okay I'm
making as a string it called object here
in Java I'm going to check
we want to create our actual cha-ching
mole check you can see it is particular
object is not isn't it
where companion says you need to assign
something you assign it over and if you
do something on this object let's say we
do a tooth strain or net let's do a
length if you see this this is going to
rip a resultant nullpointerexception
in Java right so if you do that here
let's do something here in college so I
am assigning this particular non tech
variable as null and the compiler is
complain so if you see here there is an
exception here yeah there is an
exception called null pointer exception
here in the job I will get on the job
right so in case of cortland if you see
here I assigned a variable to null and
the company was complaining that you
cannot use this null add normal
assignment to it okay so what it
basically means is it is telling that
till the compiler that this can be null
and this is now so you have to do a
question mark over here if you see here
this particular variable is being
assigned a question mark because we are
telling the compiler that this can be
null and you have to do your calculation
space on this variable to handle them
okay now let's do the same thing right
Fantana we need to print is now check
I'm going to add length
see here the compiler was saying that
okay you cannot do this because your
string can be long okay so in that case
what do we need to do is you have to do
a question mark over this particular
variable so this makes this particular
line null safe so if I run this
particular class it does not go to throw
me null pointer exceptions like how Java
is right so we got a lump on to
exception but that is not going to
happen in court length so if you see
here even though I did a length check on
a null object it is going to still
return well if I do that in Java it is
going to throw me null pointer exception
but in the court length it is not going
to throw me null point exception so this
is the major feature and courtland's
where you define the variable as null
the compiler is going to throw you
saying you are assigning its value but
you're not handling it so it is going to
do all your checks at compile time
itself and it is going to help you in
making sure your application doesn't
have any context or month null
exceptions basically null pointer
exceptions or the null letters yes it is
okay so that is another good thing about
cotton okay the next part writing
functions right now if you see here I
didn't tell you all how it how you need
to write a function but let's wrap this
into a function right so I'm just going
to use the feature of IntelliJ to just
wrap this into a function so I'm going
to change it just print the door do not
check I'm just going to ignore load
check okay so if you see here fun is the
function okay you can define it as a
private or product or whatever and then
fun is the function and then you just
call a function with a name and same way
you call it in Java so if you if I have
to do the same thing in Java I will -
just I'll just to do the same thing and
it's extracting those two lines and
putting it into a function if it is in
Java you just say private static why do
not check but in court and I can just
say private fun do not check on inside
that I just wrap it around with whatever
y1 so if you want to pass an
commit here in Java you just say
something like this like you can just
sing string me members confirm some way
again just going to commit for know you
can just passing something sure in
Cortland you just have to say name and
then the string okay so in this goal
pass this okay that is how you do it
Jesus this is similar to market here but
that is how you define a variable so
this is similar to how you define a
variable here if you see the user store
Kotlin fine right so we define the
variable with a string static type so it
is the same notation which you have to
use it in the function here so basically
you are saying that my name variable is
the string and it will be a string goes
okay so that is what this this means so
this is how you write function as well
apart from that it's all same now we
wrote Java classes we wrote Kotlin
classes in the same project cat we use
them in in the different class so I'm
going to try use the Java Java class
here if you see here uses Java is the
cour class and I'm going to create a
variable out of it okay so I can do this
directly right bar users Java equal to
users hour
I don't know if you see here you notice
here I don't know how to do a new
operator or users channel but this is a
Java class right and still I can go
ahead and use uses Java and then assign
the variables as name if you see here I
can assign stuff directly here okay
the cotton is doing something to remove
all these boilerplate and you can still
use those Java functions like how Java
has written it's even in Cortland so
this allows us to use all the libraries
which Java already has to be used in
Cortland so if you are using any
existing library like a spring utility
or Apache Commons or any utilities or
frameworks you can still use them in
Cortland but you can remove those wanna
play cold and make it clean in cotton
if you see here this is a Java class I'm
using at in Catalan is a quarter in fact
this is a Java class I'm still using it
the way how I write in Kotlin okay same
way I can use a Courtland Courtland
class if you see here this users I'm
going to say users new users equal to
new users but this is how we create in
Tao all right so still I didn't create
any constructor here ok still I'm able
to do a new users ok let's see if I'm
able to set using some Gators I begin
great indicators or settles right you
can see here I don't have any cat also
saturn's still I can do that here that
is the power of Kotlin so Kotlin is
converting these into byte codes so that
java can understand so when this main
dot java is using the byte code of users
it is able to identify that ok this is
also a byte code which is running in the
JVM so I will have all these things so
Cortland is doing lots of stuff during
compile time to create all those
boilerplate code which is required for
the JVM to do its operation so that is
why we don't have to write everything
here but still we will be able to use it
from a Java class so that is that is
another good advantage of java with
Cortland so you don't have to worry
about eliminating Java so people I saw
somewhere that people are saying Java is
dead so it's not that tau is dead you
can write hot language it's finally
going to create everything in the form
of Java and it's going to convert into a
pipe code just that it is going to make
your life simple by by making you write
less Java for or less code in the bay
Cortlandt can understand that's it so
people who are saying that ok Java is
dead ok that's what sort of pipe thing
actually but yeah that is code length
hmm so what other thing is we can try
out by out using streams right so
another thing is Kotlin supports
functional programming as well so if you
are not familiar about functional
programming this particular example
which I am going show you might be might
be like a magic or something but yeah
Java 8 support streams so you can i
trait to list or connection using
strings API and you can write
Cowen's you basically like functional
style of program so here what I'm going
to do is I'm going to create a stream of
integers so let's do that into our
frustrated I'm also just trying it out
for the first time in cotton so I'm not
sure if it will work so if it doesn't
work yester don't call me up there in
Java what do we do we create a filter so
let's say I want to filter out the value
which is divisible by two okay so I am
gonna say I'm going to write lambda
expression saying divisible by two
account equal to zero okay so what
basically I did is I'm going to stream
this particular objects I am going to I
trait this one by one and read each
object and then see if it is divisible
by two okay if it is divisible by two
and the remainder of 0 that means it is
things we like to or young or even
better tomorrow is zero right so that's
all I'll go here if it is divisible I'm
just saying that okay print that for me
what I do is I will say okay yes I can
convert into a method reference right so
if I run this particular Java program
let me remove the null checks here right
so that I don't have any knowledge
checks anymore now is not for exceptions
thinking okay I'm just running this
child program okay if you see here it
has printed only two and four basically
our function work a tough work so so
what we are doing here is we are just
filtering these stream of objects to
identify the objects which are divisible
by two and if you see here this is how
you write streams in Java eight right
let's write that in Scotland so I have
created a stream so I should be having
filter so it has a filter now how do we
write this predicate right you don't
have to do a new so you can directly do
this
you can write lambda expressions this
way to equal equal to zero right and
then I say for which and then I say oh
come on Val you okay I don't know how to
use metal references here but maybe I
think I can do this should be this way
so we don't have to tell the system that
out because that is not requiring Kotlin
so if you see here the equivalent code
for this is written here and the equal
to this is almost the same thing right
so but if you are using a complex or
function or something then you fill out
these into a function that might make
sense but yeah it looks almost similar
so the so Kotlin can do functional
programming let's see I don't know let
me run this so looks like there is no
compilation error that's what I see here
in Kotlin so let's see if it works if it
works
that means Kotlin supports functional
programming style as strengths so yeah
it works so this is from continent so
cutland supports functional programming
style as well java by default supports
functional programming so looks like we
can do everything whatever we do in Java
just that you have to write less code in
Kotlin compared to what widget in Java
so these are the initial impressions of
Cortlandt so I just started a checking
of octane only today I just got
interested because people are saying
it's very simple and easy to use looks
like it is very simple and easy to use
if you feel otherwise let me know in the
comment section below so I'll try to
help you make understand quatrain later
if you're new to Java as well I'll tell
you some easier ways to make you
understand Cortlandt better so if you
are coming from a different background
you want to move over Java base to
cherian based framework let me know I
can help you in doing some more videos
or something which will help you make
you understand content better but yeah
looks like cotton is cool so
let me try out using cotton in my
day-to-day life
I will try out a better where I can and
looks like spring is also supporting
cotton by creating promote application
right so let's let's see I had that
cotton using sling board in our next
video but that's it for this particular
video maybe one let me check if anybody
has any comment or something for me
so that I can respond to them let me
give me one moment and just going
through my mobile if there is any like
child response okay nothing yet
but yes that's what I wanted to cover in
this particular video I hope you got a
clean understanding of water Scotland
and how is it different from Java so
these are the basic things which we need
to know before starting cotton so do you
think cotton is better and did Android
take a wise decision in using Kotlin in
developing android application let me
know in the comment section below they
can take that forward meet you again in
the next section next video so do like
subscribe and comment if you have any
queries meet again in the next video
