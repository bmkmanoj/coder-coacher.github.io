and never miss any update from tech
primers welcome to tech primers in this
video we are going to compare and
contrast the different in-memory data
grids and the memory caches which are
there in the industry so you would have
seen me making videos on geode or gem
fire hazel cast and where it is so now
in this particular video we are going to
see what each differs in and what they
have in common right let's get started
so basically right right from the start
right right from the concept we are
going to see what are the different
differences first so in this particular
slide we are going to see the
differences across these three caches
and in the next slide we are going to
see what are the commonalities between
all these three right so basically the
concept of geode as you know is a
distributed data container it has pooled
memory okay it has CPU utilization the
network resources
all these are calculated and these are
shared across multiple processes okay
however in hazel cos hazel caste is Java
in memory data grid so all these are
interconnected in the form of different
processes or they are in the form of a
grid okay in R it is read this is a
in-memory data structure store used as a
database cache or messaging broker so
this is the different use cases or the
basically the concepts of these three
caches right so what are the AP axis
used by these caches so gem fire uses
Java client API or it has memcache tapu
protocol or it can use the rest so we
can use different types of these
accesses the API accesses basically so
hazel caste has the same as the M fire
along with that it has a J cache support
however reduce has a specific type of
protocol which is called the Redis
serialization protocol RESP okay so you
have lots of libraries built around
Redis
people have built like the client
libraries using the rest so that you
don't have to write the rest yourself
you can just use a greatest library like
for example spring has a radius library
you can use that to retrieve the data or
population sub scribe and stuff like
that so the next one is the supported
languages so gm5 supports dotnet and all
the JVM based languages and also
additionally it supports C++ hazel cos
doesn't support all the jvm languages
however it can support dotnet c-sharp
C++ obviously Java closure
JavaScript Python and Scala so it
doesn't support the Kotlin or groovy yet
reducing on the other hand supports lots
of languages because it is implemented
in C language so it can support all the
C languages and also the predecessors of
C language small talk TCL if you see
here the list goes on so it can even
support Objective C so that is why lots
of people use their it is because it can
support lots of languages however gem
fire and hazel cast out they are in the
JVM most of the TVM site that's why very
less application use those so if you see
a ruby or Perl or PHP application they
can also use Redis right
the next one is a MapReduce MapReduce is
support only by hazel cast Rarity's
doesn't support that the next one is
consistency so in terms of consistency
it is eventual in terms of gem fire and
Redis however hazel cast supports
immediate consistency server-side script
there is no server-side script support
for reticent hazel cast it can be used
only in gem fire ok so let's go to the
commonalities between all these
frameworks so these are the
commonalities in general right so the
implementation for the gem fire is in
Java
hazel curse is also implemented in Java
however it is is implemented in the C
language that is where it is extremely
fast than other two but Redis is not
sure not a cash
it is the key value store and it is used
as the databases so as we saw in the
previous one it cannot be used as a
cache as such but you can use it for
key-value store database or for using as
a message broker the server-side gem
fire and haze in cars they both run on
the JPM so any JVM server can be used
but for Redis you need a BSD license or
the Linux or the OS or the Windows
platform so Jim fire hazel cost and
reduce doesn't support XML it doesn't
support sequel they don't support the
secondary indexes they don't support the
foreign keys and they are not cloud
based yet so by default they are not
cloud-based but you can put them on the
cloud and then make it as a cluster or
in the form of a grid the partition
methods are all common so all these
three are using the sharding concept
concurrency durability and in memory are
the major features of all these three
has you know so they all have the same
features and when these projects started
so Jim fire was started in 2002 as a
research work
hazel caste was lost in history
initially in 2008 and Redis was launched
in 2009 the database model which all
these share are the key value store as
you know so they also the same key value
store concept with a slight modification
obviously but it is all key value store
and all these databases except trellis
support triggers registers and support
trigger so the other to support trigger
so basically addition of one data
triggers a another event and based on
that the action is performed so these
are the basic commonalities among these
three previously we saw all the
differences so now based on these
differences on the commonalities you can
now decide which one to choose
that's what I wanted to cover in this
particular video hope you guys
understood about the differences and the
commonalities between these three may
taken in the next video until then thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
