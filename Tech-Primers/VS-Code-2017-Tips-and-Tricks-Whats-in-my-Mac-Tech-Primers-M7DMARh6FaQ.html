day-to-day activity this particular
video might be helpful for you to
identify what are the different tips and
tricks which are there in the BS code
which you can leverage when you are
using the IDE if let's say you are not
using the BS code take a look at these
tips and tricks and see if it makes
sense and if we can use this particular
IDE for any of your web development or
any of your development activity let's
get started
press the bell icon on the YouTube app
and never miss any update from tech
primers
Visual Studio code is an IDE which is
created by Microsoft with the vision of
open-source and mine yes you read it
right it's open source so this
particular IDE is completely open-source
and it is not the Microsoft Visual
Studio which we use to use but this is a
completely revamped open source
Microsoft Visual Studio code that is why
it is called the BS code or the Visual
Studio code okay in my previous videos
you would have seen some mentions about
the Visual Studio code where you can use
Visual Studio code in this particular
video I'm going to use a small Java
project and I'm going to show you some
tips and tricks we can use across this
particular which you will studio code as
I start the first and the foremost thing
what we do is we search for files right
when you open an IDE so I have a Java
project which I have opened in this
particular ID and if you see here this
is Visual Studio code right the if you
see I just minimize it and show you guys
so this is how the ID looks like there
is nothing like there is nothing
literally isn't it I just maximize it
again
just to be sure with the distraction
mode right if you notice here there is
nothing else lots of things are based on
config files and shortcuts right let's
say I want to search for a file I need
to do the command P option right you
know to search for files so for example
here I have a file called search query
builder right I can just search like how
I do for any other ID and then I can
just open it once I open the file if you
notice here this particular ID
identified that okay this is a Java file
okay
and it is showing you some
recommendations of different plugins
which you can use for this file so
basically these are called extensions so
everything is based on extension so what
Microsoft did is they created the
framework called the baseline of the ID
and they asked developers to create
extensions over it so if you want to do
something you can create extensions and
you can use those extensions so for
example by default this is using the
extension called
the language support right the language
support for Java so this also is an
extension which is created by visual
studio a studio and they have integrated
with the ID itself so I install this
particular extension that is why you are
able to see that okay this is a Java
file and I am able to regain now this
particular file right so if I open the
file again let me open the file again
right so I'll just close this for
Destruction right and just close this as
well
so this is the file right this looks
like any other ID it looks like sublime
text version of an ID that is how it
looks like right there are some other
options which are here the first option
is the language support if you click on
this it identifies what type of file it
is and you can change it as well so
let's say this is not at all Java file
and if that is a C++ file you can just
go and choose that particular option so
you still have the option to select the
language mode based on your wish yet so
on you see the different support for
different languages so you see that
right almost every language is supported
in this particular ID the major support
for this is typescript and the
JavaScript because it's extremely good
when you write typescript and JavaScript
code but I'm going to show you some Java
code because one of the viewer had
requested to show me how to create the
getters and setters right so what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to write a
gator just I'm just going to write a
caterer and say so what I'm going to do
is I'm just going to use the
intelligence inside the BS code and show
how easy it is for you to create some
getters and setters right so I'm just
creating a variable here you know to
create some getters and setters in
IntelliJ or eclipse what we use to do is
we used to create a is to click a
shortcut and that used to show what type
of code you want to generate however you
don't have to do anything in vs code you
just say get name right this is going to
suggest you a particular option so if
you see here this is the intelligence
with BS code is suggesting and if I
select that option it is going to create
me Gator for me
same way for the sitter if I just say
set and it is going to show me the safe
name alright and you can modify this
comment or you can even remove this
comment but yeah this is how you can
auto generate the code inside PS code
okay so this is one way of automating or
regenerating code or generating code
from intelli from the vs code right so
IntelliJ has a different option or a
different way of doing it vs code has
its own way of doing stuff so everything
is integrated inside the intelligence
itself right not only for the Java you
have lots of stuff for JavaScript as
well right now I don't think I have a
JavaScript file but yeah I can show that
if you need alright and if you notice
here this is just the this is just the
git project so it is a great project so
it shows up the gate options for me
right there is something called feedback
right so there is this smiley in the
right corner the right-hand corner where
you can give feedback directly to the
team this is developing this particular
ID and you can even tweet that so this
is a good way of getting their feedback
and you can even create a request for
adding new features so for example if
you want to have some specific feature
which you want to add to visual studio
code you can request that from this
particular window right and also you if
there is a bug you can report that as
well so this internally creates a bug
JIRA or feature JIRA based on the type
of request right so that is another
option so let's come to some shortcuts
right so this one so the main shortcut
which we will be using most of the time
is command shift e right so this is
going to be the shortcut with which you
can search anything inside the ID so
this is similar to the double shift or
the double shift option inside IntelliJ
here you can double shift out the
control shift a I think they're right so
here you use the command shift and P
where you can search for anything let's
say I want to go to
settings window I can I just say
settings and I just say open the
workspace settings the other thing which
you notice that there is no additional
window open here everything is inside an
editor so it's all just the editor if
you see here this is nothing but a
workspace setting it doesn't even suit
looks like a settings window right yes
it is not a settings window it is all
driven based on JSON files so the whole
idea is settings is all based on JSON
file so if you want to override
something you can just overwrite that
particular feature here so if you want
to override the file dot autosave option
you just say Auto same as on right I
want to let's say enable the autosave I
can do that here this is the one which
is in the right side is the overwritten
files the one which is in the left side
is the file which which is there by
default so not only that any other
option so it's if you start typing it
the intelligence inside the base code
will such as to what type of config you
need to all right so if you see here I
just typed EDI it is going to suggest me
all the list of properties which are
having EDI as a start right so that is
pretty good the intelligence is pretty
nice right so that is one way of saving
options so let's say I want to open a
file I used I need the command P option
where I can just open the file which I
showed previously so let's say I open
another file now I want to see another
file and I want to split this particular
window right so there is this option
where you can do that so you can search
for another file and that gets loaded
there right so you can have two files
you can compare these two files in
parallel right so that is this
particular option okay
apart from that there is an option for
us to see the terminal so terminal
integration inside an IDE is the latest
thing right if you see IntelliJ
intelligible so has the terminal
embedded inside the IDE
because you don't have to get distracted
when you want to run some manual
commands or when you want to run some
commands from near command prompt right
so that is why these IDs are coming up
with these terminal options where you
can integrate your terminal inside your
ID itself so the shortcut for that is
command tilde right so when I click on
that you get a terminal here so this is
nothing but the normal terminal which we
use right so you see that okay this is
nothing but the terminal where my
project is there so this is the project
so nothing else I can just do all the
commands I do right so I can do just
maven clean install I can just start
running commands here so if you are
using any node.js projects you can do
that or if you want to do any manual
step you can do that from this terminal
the shortcut for that is control and
then the tilde symbol right the one of
the major major advantages of the Visual
Studio code is the extension so anything
which is missing inside the ID will be
the extension right so if you want to
change the color of the ID you can go on
in some extension so there are lots of
extensions if you want to say let's say
add some plugins for koo kumba you can
do that you want to say add plugins for
the node modules you can add that so for
example let's say I say theme I say
theme and I click on the search option I
just hit the enter button this is going
to return me a bunch of themes see these
are the different themes so for example
material lichen theme the art of my camp
team so these are different themes which
are the plugins which you can use for
the installation and usage right so
whatever you want you can install or you
can even customize so even inside the
theme you can there are some themes
which are customizable you can use them
and then you can customize like how we
customize the settings right we just had
the properties enabled we switch it off
and switch it on you can do the same
with any particular theme right and if
you don't know anything always go to
command shift B right this is where you
go and type anything you want you can do
it the recent one shows up in the top
and you can type whatever you want so
let's say you want to see the history
you want to see the history you can just
say open previous lter from history so
this shows the last file which we opened
all right so you want to see I want to
remove this particular file you can do
that right same way I will show you some
other options so that is something
called Zen mode okay so Zen mode is
nothing but the destruction free mode so
in IntelliJ we do have this so here it
is called Zen mode so you just say Zen
mode and then all these additional
windows the gate windows the gate status
bar everything vanish away well it's
just away okay so if you want to get
back to the original window you just hit
the same shortcut command shift + P and
then you say views in mode it just goes
out of the cell mode right so that is
nothing but a presentation mode or a
distraction free more where you can use
it when you are extensively concentrated
on only typing and you don't want to get
distracted with the different options
which are there outside right so that is
one more shortcut or the tip right which
you can use the version control option
shows the different version controls
like similar to how we have in IntelliJ
right you can see what are the different
files which got deleted or added or
something like that
right just close this so the other
feature of vs code is there are
something called tasks so you can have
tasks runner so what we can do is you
can just hit the same command shift P
right and you say task right when you
click on task you have different options
of running the task or configuring a
task
so for example if I want to configure a
task I can create a task so it creates
something called tasks not Jason and you
can decide what type of task you want to
run see this is like a once I hit the
configure task option it asked me
whether I want the Tesla Jason to be
created I said yes and then now it's
asking me what type of build it is
whether it is a Microsoft build or it's
a torrent Korbel or is there any other
additional rate so I'm going to say
maven build if I click on the maven it
automatically identifies what type of
maven will I need and then you
automatically create that these tasks so
if you see here it has created the task
called verify and inside the verify the
command for the verify is name and - be
verify and the next one is the test the
the next task is test so it runs the
maven test right so if I go to the same
option right so if I say just task right
I'll just say task space
what is he test yeah I run the tester so
this is going to run the test us so this
will run the test so if you notice here
the task which is configured as test
gets triggered okay same way if you want
to run the very fat ask you can do that
as well that I can hit the task verify
I just need to say run task right and
when I say the run task you see there
are different options do you test and
the verify if I say verify this is going
to trigger the verifies verified task
that if I task right whichever we
created and you can create a bunch of
these tasks for different tasks runner
like you want to run for NPM you want to
run for typescript or Java or anything
else or the.net framework s' etc or even
the batch files you can do that
so you just how to create a task tour
Jason and then you embed the different
type of script you want to run this is
basically just a configuration of your
command which you are going to run to a
specific task name and you can just run
the particular task directly so
internally the vs code will take care of
running that with this particular Jason
fine right the other option is just the
search you can just do the normal search
you can a search for files you just
search for plugin you can do that here
right so this is going to search across
the e files so for example I just
searched for build and it is just
searching across files and give me the
result right so there are lots of
features I am I won't be able to show
you every feature but everything is all
is all inside the extension so the major
power of BS code is all extensions you
think of feature it will be in the
extension if it is not there you can
obviously request the Visual Studio
community so they will be able to add
that for you depending on the priority
which they have but most probably most
of them are there in the extension
because these extensions are created by
people and verified by BS code so don't
hesitate to just search for a particular
feature there first and then the cost
forth okay there are lots of plugins
here see it's not like your windows
mobile right don't think it has a
Windows Mobile where you don't have any
apps you don't have any flexibility for
developers but since this is the open
source ID lots of people have developed
lots of plugins and they are pretty good
so believe me it is all great so you can
have talked you have dock of files you
have Cloud Foundry file you have NP
you have like the validations for the
JavaScript the Lintz etc right so you
can try this out if you are using
JavaScript or the angular extensively
and you don't have an ultimate edition
of IntelliJ you can definitely use
Visual Studio code because it is
equivalent to the ultimate edition of
IntelliJ which is not exactly replacing
intelligent but it provides pretty good
features and you can use it as your
crazy driver
great I hope you guys found it
interesting if you are using Visual
Studio code I hope you found something
new if you are not using in zero to do
code I I hope you found something
interesting and you can start off by
checking Visual Studio code if you are
interested right do share this
particular video if you feel that this
is useful for somebody else if you like
the video go ahead and like it if you
haven't subscribed to the channel go
ahead and subscribe to it meet you again
