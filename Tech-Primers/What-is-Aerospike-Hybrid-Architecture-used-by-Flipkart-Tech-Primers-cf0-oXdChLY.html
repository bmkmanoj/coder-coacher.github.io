guess that you already know what is an
in-memory database and what is the no
sequel today let's see what is arrow
spine and how's it combining in memory
and the merciful concept and making it a
faster database and engineers and let's
see how clip card our wiped up card is
using aerospike let's get started
press the bell icon on the YouTube app
and never miss any update from tech
primers aerospike database is a
extremely fast key value data stone or a
distributed hash table or Oracle and no
sequel database however it also provides
the features of in the mini database so
it's called an in-memory open source
most equal database so why is it called
like that it has the support for hybrid
architecture so hybrid architecture is
nothing but you have a flash memory so
you have the flash drive the insisting
solid-state drives and also the D ramps
the normal heart rates so when you have
aerospike installed in your clusters
which are having SD that's right the
rights are completely faster so it is on
like almost five to ten times faster
than the normal DDR ramps so this makes
the software faster then a very faster
since it is already in memory it is
completely faster and also it is written
in C language so that is another thing
there is no layer so it has three layers
however aerospike that that forms the
arrows fights architecture right so you
have a data layer which is nothing but
the client layer so which is the last
layer the next one is the distribution
layer and finally the storage layer
storage layer is where the hybrid stuff
comes into picture distributed layer is
when there is a distributed cluster
configuration and you get the data
replicate consistently across these
distributor regions the client layer is
the one which takes care of managing
which known to be redirected to based on
the records coming from the different
users so because of different term
layers inside aerospike apart from that
I mean if you know who's using
aerospike is in mobile users you have
heard about in mobile in mobile users
there are lots of other forms which are
you
aerospike the major one is the flip car
so if you had in India you might
probably know what is flip car flip card
is an equal in for Amazon in India so
they are using aerospike for storing
their data that is why they are UI is
faster so let's see let's explore some
of the key features right of the
aerospike database so let's go to the
architecture page and see what is there
so these are the different layers which
I mentioned the client layer the cluster
name of a storage layer the cluster name
was the distributed layer the client
there is barely a be eyes or the
applications are written so if you'll
notice here these are the different
applications you can write in any
language and you have the aerospike
cluster okay so this is the client layer
so the client layer is where all the
data is pushed or the Ecostar solution
to write the cluster layers is where the
modes are managed for maintaining the
consistency of data across nodes
the final one is the storage layer where
the flash space and the islands are
handled in a efficient way right so that
is what this lastly finally querying
wedding is just the last part quitting
the data from these across these three
lines so this is how it looks right so
why do we need aerospike light already
there are too many no sequel databases
there is more qotb there is Cassandra
there is latest Redis is not no sequel
database but it's a key value store so
like like that there are lots of a
memory databases as well right so like
no sequel database there are lots of
intimate areas like hazel caste or
Apache geo in my media records right so
what is aerospike doing how is it
different from these two right these two
concepts so aerospike know just the
concept of in memory and the no sequel
database so how does it fail when you
have the power of no sequel database in
a main memory database so if you know h2
is an in-memory database it is obviously
faster than a relational database
example
Sybase or db2 how is it faster because
it's all in memory
same way to match
most equal database is already faster
and how is it going to fail if it is the
in moment database right so that is what
aerospike is so let's see what aerospike
says as a features or something
different from the other most equal or
the in-memory databases right the first
one is the predictable performance so
there are test run over the aerospike
database and they have Pro that they
have consistent performance with 1
million transactions per second so which
is humongous I've never seen a system
claiming that they can process 1 million
transactions per second right the next
one is a high availability and uptime
right so this is provided by any no
sequel database so there is high
availability in aerospike as well the
next one is a lower total cost of
ownership so aerospike has improved its
performance with our own 20% of the cost
of ownership which is which is what they
claim compared to a traditional or in
relational database like Sybase on tv2
or oracle so you will save 20% of the
cost which you are going to incur the
aerospike right the next one is
disappear scalability so you will be
able to easily add new nodes to the
cluster inside aerospike so that is what
so be it scalability is the next in the
major one is the hyper hybrid memory
architecture so this is what I mentioned
earlier as well the flash memory versus
the data the flash writes are completely
writes in the reads are completely
faster if you have used the SSD runs
inside your Linux machine or a Windows
or a Mac right you had probably known
that SSDs are costlier and the speed is
extremely fast and aerospike supports
the SSD and idea so it is going to
provide you five times more performance
than the traditional data which is
running in a despite cluster the next
one is the real-time engine so aerospike
can be used for real-time data attention
like whether this key value store so it
can provide both real-time and the
analytics data aspect so if you have
pledged amount of data you want to store
it somewhere and then you want to do
some analytics over that you can still
use aerospike for that
the next one is the dynamic clustering
so this is where the data is distributed
across the clusters which are inside the
aerospike so you have you have a cluster
and you have different nodes the data or
the records are distributed across the
sorry not that of course the data is
distributed across these clusters so
they're across these nodes inside the
cluster so basically your data is
replicated in every node in the cluster
so that is what element cluster cluster
management means smart client is the
load balancing of the data requests
which are coming from decline so you
let's say there are thousand requests
coming in if there are thousand nodes in
the cluster the right put request is on
split to each mode based on the load if
it is able to process okay so smart
client is nothing but the load balancing
concept the next one is a flexible data
model so the data model is structured in
the aerospike database however it is
schema-less
so you don't have to define a schema
unlike Castlerock if you want to have a
structured data layer you want to have
the data model having unstructured data
Cassandra doesn't share them however
aerospike has support for scheme honest
data right so that is why the data is
get simple the data model is flexible
next one is the geographical replication
so the distribution layer takes care of
this replication across the Geographics
so that is what it means enterprise
readiness aerospike has been in the
industry and has been used by different
enterprises for the past five years and
all right so that is what elastics right
so if you that is it I think about the
product assets but I will tell you one
good thing the there are particular
documentation on how to use aerospike
just take a look at it I'm also going to
download the aerospike database and I'm
going to try it locally let's see how it
fails but I just saw some of the
documentation they have pretty good so
if you are using a Windows on the next
version you can directly download it
from here I am going to download the Mac
OS virtual version but I'm not sure if
how much memory does
it was my dig in my laptop which I'm not
sure about that but still and go ahead
and try it out
the other part is the documentation
which I mentioned the examples which are
they're here at a code so there is an
example here if you see there is an
intimate web application that was step
by step application there is a play
framework with Scala and Java mo J is
this Java there are so many examples
here right the first one being the
end-to-end one which uses aerospike
Express database angularjs etc which are
pretty insane application so you can
have an intimate field of how does the
aerospike database feels like when you
use it with a time to log ey so take a
look at this particular locator project
I am not sure if I'll be able to set
this up but if aerospike is running in
my Mac OSX Mac OS so I'll be able to get
some example and then I'll be able to
show you some demo of how we can use
aerospike and I also saw someone has
created a spring board wrapper around
the shrimp or project for project or
library basically for aerospike spring
food hasn't officially created anything
but I think aerospike has created a
spring board version for using it ins
inside spring boot but let's see
and we trying that in the next week but
you can also give it a try and let me
know how does it favor so if you are
here for the first time in the channel
do like it do share subscribe for more
videos about similar concepts on no
sequel spring boon etc DevOps etc that's
it for this particular video guys hope
you liked it wait again in the next
video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
