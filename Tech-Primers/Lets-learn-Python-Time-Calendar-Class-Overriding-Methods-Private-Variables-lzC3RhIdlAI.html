install Python how to create a basic
hello world program how our variables
used
how can strings be used and how
collections or lists can be used and how
if-else statements can be created in
Python while and for loops dictionaries
and cue 'pls in this video we are going
to see time calendar modules how to
create functions how to create classes
how to overload methods and private
variables inside Python
there's the bell icon on the YouTube app
and never miss any update from tech
primers let's start off with using the
time on the calendar modules I'll create
a new class called example three in
order to import the time module into
this particular class we need to use the
import command like any other language
this import is going to bring in the
time functions into this particular file
so we can access the time specific
modules using the time variable like how
we imported we can do a time dot and
then do some stuff so there are lots of
suggestions provided by IntelliJ IDEA
fault if you are using intelligent
intelligent as very good support for
Python so you can notice it by default
shows of what are the different
functions which are available in the
time module I'm going to use the time
dot time and let's do a print and let me
run this program so time dot time will
print the current time in float so this
is nothing but the time calculated from
the epoch time in terms of ticks so the
number of seconds which have occurred
after the 1970 time January 1st 1970
that is the basis for the epoch time
calendar from that time how many seconds
how got passed until this moment so that
is the number of count here so in order
to make it in a more readable format we
can use the time dot local time and we
need to pass the seconds here so in
order to get the seconds we need to do
the same time dot time and let's run
this so we got the seconds using the
time dot time and we are passing those
seconds to the local time if you notice
we are getting a structured time which
has different variables and we need to
extract the variables out of it however
if we want a much simpler version we can
do time dot a
see time which needs another tuple which
will be time dot local time again time
dot time so this will print us the time
in a much readable format like how we
used to see in Java or C or C++ or even
JavaScript so it shows Saturday February
3rd 11:40 a.m. and 2018 so these are the
different functions which are available
inside time the next one is the calendar
in order to use calendar we can use the
same import statement to include the
calendar library IntelliJ has the
intelligence to show us what are all the
different libraries which are there
which are starting with C al right so
you can notice the calendar library is
present in my Python installation folder
so what does calendar provider so
calendar provide different methods like
asleep if you want to identify whether a
year is a leap year or not let's check
if 2018 is a leap year it is not right
and if you put 2016 it should return
true so these are some methods which are
available out of the box for us so that
we can directly use it from the calendar
module so some some more
functions inside calendar could be leap
days so it shows how many leap leap
years we're within a year range let's
say from 2000 to 2016 how many leap
years were there so this leap days will
calculate how many leap years we're
present between these two years similar
to that we have calendar dot month which
can give you the current month's
calendar so let's say 2018 and the month
is - it's February right and let's do a
print okay until a short cut not work I
think calendar what month
by default had a printable method that's
why friend did not work okay
so you can see the calendar of February
2018 that's what we have mentioned here
so those can be used whenever you want
to use the date and time functions you
can use lots of methods inside calendar
calendar also even has the de year and
lots of other methods are available you
can just check that in IntelliJ or even
check the Python documentation the next
one is functions how do we create
functions so in order to mention a
function we need to define the keyboard
d EF this will tell the Python
interpreter that my data type can be
anything so d EF generally denotes
anything let's try creating a function
called function and there is no curly
braces as such in Python it all works on
the colon so if I define a function like
this I haven't mentioned any argument
let me define an argument it's a Arg and
I need to use the tab space so to define
that the function scope is started I'm
just going
do a print off arc or it's a inside
function I'll just say R and how do we
call these functions the functions can
be directly called as this let's say I
pauses just pause hello YouTube
let me run it you can see the function
has been called with integer and even
with string so that is the advantage of
the data types in Python you don't have
to define a data type and you can have
different return types as well if let's
say I want to return a value let's say I
want to return success message I can do
that and how will I get it printed I
need to do I need to do a print if I do
a print this is going to return me
success see that the return type has
come here and we are able to print it
there is one more way of calling
functions we can have multiple arguments
let's create one more function calculate
it as two and I will just say argument
one an argument to I'll even rename this
argument 1 comma argument 2 we can do
argument to e we can do argument to
equals hey and
and one equals they say howdy see that
argument won an argument - we're
currently correctly printed even though
we had passed it in a different sequence
the only thing is we are using the key
to denote that this is the value for
this particular key python has this new
functionality where you can interchange
the arguments however if you have the
key mentioned it the interpreter will
identify and map the values to the
corresponding keys so this is how you
can use functions in Python so there
there are lambda functions as well you
can use lambdas in Python as well so
let's see how to create that in order to
use the lambda functions we have to
define the function with the keyword
lambda let's create the third function
we need to assign these lambda functions
to a function variable so I'll create a
lambda I just say lambda and we need to
pass two arguments it is passing
argument 1 and argument 2 and similar to
how we open the curly brace or how we
open the scope for a function we can use
colon to open this Co for the lambda
function and we can just say print
inside lambda function and I'll just
print argument 1 an argument - that's it
so this is how you can define a lambda
function the lambda functions will be
useful when you have function within a
function and you want to do complex
operations and you want to change the
functionality based on some
implementation that's when it is very
useful but in our case I don't think I
will be able to show you the exact usage
but I will just show you how you can
pass it so I'll just pass argument 1 as
this and just say hello YouTube from
lambda and let's
this can see here the lambda function
cave hello YouTube from lambda so this
is exactly similar to the function
however you don't know that it is lambda
or not but when you use a function
within a function that's when you can
pass the implementation directly so you
can even pass a lambda here and then you
can pass it to another function so we
can see that complex case in the coming
videos but for now just know that
lambdas can be used inside functions in
Python the next up is classes how do we
create classes in Python like how we
created the lambdas classes also have a
key word it's called class and we need
to define a name to a class let's take
our usual example the user similar to
how we open the curly brace in any other
language we need to use the colon for
opening the scope for this particular
class and we can define our variables so
I will just define the name for that
user as Peter by default and I'll just
use the age as 34 how do we define
constructor so we can define
constructors by using underscore
underscore in how do we define
constructors in the class in Python we
can use the underscore underscore in it
this is the constructor definition in
Python so any class if we create a class
the constructors can be created using
the underscore underscore init
underscore underscore and self so self
is nothing but the object the current
object is given to the constructor as
well and we can do let's say self dot
creation of assignment of name we can do
here as well let's say I i want to
override those names
let me try overriding them right I can
do this and I'll try
more function so we saw how to create
function right we need to do a diff and
then we can write a function I'll just
create a print function so whenever you
create a function inside a class we need
to have the first variable as the self
which will be the instance or the access
to the current object so this is similar
to B this operator in Java you can think
of self as it this operator in Java I'm
just going to do a print the basic print
saying printing values or printing user
I'll just print the self dot name and
self dot age so we have created a class
we have created a constructor we have
greater deferent method which will just
print these values which we have created
as a part of the object creation I'm now
going to use this class I'm going to
create a new object of that class let's
say user equal to there is no new
keyword which we can use we can directly
do a user off and we didn't pass any
argument so we don't have to pass
anything by default self is injected by
the interpreter so we don't have to pass
that so the current instance is provided
to the constructor for identifying
whether the constructor has loaded or
not let's add a log here and let's print
this user and I will just add a print
statement
we construct our got loaded before the
Sam and the age that if I got printer
notice here we have overhead and Peter
and Peter's value if I remove this
particular piece of code or if let's say
I command it out see the Peters name is
still retained you can overwrite stuff
in the constructor if you want to
provide a argument constructor we can
provide a argument constructor name age
and let's assign the name here and we
can assign the age here so when we
create a user we can provide the name
and age I'm going to provide Ryan with
age 45 now we should be able to print
Ryan's age because we have overridden
the Peters H using the constructor so
this is how we can create a constructor
so there should be a destructor as well
right which needs to clean up this data
there is a destructor and we can even
override that destructor in python so de
l self this is going to be a destructor
so we can define underscore underscore
de l underscore underscore that is going
to be the definition for the destructor
we can just do a print and say
destroying object when the Syst
destructor get called whenever we do a
delete of this particular object in
memory this would be called i'm manually
deleting this particular object if there
is a garbage collection which is
happening in python and if your object
is not getting used and python
interpreter
identifies that okay this particular
object is not used at all then the
destructor will be called however you
can manually delete it using the de l
and the object statement see that the
destroying object has been printed if I
don't call this if I don't call this
even though I man
called it is getting called because the
object gets garbage collected after its
usage so we saw water glasses let's see
how to create a parent and child
relationship in the class and how do we
override methods we have created a user
I'm going to create a employee the
keyboard is class employee is the class
which we are going to create because
employee can be an user in order to say
that this particular class is a child of
a particular parent class we can use the
open places and we can just say I am a
child of user class and we need to start
the scope here I'm going to have a
variable called employee ID and I'll
just sign it as one two three as a
default value we can do the same stuff
here we can add a constructor I just add
a constructor and I'll also pass the
employee number here so that we can
override it I'll just say self-taught
employee ID equal to employee ID we need
also the destructor we'll just add a
destructor so that we can add some print
statement destroying employee object we
need a print statement as well of this
particular object let's do a print of
overridden methods overridden method and
then let's print the self dot employee
ID see that we have overridden the
method called print inside the employee
class so when we create an instance of
the employee class this particular
method should be called and if you see
IntelliJ automatically identified that
this particular method is overriding
however let's see from the pythons
interrupts interpreters perspective how
we are able to do that
I'll just pass the employee IDs four
five six and employee dot Brenda
so the overridden method is four five
six and the destroying object has been
called as well so this is how you can
override methods in Python you don't
have to define anything you just
directly define the method and just
start writing it now how do i define the
scope of a particular variable we have
lots of variables which are used here
and if you see I can directly access the
user dot name here I can directly do a
print of user Rodney same way with the
user dot H and with the employee dot
employee ID we can directly do this so
how do we control it
I think user has been deleted let me
really do remove this so see that we are
able to see Ryan fortify and 456 getting
printed as a part of this after this the
destroying object is getting called so
as I said earlier I was mentioning that
the if the object is not used that's
when it will be cleaned up and though we
did not use it immediately we use it
after a while
Python knew that this particular object
is getting used later and then it
destroyed only after printing these
values here
so how do we control accessing the
variables inside a class we need to mark
them as private isn't it so how do we
mark them as private we can mark them as
private using this underscore underscore
option if we mark a variable as
underscore underscore this particular
object turns into a private variable we
need to modify the variable names here
as well wherever we have the variable
name mentioned we need to modify in
every other place if we are not doing
this this will be treated as a new
object if let's say I did not do this
right if I assign a new variable called
new name even this will be created let's
try printing that right see that right
IntelliJ identified that there is a new
name variable so this gets printed now
the Python interpreter should throw an
error because we don't have a access or
we don't have a variable called name
because we have renamed it as underscore
underscore name isn't it let's try
running it and see that there is an
error saying user has no attribute name
and let's try accessing underscore
underscore name and if you notice
IntelliJ is not even prompting for it
which basically means there is no access
as well and the same error pops up even
though we had the variable there the
same error pops up and let's check that
new name because we created that new
name directly from the self and we did
not create it initially let's see what
would be this Co for that see that there
is no error and you can see the name
getting printed which is the new name
this is the new name here
but printed without any error so this is
a dangerous thing because if you name a
variable incorrectly then you are going
to face problems in Python because it
will create objects on the fly it has
directly created this new name on the
fly without even it being defined in the
class so we should be very careful while
creating objects as well so the naming
conventions are very important if we
need to have a private method or a
private variable we need to make it as
underscore underscore name we say what
are the different functions which are
available with the time module and the
calendar calendar module we also saw how
to create functions how we can create
lambda functions how are functions used
in Python we also saw how to create
classes how to create variables how to
assign variables how to create
constructors how to use the destructors
and we also saw how to overload the
methods when we have a child class and
how to use the parent class and Link it
and make it as a overridden method and
also we saw how to create private
variables I hope you guys got something
out of this particular video in the next
session we will just proceed further in
using some frameworks because most of
the stuffs are covered here these are
the different basic stuff which we need
to know in order to do coding in a
particular language in the next video
let's try and use a latest framework
which is there in Python which is used
widely
until then meet you again in the next
video thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
