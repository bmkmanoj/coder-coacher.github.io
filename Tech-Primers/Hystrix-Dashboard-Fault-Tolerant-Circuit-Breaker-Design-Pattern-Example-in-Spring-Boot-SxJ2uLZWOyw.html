which prevents your code from failing
have you seen a code which doesn't
return any exception but it does some
fallback operation in this video we are
going to see how to use hystrix
and implement the circuit breaker design
pattern and how we can use hystrix
dashboard to see what is happening or
monitoring your application internally
press the bell liken on the YouTube app
and never miss any update from tech
primers
hystrix is a library created by Netflix
it was created with the purpose of
solving the fault tolerance
in a distributed system how Netflix uses
hysteresis they use hystrix as a library
in order to handle failures and do some
fall backs when there is a failure at a
high level just understand that history
is some fault tolerant fair work similar
to how we have a catch block in a
try-catch exception block so inside the
catch block we catch some exceptions or
unknown errors and then we do something
with that particular exception right
similar to that hiss takes as a fallback
mechanism with which you can do some
fall backs additionally you can
configure these fall backs by using the
circuit breaker design pattern circuit
breaker design pattern is something
similar to how a secured works in your
electrical board if you are familiar
with the electrical circuit board you
have different states like open closed
and half open let's take a typical
example of switching on an electric Cube
light if you have your circuit open then
the current doesn't pass through the
circuit and your light is always
switched off so this is the state where
the circuit is open which basically
means something has broken if the
circuit is closed that's when your
electricity will pass through the
circuit and the light is going to glow
so typically in a successful scenario
the circuit is going to be closed so
always the circuit is going to be closed
initially and it is going to get open
when there is a failure so when there is
a failure the circuit will be opened and
we can see that from the hystrix
dashboard so how the circuits are closed
or how many circuits are closed what are
the different circuits which are closed
or which other circuits which are open
and we can even see the statistics of
how many requests came and how many
requests are failing as well so
hystrix consolidates all these circuit
breaker design patterns and shows up in
the hysterics dashboard so when does the
circuits get open automatically and when
does the circuit gets closed
automatically you can control that using
configurations where you can configure
saying if let's say there are 100
requests coming in and if there are fire
requests which got failed open the
circuit and for the next continuous fire
request don't allow these requests to
come in by default failed if you have
noticed any high-performing websites
let's say for IRCTC website you would
have notice that if you try to refresh
or if you try to click the refresh
button again and again sometimes it
immediately fails this happens because
there is a fault tolerant or a circuit
breaker which has been implemented which
will break the circuit it will not send
you till the server it will say that my
first request failed so I'm going to
fail you for the next 5 continuous
requests until I know that the circuit
is going to be functional so the 6-3
course would be now allowed the 6th
circus might take few more seconds and
it will try if the circuit is going to
work or not if it fails again then it
will again open the circuit so this is
how circuit breaker works so let's see
that with an example let's take a fix
ecommerce website example right this is
a architecture of a small ecommerce
website where we have a mobile app and a
browser the requests are coming in from
different sources here and there are
different micro services which are
hosted here what happens when the
shipping service goes down the mobile
app will crash right that is when we
need to create a fault tolerant API
where the mobile app should not crash
instead it just returns an empty
response or it just returns an error
message to the user saying something is
going wrong and you should not crash the
UI if some services failed so this is a
typical example of how you can implement
fault-tolerant systems let's go to our
usual website start at spring dot IO and
we can create a spring boot application
which uses spring cloud hystrix
and we are going to use spring cloud
hystrix dashboard
the group I would say is calm tech
primers our usual group and I'll just
say hystrix
dashboard example the dependencies which
we would require are just spring them or
spring MVC framework then we need the
history library which is nothing but the
circuit breaker implementation from
Netflix we also need the hystrix
dashboard so that is another dependency
in order to support these history
dashboard we need to create the
actuators as well so we are going to use
the actuators actuators are nothing but
some endpoints with which you can
monitor your application monitor your
spring boot application we'll see that
why we need actuators as well so let me
generate this project
I'll just unzip it from the terminal
I'll also open it with IntelliJ
let me maximize it now if you see the
palm rot examine the
from dependencies which we have are the
actuators the spring boot web the spring
cloud hystrix and the hystrix dashboard
that's all we don't have anything else
we're just going to create a simple
hystrix implementation and we are just
going to use hystrix dashboard to view
that in order to enable hystrix you have
to add the annotation at enable hystrix
so this will enable our application to
stream hystrix data so this is going to
stream some data to the dashboard so
this is going to be a client and also we
need to enable the dashboard because we
want to see the dashboard as well right
you want to have our application
dashboard embedded into the same
application so we are going to use
dashboard ansible if let's say you have
multiple micro services you can host a
separate dashboard service and then host
only the dashboard and you can use a
tool called turbine which can merge all
these different historic streams and
then you can see it in the dashboard in
our case we are going to use the
dashboard and the hystrix implementation
in the same process so that is why we
enabled both hystrix &amp;amp; hystrix dashboard
here you can even do enable circuit
breaker that is another annotation if
you go inside the circuit breaker
annotation you will be able to either
use the hystrix implementation or
whatever circuit breakers which are
configured in the spring boot
application so in our application we are
using hystrix there are other
implementations as one which you can use
from different vendors but here we are
using hystrix from Netflix
I'll create a simple rest resource just
to show how we can implement
hystrix it I'm just going to mark it as
a rest assault rest resource and just
consider that the URL is going to be
just rest I'll also add I get mapping
I'll say hello
string hello typically what we will do
is we will do a hello world isn't it so
what happens something goes wrong here
right how can we introduce artificial
failures here I'm just going to use a
random utility I'll just use random
utils dot next boolean this is just
going to give the random integer or
random boolean value where it will
decide whether it is true or false and
I'm just going to throw an exception so
that way we are going to introduce
artificial failures in the function
so what I'm doing here is randomly I'm
just throwing an exception this is going
to introduce an artificial exception so
in case of a normal application if we
don't have a hist --ax implementation
enabled what happens is we get a failure
message right the exception shows up in
the UI so the UI response will have four
not four or whatever type of exception
it is let's say 500 internal server
exception so your rest endpoint will
return an exception back to the client
however I don't want to do that in order
to do that I'll enable hystrix in order
to mark this particular method to be
fault tolerant I can had this a notation
called hystrix come on and I can give a
fallback method fall back is nothing
below but a cache block or a failure
scenario which will be triggered if
there is any exception in this
particular method I'll just make a
fallback hello
fall back hello and we can give a
command key we are going to call it as
hello and you can give a group so you
can give a group name I'll also say
hello for that this is just to identify
the particular method from the hysterics
dashboard so that you can easily
uniquely identify which is the place
which is going to fail now we have
created a fallback method we need to
implement it here the signature of this
particular method should be exactly the
same as the method behavior adding the
hottest tricks annotation
the name of that should be this the
hello fallback whatever method name we
have mentioned here it should be the
same here here I'm just going to return
saying fallback hello initiated so this
way whenever we hit the hello rest
endpoint if there is a failure we will
know that there is a fallback if there
is no failure we will be getting a hello
world as a response so what else do we
need that's it so I just have
implemented a simple hystrix command I
don't want anything else I am going to
start this particular project in a
different port so I will just say eight
zero nine two
also I want to use Java 8 in my project
I will just change that
you
and let's start the project so this is a
spring boot application which is just
having one particular rs10 point cauldre
slash hello and we have implemented some
historic s-- implementation or hystrix
command which can do something let's see
what it does
so it is the port failed I think I have
not given the correct I think I gave the
wrong name server dot port I just need
to read on this
so this should start this big boot
application in the port eight zero nine
two since we have enabled actuators
actuators create some health check
endpoints and also it creates an end
point called hystrix stream so if you
notice here these are different actuator
end points actuator creates all these
end points for example health dump trace
refresh all these are created by
actuators and also it has something on
his trick stream his trick stream is the
rest endpoint which is going to stream
the information about the health of the
method which we added here so it is just
going to stream the health of the rest
resource implementation whatever we did
here so the health of the fallback hello
or the hello group will be streamed via
this particular endpoint and using the
hystrix dashboard we are going to see
that the hystrix dashboard is present in
slash hystrix
so it will be present in slash istic so
if you see here it is going to present
in slash hystrix
and slash his tricks dot stream will
have all the streaming information about
this particular JVM let's go to the
browser localhost colon 8080 to slash
let's check if the process is up ready
up it's up this is a spring boot
application so it shows that particular
error if you go to hysterics this is
going to bring up the hystrix dashboard
so this is the hiss takes dashboard here
bear you can provide a URL of a
different application as well so you can
monitor any application in this
particular dashboard by just providing
this URL here we are going to use the
hystrix start stream
we're just going to use hystrix torch in
here I'm not doing anything else I'm
just hitting the east historic start
stream which has the streaming
information about our JVM so right now
it shows nothing I'll just open one more
tab and then I will show you by hitting
the ok this is just coming out let me
minimize this guy I think I know how to
show it separately let me show that
I'll minimize this as well
okay so in the back if you see there is
nothing right now let's hit the rest
endpoint which we had created the rest
lash hello right that's what we had
created this should return hello world
if it is successful and if you notice
here in the background when we hit the
rest endpoint the circuit dashboard
started showing something so it is
showing the hello this is the group
which we created and it shows up the
request and it shows up some dot here so
the number of times we call this
particular method it is going to call
this see see this right now fall back
happened here so we got a response
saying fall back hello initiated and you
can notice that this is showing up red
because there was a problem and if you
see here the circuit is still closed
because we have not configured anything
so by default it has a default
configuration and it is using some
default configuration and it is making
the circuit to be closed still but you
can configure the number of requests
which gets failed and you can open the
circuit based on that so I'll just try
calling this n number of time right I'll
just try to call this from different
different you are also again
so you can see the number of records
which are getting hit right see that it
is getting increase it shows how many
percentage succeeded and you can see the
failure rate as well so this is the
failure rate it goes there right so to
fail three failed
except etc so this is how whenever a
request happens whenever streaming
issues happen you can easily monitor
using the hysterics dashboard so why is
the dashboard so big and there is
nothing else right this is because we
can configure multiple functions or
multiple Hastings commands in the same
dashboard let's try creating a new
method in order to show that case right
I'll just copy/paste exactly the same
thing in this case I'll just say hello
whitey hello YouTube right I'll just
create one more
group called hello whitey so that we
know but I will just call the same for
back method
so I'll just say hello YouTube
I can even call the same method so that
is what I am doing here let's restart
this application
so once you refers the hystrix dashboard
the existing information goes away and
it is getting the data via the hist
extort stream that is why the data gets
refreshed without even being refreshing
this URL because the URL which it uses
the hist extremes is a streaming data so
you get messages every now on them
without even having to retry so let the
spring good application come up I think
it is up let's try refreshing our
dashboard so there is nothing in the
dashboard because we have not initiated
any requests
so I'll just hynny she ate at a coast
called hello rest hello and we also have
the hello YT right so and just trigger
that as we'll see that once i trigger
the hello YT a new option came up here
we can do the same again
so I can do this all day long right I
can just try doing this and then you can
see the response here isn't it if there
is a circuit which is open the circuit
open happens here so the circuit will be
open and all the subsequent requests
will be failing all this so this can be
configured by different configurations
you can take a look at the sprink
allowed documentation there are
different configurations which you can
configure in order to handle the
hystrix in your own way right so this
dashboard gives us a high level picture
of what's happening inside the
application how many requests are
passing on how many requests are failing
etc so this is very good when you are
writing for intolerant systems and you
want to monitor this fault tolerance
from a dashboard so you can use hystrix
if you are already using a spring
application you can use spring cloud
hystrix without even having to deploy in
cloud you can notice that I have just
run this application locally I am NOT
doing anything else I just installed it
locally it's not even installed a set is
just running inside the application so
you can use hystrix anywhere in any
application even if it is a monolithic
application you can use it you can
monitor the fault tolerance from a
dashboard so this is what hystrix
provide it is majorly used when you are
using micro services design patterns and
fault tolerance when you want to handle
fault
in the microservices world that's all I
wanted to cover in this particular video
I hope you guys understood what is
history and how we can use hystrix
inside a spring boot application if you
are not using any spring boot
application you can use directly the
hystrix library and you can directly use
it without the annotation instead of the
Mystics commander notation you will be
using the hist --ax command classes
which Netflix directly provides you can
directly use the Netflix history API and
do that if you are not using a spring
boot application I hope you guys
understood hystrix and you might be
using hystrix in the future if you liked
