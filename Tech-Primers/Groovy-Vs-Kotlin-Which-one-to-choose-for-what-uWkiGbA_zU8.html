particular video we are going to say
what is groovy and what is Kotlin and we
are going to do miss with miss and match
between groovy and Kotlin and we already
see which is better or are they both
equal or how do they compare or farewell
with sour right so if you had seen my
previous video I have covered what is
Cortland but I will just go through
again in this video little bit brief so
before that let's see what is guru be
right so groovy came before Cortland so
groovy is a language which is written
into JVM so if you are familiar with
Java right so Java runs on the JVM right
so groovy and Kotlin are different
languages which run on the same JVM
however there are something different so
in case of groovy so groovy is a
dynamically typed language so Java is a
statically typed language however groovy
is a dynamically typed language so
basically you don't have to define any
data type during the compile time or do
in decode so all these the casting will
be happening at the runtime so that is
the difference between Java and groovy
so inside code link so Kotlin is a
statically typed language so the first
major difference between groovy and
Catalan is cotton is statically that
programming language and grooving is not
statically typed programming language ok
that is the major difference so in
cotton you how to define integer as in
string a string stuff like that so in
groovy you don't have to do that you can
define saying des definition so that's
it so it can type cache automatically
two different data types okay that is
the first major difference the next one
is both these languages are trying to
solve the problem of boilerplate code
Xin chào so if you take Java if you
create a POJO right plain old Java
object so you have to create the gate of
your to create the settings manually and
stuff like that right place so literally
you're also
of hundred lines but internally if you
see the it doesn't make sense you have
to write lots of code to just do getters
and setters so these are like different
ceremonies right so you have to do them
just for the sake of making it work in
the JVM right
so in groovy and cotton you don't have
to do that so in groovy you don't have
to create getters and setters by default
if you create a class with the variables
everything is all public so in groovy
whatever you create you have you you can
access variable inside a particular POJO
using the object directly so let's say
you have a Class A and the Class A has a
a1 a2 a3 as different variables defined
so if you want to access these variables
you can access as a dot a one or a dot a
to directly and same way if you want to
do assign any values to the variable you
can say a dot a 1 equal to whatever
value so there is no necessity for you
to use the getters and setters
because groovy creates uses a reflection
so how groovy works is groovy uses
reflection mechanism so whatever code
you write in groovy heat gets converted
into byte code so if you are using Java
you can you can convey you can interact
from groovy to java from java to groovy
stuff like that same with cotton so you
can do that so the major difference
between the Java and these languages are
boilerplate codes so in groovy you don't
have to do that you can directly access
your variable but in Cortland simply in
cotton you don't have to write them but
not everything is public so coddling is
more of safer than groovy so groovy is
like the the groovy books of the
principle of reflection but Cortland
doesn't work on the principle of
reflection so so what happens is when
you write something it doesn't get
compiled during your compile and so it
doesn't resolve all your errors during
the compile time
so in groovy you will have this problem
of failing codes in production or
failing codes at runtime similar to
JavaScript right so JavaScript you don't
compile JavaScript same way in groovy
and it compiles but it won't be able to
resolve your
types data types and stuff like that R&amp;amp;D
component so it all happens at the
runtime but in Cortland since it is
statically typed you get all the issues
during compile temperature the other
major difference between groovy and the
courtland's courtland's type sakes so
null and I'll say so it's like if you
have any null object and in Cortland you
cannot have any knowledge akin Kotlin
and if you want to have null objects in
Gotham you have to define specifically
saying that this is null so wherever you
are using that variable you will have to
have some special handling to handle
that null so that kind of types a for
the analysis values are there in
Cortland however in groovy there is
nothing like that so groovy is similar
to Java so if you have any null and you
will have null pointer issues however in
Kotlik there is no null pointer issues
as such right so apart from that concise
body languages are concise safe that is
another thing which I said Ruby is not
safe because you use reflection so
groovy uses the reflection to access all
your classes and variables and stuff
like that but quatrain doesn't use
reflection so it is safe interoperable
both are interoperable you can use
existing libraries JVM Java libraries
inside groovy and Kotlin so you don't
have to worry about compatibility issues
with the Java code being used inside the
groovy script or the Kotlin script okay
those friendly IDs are there for both
even for a GUI we have good IDs the
other major difference between groovy
and Kotlin is Chloe works on the
principle of VSS domain-specific
language right so if you seek Gradle
right the Gradle Gradle is nothing but a
build and build orchestration library or
the pool similar to Mabel so it is
written on the concept of groovy DSL so
the essence are nothing but
domain-specific language you can create
your own domain-specific language so
that it is user friendly and it is like
user readable syntax it is not like your
maven where you how to give
XML tags so it's literally like learning
terminal machine language which maven
can't understand however Gradle is
different right so Gradle is just
domain-specific language which is the
Cobie deser so that is the difference
that is something which is there in
Google so brewery has the concept of
domain-specific language however Kotlin
doesn't have it and the other thing is
vibrant and rich ecosystem so you have
lots of additional libraries inside
groovy so Kotlin is a new language
fairly new language it is not even two
years old so groovy is like it's been
there for why I'm not sure when it was
started but good groovy you can do lots
of things since it is a using reflection
right you have lots of capability you
can plug there is something called meta
class in the groovy there you can plug a
method to any object so it's literally
like you call a prints method on an
object you can override that print
method at a superclass limit so it's
like any it's like at the object level
so it on any object if you call print it
can override you can override that
particular print method so that that is
something there in groovy so using that
there are different features which are
implemented like memorize and stuff like
that there is something called cutting
so there are these are different
concepts inside groovy okay so Cortland
doesn't have anything like that cotton
is typeset so it's a new language which
evolving right now the only advantage I
see with Cortland is you write very
minimal code it is safe and you can
still leverage whatever groovy was to
elect a boilerplate code removal and
stuff like that
the major advantage I see with Cortland
is the null null point of things which
Kotlin enforces so you cannot have null
variables so that is pretty good
encoding compared to groovy but however
groovy is like you can do whatever you
want with your code so that that is
something which is different between
groovy and Cortland so so it is up to
you to decide which one to you so I
would prefer using groovy for writing
test cases and Kotlin can be used in
production I would say it depends on the
developer scholar
depends on the management call on how
they want to see Courtland from in using
inside that application inside their
firm ok so that is what I will say
currently everybody started using
Cortland for Android development and
Google is now supporting Kotlin as a
first-class
language for Android so because because
of the code which they write because of
the less number of lines of code which
they write in the Android applications
because it's all based on the same JVM
console right so that is why people are
more going towards Cortland then groovy
or shower okay so that is the basic
difference between groovy and Java
groovy and Rockland so you have to
decide which one you can use for which
so for example back-end processing if
you ask me frankly you can use Java X
and you don't have to worry about groovy
or kata later
so groovy can be used for writing test
cases because they are you don't have to
worry about writing lots of code in your
test cases so in that case you can write
you can drink Ruby script for writing
test cases ok same wake for Kotlin if
you want to have right now all android
applications of negative angular
applications are moving towards scotland
because we are because of their safe
safety Ness and concise user support so
that you don't have to write lots of
boilerplate code in DJ jvm language ok
so that is a major difference between
groovy and Catalan
so let me know what do you think about
that so if you have any queries you can
drop them in the comment below so if you
haven't subscribed to the channel go
ahead and subscribe to it if you liked
the video go ahead and like it do let me
know if you want me to do any specific
video that's it for this particular
video
meet again in the next video thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
