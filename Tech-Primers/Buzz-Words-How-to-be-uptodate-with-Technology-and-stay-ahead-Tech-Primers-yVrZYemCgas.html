when someone talks about a technology
and you haven't heard about that word at
all so I'm going to give you some tips
and tricks on identifying these birds
were buzzwords and then how to learn
them on how to keep yourself up to date
with the technology boards let's get
started so I basically have created four
different major criteria or steps in my
learning process so if you if you talk
to me about any technology I know
because most of the technology I have
heard about it somewhere or the other
and then I would have done some
preliminary investigation on what is it
and how how does it work with the
existing platforms and stuff like that
so I'm going to share you those concepts
or whatever I'm sharing here is what I
prefer doing myself okay so that is why
I wanted to share whatever I had learnt
or whatever process I had been using
throughout my career in the past like
seven and half to eight years
so the first key ingredient is the
awareness about the technology right so
if you hear about the technology let's
say I put the term called blockchain
right so you go and immediately check in
Google right so that is what we do most
of the time if you don't about if you
don't know about a term which somebody
is talking about we go to Internet and
then search about that particular term I
say example in YouTube it says you would
have arrived at this particular video I
don't know maybe because I had put some
fancy term and then you saw that in my
channel and then that is always started
watching my video straight so that is
how we go and search it so how to get
that particular awareness so I'm going
to show you how I get awareness about
different tools and what platforms I
follow or what platforms I use to know
them right the next obvious thing is
learning about it okay obviously if I
talk with people in mine companies or
people in my previous company or my
colleagues like basically so what they
say is like if I'm not working on a
technology what should I learn about it
right so that I don't totally agree
because if you are not working on a
technology that doesn't mean that you
should not learn about it if you are
interested in knowing that particular
technology just try investing some time
in learning about it and then it might
be helpful for you maybe down the lane
or you might teach somebody else during
the process right so that is how I feel
so I'm not sure how you guys feel but
that is what I feel and that is why I
created this channel so most of the
videos on which I do here I don't use it
at work so most of the technologies
which I have shared with you I don't use
it at work but I want to teach them so
that is why I tried it and I followed
the four steps which I am going to show
you and then that is how I share my
knowledge what I have known right so the
next one would be the compare and
contrast and argue astrology where you
can compare and contrast frameworks so
for example I made some videos on Kotlik
ok so I was pretty much excited about
what is Kotlin and I was initially
thinking a year ago I was thinking like
what is this just another jvm language
and I was thinking of not learning about
it but then when I got to know about
some of the features which are better
than Java and there are some good things
about
Catalan that when I identified ok I can
now invest some time in investigating
what is that technology and how does it
better
job right so that I got to know when I
was talking with friends and when I was
going through some forums and when I was
going through some blogging platforms or
tutorials that is how I got to know that
okay that is better right so same way
this particular step you are going to
compare the technology or compare and
contrast or arguing with people in your
network about the new technology and
then you stay ahead okay that is how you
share your knowledge and then you will
also be getting new stuff from your
network the last one of course it is
coding okay after you did all the first
two three and first second and third
step you have to do coding because you
will not remember stuff until you code
right after all we are all developers
right so what do I do to keep myself up
to date and how do I get to know that ok
this is the term which is currently
doing the rounds right the first thing I
do is Twitter so every morning I get up
and I literally open Twitter so I don't
even open water so I hope in Twitter
so what I do with Twitter so I follow
all the people who take sessions in
conferences or most of the conference's
I go which is happening here in
Bangalore but there are some makeups
which are happening for what I do is I
register to the meetup calm and then I
see whether the particular topic is in
my radar and then I go and check that
out okay and then people tell about that
Twitter handle I immediately note that
and I follow them okay so that they
whatever they talk is going to be the
latest stuff so that is how I follow all
the latest people so if I'm reading
about something in the inner tutorial
right most of the time these the plural
sites and other websites who is taking
these trainings so they are going to
expose their Twitter handle because it
is easy to communicate escape Alvo
Twitter you can tweet to them and then
they respond back so most of the time I
have done that if you know about the
creator of that the contributor of
Springwood just long right so I have
personally spoken to him in one of the
conferences which happened in Bangalore
and I had tweeted to him and then he had
responded back so that is why I sell
Twitter is good so you can litter
like many people who created the chamber
so who were the founders of the
Trimble's you can talk to them you can
tell them you can praise them or you can
even scroll them but yeah don't do that
but you can have a easy bridge in
Twitter okay that is what IP I don't
personally they come on Facebook at all
okay so the next one is using apps like
a Reddit and pocket so I use the reddit
for trapping through some important
links or something which is out there so
sometimes I use reddit to know about the
latest technologies on people compare
and contrast and then argue over stuff
included better than any other platform
right so that is why I use reddit I use
pocket because I need to store some
links so let's say I was going through
some link in via a memo bed right so
what I do is I use that I share that
particular link in to pocket so that you
can save links inside pocket and then
you can access it in the internet in
behavior budget okay and then you can
even link it with any any other tool
like seed Li or something okay so the
second thing which I get awareness from
busy reddit or pocket okay the next one
will be the newsletters obviously you
can register to any of these newsletters
I register to taught works TechRadar if
you have heard about
TechRadar TechRadar is a horrible of a
quarterly publisher publishing a
newsletter from the taught works company
so they have lots of recommendations
about the new technologies and the old
technologies and they have different way
of analyzing these technologies and all
the CFOs and CEOs in the company discuss
and then come up with the technology
than their adoption rate and stuff like
that okay that is that that gives you a
clear idea of what are all the new
technologies or the water of the new
terms which are doing the rounds there
okay or if you want to register to any
or any of these you can register as it
you get newsletters the Android P Cletus
ike point java
and then well done you have lots of
newsletter so you get mails daily or
weekly ok the last and the final one
would be obvious obviously the blogs and
d coming
channa so there are I have just put down
some trade community channels like D
zone info world and input you so you
would have heard about D zone because
anything you search about Java you get
the link to disown trade most of the
time that is what we always do B
thoughts about something and then these
on pops up saying okay I already have a
solution for you you don't have to go
anywhere so you can follow these own if
you are if you wanted to keep yourself
updated of what is all happening in the
latest tech industry so how do you
manage all these things you can use
feedly ok feedly is an app that's which
you can register all the RSS feeds of
different websites and then you can have
a centralized place where you can go
through stuff so I register there edit
the blog and everything inside feedly ok
so that I can go through just feedly and
then understand what what is happening
in different web sites so it pulls the
RSS feed from each website and gives you
the latest content yes that is the first
steps in the learning process right so
to get a ticket awareness you have to do
all these stuff because you have to know
about all the new terms right so that is
why being that is where it gets started
right so that is what I do in my
personal book
the next one would be learning about
these technologies so what do I do to
learn about these technology I have a
plural psych log in the code school log
in so I you learn stuff from the plural
site of the code school website so it's
a very good tutorial for developers so
you have lots of hands-on stuff like how
I make videos it the most of the videos
or something similar and in depth I
don't make in-depth videos like three or
four hours or five hours videos because
the videos inside notre site or all like
four or three years it's like very
intense sometimes I get bored and then
sleep off like I used to sleep off
during the video so so that is
Pluralsight the next one would be Linda
so lynda.com is on the website on
LinkedIn so something similar audacity
is something similar or Nodame is
something similar okay so these are
different websites where you can go and
learn stuff for free there are lots of
topic source you want to learn about
JavaScript and the UI rated stuff go to
code school they have a unique way of
teaching you so they just sing a song
and then it's like completely funny and
then you have an IDE inside the browser
itself so you will be able to write
programs and only when you complete the
program you will be proceeding to the
next chapter
so that is completely good for example
JavaScript if you want to learn from the
basic it's very good inside code school
good cop they have a very in-depth basic
stuff about Java okay the third one in
the learning process is the compare
contrast analysis where we need to now
compare contrast and argue some new term
which we heard for example people are
asking me to make videos on reactive
streams right I have seriously I have
not worked on cactus teams I had been
saying videos about something Josh long
in YouTube and then I have seen videos
from vintage subramanyam so I have all
these people as my visionary so I used
to follow their video so I used to see
videos about reactive programming I saw
what is the reactive programming and it
made one video on vertex but still I'm
not comfortable with reactive because I
need to learn and go through all these
phases right so what I do is mega ask
what is reactive programming so somebody
says react
systems right now there are two thing to
terms like then there is something
called functional reactive program and
also now I need to compare and contrast
side what is the reactive programming
versus what is reactive systems right so
and also this reactive I got to know
that okay the reactive is present in all
languages so after going in-depth and
comparing about these stuff then I
realize that reactive is not something
new it has been there quite a while and
it is there in all the languages it's
not just it is coming only in JavaScript
or only in Java nature it is there in
every language so how do we argue so
this is the most favorite place on earth
for us right so it's awesome so most of
the time we go to stack overflow and
solve all our problems say because
everybody has faced a problem and the
solution is out there in stack overflow
same way you can argue stuff in cycle
and people have already given some
solution then people have compared and
contrasted and you can't go through
stack overflow for all the stuff okay
finally we have to code okay it's not
just okay whatever you do whatever I
told Ricky it's not just that you go
through some website and then you become
a master and some technology you have to
obviously code for in order to do that
you can create your own project you can
create your own pet project so any
company I go to I always do that
so if I want to learn a technology I
create a pet for engine project so for
example last year I move to a different
company and I was working in a new
technology angularjs okay I didn't know
about Angela James so what I did is I
created a own project internally for
myself okay not for anybody I just
created it for myself and I learnt about
angular in to end by creating that
particular project so you need to spend
obviously some extra amount of time to
do that but you can do that to make your
learning process faster because if you
rely on somebody to give work on
something and then you are going to
start learning something that's not
going to be the way around right if you
want to learn something go ahead and do
all these things right now and you will
be successful okay so the next one would
be joining an open-source project you
can join or contribute to open source
project I have not done any open source
tribution but apart from just creating
these hands-on videos in this particular
channel and uploading to github
I have never contributed to any open
source community assets but I wanted
always but I am not sure if I will be
having enough time to contribute to open
source project like spring or anything
modes or or what you can do is you can
find a new project at work right this is
the most or the last thing I would
recommend because most of the time you
go and ask somebody for a new project
and obviously after a while it's going
to get traded away so for example let's
say I was working and we knew latest
technologies for a year and then I moved
to a different project
I wouldn't expect the same technology to
be there in the new project s website so
I would I would suggest this as the last
option don't go through finding new
projects at work just for the sake of
upgrading your knowledge instead create
your own project and then use whatever
technology you wanted to use in that
particular project and then proceed with
the learning process like and after all
we are all coders right we are not
programmers we are just coders isn't it
so we need to code so these are the
major steps which I follow in my
learning process right from
understanding a technology or getting to
know a technology term or getting to
know a buzzword and then some starting
from there - retching - where where I
can create some code I can create a
hands-on programming experience and I
can share something with somebody
alright so that is how I learn stuff so
hope you guys found it useful so if you
have any any other solutions drop that
in the comment section below if you like
the video go ahead and like it if you
haven't subscribed to the channel go
ahead and subscribe to us we - again in
the next video
