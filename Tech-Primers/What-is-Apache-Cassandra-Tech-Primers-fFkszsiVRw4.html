and never miss any updates from tech
timers welcome to tech primers in this
video we are going to see what is Apache
Cassandra and there we can use Cassandra
so if you are familiar with the no
sequel databases there are lots of no
sequel databases and Cassandra is also
one among them so you would have heard
both MongoDB from my videos as well and
Cassandra is something similar to
MongoDB we are going to see what is
Cassandra and why Cassandra is different
for MongoDB so Cassandra is nothing but
a free open source no sequel database
but it stores that values in the form of
key value pairs so MongoDB stores the
data in the form of document but
Cassandra stores that stores the data in
the form in the form of key value pairs
Cassandra is highly robust
because it has a masterless replication
so basically cassandra works in the
principle of clustering so you don't
have a master you don't have a slave
concept so you have like masterless
replication so there is no constant
master so whenever you query the
Cassandra cluster so you get data from
one of the nodes and you can configure
them under your wish so you can
configure how many nodes you want in a
cluster to have your data synced into so
basically you can have your data set
into different notes and you can
configure the number of nodes with which
you can sync the data to if you're not
familiar Cassandra was created by
Facebook and then later moved on to
apache license so then Facebook created
Cassandra so they inherited the features
of BigTable and dynamo DB so this is why
Cassandra is more popular and Cassandra
is very robust in handling huge amount
of data okay
so how does the architecture of
Cassandra look like right so if you see
the documentation documentation is not
great here in the Cassandra website but
there are some basic information which
we can use from this documentation so if
you see the cassava architecture as I
said earlier there is a clustering
concept so you have like a ring so there
are rings in the cluster so basically
all the nodes are connected to each
other so you have a ring basically so
one node is connected to the other nodes
other one is connected to the road and
the same thing likewise right so they
are all connected in the form of a
string and when a request comes to the
clutter contract cluster so it hits one
of the node and that particular node
processes the clicker so let's say you
are writing an opera writing something
onto the database so that particular
node gets the data and then it writes on
to the database in its own node okay now
there is a concept of gossip there this
particular node tells the other node
that okay see I got the data and I have
updated so now you can also get to that
particular node the node 2 is going to
now update its cache or the data
database background right so that
concept is called gossiping so inside
Cassandra so the nodes interact with
each other
using the form of gossiping right so
they gossip with each other and then
they identify okay I need to pursue this
particular data and then they persist
into the database okay so let's say if
one particular node goes down so since
there is masterless replication there is
no central node which your process or
the nature commands will be heating away
so if node 1 is down your commands will
be router to the node 2 and node 2 will
be able to identify data for you okay so
that is where the fault detection comes
into picture right the next part is the
replication so since this is a
masterless application so you can
control the replication so you can
listen the Cassandra cluster you have
like 10 different nodes in a cluster you
can control how many nodes you want to
data to be synched into so let's say you
have
years of worth of data okay so you want
to store a use worth of data into a
cluster of ten machines you can split
them based on chart concept so you can
say that okay generate data can be in
one node sever every data can be in the
other node or likewise so you can split
it based on your convenience in
different nodes so you can create that
replication and so let's say node 1 and
node 2 should have January data and node
2 and node 3 should have several every
data so you can configure that whenever
you are pushing the data ok so that is
there in the Cassandra cluster so say
even though the cluster is connected
with 10 nodes you can define how many
nodes that particular data can replicate
it to ok so I just went through the net
D zone which said they had a good
architectural diagram of how the
architecture looks like so let me see
yeah so this is the this is what I was
just mentioning right so you have
different nodes connecting the form of
string and whenever you hit a query it
comes to one of the node and at that
particular instance that particular
nodes becomes the coordinator and this
is going to check to other nodes and
then gossip without those notes
basically so this is just gossiping with
other nodes and then it is going to
return the data right so the faster
basically faster in the writes are
basically faster in cassava so that is
why people are using Cassandra because
it's very fast when writing data because
of the clustering concept so you write
in one node and that node gossips with
other node and 6 the data so the rights
are more faster than other databases
like the relational database if you want
to use cassandra from a relational if
you are coming from a relational
database background you should try to
see whether your requirements fit into
the Cassandra would because Cassandra
has this concept of unstructured data so
you can have unstructured data inside B
Cassandra and if you have relationship
in your relational database Cassandra
doesn't support relationships but you
have a concept of collections so you put
the collection in the same key value
pair in the same column column family
basically it's a table kind of thing in
Cassandra so you don't have to you don't
have to have relationships in control so
you will have to have the data as a
whole so there is no relationship
concept you can't do a join in Cassandra
so you need to structure the data in
such a way that your relationships are
already taken care before you put the
data into Cassandra that is something
which is different from contracting a
traditional relational database if you
see here this is the prediction in the
high-level overview of what happens when
the data gets pushed into the Ridgid
database so that is a concept of commit
log so whenever you write something it
goes to the commit log and the mem table
so mem table is like an in-memory table
from the mint table the data gets
flushed onto the disk so that is the SS
table so the data gets plus down to the
disk and that is there the index and
keys are getting getting created and
then they gets posted onto the disk so
that is how the node works alright so
Reid also has a similar concept you just
get the data it doesn't go to the commit
log but it can directly take it from the
SS table and then it puts two pushes to
the mm table and from the main table it
takes T subsequent values okay so I
think that is what I wanted to cover and
yeah so let's see what is the in depth
concepts inside the cans right so like
how you have schemas tables and
structures right so in Cassandra
they have something called key space so
Cassandra is key space is the schema
okay inside that key space you can have
a column family so column family is
nothing but a table kind of structure so
you can have a you can have multiple
columns in the column family and inside
each column you have a key a column name
and a value so that is how they are
mapped so inside the column family you
can have a key column name and value for
each column okay and each row can have
their own column okay so you can have
multiple column
you can have a single column so you can
have one structured data inside the
column zombie so basically one row can
have four columns the other row can have
only two columns okay
so you can have that kind of concept
inside a column family so in a
traditional relational database every
row has the same amount of columns right
in a table but here in Cassandra you
don't have to have that particular
restriction so there is no restriction
on the number of columns for a row
inside a column family so we need to
just understand what is the key space so
key space is a schema the column family
is like a table the columns are like the
columns but the row can have n number of
columns so it sits in our control okay
so that is another major difference
between traditional database and I and
the Cassandra database okay
so let's summarize what we discussed so
Cassandra is the no sequel open source
free and open source database which is
similar to MongoDB but MongoDB uses the
document store Cassandra is of the key
value pair or the key value store
cassandra has masterless replication so
you don't have to worry about master
slave concept because all the nodes are
connected in the form of a ring and they
call it the Cassandra cluster Cassandra
was developed by Facebook it heavily
relies on the features of BigTable and
dynamo DB it has lots of features from
BigTable and dynamo TV that is why it is
faster the writes are much faster than
any traditional database okay so that is
it so I that's what I wanted to cover in
this particular video so in the next
video I might create a springboard
application but T Cassandra so I might
be using a spring data Cassandra so
meteo grade in the next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
