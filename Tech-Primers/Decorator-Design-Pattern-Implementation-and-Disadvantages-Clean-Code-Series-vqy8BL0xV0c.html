primers decorative design patterns are
another common usage inside the design
patterns in Java
these decorator design patterns are
otherwise called as wrappers why are
they called wrappers because they add
behavior to an existing object without
affecting the other objects
you
it uses the single responsibility
principle so every implementation or a
contrary class has its own responsible
creature implementation
you
you
it also dynamically computes the
behavior of a particular implementation
or interface
you
it is a combination of inheritance and
composition
if you don't want to create common
subclasses like how we did the other
design patterns then you can go for the
decorator design patterns so these are
an alternative to create sub classes
there are constructors which are
required because you need to have
instances created from the hierarchy so
let's go ahead and see how we can create
the decorated is in pattern I'll create
a new package for the decorator so we
are going to create an interface called
for interface and what we are going to
with the phone interfaces we are going
to build a form so similar to the other
examples which we saw about the phone we
are going to see do the similar stuff
however we are going to see how we can
use the decorator design pattern so we
have an interface called phone and what
the phone does is we are going to build
a four first we are going to create an
implementation of the phone which we can
call it as a basic form so we are not
going to add any functionality to this
particular phone so we are going to
create a plain phone and we are going to
call it a basic phone and we are going
to add the basic phone as let's say
screen right the basic phone has a
screen so we just go to print screen
then somebody calls the build method now
in order to decorate a phone we need to
create an abstract implementation for
that we are going to create the concept
of the smart phone so smart phones might
have different stuff right so we are not
going to implement the build here and
I'm going to make this as an abstract
class so what we are going to provide in
this particular smart phone is when
somebody is implementing a smart phone
they should be providing a phone to it
so either it can be a basic phone or can
be some other type of home
so let's create a constructor here
you
and we need to provide the form
interface tool
and let's create this object here
and when somebody calls the build method
in the smartphone we will call the
buried method from the phone
you
you
that's it so this is an abstract
implementation of a phone which is a
smart phone however we are not telling
what type of smart phone it is so it
could be an Android phone or it could be
an iOS phone right or maybe you have in
those phones so we have a phone
interface initially and we built a basic
phone out of it the basic food had just
the screen we did not have anything
maybe we can add screen and battery but
also sir right that's it
it had just the basic stuff however we
are in creating a decorator so this
smartphone is nothing but a decorator so
this is going to add some features to
the smartphone so we can create
implementations of this smartphone to
have features build to that so let's say
we are going to create a iPhone right
I'll say Apple phone just for the naming
convention Apple phone I will create one
more called Android phone
so these are two decorator
implementations so these are country
classes of the decorator let's go to the
an Apple phone right so if you notice
here we have the constructor pushed in
directly to the abstract class we need
to implement now the
build method right because it's not done
so we are doing a super ton build which
is fine however we need to also create
our own additional feature to this
particular smartphone right we need to
add something to the smartphone so we
will add a noise
and that go is is going to be
and is
let's say iOS version 1.0 so this is
what decorator does decorator can add
new functionality or the behavior to the
existing animal implementation so for
example smartphone is an implementation
of a bowl and we are adding different
OSS to that particular smartphone and
the smartphone is nothing but a
decorator
however basic phone if it's off it was
just a basic phone implemented from the
phone it doesn't have any decorators it
has just basic features so let's go to
Android phone and do the same
you
I'll just say arrow is similar to what
we did there a ladder Android
his version let's see 6.0 now how do we
use this particular implementation let's
see that decorator example so how do we
use it so we need a phone we need to
create a phone and what type of phone it
is we are going to create a Android
phone right we are going to create an
Android phone let me name details on
that phone so that we can create an
iPhone later we are going to create an
Android phone however in order to create
an Android phone you need to provide a
basic type of home
so what this will do is this will create
a basic phone and give it to the Android
phone and when I do android phone dot
build this is going to build something
same way if I do this for iPhone right
or the Apple phone let's say Apple phone
equal to new Android phone of new basic
phone I just need to provide at the
existing basic phone and I use this
Apple phone as a decorator so this Apple
phone is a decorator implementation and
I just used that to build my phone so
phone is just the basic phone which I'm
providing and Apple phone is the
decorator here so I just build the
project let's see what does they give so
we need to create an iOS a phone with
the basic features with the iOS right I
think I need to put in this thing
I did a build but I need to point
because that build is returning you know
string Nate
you
yeah if you notice here we have a screen
battery processor and the Android phone
however let's say we want to have a
different functionality added to an
Android phone right for example I'll
create a
you
let me create a go to the phone al
creator
one plus four right I'm going to create
a one plus one this is another decorator
I will show you how you can use the
decorators across here so I'm going to
okay I am NOT going to use it from the
phone I'll use it from the smartphone
because I like a it's a smart phone
right let me go to a smart phone I
wanted a smart phone which is nothing
but 1 plus phone the additional in
addition to the Android phone right the
smartphone will have some additional
features isn't it
so I need to have a phone which can
provide both so let's take an example of
a Nokia phone so here this could be
directly an Android phone however let's
say I will rename this as a Nokia phone
that way we know we can provide a
Windows Phone or we can provide an
Android phone so I just show you that
how we can use decorators I'll just say
we lose
so I'll just provide a public string
build
you
let's address
this is called a Dee
Windows Phone version with a 1.0
you
and I'm going to create one more
implementation called the Nokia phone
solo care phone let's assume that Nokia
phone can support either Android or
Windows
all right so I'm going to create exactly
similar type of behavior I'm going to
say build is a super dog build plus I
need to add some functionality to the
Nokia phone right I just add a branding
you
I'll just add a branding thing look your
phone or Microsoft
now when I use this particular phone in
the implementation right how will I use
the
you
low careful
so I'll need to create a new Nokia phone
right I just say new Nokia phone however
I can make it an Android phone or a
Windows Phone so for simplicity first I
will do a Windows Phone then I create a
Windows Phone again I need to provide
another type of phone right which is
nothing but the basic form because in
order to create a Windows Phone you need
a basic prototype of the poll right that
is what we have done here so we are
creating a new basic phone we are
providing that to a Windows Phone and
the same we are providing it to a Nokia
phone so and that this is nothing but a
Nokia Windows Phone and in order to
print that will just say Nokia Windows
Phone dot will so this will build a
Nokia Windows Phone same way if you want
to build a Nokia Android phone we are
going to use a different decorator right
be used already a decorator so here we
will just change it to as Android phone
that's it and we will just change this
name was okay Android phone and if I
just build this if you see how the
decorator pattern works this is how it
works so you can provide different
patterns see this right you have the
screen battery processor the T Windows
Phone version 1.0 and along with that it
says the branding is Microsoft phone and
for the Android Nokia phone it says
Android OS version 6.0 along with e
Microsoft phone branding so this is how
you can create decorator patterns so
what we did here is we created a phone
pole is just at the higher level this is
an interface and basic phone
limitation of the phone which builds a
phone with basic features like screen
battery and processor we have created a
decorator called smart phone this is the
decorator which is going to use the
phone here to decorate it so we are not
having anything else we just have a
phone and the smart phone will directly
use the constructor argument for
creating composition so we are going to
implement the smart phone with android
phone apple phone and windows phone
these are different concrete
implementations so you can directly
create an Android phone or a Apple phone
out of those implementations or the
decorators let's say we want to create a
Nokia phone the Nokia phone can be of
similar implementation if you notice we
just add the branding to it so this
these are testing nothing but the
behaviors so we add a behavior to a
smart phone and it is using single
responsibility principle because it is
doing only the branding so Nokia phone
is just doing the branding and if you
notice the Android phone or the Apple
phone is just adding the OS so these are
these single responsibility principle
and finally we create a Nokia Windows
Phone or a Nokia Android phone based on
the decorators which we have created
here so this is how you can use the
decorator pattern in the code when you
are using it so let's see some of the
disadvantages of the decorator design
pattern so what are the disadvantages
so every time you create a new
functionality you have to create a new
class for every feature that is the
disadvantage since we have new classes
the complexity increases because of the
number of objects which are more since
there are more number of objects the
client might feel it is more complex if
you notice this difference between the
Nokia Windows Phone the Apple phone
there are too many objects creation here
so the client might feel that it is too
complex for me to provide different
objects to it so it is more complex for
the clients the general usage of the
decorator design pattern in the Java API
is the i/o streams you create a file you
create a file output stream or an input
stream and then you provide a file to it
and then you provide a data stream and
then you use that to parse the file and
stuff like that so that is a typical
example of a decorative a writer so I'll
upload this particular coder to the
github repository as all this you can
get it from there for any reference
