stock let's see what is L and what do
they really stand for and why people are
using L in their deployments let's get
started
press the bell liken on the YouTube app
and never miss any update from tech
primers
it stands for elasticsearch log stash
and cabana elf is generally a stack of
components which elastic has released
and people used that together to get
something out of it let's see what are
those
what is elastic search so if you don't
know about elastic search elastic search
is the distributed no sequel database
which uses JSON like messages where you
can store messages in the form of JSON
across distributed systems where you can
scale across indexes elastic search is a
distributed system you can expose
restful api s-- so if you install
elastic search instance in your
deployment you can expose restful
services from that particular elastic
fetch instance previously elastic search
was a single entity which was called as
elastic search as a company later on
elastic search was created as a product
and elastic was the company and they
have different products under their
stack one of them is elastic the other
component which is the log stash log
stash is another framework or you can
call it as a connector which collects
data from different sources and then
streams the data in the form of data
processing pipeline onto the elastic
search instance imagine an elastic
search as a database and log stash as
the streaming component which pushes
their logs onto an elastic search and
finally Cabana Cabana is nothing but the
UI component which displays the data in
the way you wanted over the elastic
search instance if you have a deployment
you will have elastic search as a
separate component in a separate
instance you will be having log stash
which is streaming data from different
machines or infrastructures and you will
have a Cabana UI deployed over the
elastic search instance where you can
see different reports you can see
different analytics so if you notice
here this example of Cabana UI which is
custom made where you can configure
different
stats you can configure different data
and you can create reports and
dashboards out of the Cabana UI based on
your reforms and the data which is
present so that is kibana
so if you see what is ELQ L stands for
elasticsearch logstash and Cabana they
are called together as ELQ stack if you
are using spelunk Splunk has its own
collector so you have a Splunk agent
running so that collects the data and
then pushes on to spawn and Splunk has
its own UI as well so in the background
it it uses elastic as well but ELQ is
like a pure component provided by
elastic company so which has elastic
cells cabana and the locks - so
previously locks - was a separate
company elasticsearch was a separate
component Cabana was a separate
component they all formed together to
analyze just the knobs right so you can
create log analytics information from
the log there is also a new protocol
elastic cloud I had created an elastic
cloud where you can configure different
clusters I created an account here it
was valid for 14 days what I have done
is I have just created a single elastic
node on the Google cloud platform you
can either create it in AWS or Google
cloud platform I have created in Google
cloud platform you can configure
different clusters as well but I have
just configured only one instance and
you can notice that the links for
elastic search and the Cabana UI are
present here and there is an ID which
which I can connect to the elk instances
so the dashboard link is also provided
here I can go to the dashboard directly
from here it is nothing but this I have
already opened it you can see that there
is only one log currently which was the
initial log which I saw there is nothing
streamed there I couldn't stream
anything I couldn't set up instance to
stream log stash instance to stream the
data to that elastic cloud but this is
how it shows up this is how you can
configure an elastic cloud however if
you are setting up or infrastructure in
your firm how this works is you will
have dogs - deploy on to your machines
it might be like a collector which
collects the data from different
machines based on files or streaming
data or something like that and it will
stream to the
destination elasticsearch instance which
can be either in the cloud or in a
individual server and that'll be a UI
over that particular elasticsearch
instance which is nothing but Cabana so
you will have and you might something
similar to this so you can create
dashboards you can visualize data based
on what type of data you have and also
it uses elastic search to query the data
and elastic search if you know
internally uses leucine database to
index its data so the data is can be
retreat much faster because it uses
Lucene index and you can if you notice
here these are the different fields
which are there if you will just say add
these fields will be filtered here right
so you can see the data here getting
added right if there are too much of
data you can easily query you can you
easily filter them using that particular
field or that particular data which you
wanted but I don't have any data to show
that but if you notice my Splunk video
it is almost similar as well Splunk also
has a similar you byberry how different
fields and you can filter out based on
the fields so it is almost similar so
i'm not going to show by loading the
data into the Cabana instance but this
is how you can set up a cabana or a elk
stack where you have a Cabana UI to
monitor these knobs or traverse through
the norms of filter the logs you will
have a log stash instance which will be
streaming the data onto the
elasticsearch instance which will hold
the data in a distributed form an
elastic cloud is an umbrella which is
covering all these three so you can have
different configurations if you notice
here you can have different
configurations of the elastic instance
or by default they are providing for
weak in that space and this ability of
cluster size right this is the cluster
size you can have I think 4 into
whatever so that is the memory which
they provide for us in the trial version
here and I just selected the Google
cloud version so that's what it shows up
here so it is free for 14 days so you
can try out if you are planning to use
Cabana log stash and elastic search then
you can try out the elastic cloud
version similar to how we saw the Splunk
Club elastic also has a cloud version
which you can try it out
so that is all why I wanted to cover so
this is not an in-depth video on what is
ELQ and stuff but just know that ELQ
stands for elasticsearch logstash and
Cabana elasticsearch is the database
component where all the logs will be
streamed via the log stash onto the
elasticsearch instance an elastic
searching is a distributed instance you
will have multiple nodes configured in
an elastic search instance so you can
configure different nodes into onto it
and the data can be huge log stash has
different source of data which meaning
which we can push for example you can
push the data in the form of streams you
can push the data in the form of files
log stash will now transform the data
into a data habit which we can query
from dickey by my UI rocks - will do the
transformation job and push the data to
elastic search and kibana is the u1 with
which we can query the index the elastic
search index so that is the elk stat
hope you guys understood what is ill ill
if you go to this elastic tourcoing link
there is a webinar where you can
register and then watch a complete video
on how to get started with elastic
search what is elastic search what is
log stash what is Kabbalah with the
in-depth visualizations of how to create
dashboards and stuff you can just
register to it and then watch that
particular video or if you have any
other tutorial website you can take a
look at that but this video I just
wanted to cover the basics of what is in
L X stack and more - they stand for and
what are the different components inside
that that's all I wanted to cover in
this particular you hope you liked the
video we're talking in the next video
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
