continuation video from the previous
video so in the previous video what we
did is we created a micro-services
design pattern for an application called
stock price viewer ok with that
application we came up with a design so
this is the design which which we had
designed our architecture for
micro-services design pattern and we
started developing microservices right
so what we did is we created DB service
we created stock so we created a service
registry which is a Utica service and
then we had some issue with the Yahoo
Finance API so that is where we left
right so I I actually recorded this
particular video some time back but what
happened was since I tried creating so
many micro services my laptop couldn't
handle that and then it got crashed so
the whole video went off after an hour
of recording hold video went off so I
what I had to do that reboot the whole
code and I am going to recreate
everything for you in the same video
again ok so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to merge the API gateway and the
service registry into a single process
so that we will save some memory did so
I don't want to and also I will not
create the code maintenance service
because it's just the add and deletion
of the codes for a particular user so
I'm not going to do that I will just
leave it to you guys you can go ahead
and try that out ok so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to create the Zul proxy
and I'm going to merge the Zul proxy
into the array cur service ok and from
this TOC service we are going to use the
eureka service to connect to the DB
service so that we didn't do in the last
video we had a URL hard-coded but we are
going to change that that's what we are
going to do first suppose we are going
to fix the Yahoo Finance API it was not
working right so I found the fix so I'll
make that and then we can work on it
right so so this is the place where we
had the problem alright so what happened
was we retrieved the stock price
information we got the stock but what
was happening there was an exception
throws a 500 internal exceptions right
saying that I charged ahoo dot-com was
down or something so I saw that Yahoo
has a decommission this particular API
they are not going to use this API
anymore so
but still be it works so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to slightly refactor
the code so I'm going to say it's top of
the code so we are going to get only the
pricing information right so what I am
going to do is I am going to create one
more photo so that this price
information is left there okay so we'll
just create a table here called stock
okay it has a stock now and I'm going to
say create a code and the first
information is going to be quote and the
second information is going to be stock
cake code . k trice so this is going to
give the price of a stock okay
and i'm going to create a POJO so and
just creating an inner class so that we
can use it okay so let's use IntelliJ
feature to create parameters which is a
quote cake or I'll just a great price
and finally I'm going to say Gators and
Shiva types
okay cool my poacher is ready so I have
the object as well here and I need to
return the same object right so I need
written the code objects right so they
should work now I need to do a return
here right so this should work
so we are going to test that meanwhile
if you notice here what we have done is
we have hard-coded the URL of the
databases right so we should not do this
we should not hard code the path of
database service we should be using the
Eureka service to retrieve the database
service information and route request so
we created the Eureka service the
service registry because of this only so
we don't have to hard code the URL in
this in this process so we don't have to
add code the URL of stocks of DB service
inside stock service that is why we have
the service registry so they say service
registry by providing a service name so
for the Debbie service the service name
is DB - service so let's bring up the
eureka server and I will show you why I
chose that name right so when we bring
up your wrecker server and when we bring
up TTP service
bring up T visas also the TV service
will register to the Eureka service
under the name called DVI sensors so
that name comes from the applications or
property so we have named our
application and spring application or
name as DB service 8 so that is the name
with which we will be now calling this
over so if you see here the URL is vo
right so this is how the discovery
service is going to work the service
registry is going to work
basically so Eureka will identify that
okay I have this particular name okay
I'll go and check in my registry and
then I'll route it for you
so additional to that what we need to do
is we need to go to the configuration if
you see in the rest template we are
going to use Reston plate to do this
right we are doing a res template or
exchange interesting plate we have to do
load balancing so we have to do
client-side Road balancing so you have
to add this annotation called
at load balance if you see in the
previous video I added and deleted it
but we need to add that so that there is
a client-side code balancing which will
take care of resolving that URL so it
will go to service registry and resolve
it so that is why we need to add that at
load balance so if you are using a
normal test template and you don't use
any service registry or any other framer
you don't have to add the at load
balance you need that specifically for
the unica service ok so if you see what
is happening
I think DB service is not coming up I
think this is because database is not up
so I haven't brought the my sequel up
let me go and quickly bring that up
meanwhile the Eureka server should be up
let's go to the Eureka server and check
the server alright so
right so what are they to do use a very
much it go so I'm just talking the my
sequel so okay so good
so our my sequel server is started yep
its success so let's go ahead and
quickly start the TB servers which
failed because David sellers was
connected to the my sequel database but
since the database was down it was not
able to connect and with connections
were failing and that's why the process
was not off and if you notice here
Eureka solar is already up so it is
having the dashboard and there are no
services running right now okay so we
have started TP service let's see if the
DP service is getting registered and
let's say I think main while I can also
start the stock service side to save
some time so let's go and start the
stock service also okay I'll just move
this table with us right okay
so if i refresh this page you should see
some information yeah if you notice
here's already DP services registered to
the Erica server let's wait for the
stock service also to register one stock
service is registered we will now hit
the stock service and internally we had
changed the you are and right now the
stock service is going to use Eureka to
route to the DB service okay that is
what we are going to check now here so I
will just keep the URL ready so the URL
for stock service is 8301
and this is going to be the URL right
red slash stock so let's hit it and see
all right so there is a ribbon
load-balancing error I think this is
because the load balancing let's see if
the record register yeah so the DB
service is registered so we have the
stock service and the DB services both
register let's go and refresh this URL
if you see here there is a exception in
the ribbon client no class definition
error cannot account means okay I think
it is because the server is not
completely up alright and I think I hid
the rest endpoint before that let's
check quickly what to say
I'll just clear this often then I'll
restart the server
so I have configured at 10201 de ok now
mr. solos right fine let us come up
first and we will hit that restrain
point after tip we stood right we were
troubling it something back but here
okay it is off now it has gone to the
discovery Claudia let's go and check if
it is connected to miracles all right so
let's go and check in the Erica so what
if these doctors are still showing up
now so it's showing us up now we can hit
the rest in point so now this is going
to hit the TB service and retrieve the
stock information for the Peter so it is
going to go to the DB service yeah it's
working it so if you notice here okay
the DB service went the stock service
went to the DB service queried whatever
all the course which are available for
Peter and then it to retrieve the stock
information okay if you see here there
are three your stock codes assigned for
Peter so if I let's say I want it for
Sam it will go to Sam's information so
Sam has only Google so it went to Sam's
it went to the database and retrieve the
quote for Sam it is Google and using
that Google it went into the Yahoo
Finance API retrieve the price
information and it is showing up in the
UI
okay so what we did here is we are what
we did here is from the stock service
they connected to the service registry
from the services sheet went to DB
service it got the data it came to the
sock service it went to Yahoo Finance
API to treat the data and then we got it
okay that is what we did here now what I
am going to do is I'm going to create
the API gateway and embed that into
pee-yew wrecker service okay that's what
I'm going to do now so let's go to the
you decker service so we need to do in
order to embed that we need to add the
dependency form dependency so the
dependency is spring cloud starter zone
this is the dependency which we need to
add so the version which I am adding is
1.3 dubsy row early okay so this is
going to have the Zul proxy enabled in
this particular project so
as you know spring boat has this way of
having annotation so we need to add the
annotation for Zul proxy hazard so we
need to add the enable zone proxy
annotation this is going to make this
particular process behave like a proxy
okay it is just going to be like a proxy
so it's just going to be like a bypass
system okay so how will be till spring
booth or how will you tell Zune to be a
proxy so we need to add some property so
I already have some properties here so
I'm going to add the properties for the
DB service and the stock service right
so what we need to do is we need to give
the URLs of the TV series and stocks of
this here okay and we need to give the
rest endpoints of these okay so if you
see here what I am doing here is I am
just configuring the URL on the path
with which we need to connect the DB in
the stock source okay so let me finish
it and I in till you okay so what we
have done here is we are saying that
every rest in point which comes in a
slash API needs to be proxied okay which
is Zul protected now under api if it is
having DB service go to this particular
post okay if it is going to have stock
service go to this particular post
that's what we are doing here so we are
basically having two registered hosts
two registered services one is the DB
service and the stock serving so this is
going to be like a proxy so when any
request comes in it indirectly redirects
to 8 3 0 0 8 3 0 1 and this is basically
running in a 3 0 to 1 if you see this
this particular process is running in
the 48 3 0 2 okay so yeah see this right
it particular this particular process
runs in a 3-0 - so if you hit a 3 0 to
port number it is indirectly going to go
to a 3 double 0 8 3 double a 3 0 1 that
is what we are going to do ok that is
what Zul is for so that is why this API
gateway is in place here so it is just
going to be like a proxy
so whenever a request comes in ok it
goes to the sock service ok or it goes
to the DB so is directly so literally we
are doing micro services inter-process
communication using VAP gateway and from
the stock so it is going to use the
Eureka service
to figure it out what are the
microservices not yet and it can connect
to that that is all we are using the you
take a design pattern basically the
server suggests a design pattern right
so we have now designed the API gateway
now we need to hit the restraint points
right with this particular API slash
whatever
so let's restart the Eureka's over the
raker service basically mean well let me
check if the videos getting a folder
yeah it's getting recorded yeah last
time what happened it was I as I said
earlier so my video got corrupted and my
system got a started and I had to divert
everything and do it again but yeah this
time I'm very cautious so okay so I
think it has registered it's trying to
register the clients I couldn't find so
that's why you that exception came so
let's go and check the dashboard and
confirm that all the registrations are
done and then we will ship T yeah so the
registrations are done so the clients
are registered to the wrecker server now
if you see the URL for this we are going
to use this particular URL so previously
we access we used the stock information
of Sam with directly hitting these talks
of the state now we are going to use the
API gateway so we are going to say API
slash stock - service okay and then we
will have a red slash tok slash peter
right just what is going to happen is
let me do some so I think knowing
since available for tb3 this because the
it takes a while for the service to
register so that is what is happening
that's why it's still showing it yeah it
is working so yeah so if you notice here
previously we had used the URL called
8301 with which we directly hit the
stock service now we are going to use
the api gateway you using the api
gateway we are using the stock - service
and retrieving is talked for beta okay
if you want to access the TB service we
will do this we will use the TV service
and we will do DV and if you notice
these are the stock coats
for the Pater for the username Peter and
this is directly going to the DB service
from the API gateway okay
previously when we hit the stock service
it went to the stock service from the
API gateway stock service internally use
the array car service to identify the DB
service and it was internally using this
right so literally we have gone through
three or four levels of micro services
what he called navigation so we went to
API gateway from there it went to stock
so come there it went to service
registry and from there it went to TV
service ok that's what we did there
right so now we need to create a UI and
we need to integrate that into the UI
right so how are we going to do that I
already created a sample UI code let me
open that let me open that inside
sublime text because last time what
happened when I opened it I opened it
inside Visual Studio and it got screwed
up so I don't want to screw up this time
right so I have only two files one is
the index dot HTML and the other one
will be after at HTML app dot J so
it's emotional it's good
and just make it bigger
okay good I think this should be in a
strike
yeah so what i'm doing here is the
index.html is a basic HTML file so i'm
not going to run any tomcat or any web
server for running this particular
angular JS code so it's just a simple
HTML page you can run that client-side
angular angular JS right so that's what
i am busy so i am going to add the
angular library as the script dependency
here and i am going to include my script
the other side the apt of g is Phi which
is going to have a controller okay and
coming to the the UI part so I will have
something called username that is just a
text box and there is one more textbook
code and I have two buttons one called
add and one called retrieve price so ad
is going to add the quotes for that
particular user and retrieve price is
going to retrieve the code information
retrieve the price information from for
that particular user whatever codes are
there configured in the database you can
retrieve all those code information and
those prices okay so I'm using the
application so my name the application
is called my app so I have created an
angular application here so and related
angular module called my app and I have
tagged that ng app here as my app the
controller which I am going to use as my
controller it's just I am just a liasing
it as ctrl and when I click on the
button I have some action items here so
I just say ng click so retrieve flies
will now call the three method so if I
go to the tree method I can see what it
how what happens indirectly mother in
the tree method I have this URL here
right so this is nothing but the URL
with which we are going to access or be
just accessed right so if you go to the
browser right we just access this you so
this is the same you are whatever we
access so this is going to be the
gateway URL if I go to the diagram here
can see it so the UI is going to have
only the gateway URL it is not going to
have any other stuff that is what we
have done here okay
that is what we are doing here and so it
is going to go to stock service and
retrieve the stock for that particular
name whichever we provided in this
username text box okay so whatever name
you provided in the username text box it
is going to query for that particular
user okay
and the response is going to be pushed
inside a variable called codes and that
codes I am just doing it here making it
okay so under and for the other method
so if there is a if there is the add
button action which got triggered that
will now go and push the quote
information for the user into the
database so I don't know if it works
I just tried in my previous video but it
did not work because I was doing
something wrong me but I can show you in
postman so what I will do is I will push
that to the postman and see how the code
got changed or something like that okay
so I'm just doing a post here and if you
see here instead of DBH sort of stock
service I am going to use DB service and
I am doing an ad and then I'm giving the
JSON message and I'm pushing that into
the same quote here nothing else okay
that is what the UI is going so you the
UI is basic simple one so if I open the
UI in it let me open the UI and show you
what is there in v1 so this is what is
there in the US okay so the UI is going
to have a user name field code ad and
rightly so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say Peter and I am going to hit
the retrieve option okay this is going
to run the rest endpoint which we did
here and if you notice here it ran and
already we got the results here okay
because the stop my information so
literally we have access the API gateway
okay we from the UI we access the API
gateway it went to stock so it went to
services tree it went to TP cells
collected all the information collated
it together and then it pushed it to the
US that is what I am up in here right
now okay so that is what has happened
here okay so if I say I want to add one
more quote into Peters name right so for
example let's say I want to have a tech
class
okay I want to address class stock
information I click on the plus button
okay it is working cool so once I click
on the plus button it ran the BB service
so it ran the DB service with the add
option so if you see here what we did
raise the van the add option with the
Jason matures which with which the DBA
is expected so if I go to the TV so
visit the DB service was expecting and
add option actually the client the quote
maintenance service is supposed to do
that Oh V okay but the I have directly
Tang back from the API gateway it's us
because it's not required actually I
just figure that out with the code
maintain service is not required because
the respond endpoint is already inside
DB service so I city here it has come
here
it added the code information and it is
really the what all codes are there for
the particular reason and it is showing
up in the UI so Tesla code got added to
Peter and if I now do a retrieve price
Tesla code also should come to the UI if
I see here yeah Tesla price is 350 fine
so that also has come so if I need to
display this into a meter format rate I
don't know if I can let me try right so
what I will do I will just try
displaying this in a neater format I'll
just put a table so table TR T H so coat
I'll just have a cold and then what else
I have rice right
this is already there and now I need to
do the ng-repeat options right so what I
will do I will just say ng I won't
repeat right and I need to repeat codes
in code okay and I'm going to say this
is going to be co dot what is the code
it's going to be code why did I name it
as code I don't know okay okay so this
is what is going to happen and the next
one is a price right we need the price
is it dry is it called a spicy are
described it's called as price and I am
going to close this and I'm going to
close the table that's it let's see if
the table gets refreshed and I will just
remove this code right let me refresh
this and make the UI better I think
something happened something failed all
right
so what what fail I think something in
angular only fails because maybe I
messed up the syntax here let me see if
that is the problem
no that is not the problem whatever
things are stark
parity are deepening right so I had a
coke vehicle it existed a ng-repeat so
what is the problem for it is kind of
let me quickly go and then so the ego
thin sorry
injera paid in and below
okay X in records okay whatever I did
previously work okay whatever this is
correct right okay and why did it fail
okay the table going displayed okay I
can activate it yeah that's what I have
done here the quote and then I can say
quote dot quote because that is going to
be a JSON so let's do first is going on
cuz there is a problem
I think why let's go to the after Jess
is the time I think there is already an
optical code already so what I'll do is
I'll just say this ask you and then I'll
just Union this is Q so that nothing
gets messed up and I'll - first this
page still not working and I don't even
see what is the problem so let me come
on this guy and then still now it should
work all right
and just plenty codes sorry
something got screwed up guys
so what quad CUDA up I'm not sure did we
add anything unnecessary actually I
didn't add anything which is creating
this problem what did i do from the
beginning
into this water eject okay
this may be firsta page
yeah something is working out for it
right so now let me paste that code
which I had in mind
right and refresh it okay good
it is getting this plate now let me the
motors and then I am just reverse this
page cool our code is not working now if
I say Peter and if I say the trip price
this is going to take the pipe yeah I
can see that so the code for Google is
this Apple is none waiting to hit
Amazonas whatever tip flies whatever
yeah that's it so if I have to have one
more quote information added let's see
for family so for Sam we let's retrieve
the place and we like them so for Sam
let's add a tester right so I'm going to
say act okay the test lab size is going
to be added so just a code will be added
and I think it won't be displayed
because we did not have it yeah I think
I added twice just laughing cool so it
is working so this is the angular web UI
whatever we saw in the architecture
diagram so we have created a web UI we
added the code information whatever new
quotes information we have added
whenever we do a retreat those are
getting retrieved okay that's what we
did and how we designed is we created a
zone API keep a proxy and then we merge
that inside the service registry which
is the Eureka's over we named it as you
take a service okay that will be the
project name inside the project you can
check the product in the github in the
github repository I have put that there
and we are going to have a stock service
stock service is going to go to the
Yahoo Finance API and to take the stock
price information real-time PB service
is going to store the code information
of for each user what are all the codes
he has registered to okay so that is
what we did and D we're communicating
from the stock service to the DB server
is using the service registry of the
unicursal okay so that is where you
record comes into picture and we did not
design the code maintenance of it
because it is not made any sense
right after we started designing et
cetera promote so as
you can remove that it's not out of
scope right now okay so that is it that
is what I wanted to show but that there
is one more thing it is notice here we
have not taken care of any resiliency
right what if the stock service goes
down what happens to the message right
what happens to the UI do we get any
exception right let me bring that down
right so let's bring the stock service
down okay I have brought the stock
service now now let me go to the UI and
then retrieve this talk okay nothing is
going to work it's not even saying
anything right we should have said
something so we didn't had any add
anything there right so that is the
problem isn't it so we can have
different design patterns inside this
micro-services architecture so there is
something called the history design
pattern so same way net Netflix as they
are created that okay we can use that to
thin pattern to come up with a fallback
mechanism so if something is failed or
something goes wrong you can go to the
fallback and then you can open the
circuit so any subsequent requests will
be failing and then once the service is
up you can close the circuit so that the
subsequent echoes are successful so that
is one type of design patterns Cystic
since one table is in Batam one more
thing one more problem which we will be
facing in the micro services is the log
traceability
okay how will we trace the log right
some day be serviced in the UI right
right on the you identity becomes how do
we trace the logs right that is a
challenge right now in the micro service
industry so there is a library from
Spring itself it's called spring cloud
sleuth I have also made video on that
already separately where I would have
shown and I will deployed it into a
cloud in moments why you I deployed it
into a vertical foundry and I showed
that example so they have to use that as
well so in this particular example we I
haven't show that but it's just a
dependency which you have to add the
form protection one so that you can have
the trace ID right from the start till
the end so you will have span area
increase ad concepts so you can check my
other
video - no in depth of what is spring
cloud salute on over okay so these are
different problems which we face in
micro service there are so many other
problems as well for example if you
scale the application if you introduce
new version of stock service if you
introduce new stock service new DB
service how will it route automatically
to which service how will the api get
wear out right now we are reacting to a
single port ID
how will it route so in that case we
have to route API gateway itself to the
service registry from the service
associate has now automatically choose
which one is balance and stuff like that
so those things are there so these are
the different things which we have to
consider when designing Microsoft okay
it's not that easy to say okay I am
going to make your service but make sure
that you guys are aware that okay these
are the things which you need to take
care one going to micro service design
pattern okay so I hope you guys found
this video interesting and you learn
something from this particular video if
you liked the video go ahead and like it
if you have any doubts go ahead and drop
that in the comment section below I'll
be able to reply whenever I see it meet
