are going to see what is Google cloud
and what are the different components of
the Google cloud and how we can use
Google cloud to manage and deploy our
application so today I have created a
Google cloud account so I have linked my
credit card and I don't know what
happened they detected $1 from it and
then they finally cancelled it I don't
know what was the reason but I have
created the Google cloud account if you
see here it shows that I have $1 300
credit which is left for 365 days in
this particular filter so let's go
through what is this Google cloud
platform all about and how we can use
Google cloud platform to deploy and
manage our application and what are the
different components which are there
inside the Google cloud platform so if
you see here the URL for the for logging
in to the Google cloud platform is
console dot cloud.google.com so
basically this is called the console so
once you log into the Google cloud
platform
you have this particular dashboard kind
of UI so this is going to be the console
and there are different options here in
the website so what we are going to see
in this particular video is what are
these H different options and what we
can do with them so that is what we are
going to do in this particular video so
once you go into the Google cloud
platform you will be requested to create
a project so for example I have created
a project called tech primers so based
on that every time I deploy an
application so this is basically an
application so the application will have
the URL tech primers dot whatever the
appspot.com or whatever domain which we
give ok so these are the different
options once we log into the console we
see something called cloud launcher so
cloud launcher is something similar to
the marketplace or fader players or D
Cloud Foundry and Roman so you can see
all the different features or the
different third-party libraries or the
services which we can integrate into our
application or we can deploy that into
our application so for example if you
see here there are something called
features so they are just showing up
what all on the premier ones here the
next one is the witch
machine so for example you can deploy a
wordpress application directly into your
application so this will deploy there
were plus VM into your application so
there are lots of those so if I save you
all I can see tons of these right so for
example these are all different
different API so services or
applications which you can deploy into
your application into your project
basically say for example MongoDB so you
can deploy MongoDB into your application
and you I can host it inside the Google
cloud platform okay so there are lots of
other things like LGTB PostgreSQL there
are lots of these so cloud launcher is
the place where you can go and collect
and use these services to deploy into
your application so that is the cloud
launcher so basically it is like a
marketplace where you have lots of
services which you can go and buy or you
can add it to your project basically so
APA Manager is where you have lots of
api's which are there available provided
by Google so for example here if you see
these are the different aps you can
enable and disable these api is for your
application so basically your
application will be exposed to these api
so and google will be using these to
collect some information and saying that
you can also use these to collect your
information about the project or the
product which is deployed so you can
enable or disable them there from the
API manager building is nothing but it
shows the billing information of your
project so for example I have a three
hundred dollar credit I just registered
it few minutes back so it is just
showing those information you can see
you can link a credit card and you can
rename and close the building as well
from their support is where you can
contact a support people directly here
you have community support anti phone
support as well you can go there and
then another gate to whatever you want
okay the next one is the I am and the
admin so this is where we manage our
user roles and responsibilities so for
example here I'm the owner here it shows
as owner so I can add lots of other
people and then manage their roles here
from this I am admin and also I can use
different API is to connect
- this particular cloud consult so I can
control everything here okay the next
car next part is the major tricky one so
the these are the major part of the
Google cloud platform the App Engine
compute engine and the container engine
so if you are familiar with the platform
as a service offering so App Engine is
the platform as a service offering
offering so basically you don't have to
deploy about your infrastructure you
don't have to deploy about your
management of the process where it is
running which VM it is running how
should i Cal it up and all those things
so that will be taken care by the App
Engine so App Engine is nothing but a
platform as a service offering inside
the Google cloud platform okay so there
are lots of documentation as well so if
you go to the home page and if you go to
the navigate to the documentation
section you can see all the
documentation which is out there so that
is how I gotten all these things I was
just going through the documentation and
I'm just summarizing so that you can
understand in a UDL way okay so that is
what is app engine all about so all your
deployments will be done inside App
Engine so whatever application we deploy
we are going to deploy into the App
Engine so if you see here this is the
high-level go view so the App Engine the
container engine and the compute engine
if you see here these three are here
okay
so App Engine is where our application
is going to run and that is what is
going to act as a platform for us so we
will know what is happening in the app
engine only okay container engine and
the compute engine are something at a
low level where you can create your own
app engine using these two so these are
for managing your cluster and these are
for managing infrastructure so compute
engine manages your infrastructure
cluster manages your cluster of nodes
which are connected so in general if you
don't want to use these you can use App
Engine so when you're deploying to App
Engine it will randomly apply into any
Linux machine which is there in that
particular cluster and it will it will
be taken care by Google however if you
want to manage your own cluster and you
want to manage your own infrastructure
then you can use containers Engine and
compute engine okay so that is that is
what
Google provides so Google is basically
providing you all types of options for
you to manage and deploy your
application so along along with the App
Engine what is there inside the App
Engine right so how do we what will be
the database which I can use how do I
store the data so for that purpose
Google is giving something called data
store so data store is for storing your
key value store so something similar to
rate is so Google is providing something
called Google Cloud data so data store
okay or the App Engine data store okay
so you can use that for storing your no
sequel data store so for example here
I chose App Engine data store is your
schema lab no sequel data store so it is
something like a written so you can
store the no sequel you can show the key
the key store information inside the no
sequel data store okay so there is one
more thing called Google Cloud sequel so
which is similar to your SQL database
which is a wrapper around the my sequel
or the co screen you can use either of
the database and which is wrapped around
and Google calls it the Google Cloud
sequels so you can use that from the App
Engine so your application can bind to
these services you can just create them
and deploy to your App Engine and you
can use them so that will be for the if
you want a traditional relational
database okay
the final one would be the storage so
how do we store files right so Google
provides Google Cloud Storage basically
this is the rest exposed service so
which is similar to your Amazon s3
storage object store so Google Stout
storage is similar to that so you can
expose the file storage using the HTTP
rest rest calls okay so if you see here
there are Google server provide space
for transferred so that is what it is
all about so you can see all those here
whatever I spoke about so you can see
those indeed website so there is
something called datastore which is
nothing but your Google App Engine
datastore storage is Google Cloud
storage
sequel is Google Cloud sequence okay so
that is all there so you can create an
instance here
at any cost and you'll be charged based
on that so you're bright on my building
hasn't started because I have not
deployed any application but my building
will start when I keep creating these
services and then deploying applications
here and start using it so that is the
thing also they have something called
big big table so if you want to if you
are aware about Google's big table so
it's the same thing you can use that as
well as a service and that there are
load balancers as well so how do we
handle load balancer so Google has a
inbuilt load balancer so you can
configure the load balancer so it
automatically distributes the traffic
among the servers so let's say you
scaled your application to 2 or 3
instances so Google takes care of
distributing the traffic to whichever
instance or the port number or wherever
the host or wherever you of the kitchen
is running so it takes care of routing
that automatically so it does Network
load balancing as a HTTP load balancing
and that's what this is all the same way
they have a DNS clout in so that is how
they manage the DNS and route to that
particular instance wherever it is
running ok finally they also have the
big data support as well so if you see
here there is a separate section for big
data you can use all these different
tools which are tools and services which
are available here bigquery pop signal
pops up and data probe data flow ml
engine and genomics calls the different
services which you can use for your
application
which are related to the Big Data terms
again these are just the tools which you
use for monitoring and deployment and
all those things so we will discuss that
in the feature series apart from that
there is also log in here so if you see
here start waiver so this is going to
show us how how's our application
preferring how's our logging what is the
health of the application we can monitor
for errors all these are going to be
managed from this particular section ok
also if you see here there is a separate
console window here so if I click on
that you will be able to literally a so
for example I clicked on it
and let's see what's happening so if you
see here the console is literally
opening and this will be connected to a
VM which is hosted inside the Google
cloud platform and I can do all the
normal commands which I do one on the
next machine so that is this particular
option so when we do deploy applications
ready we will be able to see that right
now I think it is not going to let up
done but I can expose it to the next
window so I will just expose it to the
next tab so let's see how it shows main
ones that rest of the options are like
sending feedback asking for help and
then there is a notification stroy it
shows what what is happening okay
so if you see here yeah our console has
come you can type whatever you want
so you see here there is only one file
under my project called ed primers which
is nothing but rate meter flow so let me
do a carrot okay it's just saying go
welcome to Google clock so this is where
we will be deploying an application or
this is how you put your application
here and start your start or deploy your
application so that we will see in the
next section but yeah this is the
console which is there also Google
provides something called Google Cloud
SDK or the Google App Engine SDK so that
is used for deploying your application
from your local machine to the Google
cloud platform so let's say our
application is built locally right so we
can do testing using that so you can
just install your App Engine locally and
literally you can host a Google cloud
platform locally as well also you can
use the same SDK to push your
application to the Google cloud platform
as well so you can do that time so you
can push it to the local instance which
is running in your machine as well as
you can push it to the cloud platform
which is their hosted global so that
that is an SDK provided by Google cloud
so we can use that to deploy as well
I think that's it about this particular
console so the console is basically a
central place where we manage our
application and Google cloud platforms
App Engine is a platform as a service
offering it also provides the
infrastructure as a service so you can
you can go ahead and create your own
clusters you can go ahead and create
your own be m0i go ahead and create your
own containers on all those things so
Google provides that as well but I'm
interested more on the Google App Engine
because that is going to be your
platform as a service offering there you
don't have to do anything from an
application developer perspective we
just push your application your
application is deploy into the cloud and
you get your application up in no time
so that is what I'm keen in testing now
let's see in the next video so we can
deploy an application into Google flow
and also I can compare and contrast with
the Cloud Foundry how cloud foundries
and how Google platform is I haven't
tested the AWS yet I don't know I was
just skeptical because I saw that I have
the link that credit card information
and I was like skeptical that they will
detect money from that but I didn't want
to invest money on that yet
oh yeah now we'll see how it goes so
I'll do a video on AWS if I'm
comfortable there as well but yeah in
the next video we will see how to deploy
an application into the Google cloud
platform until then see you guys thank
you for watching so if you like you like
my video do subscribe and like and
comment if you want me to do video on
any specific topic go ahead and comment
it down below I can do that based on my
availability meet you again in the next
video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
