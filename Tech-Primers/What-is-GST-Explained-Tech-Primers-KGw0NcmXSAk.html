are going to see what is GST so if you
are in India currently so you will know
this bus term GST so that is getting in
Belem meter right from today July past
so let's see what is this GST and I will
tell you what I know about GST I just
driven through this clear tax
description on GST and how will a tough
ex-husband how it is going to change the
way tax was levied on different items
and how it was previously and they are
going to compare how it is going to be
after GST is implemented alright so
let's get started so GST is nothing but
goods and services tax so it is
basically a multi stage tax so let's see
do you introduce codes you will know
what is this multi stage tax so
basically the tax will be levied on the
value addition at each level all right
also the GST is not something new which
the government has done so this GST was
implemented long back so we will it
started long back basically the idea of
jht shattered long data forms before the
for 16 years okay so we'll see that also
the history of GST how it started and
there it was blocked and how the
progress went and how we are right all
right so what is the GST and multistage
taxes right so the multi stage let's
understand what is this multi stage tax
so basically if you consider a product
right so before the product is created
the manufacturer while the raw materials
then he manufactures that then he moves
that to a warehouse from the water hose
he moves it to a retailer from the
retailer it goes to a customer so that
is how it happens right a typical
product reaches a customer in this
particular life cycle so what happens is
every time if you move from one stage to
another so for example when you buy your
raw materials you have to pay a tax when
you manufacture and sell it to a
wholesaler you have to pay a tax so when
it comes from the wholesaler to the
retailer the retailer has to pay attacks
the
Hotel has to pay attack then from the
retailer to the customer the customer
has to pay attack so it's like taxes
levied at every stage of it and the tax
is constant so how much ever you buy how
much ever you sell so the tax is always
constant so what happened was everybody
was paying the same amount of tax for
even though there was a small value
addition so from the wholesaler to
retailer there won't be much of
valuation you will just stamp is label
or something like that that's it but
still you have to pay again the tax so
if you consider the whole lifecycle you
are paying the same tax in too many
places right so that is why GST has been
created so let's see what is the value
addition so as I said like stamping a
label is a valuation so for example if
you take this particular example buying
the raw materials is getting your cotton
materials for your for making your
clothes and then you make that into a
t-shirt so that is a value addition from
the t-shirt to adding a label that is
another valuation from the label and
then again sealing it and packaging it
that is another valuation so these are
different value additions so so what in
GST what we are going to do is we are
going to pay tax only for the value
addition so the guy who bought the raw
material he would have paid the tax so
the guy who buys the t-shirt he will pay
that tax so the guy who is tamping the
label doesn't have to pay the tax which
is already paid so you just add the tax
only you just pay the tax only for the
value addition so that is what is going
to be changing so that is that is the
basic difference between the GST and the
previous tax policies right so if you
notice this is how it will be
so the previous the previous pattern was
like when you buy a raw material you pay
a back then you when you manufacture it
and when you sell it to a wholesaler you
have to pay the back plus the exercise
duty and then from the wholesaler to the
retailer we go to pay VAT and then find
again from the retailer to the customer
you have to pay back so the VAT is paid
at each level right so here also we are
going to pay the tax at each level
however it is going to be only on the
value added by that particular
sellers okay so that is what is the
major difference
all right so how does this jst work
right so there are three different GST
one is the central GST one is a state
GST and one is the interstate GST so it
is like a central government will be
controlling it but it is for interstate
sales so let's say you are buying from
one state you are buying from Gujarat
and selling it into Maharashtra
so that so you have to pay a GST in that
case you don't have to pay the state
government but you have to pay the
central government stating that it is an
interstate sale on the interstate tax
okay but if you are inside the state you
have to inside the state it will be
central plastic so it will be 3 GST + s
GST ok that'll be two taxes so that is
what is mentioned here so previously we
previously these terms were called as
back and back and service tax now it is
all like GST either it is central GST or
state GST or iest interstate GST right
so for example this is the old regime so
previously we used to call it back to
that and service tax now it is going to
be called see GST and s GST and the
interstate tax was previously called a
central sales tax and service that now
that is going to be changed into a GST
okay that is the major change so in all
your results you might be you must be
seeing these terms only so you won't see
any back term or the service tax
hereafter ok so let's take a typical
example rate that is what is explained
here so I will show you so let's say the
manufacturer buys the product or the raw
material at 100 ok
so they buy a raw material cost of
higher the cost of 100 rupees let's say
right let us take it as hundred rupees
so the tax which a pays 10% let's say so
10% is the tax which you would need to
pay for this particular product right so
he bought the raw materials he paid 10
percentage of tax so the cost is 110
right so and also the manufacturers
bought the raw materials 110 he
manufactured the product and he is now
selling at 150 right so he's having a
profit of 40 rupees so now he is selling
at 150 now the tax he has to pay is 15
percentage so 15 percent just once of T
is whatever of 100 is whatever 165
and then the cost adds up to like 165
all right so same way for every every
stage you have to pay that much amount
of tax so if you notice here 195 again
you have to pay the 10% sorry not 15%
percentage rate across everywhere so 10%
off of t1 of T is 15 same way 195 is
19.5 so everywhere you have to pay the
same ten postage tax even though you did
a small value addition of only few
rupees all right so that is what is the
current tax regime so if you see GST how
it will change is the same 100 you are
buying the same raw material five
hundred rupees you will pay the ten
percentage tax right so you are reliable
for only ten ten rupees so 110 so now
the manufacture is going to sell at 140
if he sells as 140 the 10% of tax is 14
however the 10 is already paid by the
previous guy when he bought the raw
material so you don't have to pay 14 you
just deduct a 14-10 and you pay only
food so the manufacturer pays only for
the manufacture or the the next level
guy he paying only for 4 rupees okay
same way for the next value addition for
example later he is adding and labeled
nice to live he's adding evaluation of
30 rupees and the tax for that is 17 so
he already the tax paid is 14 so he has
to pay only 3 rupees tax so that is what
the change happens in GST versus the
previous regime so if you notice the
previously the product same product
would have got shifted 214 rupees 50
paisa and now it is 187 okay so the
PAC's if you see has got reduced because
the tax is accumulated so it's like
multistage tax so you don't have to pay
tax every for the whole of the item for
whatever value addition you added you
need to pay tax only for that so if you
notice here the value addition Falls 40
rupees and 40 rupees of 10 percentage
whatever is 4 rupees that is what they
are paying same way here the valuation
is 30 rupees and 3 rupees in fact so
that is the major difference so I'll
repeat again so GST is the goods and
services tax so the change in this
particular GST is you will be paying tax
per value addition only at each stage of
so let's say manufacturers buying a
product so he will pay some tax there
and then he creates the manufactures the
product so he doesn't have to pay the
tax for the whole product he has to
reduce the tax he already paid for the
raw materials and he has to pay the tax
only for the final value addition which
we give so same way for every stage
people have to pay the tax only for the
validation they made so that is the
major difference in GST and that is the
change in GST right so as I said earlier
this is the history of GST so if you
notice your GST was initially proposed
during the period of wash pie so when no
much pie was the Prime Minister so that
time GST was proposed and it was started
so in 2000 was started and later in 2004
that these are the different stages so
you can go through this I'll just paste
this URL in the description below so you
can take a look at in depth of what are
the history so right now if you notice
here 2017 be online so right from today
July 1st you can see all the bills the
table data GST information but the
government is saying that it is you
should be doing it from today however
I'm not sure if everyone is following
that and everyone has updated that
software so you might find some delays
in in the received with the updated GST
information right in in some outlets so
so that's what about GST so if you have
any doubts or queries a drop drop in the
comment below so if you haven't
