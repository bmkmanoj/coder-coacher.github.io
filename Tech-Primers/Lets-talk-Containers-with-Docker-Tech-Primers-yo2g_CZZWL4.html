we're going to talk about containers
along with taco so if you had heard
about the latest buster containers are
the buzz term right so containers and
darker so if you hear two people talking
about containers you don't have any clue
right basically so let's talk about
containers and understand what is the
container and what is this docker okay
so what are containers so containers are
nothing but lightweight image of a
package basically so what is there in
the package so you have the code the
runtimes the tools which are required
for the runtime and also the libraries
which are record for the runtime
additionally there are some settings
so basically container is a package or
image which has the complete set of
software information which is packaged
in a simple image okay so that is that
is a container so what are the
advantages of a container right so why
why why container is like much talked
about because the containers can be used
across OSS so you can use that
particular image can be used in the
Linux machine or you can use it in the
Windows machine or even you can even use
it in a cloud machine okay
also the other advantage of containers
is that you can isolate the software
from its surroundings so for examples
right over you will have a development
environment you will have a UAT or
staging environment and then you have
production right so when you create an
image the same runtime the tools the
system libraries are all packaged in one
image so you will get the same image
across all these environments and the
lesser lesser coupling is there with
your hardware so in general what we do
we have a different configuration for
deltas and complication prod and test
right so but only the configuration but
also sometimes the runtime environment
itself varies right because it sells the
hardware but container packages them all
into a single image okay so that is the
basic idea of a container so if you take
a traditional virtual machine right so
previously before the visual
virtual mention machines came into
picture right so we had these bad metals
so bare metals basically had like a
hardware and then you had an OS and then
you had an application so basically
every application was deployed into a
complete bare metal machine basically
you have an Hardware OS and the app
that's it however the virtualization
concept change the way you deployed
application so if you see the
traditional virtualization or the VM how
it is is we have a server or a hardware
and then there is the host voice so
which is the ho ace which is record for
the server to function and then there
was a concept of hypervisor so the
hypervisor will now provide us to create
virtual machines so the guest OS and the
app is all virtual machine so you can
create n number of virtual machine and
you can deploy your application so this
basically allowed us to segment a
particular server into different
machines basically called as the virtual
machines so if you see this is how we
have been deploying our application that
you create a VM inside a hypervisor and
this particular VM will be specific for
an application so you can install any a
voice in that particular being ok so
this is how we are doing traditional VM
management right now so why do we need
it now right so it was all good so what
what is the product what is the problem
in that right so why do we need
containers now the major drawback of the
virtualization concept is there are lots
of space which are getting wasted if you
see there are lots of OS installations
which are happening in the same
hypervisor and also the space is getting
wasted so you literally have one was
already running in the server and then
you have OS per instance right so that
is unnecessary waste of space and also
the licensing cost associated with each
way so there are some times instance
level licensing which are there for
oasis so that cost is like unnecessary
right and also the complex configuration
of the VMs and the hypervisor so that is
all that all made people think that ok
why do we need to use visualization so
why can't we think apart from
virtualization and that's when
containers evolved
okay so if you see a traditional
Container architecture how does it look
like you have a server you will have a
host always however there won't be any
hypervisor so instead you have something
called container directly and then the
apps will be hosted in time that inside
the container so that is how it is so
this is this is the typical container
architecture so previously if you had
seen the VM architecture you had an
hypervisor and be created VM and never
guessed oasis specific to each
application so the concept of guest OS
is gone now so you have a single Louis
so the container is an image which takes
care of all those which are required for
the application okay so how does the
docker container look like so it is
almost the same the only difference is
the docker engine which is there above
the OS which will be what you call an
abstraction layer between the container
and the OS so you have a container with
the app same way you have different
containers in the same OS but docker
engine would be the abstraction for the
containers to speak with the hose ways
or they hide well okay so what are the
advantages of talker
all right so talker is basically very
lightweight so if you compare the
virtual machine they to V M so the VM
has a complete OS and an app and also
the set of libraries which are equit
which is so heavy
however if you see docker or the
containers they are very lightweight
because it's a it's just a package it is
like a zip file or a car boat but it
doesn't have any OS installed it's just
a static bin or a library okay and also
docker is based on open standards see
these containers container platforms is
based on local open standard so they can
be run on all major Linux distributions
and also the different OSS like Windows
and others as well oh also it can be run
on the bare metal as well same with a VM
so even these these container platforms
can be run on the bmz as well so instead
of the Oh baby
OS the hypervisor will internally have a
docker image it so
you can do that as well same way with
the band metal on the cloud so we can
run containers of the docker and D cloud
so what is basically talk right I forgot
to cover that so docker is a
implementation of container platform
okay so docker is evolving day by day
and also it's becoming a platform in it
in itself sorry so it's becoming a
platform in itself as well so basically
docker is an implementation of container
platform and people are widely using it
now and also as you know it's open
source okay so the docker containers
isolate the application from one another
and from the underlying infrastructure
so as you had seen in the previous image
it isolates the application from one
another so you don't have different
applications deployed in the same voice
even though the OS is same okay it
creates a container it creates basically
a boundary for your application so that
you don't cross your boundary and touch
the other application space so that is
what talker helps us in doing okay and
also draw our docker provides a full
isolation limit the application with
into a single container instead of the
entire machine so that's what we that's
what I told right so it will have
isolation limit only to that particular
container and not to the entire machine
so you don't have to worry about these
space concern so docker uses the there
is something called user space in Linux
kernel if you have heard about user
space or the namespace so docker uses
that to allocate space for that
particular image okay so this is how how
you can use docker so the additional
advantage of docker is so let's say
there are two different woes so all are
having a server
oh-hoh so it and also the rocker engines
running now I have some containers
running in the host one and this image
can be shipped from the host one to host
two okay so you just create an image in
host one the same image can be shipped
to host two and you can get that up and
running within minutes okay that is the
major advantage of talker so you just
create a docker image with a set of
libraries and set of
things that you need along with your
application code and stuff like that
so you just create a docker image and
that particular doctor image can be
deployed into any host and you can get
your application up and running within
minutes okay so that is the major
advantage of talker and that is why
people are going towards talker and its
usage okay and then the container
platform basically so that's it about
the docker so I I don't have any
hands-on as such for docker I haven't I
have installed docker engine but I
haven't tried it yet I don't know
whether in my laptop will be able to
handle it and I don't know if it works
on Mac right so and I haven't done any
detailed investigation on that but I'll
let you know once I have some hands-on
experience on that I will just make
another video so if you like this
particular video go ahead and hit a like
button if you have any doubts or queries
on any topic give me that in the
comments below so that's it but for this
particular video meet you again in the
next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
