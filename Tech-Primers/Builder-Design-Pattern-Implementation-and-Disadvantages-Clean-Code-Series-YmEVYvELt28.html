primers builder patterns are patterns
they generally often use them when we
are writing lots of ap answer however we
rarely create them on their own in our
source code we generally do that while
creating test cases when you want to
mock up objects when we want to create
values of pojos that's when we create
builder patterns however builder
patterns are useful when you have lots
of objects and you want to create
multiple values from a POJO and you want
to create them in a more immutable way
let's see how we can create built a
pattern from scratch
I have a builder pattern folder here I'm
going to create a class called builder
example so this will be the main class
from where we will be accessing the
Builder classes and just going to create
a public static one me so for simplicity
I'm going to create a POJO called
form so in general what do we have in a
phone right how do we assemble a phone
we generally have the
back panel
we have the front panel as well which
has the screen and stuff so I'm just
going to add it as front panel back
panel we do also have the processor we
have the type of processor which we have
and also the camera these are the
different features of a phone right so
these constitute a phone so I am going
to create a four with these features so
how do we generally created as a POJO we
generally add the getters and setters
right so we add the Gators and sisters
and we create the phone here so let's
say I create a phone call 1 plus so what
do I do I just create a new phone I just
say 1 plus
dot set camera has 12 megapixel 1 plus
dot set
back panelist sandstone finish
front analyst
ceptin families I'm honored one sort set
camera we have done what else is
spending processor it so let's say I
don't know exactly what processor it is
or something like Snapdragon let's say
right and just saying it's not driving
okay so if you notice here we are not
forcefully saying for a phone for a
phone creation you need everything so if
let's say I don't provide the camera it
still creates a phone with oneplus
however I don't want to do that right so
in these kind of cases when you want to
have immutable objects and you want to
create an object together and you want
to mix and match so if I have a default
value I can use it if I don't I can I
don't have to use it and I want to do it
in a much neater fashion where I want to
create it in one shot so for that we use
generally built up patterns but there
are other ways as well so let's say if I
don't have setters so if I will let's
say remove these items right let's say I
just add only think eaters and I add
constructors the telescopic constructor
so if let's say I add telescopic
constructor so what I will do is I will
just add front panel for the first time
then I'll add front panel and back panel
then I'll add fan panel back panel and
the processor the next time I'll add all
the three all the four right so this is
called telescopic constructor creation
right where I will force everybody to
use all the features or all the objects
of the phone creation right all the
features are the or the parts of the
phone creation okay so here I am just
posed to to enter everything isn't it so
if I just provide only the camera I
won't have the back panel I won't have
the front panel I won't have the
processor or what I will have to do is I
will have to remove all these and then I
will now to enforce saying create all
create with everything but however I
want to have
some default values right in that case
there could be some place where you want
to provide only the front panel there
could be some case where you want to
provide a different back panel so for
example you can change the camera you
can change the back panel you can change
the processor and stuff like that right
so that is when you use the Builder
design pattern so I don't want to use
anything I'll just create delete
everything so I have a POJO I'll create
something called a builder inside the
pool and this is going to be a public
static inner class which I'll just
called as a builder
and I'm going to have exactly the same
I'm gonna have everything as the same
and I'll create a constructor with
different methods which are going to be
not the setter methods but these are
called the Builder method so what do
these methods return these methods are
going to return the instance of the
Builder itself if you know so why let's
see that I'm going to create a front
panel by pausing let's say string so
this will act as a setter however I will
be returning the instance of the builder
itself so we will be setting the front
panel they start fronting on equal to
run panel
so this way I'll be sitting every other
object so I'll do the back panel now
I'll just set the back panel
next I need to set the processor
and finally the camera
you
so now that all my objects have said I
need to somehow create an object out of
these right that is why I need a method
called build or you can have any type of
method but in our case I'm going to
create method called build so we need to
build a phone correct we need to build a
phone in order to do that we need to do
all of this so we need to pass this as a
constructor we need to pass the Builder
instance to the constructor of the phone
so we don't have any constructor here
I'm going to create the constructor so
I'm going to say
for
with the Builder
and we need to assign the front panel
from the Builder to thee home so this is
how we copy the objects from the Builder
to the food we can copy everything the
same way back panel we can copy it from
the Builder back panel
I'm going to say processor then camera
processor camera to be how copied all
the objects from the Builder to the
phone and we are copying it only when we
are doing a build so whenever we create
a phone using the Builder we pass the
objects to the Builder and then we say
build the phone objects gets built so
this is how you can create objects so if
you have if you want to have default
configuration you can provide that in
the Builder and when you create the
object you don't have to provide
everything in one go so how do we create
these objects we will be creating using
phone builder will just say builder
equal to new phone builder dot now we
can set all the back panel we can say
sandstone
front panel we can say wondered
you
camera we can see it one megapixel
and the processor with a snapdragon some
check
let's say 625
this is how you created a builder now we
need to create a phone out of it we can
say build or dot build this will create
a phone out of it so this is the place
where the objects gets created
you
so the phone is what if you print the
phone you can get access to all the
values from the for all right so if I
just print the phone
so for simplicity let me over IT to
string
I'll just use the two string builder to
create a object over to string builder
is not there I'll just say create a two
string using string builder if you
notice your string builder also in
itself is a builder pattern so let's
cover that in a moment so mean by let me
run this program so this is how you can
create a builder where you want to
provide some specific values if you
notice here you are getting the values
winter we are getting the value sprinter
so if let's say I don't want to provide
a back panel I can remove the back panel
however I can default some values into
the builders here I can provide some
default configuration let's say this is
a phone right so I'm providing some
default configurations for the phone and
when I am creating using the Builder
pattern I can overwrite the different
configurations here so that the phone is
different so let's say if I want to
create an iPhone I can give different
back from different from different
camera or different processor and I can
create a different phone object so this
way I don't have to rebuild my phone I
don't have to create a complex way in
creating an object where I need to say
new phone off and then I have to pass
different different arguments I need to
do setters like how we did here we don't
have to do that we can create a builder
and we can't reuse that builder to build
objects so this is how you can build the
you can use Builder pattern
whenever you are using in your
implementation so to build a patterns
are generally used when you have complex
setters you have lots of arguments it
will pose immutability so basically if
you create a builder it will force you
to create an immutable you cannot change
that particular object so if you notice
here in the phone there is no setters
here you cannot change the object
because you already created it using the
Builder pattern so it will force you to
do imitability similar examples which we
use already are the Builder pattern the
string buffer or the string builder so
this is using string buffer but in
general if you use string builder you
would have seen that we use the Builder
pattern document builder is another
example local builder is another example
as well so I'll just mention the example
I'll remove this
you
you
you
stringbuilder document builder and also
there is something called local builder
there are lots of different examples
which you can see in the current usage
of spring if you use spring if you are
using spring reactive components then
you can see different builders spring
reactive or if you are using mock MVC
builders there is something called
mokomichi builder api you can see lots
of builder design pattern there so these
are different examples of filter design
patterns in our common due to day usage
in general if you notice builder
patterns are useful when you have
complex setters and you have lots of
opera lots of parameters you want to
create and you want to make it immutable
before seeing the disadvantages of the
Builder pattern let's just mention the
different usages of the Builder pattern
for our documentation so that you can go
through at a glance the Builder platen
solves the multiple constructor problem
for the telescoping constructor it also
has static inner classes which is
nothing but the Builder
it internally calls the record
constructors because we are setting it
using the Builder so it if you want a
specific value you can set it if you
don't set it it won't be called so you
won't have multiple constructors it will
internally take care of it also it
removes the need for setters
so we are not using any setters if you
notice in the phone example we are not
using any setters we are directly using
builder pattern so it negates the use of
setters here now let's compare the
disadvantages of the Builder pattern
the major disadvantage is it is
immutable we cannot change the object
once you have created it if you notice
here once you are credit with the using
the builder you have build an object you
cannot change it there is no setter in
the phone it's all just catalyst and you
can't even access the constructor the
other disadvantages it has inner inner
static class which is the Builder which
itself is a disadvantage also builder
design patterns are designed first so
you will have to think about it before
creation of this particular object so
you will have to design this first and
then you will have to go for the
implementation or else
it is not going to work because builder
design pattern is designed in such a way
that you can you have to design it first
and then you can use it so which itself
is a disadvantage you cannot modify it
as and when you go the other one is it
is complex so due to its complex nature
if you notice here this particular phone
object was very small initially and now
it has become complex it has got an
inner class called builder and then you
have duplicate or redundant objects and
then we are creating lots of methods
here and then finally we are calling a
build so it is little bit complex when
you want to create when you want to
understand these lines it is little bit
complex so which is a disadvantage of
the Builder pattern however in general
if you know how to use the Builder
pattern you can use it to solve lots of
problems example the multiple
constructor problem
so that's all I wanted to cover in this
particular video hope you liked it later
