are going to see what is reactive
programming reactive programming is a
programming with us internals data
streams streams are nothing but a set of
events which are ordered in time for
example time is a stream of events so
basically all the seconds and minutes
and has our own events right so these
are wrong streams so for example tweets
are also even so these are events and
the programming which is reacting on
these events is called reactive
programming so Netflix what they did is
they saw this opportunity of reactive
programming from Microsoft so Microsoft
used reactive programming internally for
their frameworks and they had used that
in dotnet so and that was called
reactive extensions rx okay so Netflix
what they saw they saw this opportunity
and they started using reactive
programming in India Netflix API so so
there is something called rx Java so
that is a Netflix API so like us there
are lots of api's which are available
out there and this is not a new concept
which was created recently so it was
receive this particularly active
manifesto which we see here this was
published in 2014 so there are lots of
libraries which we can use for reactive
programming in general what does
reactive programming says systems are
generally reactive when they have when
they are responsive there they respond
in timely manner so for example if you
give a request and if the request should
be resolved within like milliseconds or
seconds so if you have a REST API and
the REST API should return your response
within milliseconds or seconds so that
is what a response responsive main here
simply resilient so how resilient your
REST API or the system is to in terms of
failures so how is it handling the
failure and how is it taking care of
replication isolation delegation within
the components so that is the resilient
back elasticity how the system is
responsive under varying workload so if
there are lots of requests coming in at
the same time so how is the system
taking care of that and finally the
message driven part so as in current
messaging so in case of reactive systems
the messaging will be a synchronous
basically what a synchronous maizes you
send a request and you don't wait for
the response instead you just register a
callback to that particular request and
the once the request is completed the
messages will be pushed to these all
back method so that that's the a
synchronous messaging okay so that is
what reactive programming is all about
so other things about reactive is the
reactive in case of rxj so I will show
you an example with rxjs so as you see
here this is the API which Netflix has
created so if you see here this is the
github link for the reactive xrx Java
which Netflix has created so they have
also other versions of this particular
API rx groovy rx closure and arcs color
so so this is how you write basically so
I'll show you an example which I wrote
but how this rx Java works is they work
on the principle of observable design
pattern so if you are other about the
ice tray table and the observe so I try
table hyperbole is basically when you
want to pull data from a list or
connection so bi trace right bi take
what we basically those will pull the
data from these I travel and then we do
a next and then we get the data and do
something around that so observable is
then we push the data so basically the
server side is it's considered as a
server side right so from there the data
is pushed to for the client side so that
the client doesn't have to wait for it
so whenever the data is available the
observable will push the data to us and
whenever there is an exception or or if
they complete the data is completed if
the scenes are completed then those will
be notified back to the callback so that
is what our observable done so that is
what the same this reactive programming
is all about and the RX Java does the
same thing so Netflix has implemented
those observable patterns and they have
come up with self functional style where
you can use the observable library to do
something
which is functional okay so what next
metric defines this particular reactor
or the RX Java L is a library for
composing the synchronous and even based
program using observable sequences for
the JVM and these are all based on
reactive extension so if you see this
particular diagram this is what shows
the observable pattern you can just go
through that I'll drop the link in the
description below so you can take a look
at what Netflix has to say about the
observable and their implementation now
let's go to the example which I wrote so
if you see here what I have done is
uniform this is a basically a spring
board application I have just added rx
Java code so this is the dependency
which we are using for using reactive
programming from Netflix so you see here
the group IDs ComNet 6rx java and the
artifact is rx Java open core diversion
number which I'm using is 0.20 dot seven
so this is going to do this nothing but
a library which you can use for doing
reactive programming okay so this is
going to give a observable different
pattern and the functional type so let's
go to the example so what I am doing
here is I'm just creating an observable
object so the class this class is called
react example and I'm just creating an
observable object okay and then and I'm
using this particular example and I'm
calling a gate method so I'm just
writing a method called get get data so
that this gives me the observable
interface for the user so what I have
done is I created a model called user so
I am using Lombok so long Bach is a
compile-time hojo bidder so you can just
annotate it with teeth and it
automatically just HD photos so I don't
have to write the Gator sitters and the
Constructors on the two strings all
these are taken care by Lombok so that
is what I am using here if you see the
dependency I've added lompoc here okay
so that is what is done here so I'm
using the users
model so I'm basically using giving a
list of users to this particular gate
data so I am using a guest users method
where I am just framing some object so I
am just creating three objects with the
name Bob Peter and Chris and then the
salary of ten thousand twenty thousand
or ten thousand again okay so it is just
a static data which I am pausing to this
particular observable so what we are
doing to do here is we are going to
create an observable pattern or a
subscriber basically okay for every
every subscriber action okay I'm going
to check if it is subscribed or not so
basically you can control if the client
has subscribed or not so what I have if
you see here what I have done is I am
creating object of this observable and
then I'm saying subscribe so that is
where this particular piece of code in
be triggered so so that is why we are
checking if it is subscribed or
unsubscribe to see if we see here what I
am doing is I'm checking if the
subscriber is on subsequent not
unsubscribe basically subscribed so once
the user is subscribe what I am doing is
I am getting the users list and
streaming over that and I am saying on
every user call the subscriber not on
next so whenever I hit the subscriber
tour on next T callback which I have
registered to the subscriber will be
caught so if you see here how I register
the callback is this is the contact so
if you notice this is the callback okay
so I need to do a observable tour
subscribe so if I go to the
implementation so this coming from the
observables class which is huge actually
so this is coming from the observable
care class so there we have the
SUBSCRIBE button so the first argument
is nothing but t if i go to the object
the first argument is nothing but these
or next which is basically he call back
the second object is the own error the
third of the typic on complete so
whenever there is a callback
implementation called so for example
here we later on next so whenever you do
on next this will be hit so I'm just
printing it out so whenever the on next
is called I am just printing and then I
am just sleeping for one second just to
just for us to show how the reactive
programming box or the callback work so
the next
argument is the error so whenever we do
on error what I am doing is I am just
printing saying exception and then I am
just printing the exception which be
revealed and finally the third argument
is I'm just printing out completed so
what I am doing is after I iterated all
the list and this calling the
uncompleted method so that is when we
get notified saying it's completed so
what we are doing here is we are
creating a observable from the gate data
and using the observable we are calling
the SUBSCRIBE and then we are
registering a callback
they are registering an error method and
then we are finding registering a
completed method inside the gate data we
are creating an observable string
basically we are creating an observable
stream and inside that for every
subscribe the scopes curb action so for
we are checking if it is subscribed or
not if it is subscribe they for every
users list we are streaming and calling
the subscriber dot on next and that is
received in the callback and then we are
sleeping for one minute sorry one second
and then finally once all the stream is
completed we are just calling the
uncompleted so let us run this
particular program so what I expect is
for every one second I am going to print
the users I need to get the users
printed and finally I need to get a
completed so basically if you see the
SUBSCRIBE method so this is an a
synchronous call if you see here it so
whenever there is a string which has
been called on or next week it's a
response back in T called back here so
if you see here if we notice here the
users Bob will rerun again I didn't
notice when you can see here Bob got
printed Peter Kostis Chris printed and
finally completely caught printed and
there was the one-second delay because
we had a delay here okay so if you see
here these are the callbacks
t43 print statement so the callbacks and
the final one will be completed come
back so whatever we repeat here we are
going to print that is what we did our
knowledge check if there is an exception
right so what if there is an exception
on B then we did a string okay so what
I'm going to do is I am going to post
fully trigger an error exception so
basically on completed and all error
statements basically it will complete or
end the stream so if you are available
Java H streams noodle clean dry for a
general statements are ordered
terminating statement so these
statements nd stream so if you see here
if you notice here when the Bob got
printed and when I called the on error
there was an exception by the said 'wow
exception and the ignitions are
completed the program got terminated
basically so that is the terminating
command so on other and all completed
are terminating command so it will never
proceed after that so that is why so if
there is an exception or if we handle
something in the exception here you can
call the honor so basically what we are
saying here is the client should be
independent of how we handle the
exception so the client wouldn't see
that exception the client should be able
to use the callback and handle how the
exception is received so that is what we
are saying here the client did not get
any exception instead we are just
calling and all other saying okay there
is an exception you handle it however
you want
okay that is that is what this
particularly active of the SUBSCRIBE
method is using okay so this is one of
the example of how you do reactive
programming so instead of using your
users list stream here we can all an
external service here so for example
let's say if you want to stream the
Twitter data so you can call the Twitter
service here and then you can stream the
data here and then you can filter it out
and call the on next for the subscriber
so based on that you can process the
data and push it to the UI or to
whatever you want with that stink later
okay so basically this is how you
implement reactive programming so the
client side you have a subscriber user
subscribe and the observer will will be
shaming the data and then pushing the
data back to the callback so you can
handle that call back here and do
whatever you want you can again call
some others so so something like that
but this is the typical example of how
you implemented reactive programming
