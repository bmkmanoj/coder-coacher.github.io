you heard of the term called Splunk if
you are working on micro sources and if
you haven't heard of the term called
Splunk then you are probably not
monitoring your logs or monitoring your
infrastructure let's see what is plunk
and how we can use plus for different
day to day purpose inside micro services
world or even without mic responses for
monitoring some that's based on
press the bell icon on the YouTube app
and never miss any update from tech
primers Splunk is a software which
provides wide variety of options for us
to configure for an example we can
monitor the logs we can search across
logs we can create an index we can
stream all our logs into a common
location and we can search that
particular coal log directory so we
don't have to log into the Linux machine
we can directly go to Splunk and you can
search across machines or across your
deployments so a typical example would
be if you are working on micro services
environment and you have lots of
micro-services and you want to monitor
the logs or you want to traverse through
these rocks you can use plunk once you
stream all the logs to Splunk you can
use a common identifier and then you can
search the logs across microservices how
Splunk works is you need to provide a
Splunk server and you you will have a
Splunk collector installed in your local
machine or your cloud machines for
example I am using this plant cloud here
what I have done is I have uploaded the
data manually but you can stream the
data real time if you have a Splunk
collector installed in your vsi machines
or any any machine which you have if
let's say you are in a cloud vendor
infrastructure for example Amazon or
Cloud Foundry they do have services
where you can stream your logs
automatically it is Splunk so they have
this plunk in prescription and the logs
get redirected to these plunk instance
so let's say this is how the logs get
redirected and this is the UI so this is
this plunk you and this is how this
plunk UI looks like what I have done is
I have created an account and display
Splunk cloud and I have uploaded some
log files here so that I can show you
how to search or how does it show so
this is how Splunk shows up so this is
the typical Splunk dashboard which you
can see which you use for searching so
the example which I have
here is I have uploaded the log files
here so I'm going to search across the
log for example here I have a source
file called tutorial data dog zip and
then I had different sources so you have
something called host here this shows
what host it is currently it is the
local host because I am annually
uploaded if you are streaming it from
different host the host show up here the
next one is this source so these are
different files which are having the
data right basically the source of
information so if you don't have any
files if you are having micro services
then you will have the microservices
names right so Skype is something which
you want to group by so let's say you
want to group some specific set of logs
on to a different source type you can
group them and you can traverse by that
as well so if I let's say I select
bender since this will filter out the
logs based on the source type called
vendor sales so only the logs which are
specific to the vendor vendor sales that
will be displayed right and also you can
use it for the visualization so if you
have any specific logs or if you have
any specific stack so for example this
is not specific to logs you can publish
some stats let's say you have some
reports to be generated you can do that
from Splunk so you can stream the data
to Splunk and then you can create a
visualization dashboard or you can
create pivot tables from the
visualization option here right and you
can also generate mail reports so if
let's say you want to monitor some error
logs or any error report or any
fluctuation in the reports you can
create alerting for that so you have an
option called alerts here so we can
create alerting from these Splunk
instance so you can create an alert
based on the data which is coming in and
then you can notify the monitor right so
you can do that as well also you can
create custom dashboards in Splunk let's
say you have the logs coming in you have
your JBM data coming in let's say you
want to monitor them in a single
dashboard you can do that as well so for
example they have created
a few dashboard here salon team has
created some dashboard so what I am
doing is I'm using a trial version here
of the Splunk cloud so this is one
particular dashboard and you click on it
this takes you directly to the logs or
the data or the event you got right so
if that Italy takes you to that all
right so let's say I want to see the
exact source file right so I have the
logs here but I want to see the exact
source file how do I do that you can
click on this option go to event actions
and you can go to show source you have
lots of other options here you can
extract the fields you can build the
event types you can extract the fields
as well what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go to show source show source
is going to show the exact data which is
coming in the file so which is coming
from the file so let's say I put 500 per
page this is going to show me 500 lines
right so I think it takes a while and
let me put 250 I think there is nothing
much let's take some other example right
so this is prices so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to search for tutorial
data
Roger let's search for a particular
finance bill right and I'll do as shows
yep dish if you notice your choice of
tea per page if I let's say want to
reduce it if I did say 25 it will just
show to anybody right so this shows the
exact source or the source events which
came as a sequence so you can see that
as well so let's say I want to filter
out using the failed right this will
filter out these statements which are
having failed and if I let's say I don't
want this specific fine I can just say
stir and this is going to fetch the fail
for all the source types or the sources
all right if you notice here these are
matching the events or these logs in
this particular case so this is how you
can use plunk so if you want to try
Splunk go ahead and try it out you can
create an account in the Splunk comm so
go to Splunk comm and that is an option
called free Splunk you can create a
cloud trial I have created the cloud
trial it is valid for 15 days so you can
just play around you can just try it out
there is also a tutorial on how to
upload it
which one itself provides it's just a
simple step-by-step process where you
can just upload using this settings
option here so you can just say add data
and then you can just upload the zip
file here and then it gets indexed right
so how Splunk works is whenever you
stream the data it gets indexed so once
the indexes are created you can search
across these indexes so in general here
I don't have any index because I didn't
stream the data and I'm using these
plant alone but in general you will have
something like index equal to let's say
I take prime mostly you will have index
equal to tech primers and then you will
be searching on that a particular index
so if you have lots of team streaming
the data onto the same Splunk instance
you will have your own index so you
don't have to worry about the data
quantity right
and there are lots of other options
using Splunk query so you can have
different options if you see here see
there are lots of solutions which are
coming in you can do that if you want to
get statistical information on what is
the maximum count of how many
transactions were there for that
particular search query or all those can
be done using the Splunk query so you
can take a look at these plunk tutorials
from this plunge website there are lots
of documentation around how to create
these plunk queries and stuff like that
but in general
Splunk is used for data mining whenever
you have lots of events or data you can
do data mining over Splunk using this
plunk dashboard you can configure alerts
you can create dashboards you can even
create a reports out of it and then you
can send those reports daily so Splunk
provides lots of options apart from data
mining it has primarily it is used for
logging purpose so lots of firms are
initially using it for logging because
that's a more common criteria but you
can stream your infrastructure details
on to Splunk and then you can search as
well because if you don't want to manage
your separate database and separate UI
then you can go for Splunk because plunk
does that automatically so because plunk
already has its UI it's dashboard and it
is so customizable that you don't have
to create them again you just change the
data you can create reports and you can
create a dashboard out of the data which
you have pushed in right so that is
plunk it is pretty typical using a
gnostic search a person who had notice
and this is the key banner kind of UI
setup where you have different fields it
automatically mines your data and it
creates the fields which you can use for
querying so if let's say you want to use
this particular field you just say you
just double-click and then it will you
can double-click I think select areas so
yeah you say yes and then you can query
it using this if you just click on the
particular value it automatically pushes
that particular string onto the search
right and queries based on that
particular field right you can even
query by time so if your logs where time
stamped you can use in query by what
it was for show you can see that timing
here there is nothing here because the
data is old I'll just say all time but
you can do that as well so you can
streamline your queries and the queries
are faster since it uses streams so your
data will not take longer time to load
while you are searching the data then
the consequent pages will be loaded so
you don't have to worry about the speed
of the Splunk
that's all I wanted to cover about
Splunk hope you guys understood what is
plonk and Wade you can use it in your
current day-to-day activities just give
it a try if you are interested go to
Splunk calm and create a Splunk crowd
trial it is available for free so for 15
days you can just give it a try and then
see how it works and then you can see
how you want to explore the options of
usage of Splunk in your firm or in your
company
that's all I wanted to cover meet you
again in the next video hope you guys
