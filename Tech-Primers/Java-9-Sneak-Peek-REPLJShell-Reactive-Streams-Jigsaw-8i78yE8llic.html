are going to see some of the features
which are coming up in Java 9 so as you
guys know Java 9 is 2 for this year and
release
so we are going to see what are the
major features which they have developed
and we're just going to see how is it
different from Java 8 and Java 7 okay so
I have listed down 12 of the most
important features which everyone is
discussing about and also I have just
tried that out so we are going to use
that and then try it out and see what is
the major difference between them the
java 8 and the java night right so the
first feature of Java 9 is sepal so if
you have heard about repple so there are
lots of other languages which already
have ripple so ripple is not nothing but
the gel in Java so that is nothing but a
command-line interface where you can
write your code and then it the so the
JVM is going to respond so gel is
nothing but a command-line interface
where you can just type in Java code and
then it is going to respond us back at
the output for the Java code ok right
now we don't have any command-line
interface for Java so you have to write
a Java code you have to compile that and
then you run it
but jail is going to solve that problem
all right so let's see what is that gel
right so I already have installed Java 9
in my machine so I have installed the
early access version so it is a EA
version so if you notice here I have
installed it under this particular
directory right so under a home bin so
this is where our jail does that so this
is going to have all our Java Runtime
jars and stuff like that right so I'm
going to use J shell to show what is
that J shell so let's run this issue
right so you can download the Java 9
from the java java website so I'll just
give the link for the download link in
the description below you can just check
that and then you can draw download that
and try it as well so if I see here I
have opened ization so this is going to
be like a command-line interface if I
see a J shell is the command interface
and you can type whatever you want so
let's say I am
say int a equal to ten I can just type
that and then Java is saying that okay
you said a este okay
now I'm going to say B is equal to ten
it's going to say you said a equal to 10
now B is equal to 10 now I am going to I
am going to say in C is equal to a plus
B let's see what happens see that Java
responded saying okay you already had a
10 in mind for a 10 in mine for B now
I'm going to add that up so if you see
here so as done that say if you want to
do that in a single line you can do that
as well say let's say a 1 equal to 20 B
1 equal to 30 right and in C 1 equal to
a 1 plus B 1 and we want to print this
rate so you can do this you can do
system dot out dot println like this and
say C 1 right so now Java is going to
compute all these values and it's going
to print as well ok so this is how you
can do stuff inside ratio so it is a
very good feature from other languages
so finally Java has brought the
command-line interface so you can try
out any small programs what do we do is
we create a small test program and we
write some basic stuff and we try out
small program site or for example let's
say I'm going to write a regex
inside a very big project I cannot run
that project always right so what I do
is I create a small test file outside
the particular project when I test that
particular code and see if it is working
in it so you can do that now in DJ shell
itself you don't have to write any
specific program so that is Jason Jason
ok so we have completed what is Jason so
the next one is the fact C method for
the immutable lists which are the set
map and the map entry so initially in
the Java till Java 8 how do we create
less XP 2 arrays loss as as list and
then be passed something for set we
don't have a way to create it right but
in Java 9 there is a much easier way of
doing that so let's go to IntelliJ so
I'm going to create a small
Java project like to show an example so
I'm going to say so I just selected Java
9 okay I am selecting the archetype so
I'm going to say basic art straight
right so let's go and give a basic art
shape of what do I need
I'll just say maybe not say quick start
right I don't need anything else so I'm
going to give a coupe ID I'm going to
say comm tech primers slash Java 9 okay
and I'm going to give the artifact as
Java 9 example right so it's going to
use maven 3 fine so let's do it
so let me maximize the window so that
you go and get destructed cool we have
got the maven project so if you see here
there is nothing here so I'm just going
to create a source directory I'll just
create a main in fact I think this is
getting created generating the project
in batch mode I think it is going to get
created as a part of the plug-in but
meanwhile I'm creating it you create it
so that we are quick enough cool so now
I will just set the project structure
go to modules so I'll just say these are
sources okay I just need that that's it
I think yeah I think the they created
already spark or the plug-in has already
created so the plug-in has already
created the app file so that should be
good
Salem gets 102 by input so let's run
this program and see if it is working or
not so this is the first time I'm trying
Java 9 so frankly I have not tried
Giovanni I know what it is doing but I
haven't tried Java 9 as well so let's
see if it is working
you know it gets doing lots of
compilation but hopefully it should work
Quartet has worked so the hello one got
generated right so fine yeah we have got
the class phones also they're cool so
the Java nine is working if you see the
Java version which it is using is Java
net right cool
now what is the next feature so we
wanted to check the factory method for
the list right so what I what I am going
to do is I'm going to show you what is
the new thing inside Java 100 so
previously we were not able to do this
so we can do a list of objects here so
you can say a list list of string and
say names right and you can do that here
now like Peter Sam right so this is a
new change inside Java 9 so I think I
have to change the text to Java yeah so
at the project level if we change this
to its online anymore the level also I
need to change this to 0 9 right okay
good it is notice here there is no
compilation error so cool so this is now
going to work like how we were doing
arrays dot fact list right
the major good thing about this is if
you have a set rate we were not able to
do this previously but now we can do
that in the set itself so we don't have
to worry about that like how we were not
able to do previously so we were using
all the api's and library sighs so now
Java has come up with these kind of
libraries which is which are going to
help us in doing that so this is inside
the interface itself so interprets
itself is going to help us in having all
these methods so that is what has been
done in Java 9 so let's see for just
simplicity of this print one of them
right I think it will it will not show
the object anyway
yeah whether you got the point rate so
it I just want to share make sure that
this compass succeeds the compliation so
that is why I am going to just run this
anyway it's not going to give the Peter
and Sam so okay good it is giving
because it is string so it is giving
patron Sam so if you notice here these
are lists right so that we can do
creation of factory methods inside the
Java Java nine basically so that is the
major change inside job on I okay so the
next one is the private methods in the
interfaces okay so if you notice there
are contradictions in the Java 8 itself
so if you notice your Java introduced
the default methods in Java 8 to support
streams so now this off also is
something similar it is a default method
so now it's our in Java 9 they are
adding something called private methods
in the interfaces so interfaces as you
guys know by default it will have only
public methods so now in Java 9 they are
changing that to support private methods
inside interfaces so by that way you can
have multiple methods in the same
interface and then you can make them
private so that you don't have to expose
those methods so let's say I am creating
something call into interface called
inter ok so here I am going to expose
some method called process let's say
right ok and I have some other method
called I have a method called start
let's say ok and this is going to be a
fault method right so this default
method ok needs to be exposed by default
ok before Java and 9 came into picture
whatever method you write you will have
to write it as default it so if you are
doing a code refactoring or if you are
trying to group stuff side inside start
it's a I have like huge amount of code
ok if you want to wrap that into a
method and then you want to use that in
two different default methods you will
have to expose all the default methods
but now you will be able to define
private methods ok
so you'll be able to define private
methods so I'm going to say void right
so if you see I'm able to define private
methods now interference identity there
is no comparison ever like a Java nine
allows us to do that so prior to Java
nine if you do this the compiler is
going to throw you errors but now in
Java nine we are able to do that so that
is the private method ending interface
okay that is another major change the
next major and the most talked about
change is the Java nine module system so
with the Java nine the module system is
coming into Java so module system is
nothing but if you want to use anything
you will have to expose them as modules
so for example I need to have a file
called module in photo Java so I haven't
created this this project hasn't created
automatically because the archetype
which I was using is the older one H
doesn't support Java nine so what we
will have to do is we'll have to create
a file called module info so it will be
under a service but I'll just show you
how the file will look like so you will
just say model in photo Java and then
you will have to define a module saying
comm tech primers dot zero nine okay so
you like to define a module like this so
this is the module info file okay and
inside the module info you can do import
or export you can import comm stuff like
that and then same way you can do an
export right so there are different
methods like this if is notice here the
common method so if you say export since
I'm going to export this particular dot
so that's when I say I can export this
jar as a this particular module as a
char that's when I do a exports so this
is the major change inside the Java 9 so
I'm not going to go in depth inside how
this works because that is a huge
topping in itself let's cover that as a
part of the next session but just to be
mindful that this is going to be the
change so if you want to use any Java
dependency from for example spring rate
we'll have to import okay so you have to
do import calm spring stuff like that
you will have to do that so you will
have to do that inside this model info
file okay so that is the model line Java
9 module system okay the next one is the
process API improvements so previously
when we were executing the the Linux
processes of the processes which are
outside Java we just use the runtime
data exec and then we execute it right
the the disadvantage there was we were
not able to control that particular
process because we were not having the
process ID at all so now in Java 9 you
can now access the process ID and then
you can kill the process ID when we want
so that is now a good thing in Java 9 ok
you can access the process ID in the
process API the next one is the stream
API improvement so there are
improvements in the optional and the
stream API so there are new methods
included in the stream so that also we
can cover as a part of the next video so
we will be having new methods and inside
the stream which are making us better so
which are making these teams look better
so that is another improvement in Java
Java 9 the next major improvement in
Java 9 is the reactive programming
support so there are interface is now
coming inside Java 9 itself which are
going to be under the Java dot util dot
concurrent so called the reactive
strange so the reactive seems are going
to be under something called flow so if
I show it so to the flow so if you see
here flow is going to be the final what
do you call the super level superclass
if you see here it is the final class so
that that is going to support the each
hour stream so if you Java at the
reactive streams and internally inside
flow you will have a publisher which is
going to be an interface okay and then
there is going to be a subscriber that
is going to be a subscription and that's
going to be a processor so this is going
to be aligning with a reactive
programming world where the reactors and
the reactive streams have the exact
similar pattern
interface and be in the interface and
the function names or the names of the
classes so the names of the classes are
exactly the same so if you see any
reactor frame books the publisher
subscriber subscribe subscription
processor all exactly the same just that
the flow has been changed it's flowing
Java 9 so that's it so that is the major
change so we will see how to use
reactive streams as well so that is
another big topic in itself so that is
another change the next one is the
better
deprecated annotation so the deprecated
annotations will now tell you when this
particular function is going to be
duplicated along with the date and the
date and the predicted or equal the
expected month and the year so that is
the new improvement in Java name ok
the next improvement is in the Java
garbage collection
so obviously Java garbage collection is
what everyone is talking about it when
you try to improve something the
performance of the JVM is going to get
improved so that is what everyone wants
it so Java has taken some steps to
resolve that as a part of the Java 9
framework ok the next one is this talk
the stack walking APA the stack working
a page nothing but if you see if you
want to print a stack trace it's very
difficult for us to go through the stack
trees and then most of the time you get
null pointers because the throwable is
not there or the message is not there
and stuff like that even I have faced
lots of problems with the stack trees so
now Java 9 is providing good the stack
walking API you can see that also maybe
in the future series if you are
interested I can do one ok so that is an
improvement in Java 9 ok the next turn
the final things are related to the Java
documentation so if you see if you are
creating a Java documentation if you
have a Java doc plug-in and if you are
in going to create Java documentation
the Java documentation is now going to
be created in HTML 5 ok from 0 9 it's
going to be HTML 5 and finally we will
be able to search across the Java
documentation so that is the final
feature inside the Java 9 so these are
the 12 major features which I felt that
okay which I want to take share with you
guys
so right now Java 9 is not in production
or it's not live yet from Oracle so we
are waiting for the Java and release
everyone is waiting for the Java and
early so that they can use that and see
the stability of the production version
of Java so obviously the first version
is not going to be the exact or the
stable one but still it should be fine
so we we should know that what is
happening in Java 9 because it's been
there it's been getting developed for
the law for a long time maybe more than
three years I think two to three years
so which we and there are like major
changes like the Java 9 module system
and the reactors change so I'm expecting
the version to be out soon so and I want
to try it out personally with the stable
version alright so that's it for this
particular video so if you want me to
make any video on inspir specific topic
