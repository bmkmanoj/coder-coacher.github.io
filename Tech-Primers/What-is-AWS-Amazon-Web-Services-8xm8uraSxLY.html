technology sector or any of the
information technology company you would
have definitely heard about the term
called a WMS and everyone is talking
about it either at the low level or at
the management level everyone talks
about Amazon Web Services in this
particular video we are going to see
what is Amazon Web Services what are the
different offerings which Amazon Web
Services provide and what are the
different features functionality and why
people are moving to Amazon Web Services
from a traditional way of deploying
application
press the bell icon on the YouTube app
and never miss any update from tech
primers Amazon Web Services is a cloud
services platform which was created by
Amazon which offers wide variety of
computing powers database storage
content delivery platforms and lots of
other functionalities which provide lots
of value to the business which you can
easily scale and grow without having to
buy huge servers and host it in urine in
your data center Amazon promotes AWS as
a platform for virtually every use case
right from your database where housing's
to the deployment tools Amazon has every
type of service for your need let's see
what are the different services which
Amazon or AWS provides right so this is
the Amazon AWS website which I am
currently looking at if you see these
are different services which Amazon
shows that they are providing and what I
have done is I have created a free
account in AWS I have got the console
logged in so I have just logged in with
my account you can see that it shows
take primers here so I have created a
login and I am just trying to explore
what is AWS meanwhile I just wanted to
give a introduction about what is AWS so
that we can get started from there we
can try deploying applications we can
try creating a VM using ec2 let's see
what are these right so different
services which Amazon provides our
infrastructure as a service platform as
a service software as a service or in
fact you can use database services like
a relational database services or there
are different load balancing services
all these are different functionalities
which occur which you can use as a
service to your application
so first up write infrastructure as a
service so the most famous one which
Amazon provides is the ec2 instance so
ec2 instance is nothing but a virtual
machine which Amazon can give you so if
you want to host
your application into a into a virtual
machine you can buy an ec2 instance so
you can go here and then create an ec2
instance of your choice so you can
create a specific easy to instance based
on your need with your memory
requirements so Amazon has lots of data
centers so if you see right now I'm in
the North Virginia data center there are
different data centers here these are
different regions and they have data
centers in each of these regions so
right now I am in the North Virginia and
then I create a easy to instance from
this particular data center or region it
will create a virtual machine in one of
the servers which is present inside this
particular region and I will be given
that particular machine so I can install
all these software's in that machine I
can then get started so this is
infrastructure as a service and that
there are lots of different services
which I will show you now wine which we
can use along with the ec2 instance this
is infrastructure as a service if let's
say I don't want to manage a machine
I just want to leverage Amazon's
platform as a service offering then we
can use elastic beanstalk so elastic
beanstalk is there we push our
application and the application is
deployed somewhere inside Amazon's AWS
cloud infrastructure and we don't care
about the middleware components so
elastic provides different middleware
components like Java or Python or the
runtimes then we push the application
these runtimes are created dynamically
and our application is deployed in the
runtime which is present inside the
edibles cloud so that is the platform as
a service offering if you have seen my
videos on cloud foundry so Cloud Foundry
is the equivalent of the platform as a
service which is inside AWS which is
called elastic Beanstalk so that is the
platform as a service offering provided
by Amazon so these are the major
components which people use when they
are creating applications either they go
for ec2 instance where they book their
own machine and deploy applications into
that or they use the elastic Beanstalk
to just push the
application sit and watch so how Amazon
charges us it is based on Harley billing
so we will be charged based on every
hover usage how much time we have used
and what type of services we have used
in that particular Hart and you can have
some flexible buildings with Amazon
where you can have deals you say that I
pay for three years up front you get
lots of discounts from Amazon so that is
also available in AWS so that is why
lots of people prefer AWS because your
billing is flexible based on our need so
now let's look at some of the services
which are there in Amazon and why people
are using Amazon right because there are
lots of services which are created out
of the box in the AWS infrastructure so
that is why people are using AWS because
all these are created upfront and all
these are available already and there
are lots of tutorials and there are lots
of examples which Amazon provides in
order to integrate these services into
our application the compute node
provides services of different type for
example the ec2 which I was mentioning
there is something called light sale
there are different other components
like patch so where you can run your
batch processing systems there is
something called Amazon lambda AWS
lambda so lambda is the new server less
architecture which Amazon had created
few years ago where you can have your
code idle a new server is not running
whenever there is a event triggered from
your consumer or the producer your
Amazon lambda gets initialized and then
it serves the purpose and finally after
giving the response back it just goes to
an idle State so basically there is no
server which is running out there your
server will be initialized when the
request comes in it will be sowed and
then it will be finally destroyed so
that is how lambdas work Amazon kW slam
does work so the other thing is the
elastic container service so this is
equivalent to the docker container where
you can deploy containers into AWS using
the elastic container service
there are different developer tools like
code star code commit these are
developer tools where you can commit
your code changes and you can directly
deploy and you can create pipelines in
order to deploy into your ec2 instance
or the any of these compute nodes here
recently Amazon has introduced array of
services for the machine learning if you
notice here these are the different
services which are provided as a part of
the machine learning project there are
lots of components which are pretty much
new so I'm not sure what they are
because I'm new to envision learning as
well but Amazon AWS already has services
if you're working on any machine
learning projects do take a look at
these services they might be helpful for
you so similar way for the AR and VR
there is one service created by Amazon
Amazon Sumerian so you can take a look
at that as well apart from that the most
common features is the storage space so
for storage Amazon by default provides
the s3 storage the simple storage
service which you can use as a service
in any of these computing design pattern
where you can use s3 storage or the
elastic file system or even the glacier
or even the storage gateway to just
store the data and then just clean the
data whenever we need it also there are
management tools like dynaTrace or the
app dynamics there are lots of tools
which are internal to the cloud inside
AWS there is something called cloud
watch there are also auto scalars which
can scale your application based on your
resourcing usage so let's say you have a
ec2 instance running right let's say we
have a memory of about 8 gig and you
have a tomcat it is running and it is
serving some clients now if the memory
reaches almost let's say 7 gig and you
can have the autoscaler to scale or
spawn a new ec2 instance with the same
code which is deployed in the first ec2
instance that can be done using the AWS
autoscaler so autoscaler will
automatically create a new instance and
just for
the processes parallely into another
instance and that sells the clients as
well so these can be done and configured
using this particular service so similar
way there are lots of services I'm just
mentioning the most famous ones which
people are using so yeah so in terms of
analytical data collection there are
different services like elastic self
service cloud search data pipeline the
athena ones etc for customer engagement
you can use the amazon connect in order
to have direct interaction with the
amazon executives or if let's say you
want to connect to different people
inside your org right you want to send
some mail mail to different people
inside your or you can do that using
these simple email service etcetera
for security there are very good tools
which you can use for compliance as well
so the I am kognito guard duty inspector
artifact or even the Amazon aw a single
sign-on can be used when you are using
your application to secure your
application using the Amazon
infrastructure so you don't have to
manually handcraft stuff you can utilize
any of these services which are
available here same way with the media
streaming libraries there are lots of
media streaming libraries and also if
you want to migrate data from an
existing relational database to the
cloud storage you can do that using the
database migration service or in fact if
you want to migrate servers across you
can use the server migration service
there are some here as well additional
to that if for the networking
perspective there are Virtual Private
Networks which you can create within
your Amazon space where you can create a
virtual private cloud and you can have
different ec2 instances which can be
speaking with each other so you can
literally create a what you call a
virtual private cloud network and you
can have full control inside that
network because Amazon doesn't provide
complete control for their cloud but
they provide something called virtual
private cloud where you can control all
your ec2 instances inside so let's say
you have an organization with Liggett
let's say 10 teams so you can have all
the servers booked by these 10 teams
under a single VP C and you can host
them and control them as a whole there's
also the API gateway and the route 53
which are useful for creating DNS pairs
and then routing the request into your
ec2 instances se mueve for the gaming
and the mobile development there are
different services as well so these are
different services which are available
in Amazon if you see if you want to read
about every each and every service it
means that it will keep on going you can
see that there are too many services
there is a service for whatever you
think all these are already created by
Amazon and you can just use that as a
service which is available from the
platform you can just bind that and then
use it in the application whenever you
are deploying the application so that's
it about Amazon AWS if you're free and
you want to take a look at what is a
double yes just go ahead and and create
an account in the aws.amazon.com like I
how I did
I will also be trying to deploy
applications to AWS and I'll try to show
you whenever I am ready I will try to
make a video on how I am deploying
application to the AWS instance by
default ml Amazon AWS provides a
12-month free usage so you just now to
link your credit card and then you can
use it for 12 months and then you can
later on cancel that so I haven't linked
my credit card I'll be linking that soon
and then I'll try to deploy applications
into the ec2 instance you can also try
doing that so that's it about AWS I hope
you guys got a basic understanding of
what is AWS that's it for this
particular video meet again in the next
video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
