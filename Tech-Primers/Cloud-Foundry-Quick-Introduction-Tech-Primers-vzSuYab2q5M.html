quick introduction about cloud foundry
so what is cloud foundry so I'm not sure
if you have heard about cloud foundry
but I had been aggressively working on
clothes only at work so we used an
implementation of cloud foundry so we
deploy all our applications into the
cloud foundry for the production usage
so if you are not aware cloud foundry is
an open source platform as a service
offering which is provided by pivoted so
pivotal is the company which is
maintaining the cloud foundry so cloud
foundry is an open source platform as a
service offering provided by theater so
what and what is this platform
as-a-service me so as you are aware in a
traditional IT infrastructure so what do
we do so we create an application the
application has data it has it runs on a
runtime environment it has a middleware
system it has an operating system it has
virtualization it has servers so it has
storage and networking so all use all
these constituting traditional and IT
infrastructure services however if you
see the cloud how we are transforming
our traditional IT application into a
cloud-based service so there are
different concepts called as
infrastructure as a service platform as
a service and software as a service so
what do they literally mean right so
infrastructure as a service means that
the operating system virtualization
servers storage and networking will be
provided as a service basically you
don't have to worry about those stuff so
we don't have to worry about these stuff
because the particular software which is
going to give the infrastructure as a
service offering is going to take care
of that typical example of
infrastructure as a service would be
Amazon AWS which you will get might be
familiar by now so Amazon AWS is not a
platform of the service but it is an
infrastructure as a service so it is
going to give the OS it is going to give
the virtualization it's going to give
the servers storage and networking stuff
so based on that we have to create our
application provide the data for it
runtime and the middleman so that we
have to manage so if you see here
infrastructure as a service we are good
manage the glue packs the others are
also
any service in itself what clouds only
does is this part the platform as a
service so clouds fall tree provides the
runtime and the middleware along with
the operating system virtualization
server storage and networking so it's
going to help you in managing the
deployment which is out there so you
don't have to worry about the deployment
management so you just have to create
your application and deploy that's it
and then forget it
so that is what Cloud Foundry is giving
software as a service is completely
everything so you for example Google
Docs that is the software as a service
sub transom so you don't have to install
the word you don't have to install
anything no doubt you don't need the
hardware you don't need the software you
don't need the mutualization you don't
need the storage everything is out there
in the cloud so that is the software
innocence so to reiterate this
infrastructure as a service provides DS
as an offering by default so Amazon AWS
is an example of that platform of the
services including the runtime in the
middle where it provides the bees as
well so Cloud Foundry is a typical
example so Amazon also has something
called amazin being stock
that is very placing for cloud from B so
that is the platform as a service
offering I'm not sure many many of them
are aware of that so amazing Beanstalk
is the platform as a service offering by
Amazon so software and services as I
said Google Docs is a typical example
you don't have to worry about even the
application so you get it on the cloud
you just log in to a website and you
have everything out there so that is the
typical cloud concept and what close
foundries at a high level if you see if
you see this is what the platform as a
service offering them so you have you
maintained your organizational roles in
your organization you have different
party management you have a reporting
you home modeling you have the process
engines and everything is all in there
in the platform as-a-service
the infrastructure result has these
servers and stuff like that so it is
like the AWS and imagine this is like
the cloud funky so you can plug anything
in cyclop only you can plug a AWS you
can plug as you or you can plug a
OpenStack anything anything inside close
for me that is that is what Cloud
Foundry does
if you see Cloud Foundry since Klaus
only is an open-source platform so
pivotal has a implementation of the
cloud for you and that is called pivotal
Cloud Foundry SAT has the implementation
and they call it SAP HANA cloud phony
SMP HANA cloud phone key black cloud
platform iBM has its implementation
called IBM bluemix so same way there are
few other implementations of the cloud
for me because this is open source so
everyone has their own implementation of
the cloud function so that's it saw the
high-level overview of the Cloud Foundry
make you guys in another video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
