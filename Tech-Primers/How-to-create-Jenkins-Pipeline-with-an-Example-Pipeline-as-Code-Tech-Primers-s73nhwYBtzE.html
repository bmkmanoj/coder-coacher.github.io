we're going to see how to create a
pipeline inside Jenkins
so in the previous video we saw about
Jenkins on how we can create a maven
project in Jenkins on how we can trigger
the pulled right so in this video we're
going to see how to create a pipeline
and what is this pipeline all about
so pipeline is basically like a plug-in
inside Jenkins so if you had work with
Jenkins right so there are lots of
plugins so you can install plug-ins and
then you can play around with the plug
it but pipeline is something like you
can create a workflow inside a Jenkins
build so it is something similar to a
new job or something but it you can
control that using jenkins file which
you can have it in your codebase and you
can control the workflow based on decode
revision so basically you can control
the whole jobs workflow based on your
code so you can have a different build
based on your branch you can do so many
things in that so basically this jenkins
file is a readout of this groovy dsl so
you can do lots of things with that so
for example this is how jenkins file
looks like so you have a pipeline you
have a agent so we define an agent we
have different stages in the pipeline so
you can define your own stage so
basically we can define our own stage we
can give a different name and we can do
whatever steps we want inside ok so this
is what we are going to do now so I'll
take the same project which we had the
Jenkins example like the Ju notify
example so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create a Jenkins file so as a
part of your codebase you have to create
this Jenkins file and the file name will
will be Jenkins file so this is how you
have to create the file inside your Co
Bay so that Jenkins pipeline can
identify that ok at this particular code
base is the pipeline enabled one ok so
what I am doing is I'm just creating a
pipeline we just say the agent is any
what
and then I have different stages right
and the first stages let's say I'm going
to call this compiled stage okay I'm
just going to give up give my own name
so that we can differentiate with what
we did also here since I have maven
project so I'm going to give what is the
version of maven which we are using what
is the configuration of maven which we
are using right so the name of the maven
is if let's say I go to the Jenkins
build Jenkins actually I go to manage
Jenkins global tool configuration so I
have the name of the consecration of the
maven build maven configuration which I
have done there so maybe an installation
so this is the name I need to give so
that in the build it can use that
particular maven because we are going to
you do something with made right and
this is going to be a step right so I'm
going to say steps so if you notice here
in the pipeline so that is I would say
steps let's all they say steps and
inside the steps and however maven we
just move this inside ok so inside that
I will put a command Sh maven clean
compile let's say I'm going to just
compile it so as a part of the compiled
stream this go and say may even clean
compile and I don't have anything else
so in the next stage I want to do
testing stage let's say right so same
way as this copy the same step
right instead of maven clean compiler
the same way one test okay
finally let's say I want to do a deploy
so I'll just say deployment stage right
so I'm in this case I'm going to just
apply to the maven artifact so I'm not
going to deploy to any repository as
such but I'm just gonna run maven deploy
that is going to deploy my code entities
repository okay
maven repository which a we saw in the
previous example right so the my
pipeline is set so let's commit this
particular pipeline so this particular
code is there in the github so I am
going to push this code to github and we
are going to use the same repository to
configure that in the Jenkins job and
pull the data from the github and then
we are going to build so let me create a
new Jenkins job so at this particular
stage so I'm going to say a pipeline
Jenkins example okay so if you notice
previously created the maven project now
we are going to create a pipeline okay
you can create multi branch pipeline if
you want to together built on different
branches but I am going to use pipeline
because we are going to use only one
branch which is the master okay
and the github repository is Genting
example right yeah so this is the github
repository I'm just going to use this to
configure it here so here if you notice
you have an option called pipeline and
you can create the pipeline script here
so if you notice here it just says it
has a hello world
get her plus may be automatically these
are pre-built pipelines which you can
use but I am going to use the Jenkins
file so I am going to say pipeline
script from AC and I am just saying that
use the gen kids why okay an SCM is
nothing but good so I'm going to get
give the git repository and the curtain
shows and I'm
say it is taken from master so I will
just do that that's it so we don't have
to do anything else and this configure
the configure in the pipeline okay now
when I let us see if it is got pushed
yeah push is successful now if I build
this this should pull the pipeline the
Jenkins file basically and it will do
all the stages which we have defined
here okay and let's check that okay if
we notice here the first step is just
checking out the codebase so just what
is showing here it may open this in a
new tab so that we can drag the status
as well okay the code is getting checked
out the code check out the successful
let's go to the pipeline
okay the pipeline shows that this code
is checked out in 16 seconds the next
stage is the compilation stage it is
going on as well yeah compilation is
also successful if you notice here yeah
compilation is a crystal and it has
moved to the testing phase so these are
the stages which we if you notice here
these are the names of the stages which
we gave here right so the same stage
names comes here so you can control the
number of stages in the pipeline you can
create a number of stages so you can
automate the whole build and deployment
process itself so based on the master or
the develop deploy develop or the
feature branch you can run specific
tests so let's say you want or an
integration test you can create an
integration testing stage and then you
can do that only for a specific branch
or something or let's say you want to
run a integration test with the database
itself like like the production database
all the UAT trip is all the David attack
with it so you can also run that
specifically for a specific branch using
and you can control that using this gene
cakes file and this uses groovy DSL so
if you have a video with groovy syntax
so you can write lots of code here you
can write echo you can take all the
groovy stuff inside this okay and there
are lots of other plugins which you can
use also if you notice bit maven is like
pipeline maven plugin so that is I have
used this meme but if you want to know
what all that is
and existing commands which we can use
you can go to the plugin and chose of
their eternity if you notice here the
stage is completed so our build is
completed our pipeline is completed if I
trigger the build again it will show
another line so it gets accumulated and
you can see that if i refresh it so if
you notice here it shows the next
pipeline and it shows the different
stages as well
so this is easier for us to track the
whole workflow and we will know where it
is failed and you can test your code
base case by face ok so that is the that
is all about pipeline and that is how
you configure piping so it is it is
straightforward you just have to install
the pipeline plugin along with that if
you are using maven you can do to
install maven integration pipeline
plugin and if you want any other feature
too we use you can use different plugins
so in our case we are just going to
you're just using the straightforward
maven pipeline plugin and also the
pipeline clicking ok so that is what we
are using wave and crackle and breaking
that is a very recent with maven and
providing the major version if I you
don't provide this maven will not be
recognized when the build is run ok so
this is how you create a pipeline using
the Jenkins file that's it about this
video so if you like my channel go ahead
and like it if you want to see more
videos go ahead and subscribe made again
in the next video until then thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
