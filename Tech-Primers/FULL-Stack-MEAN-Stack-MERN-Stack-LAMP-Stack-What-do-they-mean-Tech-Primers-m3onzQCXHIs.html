web developers and stuff like that
during our job description search right
what does the really mean by full stack
developer mean developer myrn developer
or a lamp developer right what do they
really mean let's see what do they
really mean by these terms right let's
get started
main star developer so what does it mean
by a main stack right so literally these
are the abbreviations so M stands for
MongoDB bhavati B as you know is the
backend database it is a no sequel
database I have done some videos on
MongoDB so you can check them out for
knowing what is MongoDB and I have
created a small Springwood application
with MongoDB as a back-end so you can
see how we can use MongoDB document
store for storing our data right so that
is more body so MongoDB is a database
right so that is what part of the main
stack the next part is the extras Jas
so expertise JS is a framework for the
backend applications which is written
using javascript so expressjs is a
back-end application or a framework
where you can write JavaScript code
right so they do this expressjs run
there are no no J's
so no J's is a back-end server for the
JavaScript application so if you want to
write a back-end code using javascript
you can use node.js and no J's is the
technology where you can run the
JavaScript so for example this chromium
browser right so the Chrome browser is
using the Chrome's v8 JavaScript engine
so no J's is built out of that so some
similar to how you have a back-end java
application you can write JavaScript
applications with the help of node.js
for back-end processing so that is the
back end for the MongoDB right the
back-end server and the UI technology is
based on angular so angular is the
framework for creating UI so this is the
main stack right M stands for MongoDB e
stands for experts J's which is a
framework for writing your back-end
JavaScript code and angular is for the
front end goals node.js is where you
will be running your back and Express
genius application right so that is the
main stuff
so what is a myrn stack right burn stack
same way M stands for MongoDB e stands
for expressjs insert the angularjs we
are using react.js here so react.js is
the library where you can use it for
creating user interfaces using HTML and
they the JavaScript as a UI part right
so that is the merge stack so everything
is same exactly similar to the main
stack except as instead of the angular
technology or the angular framework here
we will be using the reactor library
right so that is the monster so what is
the lamp stack so lamp is a pretty older
stack but still some people use the lamp
stack for creating web applications so
let's see what is this lamp stands for
right so L stands for the Linux so where
your your back-end processors will be
running in or you have your code
deployed into your next machine right so
that is the Linux right a stands for
Apache so when you have an Apache web
server right HTTP server basically where
you can route your applications using
Apache right so that is the a and M
stands for my sequel database so that is
the backend so lamp in the lamp M stands
for my sequel which is nothing but the
backend database and for P it can be
either Python or PHP or even perl for
that method so that is why the stack is
little bit cold the foil is pretty old
PHP is pretty old and my sequel is also
pretty old so literally lab stands for
Linux Apache my sequel PHP or Python or
Perl so that is the lamp stack so when
that when somebody says lamp stack that
means this is the complete stack which
they have worked on
so what is a full stack developer - full
stack is basically any UI technology any
back-end technology and any database
technology so when somebody says I'm a
full stack developer that means they
either know angular or expressjs or
reactions or no J's for UI and for
back-end they either use node.js or any
other back-end technology and like
Apache has then and the database could
be MongoDB or my sequel or any other
know sequel database so when they say
full stack developer that means they
would have worked on right from the UI
till the end the back-end database right
so from end to end they have worked on
all these technologies of that is why
they call themselves a full stack
developer so that is the full stack
developer explanation right so that is
what I wanted to cover as a part of this
particular video I hope you guys
understood what is a main stack what is
a myrn stack what is lamp stack and what
does full stack mean hope you guys found
this video interesting if you are here

ahead and subscribe to it you can find
similar videos on all the latest
technologies on spring booth devops
jenkins and stuff like that if you like
