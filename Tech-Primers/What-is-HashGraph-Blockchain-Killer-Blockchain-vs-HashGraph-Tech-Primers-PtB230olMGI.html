technology revolutions in the last few
years it led to the creation of
different cryptocurrencies and the
softer platforms like Bitcoin or
aetherium and they have changed the way
we used to see the financial and the
software development sector however
there is a new technology which is
coming up called the hash graph let's
see in this particular video what is
hash graph and how it is different from
blockchain and is it truly a blockchain
killer press the bell icon on the
YouTube app and never miss any update
from tech primers the agenda for this
particular session is what is hash graph
how does hash craft work and is it
really worth moving to hash graph from
the blockchain and how does it differ
from blockchain and is it really a
blockchain killer
so before understanding what is hash
crap we need to understand what swirls
do sewins is a software platform which
is created for full distributed
applications that can harness the power
of the clouds without the servers they
can develop applications with fairness
in the decision speed trust and
reliability all at the fraction of the
cost of the traditional server based
platform what do we need to know about
this particular companies they're the
ones who have created hash graph what is
hash graph hash graph is nothing but a
consensus algorithm which is used by
that company which is called swirls
these are already being called as the
blockchain on steroids hash crafts are
on telly called as blockchain on
steroids there are few properties which
are truly unique to the hash graph
example speed it can confuse more than
250,000 transactions per second however
if you notice block chains they can't
compute this many number of transaction
they can do only seven transactions per
second there is the next property called
the fairness it uses the concern since
time stamping which makes the system
fair and finally security it is a
synchronous and it is based on the
design team fault-tolerant system which
is similar to how blockchain works
blockchain also uses the same font
tolerance system what does it mean is it
can still work even if one of the node
is not participating inside the
functionality so how does this hash
craft work Ashcraft uses two special
features for achieving all these three
properties the first one is the gossip
about gossip and the next one is the
virtual voting let's see in depth of
what are these gossip about gossip or
the gossip protocol is a very well-known
concept in the networking industry
imagine how do we spread gossips in real
life let's say we have four different
people
Peter Sam Ryan and Adam what do we
generally do we just gossip among each
other right let's say Peter gossips to
Sam about something and Sam goes it's
the same thing to Ryan and the chain
goes on imagine these are different
nodes in the hash graph every node in a
hash crap can spread signed information
or events on the newly created
transactions and the transactions
received from the others - its randomly
chosen neighbors these neighbors they
collect the information from the others
and then they try to distribute it to
random nodes this goes on until all the
nodes are aware of that particular
information
so that is how gossip about concept
works let's see the working of gossip
above Gafsa with a small diagram let's
imagine these are the different nodes
inside a hash graph let's imagine Sam is
sending an information to Adam so Sam is
gossiping something to Adam
how Adam creates an event which is
nothing but the blue bond and say some
that I have created an even and I
acknowledge your information now there
are three events one was created by Sam
which is the red one same way Adam also
has a red one these are the initial
events or the first events created by
Edie nodes and then the new event is
created as a result of Sam gossiping
with Adam now what is inside that
particular blue ball
this is something similar to how we have
in blockchain however it is slightly
different so there is a timestamp of
that particular gossip along with the
timestamp there is the transaction
information which is being gossiped so
the information which is being gossiped
is inside and also there is a timestamp
additionally there is the hash of what
is the first event the first event is
nothing but what is here the hash of
this particular event is present in that
as well
and finally the hash of atom is present
as well so these two are nothing but the
hashes of the first event of Sam and
atom so this is how the final gossip is
created this is called an event so when
Sam gossips to atom and event is created
by atom with all these informations and
the same information is now passed on to
different neighbors let's see in real
time how does it work if there are more
nodes right
so this is how it can look like when we
start creating new gossips and the
information passes from each node to
other so this is how gossips can spread
across the neighbors and spread across
the network so this is just a small
example of how a gossip works the
information is passed in a similar
fashion across the nodes this is the
first feature of the hash gap let's see
what is virtual voltage now that we have
passed on information using the gossip
about gossip now how do we vote and
identify which information is valid so
virtual voting comes in handy in that
place every node determines whether the
transaction is valid or not by doing
virtual loading if a transaction has 2/3
of the node in the network as witness
saying these are valid then transaction
is considered to be valid this is
similar to blockchain however there is a
small change compared to block change
the wording happens over lots of drones
so example this particular chain can be
split into three different rounds round
one which consists of some particular
transaction round two which has another
set of transactions same way round three
which has another set of transactions
whenever a gossip is made the
transaction knows that which particular
round it belongs to by dividing this up
into rounds we can make the calculations
faster that is why hash crafts is faster
compared to block chains there are lots
of algorithms which you can see in depth
to know the voting process I am NOT
going to cover the in-depth algorithm of
how the voting process works but
understand that there is virtual owning
and the transactions are validated based
on two thirds of witness which say that
these transactions are valid let's
compare that with a blockchain and we
can identify and let's see is it really
a blockchain killer
the two biggest problems that
blockchains are facing is the speed of
the transaction and the fairness of the
transaction the speed of the transaction
is a pretty low in the blockchain the
bitcoins have a transaction speed of
seven transactions per second a theorem
usually has 15 per second however hash
craps can process 250 K transactions or
more per second which is a major
advantage for the hash crafts blockchain
is public and it is not permission based
so there are unknown networks which can
come and create their networks in the
blockchain however hash crafts are
currently operated on a private based
network and it is permission based so
you know that how many nodes are
participating beforehand this is why it
is unfair to compare a blockchain with
the hash graph because blockchain is
public and hash graph is private once it
moves to the public world we will be
able to identify how hash craps solves
the problem of privacy there is no
fairness in the transaction validation
in the blockchain because blockchain
miners themselves manually put these
transactions into the blocks and then
they will always choose the transaction
which favors them financially each
transaction has a certain amount of
transaction fee which are attached to
through these many times most users will
have to pay extra transaction fee in
order to get a special preference for a
particular transaction for a cut in line
so in a blockchain you can skip the
speed based on the financial gain
however in the hash graph you cannot do
that because it is all time stamp based
and it helps in fairness validation
based on the sequence or based on the
voting mechanism or based on the
validation which happened first
it is simple first-come first-serve as'
and keeps the network as fair as
possible compared to the blockchain
where it can skip your chains when you
have a special preference the final
conclusion which we would say is
it is too early to say that blockchain
is going to be killed by Ashcraft
because hash craft doesn't align with
the blockchain stack because it is still
private and it is not public yet it is
not even open source so we cannot
directly say that blockchain can be
killed by hash craft but hash crafts
concepts are very good and the speed and
the security and the fairness which has
been involved in the hash graph is
pretty impressive so what did we see in
this particular video we saw what is
hash Cara how does it work how does the
gossip about gossip works and how is it
calculating the validation using the
virtual OD
and finally we compared the hash craft a
bit blockchain hope you guys found this
particular video interesting if you
