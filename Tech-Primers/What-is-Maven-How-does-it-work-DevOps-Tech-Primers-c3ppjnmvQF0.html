difficult task when you want to maintain
the consistency of the build process
across your projects let's see how we
can use maven to solve those problems
let's get started
as you guys know maven is a project
management tool that is used by lots of
developers to complete a build life
cycle because maven provides a framework
with which you can automatically provide
plug-and-play stuff for maintaining your
build process across your projects let's
see what are the different features of
maven before getting into a background
of how a maven works right so maven
provides something called as the
model-based development or the
model-based builds so maven can build
the jars worse or it can create a
metadata out of the project okay if you
want to build a Python project you can
have the Python plugins and create some
Python packages if you are using a Java
project you can create jars or worse
depending on what type of project it is
so that is one of the feature of maven
the other part is the release management
where you can create a release and then
upload that into a distribution system
or a maven repository or a repository
where people can take in from so maven
can do that so it can do the release
management and the release distribution
and the publication part as well along
with that it can maintain the
dependencies so as a single point of
control
maven can control the dependencies of
your project so you don't have to
package the jars or the dependent VARs
of the jars into your project those will
be used at the build time so your
repository or the codebase size will be
reduced come compared to storing
everything into your project so maven
can help in downloading these
dependencies and managing those
dependencies at the build time
right maven also provides something
called plug-in development where you can
create multiple plugins and plug the
plug tools into the project and use them
based on the tasks whenever you need it
so for example if you want to push some
package on to your hosts you can do that
as a part of a plug-in itself so there
could be a task for example your post
build process so after the way it is
executed after package is completed you
can create
plugins to trigger the task after the
plug-in or the package is completed for
the particular project so you can
trigger the plugin after the package got
created and then you can push that onto
the remote machine or something like
that so with the plugins you can create
and whatever you want there are lots of
plugins we will see whatever is useful
in becoming videos but ya know that you
can create multiple plugins and then you
can plug and play inside the maven
project maven project okay there is
something called auto parent versioning
so you can have you don't have to
mention the parents name inside the
child modules so if you have the parent
project and you mention all the child
that will be group into the parent so
that is the that is the auto parent
versioning so you don't have to if let's
say you have you have to stamp a version
number across the parent modules to the
child models you don't have to manually
enter that you can have plugins and
maven will automatically go and change
the version number from the parent till
the child so it can automatically do
that so maven does that automatically
for you so that is why it's called Auto
parent versioning so you can have
versions appended automatically right
the other processes the as we saw the
consistent build process so when you
create a single maven process you can
use the same maven process for every
repository which you use so you will
have a consistent build process for all
their projects under your team or your
group right so maven also uses
convention over configuration so which
basically means that you don't have to
create the build process yourself
maven provides lots of build life cycles
you can use them so for example these
are the different life cycles which we
have so I'll cover the life cycles in a
separate video
but to understand that as a part of the
life cycle you can do lots of stuff so
you don't have to create those life
cycles or the tasks yourself those tasks
are created by maven automatically and
those tasks run in a sequence or run in
a particular order but you can use those
tasks and leverage them to do some
particular tasks on your own if you want
to do something
right so that is Maybin so maven is used
for creating a project so you use maven
to build your project okay so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to create a
maven project using IntelliJ and let's
see how does it look like right so I'm
going to create a new project I'm not
going to create anything out of the box
here so I'm going to click on the maven
option in IntelliJ here and I'm
selecting the SDK as 1.8 okay I'm going
to use Java one rotate and there is
something called archetype so our steps
are where you help redefine the folder
structures or the skeletons given by
maven itself so when you run this
particular archetype it is going to
create a package with your folder
structure with the necessary files in
build you don't have to do anything on
your own
right so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to see if there are any maven
simple archetype which we can leverage
and create a simple project for us
alright so let me see there is something
called maven archetype we're back I can
do a Batman suit so let's create this
particular bag
so I'm going to click on the next button
okay there is something called group ID
artifact ID and version number here so
group ID is nothing but the organization
with all the group which you are a part
of for example comm tech primers is my
organization or a group right an
artifact ID is the library which you
want to create so for example I'm going
to say in a van example right so this is
the artifact ID or the project which are
going to create under the organization
called comm not tech primers right I'm
going to click the next option so this
is going to give me the option for the
mavens version so there are different
moment versions team maven home I'm
going to use the maven 3 itza so I'm not
going to do anything else and it uses
something called setting star text
someone and there is something called
repository so repository is there
is going to download all the
dependencies which we saw it the
dependencies for the project and it is
going to store those dependencies
integers that are positive so this
repository is going to host all the jars
which we require all the packages which
we require for the project into this
particular folder so this is a local
repository there could be a remote
repository from vary to be download so
that will be mentioned in the settings
dot XML so settings dot XML will have
the remote repository location details
where you can use it for dependency
management downloading and also the
release distribution so whenever you
want to distribute some jars on to a
remote repository those repository
information will be present in the
settings or XML or you can even override
it in your project itself but by default
they are present in the setting static
so much right and local repository is
well or the remote dependencies are
downloaded and kept for faster access
when the project gets built right so
every time you run maven it will
download and keep it in the local
repository you can clean up the local
repository depending on your usage right
and if you notice here these are the
different properties which is which
maven is going to use right I'm going to
click on the next button so I'm going to
give the project name as maven - example
just to be precise alright so this is
going to run the maven archetype in the
background and maven is going to create
a project
so the maven archetype is going to
create a project and that is what it has
done let's see what it is doing right so
and if you notice here it has already
triggered the maven build option so this
is nothing but maven what is the command
here yeah it is doing a maven generate
right so this is the task which is going
to generate the maven project so the
archetype which we have created is the
web app so this is going to create a
project of structure which is equivalent
to a web application let me maximize
this okay let the maven archetype
complete right so meanwhile if you
notice IntelliJ identifies that this is
a maven project and it automatically
opens up this option called the maven
project
window okay and this shows up what are
the different life cycles and the
plugins which this particular project
has alright so yeah the project is ready
now let me click on the import changes
and let's go and see what are the
different files which got created
the dot idea folder is the file folder
for the IntelliJ to be used so it has
created source main resources and there
is a web app folder with some default
package so this is since this is a web
application it has created a web app
folder if it was a simple java
application it would have just created a
java folder so if you want to create
java files you can go and create them
under this particular folder so you can
create a directly called java right and
i can just go ahead and create a file
called hello without any package right
now if you want to create a package you
can do that and let me go and modify the
project structure so that this
particular project identifies that these
are sources all right yeah so what I
will do I'll go here I've just mentioned
this as a source this resource is
automatically identified ok so now my
Java project has got and defined right
and if you notice here there is one more
file called Java example dot I am and
this is a file generated by IntelliJ for
its reference so we can if though that
don't come at this file it is something
similar to the dot Eclipse class path
file which gets created in Eclipse so
this is the main file which is used by
maven so it is called the form dot XML
so palm is nothing but project object
model right so this is the file which
maven is going to understand so if you
want to speak with maven then you have
to speak via this particular file so you
have to control the whole build process
using this form dot XML so this is the
file where you have to modify all the
stuff which you want to do it in your
project ok
you notice that there is a XML and this
particular file is of type XML so it is
called the Palm Court eczema
so if you notice here the file name is
pom dot XML and it's present in the root
directory this is a single module
project so I'm having only one forum if
you have a multi modal project you can
have multiple folders in here and each
module will have a form dot XML so that
way
maven identifies that this particular
project is a multi module project and
intelligent is here it has identified
automatically that there is a maven
project in this particular folder and it
has identified what are the different
life cycles which are there you can run
them directly from here it has also
identified what is that dependency which
is present here so if you notice here
there is one dependency but currently
present which is the chair unit so let's
go through the palm dot XML right so
palm talk Simone is basically a XML file
there you have to have predefined XML
notations mentioned so that maven can
understand them so for example it starts
with project and this is a typical maven
convert XML so you will have to mention
the project here and some different
scheme our locations and exercise your
locations which is all like by default
present there right the next one is the
model version the model version is by
default for dot 0 dot 0 okay so maven
uses that particular version number so
we are going to stick to that particular
version number group ID as we saw
earlier is the organization path or the
group path which we are under artifact
ID is the library name with which our
project is going to be shipped and the
next one is the packaging so this
particular packaging identifies what
type of metadata we are having so what
type of model are having either it is a
jar war or anything else right so in
this particular case it's a vapor so we
are having war here the next one is the
version number so by default I'm having
one dot 0 dot snapshot right so you can
have n number of versions you can have
different different versions based on
your project or the product releases so
version is going to denote what version
of product we are currently hosting here
the next one is the name the name of the
application this is just the name used
by the project when we run the maven
project and
the username so this is just a name
which we can give for referencing this
particular project URL is it's just a
property I don't think anybody is using
it it's just by default having the
manual at short - Lee the next one is
the dependencies there are two things
here so one is the dependency management
and the other one is the dependencies so
dependency management is something like
a what I call a parent or container okay
so when you have multimodal projects
your parent can have the dependency
management and you can have dependencies
here under dependencies you can have
different dependencies so for example
j-unit right it's one of the dependency
so you can have something like that and
in the this this could be in the parent
body so this particular table dependency
management can be in the parent module
right and in the child module you can
directly use it as dependencies right
and you can directly use the dependency
like this you don't have to mention the
version number here so I can even remove
this it's just the same okay and I can
put all the scope we here as well this
is just the j-unit package which is used
for the test cases so I'm having it as
scope the scope is test oh I'll tell you
what is the scope so in a multi-modal
project if you have multiple modules
with the same version of the packages
used across different models then you
can use dependency management to manage
the version number in a single place if
you have a multi-modal project you'll
have to mention these dependencies in
every module so when you have when you
have to have multiple versions so
everywhere you will have to mention a
version number but dependency management
solves that problem using this
dependency management tag where you say
dependency management and in the sub
modules you can use it lyrically like
that without using the dependency
management same with plugin management
so if you have a plug-in usage in
different modules you can use the
plug-in management so you can directly
say plug-in management right now the
plugin
we'll be inside the build so I'm going
to do build and if you notice here the
plug-in management has come inside the
plugin management you can have multiple
plugins right you can have plug-in and
then you will have to have the
dependencies or the artifacts here okay
so this how you can help
plugins inside the build right so inside
the dependencies so there are three
things for things like the group ID
artifact ID version number scope so
group ID we saw artifact ID we saw
version number we saw these are the
different version numbers names and the
artifact IDs and group IDs of the
packages which we are going to use from
somebody else's project there are
something called scope the scope can be
either compile time run time provider or
the test these are different phases or
the different ways we can use this
particular dependency in our project so
for example if it is test this
particular package will be used only for
use running the tests so if we have a
test module so in general in general
right now we don't have any test package
here so you can have a test folder and
then you can write test cases there and
this particular dependency will be
downloaded only during the test phase of
them have a life cycle right okay so
that is this Co the next part is the
build so build is where you mention all
your profiles plugins and stuff like
that so for example this final name is
what the artifact is going to be created
on so if I say maven example this is
going to create may have an example dot
what so let's I try something right so
let's try packaging this particular
project so I'm going to say clean and
packaged so clean is going to clean the
existing folder structure or the
compiled jars and then it is going to
create a package so if you notice here
there is some failure which says that
okay it's not able to download this is
because the maven repository is not set
up right so it's not able to identify
where it should download from and stuff
like that alright so
maybe the positive as cash in local the
person who solution will not be a temple
until the update wasn't yeah because I
have given the fire at one version I'll
use the 4.12 which I already had right
so let me do the import and also that
Fido to one version had a different
artifact ID I guess so that could be
another problem why they may one did not
download but I know that for 12 version
works so this for our 12 should get
downloaded and if you notice here it has
got an ordinance proceeding with what it
is done and it the build is successful
so let's analyze what is happening here
it so as a part of the Maven clean
package right so there is a plugin
called maven clean plugin which may one
already has it so we did not mention any
plug-in here in the palm but xml but
maven directly use that particular
plugin and it cleaned some project it
did some maven resource copy using the
maven resource plugin then it compiled
the project then it again did the test
resources then it did a test compiled in
a reader test so then finally it did a
packaging of the web application and
finally it has created a folder called
target if you notice here this
particular folder has got created newly
and you can see that there are classes
there is a maven starters move an
example these are different packages
used by maven and classes is where our
files will be there so if i had created
a hello world if i had created some
something here right
if I'd created this this should have
created a hello world class inside this
particular classes package right so that
will be inside the classes package and
finally the wire will be present outside
the classes package and this particular
name was coming from the combat XML
entry where we had mentioned that the
final name should be made an example if
you mentioned some of the name this
particular world will be different if
you notice it if I go to classes you can
see the hello world or class right so
this is how maven does it so these are
different default maven notations where
maven creates a folder called target and
it creates classes if you have test
classes it will create under test
classes so we will see that in the next
video so where I explain you the life
cycle of maven what are the different
life cycles inside maven but understand
that maven is going to help you in
building your project and follow a
common stuff across all your projects
right so this is what maven is useful
for and I hope you guys understood what
is maven so maven is nothing but a build
or a process controlling tool which is
used for setting up your project and
follow some best practices and have some
consistent usage across all jebecca
projects so it has the different
features like the dependency management
plug-in development auto parent
versioning release management and the
release distribution and obviously the
final thing is the consistent build
process across all your projects okay so
that is what maven is useful for there
are different tools available as well
like graded so Gradle is another tool
which is similar to maven we can see
that later but maven is the latest one
sorry compared to Gradle maven is little
bit older however if you compare it with
ant may be used to manually do lots of
stuff inside the ant or a makefile
maven does lots of things automatically
for you with its in Bill plugin usage so
that is what maven is useful for I hope
you guys understood what is maven in the
next video we will see what are the
different life cycles inside may
and that's it for this particular video
I hope you guys understood what is
enable if you have any questions
relating to maven do drop that in the
comment section below I'll be able to
answer that if you are not a part of the
tech promise slack community do drop me
a mail I'll add you to the slack
community where we do discuss day to day
issues as well there okay I hope you
liked the video if you liked the video
go ahead and like it if you haven't
subscribed to the channel Road and
subscribe to it wait again in the next
