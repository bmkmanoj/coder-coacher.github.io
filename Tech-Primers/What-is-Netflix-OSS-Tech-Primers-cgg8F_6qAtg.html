technology company and follow their
trends and we always wanted to do
whatever they wanted to do right or
whatever they are doing in this
particular video we are going to see
what does Netflix doing with something
called Netflix OSs
let's get started
Netflix OSS is nothing but open source
software contributed by the Netflix team
on to the open source community so as
you guys know Netflix is a website where
they have lots of web syriza's which are
premier and you have to have a Netflix
account to watch the Netflix web series
and most of the web series are all like
famous and you might know most of the
web series are made into the television
series as well so Netflix is one of the
biggest technology company which is out
there in the world so what Netflix has
done recently is they have recently out
sourced most of their technology tools
which they use internally in their
company so we are going to see what are
the different tools which are there in
the Netflix OSS so Netflix is the stands
for open source software so Netflix is
has started contributing to the open
source community quite a while ago
so what Netflix OSS is a set of software
provided by Netflix the way they'd the
designs of the day way they deploy
microservices they have open source lots
of software's which they have designed
and spring has already come up with
different frameworks using those
software's you would have already seen
me making videos on spring spring clouds
old hystrix Eureka and stuff like that
if you ever see what are the other tools
which Netflix OSS provides as well and
in this series I'm gonna make different
videos on what is Eureka what is owned
what is history separately so that you
know what these individually mean as a
concept and what they can literally do
with the implementation right when you
design some micro services or when you
design applications on the cloud so even
if it is not for the cloud so how do we
handle failures and stuff like that so
that is what we are going to see in this
particular series but this particular
video we are going to see what are the
different softwares and you will see me
making new videos on eureka hystrix and
other stuff which are out there right so
if you'll notice this particular website
Netflix or github dot-com it is going to
explain you the different categories
with which Netflix has created their
tools based on so you can see the
different tool links from there for
example for Big Data they have different
tools like genie in be so lipstick stuff
like that so they have a fancy naming
concept
so if you notice Netflix they're all
their tools tools have a naming concept
and it is all funny and then it's it's
quite interesting as well but the major
part is the functionality which nit
explodes I feel that fix is doing the
heavy lifting of doing all these
technologies and then open sourcing it
and people are just writing a wrapper
around right for example spring is just
writing wrapper around Netflix
implementation and then we are using
them very easily so if you had seen my
video on hystrix or Zul or eureka we
just did very little work to integrate
that but I'm gonna tell you like what
they really mean right so in the indie
series so the first part is the big data
so for big data they have this set so
whatever big data implementation which
Netflix has in their company so they
have open source most of it so these are
the different tools which they have they
use spark they use her to and all these
latest things and they have shows these
tools like genie and in video for us to
use so you can use it and you can deploy
it in your envelope and try it out right
so I'm not going to go in depth on each
and every tube but I'll just give you a
high-level over for is there for each
category so that you can remember those
names and if somebody's quoting those
names you can identify that okay you
heard it somewhere right the next one is
a built-in delivery tool there is a
famous tool called nebulae which Netflix
has created so that is a nothing but a
Gradle plugin so you can use that little
plugin to automate your
build and delivery right so that is one
the major part which I have used from
Netflix is the common runtime services
which is nothing but the discovery
service or the load balancing or the
circuit breakers like hystrix or even
the API cafe like Zune API proxy let's
zoom etc right so we'll be seeing those
in the coming videos but yeah just
understand that those are just the
common runtime libraries or the services
which you can use in day-to-day life
like Eureka is similar to zookeeper
which does the service discovery istic
does the circuit breaker we will see
what our circuit breakers and what are
the circuit breaker patterns and why do
we need them in the micro services
enrollment then we have zone which is
nothing but the proxy which can be used
for proxy in your API gateway so you can
you can create it like a API gateway and
then proxy we request to the different
service the other part is the content
encoding so they have some tools written
there called photon data persistence
layer so you can use lots of tools like
dynamite and then Dino used by Netflix
for persisting data onto the cloud right
so you can use that I haven't used them
personally but I have heard people using
it so it goes well with you know sequel
databases like guess anger and stuff
like that right the next big thing is
the reliability and the performs so if
you have heard about Netflix reliability
and the performance management it is
quite mind-blowing they have very good
tools for testing their environment into
in for example they they have a simian
army so simian army is nothing but a set
of a bunch of tools which they use for
testing rather than normal so one such
tool is the chaos monkey or the chaos
Kong which they have so they can knock
out set of servers in a particular
region or in a particular location and
then you can test the enrollment so
these software's literally knocks out
stuff for the servers they just plug out
the connections of the edges crash tease
so was randomly so that our software's
are getting tested
so Netflix has some
very good performance and reliability
testing software so Simeon army is the
one which they have internally they have
so many tools so chaos monkey is one
among some chaos monkey chaos Commons
more others are there so we will see a
video on that as well right the next
thing is a security so in the security
space they have against security monkey
so I don't know why they name software
is in the name of monkeys and King comes
or something like that but they have a
peculiar way of defining the names right
so the final part is the user interface
with respect to the user interface they
do have some of the implementations for
RS rxjs and stuff like that so I'm not
sure how that will be helpful for us but
there are lots of libraries which
Netflix has built which we can reuse for
building some libraries right using
those libraries we can build our UI out
of the box so you don't have to do lots
of heavy lifting so Netflix has done
that and so whatever they have used it
in their UI implementation so it's all
there in rxjs which they have
implemented right so this is a different
open source stuff which netflix provides
so we are going to see you each one one
by one okay so just to give a high-level
idea I wanted to show you guys what is
Netflix Oasis so Netflix voice is
nothing but the open source software
which Netflix provides these are bunch
of software which Netflix has open
sourced so you can contribute to it as
well and then you can use it as well so
that is what Netflix OSS provides in the
subsequent videos we are going to see
what are the different Netflix OS the
software's which are very popular and we
are going to pick the popular ones and
we are going to see what they do
theoretically and then if possible I can
do a hands-on on the same right let's
see that that is what I wanted to cover
in this particular video hope you guys
liked it if you want me to make video on
any specific Netflix vs. library do let
me know in the comment section below I
can take a look and then I can do a
video on that so hope you liked the
video if you liked it go ahead and like
it if you haven't subscribe to the
channel go ahead and subscribe to it
wait again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
