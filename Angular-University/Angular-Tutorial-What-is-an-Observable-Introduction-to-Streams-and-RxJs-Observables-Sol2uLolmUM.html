from the angular University and in this
lesson we are going to start our journey
exploring services and HTTP the HTTP
service of angular 2 in detail now you
might have noticed that when you are
using the angular 2 HTTP module in the
early examples that we present it to you
that whenever you need a result from the
server you need to subscribe to it what
is this SUBSCRIBE method we are going to
learn observables in this first section
of this course and then we are going to
use them to build service layers with
HTTP you noticed before that we were
calling the server and that we were
storing the state in a state variable in
the service this is actually not a good
idea at least not in this form how
should we build angular to service
layers then the answer is simple by
using observables now let's start at the
beginning what is an observable and what
is a stream in our applications we have
streams of values everywhere imagine
when you drag your mouse around the
application so that series of values of
pairs of x and y-coordinates that's a
good example of a stream so a stream is
just a series of values in time okay
that's simple enough but then what isn't
observable well let's start by saying
what an observable is not an observable
is not a stream those are two different
concepts that it's important to separate
from the beginning now instead of
focusing on the perfect definition of
observable let's just build one and take
a look at it and see what can we make of
it let's build our first very simple
observable and take it from there for
example when we type in the adolescent
input box the
stream of values of the input box in
time that's a good example of a stream
now let's write an observable so that we
can tap into that stream let's for
example print the values of the stream
to the screen using the observable API
let's do observable and then from event
the first argument of from event is the
Dom element on which we want to listen
for an event and the key app is the Dom
event that we want to listen to the
output of from event is an observable
let's assign it to a variable in this
case to the keys variable that ends with
the dollar this is a convention to
identify variables that correspond to
observables if we try this out we can
see that this doesn't really do anything
visible in the program that's normal we
haven't even tried to print something to
the screen let's do that using the do
operator so observables came with a lot
of built-in operators this is just one
among many it's used to typically for
debugging purposes so it shouldn't be
used for anything other than that
because it produces a side-effect let's
see this in action if we now type in the
input box we can see that nothing still
happens and this is critical to
understand the difference between
streams and observables so the stream
exists when we type in the box there is
a series of values in time for the cube
event what happens here is that the
observable is really just a definition
of declaration of what we want to do
with the stream so and we need to
activate it we need to subscribe to the
observable otherwise nothing will happen
this is one of the main properties of
observables you need to subscribe to an
observable other than that the
observable before subscription is simply
just a definition of what we
want to do with the stream is just a
declaration it's just a blueprint for a
functional processing programming chain
that binds an input of a stream to a
consumer that is interested in values
that are derived from that stream so if
we now type in the input box we can see
that the key that we just pressed is
being outputted to the console we can
see here that the variable keys dollar
is really just a declaration of what we
want to do with the stream values we can
pass it around in our program we can
combine it with other such declarations
but this is not the stream itself it's a
way of handling the string it's a way of
building programs based on the notion of
stream remember the notion of observable
is essential for being able to use the
angular to HTTP module as well as
several other parts of the framework
let's continue laying down the
foundation for understanding observables
