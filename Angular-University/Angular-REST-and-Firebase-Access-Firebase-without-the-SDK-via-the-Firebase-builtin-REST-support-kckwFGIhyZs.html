how to do rest with firebase one thing
to bear in mind is that the angular fire
client and the SDK as well they are
isomorphic meaning that they will work
in both the browser and a node.js
process there are also versions of the
SDK in many languages it's available for
Android etc so you could easily build a
REST API that calls firebase another
alternative is to use the rest
capabilities of firebase itself in
firebase everything is rest enabled out
of the box so every lesson every course
we can do rest calls to operate on this
data let's take for example this course
angular 2 tutorial for beginners it's
actually a lesson so this is the first
lesson of the first course angular 2
tutorial for beginners let's copy this
URL here is the URL so it takes the
database so this is the URL to the root
of our database then slash lessons and
then the ID of the lesson with firebase
if we take this URL and we do a get call
to it we are going to get this data so
this is already implemented for us we
don't need to implement a REST API that
it's going to read firebase and get this
lesson and then return it to us we can
call firebase directly using an HTTP GET
and retrieve this lesson data let's do
that here using a test client we are
going to do a get call to this path we
need to add dot jason at the end so as
you can see when we run the get method
in this host to this path using dot JS
and at the end we get back the data of
this lesson as expected because it's a
get request you can also do this
directly from the browser so if you copy
paste the path itself without the dot
J's and you are going to be redirected
to
fire base console so here you can see
your data in the fire base console but
if you add a dot Jason at the end take a
look at what you receive you receive the
plain raw JSON data so in this example
we did an HTTP GET to retrieve the data
from firebase directly but other methods
are available so if we switch back to
our test client we can do for example
also a post to create a new lesson we
can do a put to replace the whole
content of the lesson a patch to replace
certain properties and delete to delete
the lesson in this case we are going to
do a patch so let's say that we hit this
URL with a patch request we are going to
set here the body of the patch request
and we're going to pass in here some
JSON we are going to modify only the
description property so patch allow us
to modify only certain properties we
don't have to pass in the whole list of
properties so we are going to set the
description property to test if we now
run this and take a look here at this
description field the description field
was updated to test as expected so this
means that all modification operations
in our database could be done using also
the angular 2 HTTP library so let's add
it here to our program we can simply add
here the HTTP module and with this we
have all the HTTP injectibles ready to
use what we're going to do is to show
that this is a possibility we are going
to implement the logic to delete a
lesson using the HTTP module in general
the angularfire library is a better
solution for accessing firebase because
the observable base the API is really a
great match to the real-time
capabilities of the database but
everything in firebase is doable also
via rest and that's what we are going to
illustrate here in order to implement
the delete lesson logic we are going to
switch over to the lesson detail HTML
template and we're going to add here
Atlee
handler to the delete button now let's
switch over to the lesser detail
component and let's implement the delete
method so the delete method is going to
delete the current lesson for this we
are going to do a call to the lesson
service and we are going to call delete
lesson which is a new method that we are
about to implement and we are going to
pass it in the identifier of the current
lesson so let's implement delete lesson
in lesson service so this is the
signature of the delete lesson method we
are going to implement delete lesson not
using the angularfire api but instead we
are going to do a rest call as we
mentioned we have injected here in the
constructor of lesson service we have
injected angular 2 HTTP so how can we
use it to do an HTTP delete what we want
to do here is we want to call the HTTP
delete method so using this dot HTTP we
have here a call to delete and we want
to pass in here a URL that we are going
to build here so I am just going to
initialize it for the moment like this
now what is this URL remember we have
here a firebase config and the firebase
config contains here your main database
URL so let's base ourselves on that
we're going to do
firebase config dot database URL and
we're going to add a slash and we are
going to add here slash lessons and we
are going to concatenate the lesson ID
so this is the URL that we want to hit
with the delete request now like other
API methods of a lesson service it's a
good idea to return here and observable
so in this case we will simply do an
observable of any and we are going to
return the result of calling delete so
if there is an error calling delete like
it's not authorized this is going to
trigger an error in this observable here
let's now try to delete a lesson so I
have switched over to this view so that
we can see at the same time the
application and the database we are
going to delete this lesson
the build your first angular 2 component
which is this one over here remember you
need to be authenticated at this stage
of the application development in order
to access this screen so let's just
delete the lesson and see what happens
as you can see nothing has happened and
this happens very often developing using
observables this is because we called
this method and we get back an
observable but we did not subscribe to
it so that ended up not triggering the
HTTP call so what we need to do is we
need to subscribe to this observable and
what we're going to do here is if there
is a deletion successful we are going to
show an alert to the user less and
deleted otherwise and in this particular
case we are simply going to lock the
error to the console we also need to add
to the URL the dot J'son extension let's
now try to delete the lesson so we are
going to try to delete build your first
angular 2 component which corresponds to
this lesson right here so if we click
delete we can see that the lesson was
deleted so it's gone here from the list
of lessons and we have seen the pop-up
saying lesson deleted as we can see the
firebase rest API allow us to do the
most common date operations that we
typically use with rest so all the
operations of adding to a list removing
from a list updating an element patching
it etc all of that is available out of
the box with firebase</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
