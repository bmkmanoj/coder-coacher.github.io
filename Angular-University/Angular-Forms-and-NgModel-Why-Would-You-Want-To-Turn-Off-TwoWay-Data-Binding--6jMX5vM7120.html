from the angular university and in this
lesson we're going to learn a couple of
different ways of using ng model ng
model is not only for the directional
data binding there's more to it so let's
take an example sometimes we simply just
want to initialize a form with certain
values that arrived imagine from our
back end but we don't want necessarily
to keep the value of the form all the
time in sync with a certain object maybe
we want to wait until the whole form is
valid before retrieving the data there
could be several reasons anyway ng model
supports that and more now when aside
how do we handle this radio button in
angular 2 we usually want to assign to a
radio button we want to have it
associated to a typescript indem in this
case the student level where you have
beginner and advanced the different
levels of a lesson well an HTML form
does not give us any number it gives us
a string simply put the string that we
have specified in the value attribute of
the radio button option in the form how
can we deal with this since ng model is
continuously reading and writing into
the lesson object level property what we
can do is we can use typescript getters
and setters to transform the anome back
into a string and vice versa like we are
doing here now ng model works also only
for initializing the form you don't have
to use it always for be directional
binding if you just want to initialize
the form with the content of the lesson
object but don't want to bind to it all
the time you can do so by removing these
round brackets from the ng model
attribute declaration let's try this out
if we now edit the title and the
duration
fields the values are not being
reflected back into the lesson object
but if we now edit the student level
innum that is still being be directional
e bound because we are using the famous
banana box syntax for the student level
field but remember ng model and angular
2 forms in general is about data binding
and validation you might not want to do
any data binding at all not even setting
an initial value in the form you might
only want to use the validation
functionality of forms and ng model
supports that if we want to do that we
simply remove the brackets notation from
the ng model attribute we simply use it
like this if you enjoyed this tutorial
you can always subscribe to my channel
for more upcoming angular 2 tutorials
also have a look at the website of the
angular university to see what type of
angular 2 tutorials you find there that
you might like let's try this out as we
can see now there is no data binding at
all being that not even an initial value
but validation is still working the
validation functionality that sets the
CSS state classes like dirty touched
that is still being applied to this
field by ng model but ok what can we do
with these classes we are not displaying
any error message to the user how can we
do that how can we give the user a good
form user experience using angular 2 we
are going to find out in the next few
lessons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
