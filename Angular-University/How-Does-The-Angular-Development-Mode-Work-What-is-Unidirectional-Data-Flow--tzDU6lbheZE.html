directional data flow why would we want
that in an application and let's see if
that is related with flux let's start
with MVC Model View controller what we
want to do when we are implementing an
application in general is that we want
it to have certain beneficial properties
namely
we want to make sure that the
application is simple to reason about so
that it's predictable that if we modify
let's say that for example here we
somehow modify the model our application
that modification is going to be
reflected in the view but the view
itself will not trigger other
modifications of the model so in MVC we
have here the controller that interacts
with the view and the model we want to
ensure in an MVC application that if we
modify the model so we modify locally we
meet a new message for example that
model modification is going to be
reflected in the view so meaning the new
message will be displayed here this
panel will be scrolled down and the
frame summary will be updated with the
latest message that we have just typed
in here in this component so we want to
make sure that this new message is
reflected in the view of our application
but this synchronization code that takes
the model and renders the view we want
to make sure that that code does not
itself trigger further modifications of
the model because that would make the
application very hard to reason about
let's show here a running angular 2
application so this is the application
that we are about to build it's already
in a certain stage of its development
but have a look in any angular 2
application that you have running even
if it's hello world you will have here
the code that is generated for us
automatically that
takes care of this synchronization for
us so in angular 2 one of the advantages
is that we will never have to write code
that synchronizes the model and the view
together that code is automatically
generated for us let's have a look at it
it's present in every application if you
open the chrome console and you search
here for
for example component dot ng factory
this is the code that is generated
automatically for us to make the model
and view synchronization let's take a
look at the code that synchronizes the
list of threads with this view here so
this is the phred list component so
please don't worry you will never have
to I hope debug this code this is
generated automatically for us and
although it's strange looking at first
it's more or less what we would write by
hand if we will be writing this
synchronization code ourselves so as you
can see this code is really the type of
code that you never want to write
yourself and you never want to be in the
situation where you have to debug it
even if you know that it's present so
this code that you see here you can see
that there are multiple elements that
are being created this is creating Dom
elements based on the model of the
thread list component we want make sure
that this code here going back to this
diagram this code here which is doing
the synchronization between the model
and the view we want to make sure that
this code will never itself trigger
further modifications of the model
because this would make the application
very hard to reason about now this
property where modifications in the
model are reflected on the view but no
further changes are triggered this is
known as unidirectional data flow and
the name comes from the fact that the
data the model really only flows in one
direction like we have here in this
picture and unlike situations like it
used to happen in angular 1 or
angularjs it's not possible for the
model to view synchronization code to
trigger further modifications of the
model keeping the application simple to
reason about for example in angular 1 or
angularjs that was not the case because
in one synchronization pass we could
have multiple changes in the model
because the watcher expressions could be
evaluated multiple times and that would
trigger a cycle where the model would be
updated multiple times until it will
eventually stabilize and wise an error
would be fraud so if you are not
familiar with angular 1 don't worry it's
just an example of how an application
might become hard to reason about
because we are allowing the view to
update itself in angular 2 this property
is ensured by a special development mode
so whenever we start an angular 2
application we will typically see here
in the console if we are running it in
development mode we will see here this
message so when the application is
running in this mode what angular will
do is every time that the
synchronization code between the model
and the view is executed to generate a
new view output based on a model that
code in development mode is going to be
run twice so the first time we are going
to generate a certain view and then we
are going to run that code again to make
sure that we still get the exact same
view if we don't get the exact same view
it means that the synchronization code
itself triggered further modifications
in the model that is something that we
want to avoid so at that point we will
get error and our application will crash
so this is how angular 2 applications
ensure unidirectional data flow via this
special development mode so as we can
see these beneficial property of
applications unidirectional data flow we
can see that it's not really related to
any type of application architecture in
general the use of the special angular
development
mold ensures in a directional data flow
in any application whether it uses the
flux architecture or not and so here we
are at the end of this introductory
section I know that we went through a
lot of things let's do a quick summary
in the next lesson and then after that
straight into implementing our chat
application we are going to do it from
an empty folder from the beginning it's
coming right up in just two lessons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
