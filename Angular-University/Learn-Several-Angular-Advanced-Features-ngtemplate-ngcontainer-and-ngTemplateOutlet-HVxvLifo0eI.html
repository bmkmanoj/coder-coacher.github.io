now cover some more advanced angular
features we are going to cover the ng
template and ng container called
directives we are going to use them to
improve our tab container we are going
to add to the tab container the
possibility of overriding the default
look and feel of the tab buttons so not
only the styles but the ability to
override the HTML itself let's have a
look at this so here we are giving this
default look and feel where we have the
buttons here inside this div with this
particular set of CSS classes this is a
very common way of styling tab buttons
but usually for example on mobile what
you see is something that looks closer
to a plain HTML button with some styling
so we would like this component to still
use as default if nothing else is
specified it's going to apply as default
this default looking field but if we
provide to the components a different
way of implementing the tab header
buttons that would be taken instead so
the way that this works is we are going
to pass in a template to the component
as an input property so let's introduce
the notion of templates and the ng
template angular core directive so if we
go here to the tab panel component we
see here that the look and feel of the
buttons in this case would always be
this list with a series of buttons that
we have here with these very specific
CSS classes so now let's see how could
we make this specific part of the
template over rideable we are going to
use here the ng template core tag
directive and we are going to move our
implementation of this part of our
template here inside this template so
the ng template tag will not be rendered
to the screen but we can use it to
render functionality so we are going to
give it a name to this template and we
are going to call it the default tab
hether template we are going to define
here an input property for this template
we are going to call it tabs and we are
going to pass it in the tabs variable of
our component notice that here the input
parameter variable of the template is
named tabs which has the same name as
the component member variable tabs these
are actually two separate variables that
could have two completely different
names with this in mind let's now switch
back to our tab component we are just
going to fix here a couple of things so
we are not using the constructor also
let's guard against the possible
occurrence of a type error that could
occur if we have not yet defined any
tabs inside the tab container we are
going to check if the first property of
the tabs member variable is present
before accessing it so now let's go back
here to our ng template instance we have
now moved the implementation of the list
of buttons inside the template but we
are not using the template here
elsewhere on this component and because
of that the tab buttons are not being
rendered to the screen so the template
by default does not get displayed on the
screen it's just a definition of a
section of our component template we now
need to take the ng template and
instantiate it there are multiple ways
of consuming templates one of them is to
use the ng container tag ng container
will not result in any Dom elements to
be rendered to the screen but it will
allow us for example to apply a
structural directive on top of it such
as ng if or ng for so if you would ever
find yourself in a situation where you
want to iterate through something let's
say the tabs and you would like to
iterate without rendering something to
the screen in that particular tag ng
container would be an example so in this
case we are going to be using ng
container to apply another structural
directive that already exists in angular
so it's not ng if or ng for its
ng templates outlet so
these structural directive takes as
input a template and renders it on the
screen so the first argument that we
pass in to this directive is the
template that we want to render and
there's the second argument we can pass
in an optional context object so this
context object would contain the inputs
that are needed by the template so in
the case of this template it's only one
property named tabs then we were already
filling it in at the level of the ng
template tag but we could have not
provided that value there if we did not
know it up front and we can also
alternatively provide it in a completely
programmatic way let's see how we could
do that so after the semicolon here we
are going to specify another property
which is the context we're going to
separate with a semicolon and to the
context we are going to pass in a plain
JavaScript object that we are going to
call tabs context and we are going to
see what do we need to pass in here in
order to render the template if we
switch back here to the component let's
quickly implement here a getter for this
tax context property we are going to
have it return a plain JavaScript object
with one property we are going to call
it tabs so this corresponds to the input
property that the template needs as
input and we are going to populate with
this property the value of the tabs
property that we have here at the level
of the component so if we now hit ctrl s
let's see what happens so as you can see
our ng template is now being applied to
the component as expected so now we have
the same look and feel as before but we
could now replace this template the
default tabs header template by another
template that was externally provided to
the component let's see how we can do
that and effectively customize the look
and feel of the component with
alternative HTML this is chemi right up
in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
