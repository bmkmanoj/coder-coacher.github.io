from the angler university and I'm sure
you all heard the great news so angular
2 is out I would like to bring you a
quick demo of how to use angular 2 final
together with the latest CLI so this is
the web pack preview of the CLI we're
going to see why there are several
reasons fill out this video why it's a
great idea to use the angular CLI either
if you are just trying out the framework
for the first time and you want a safe
stable playground as a development
environment or even if you are starting
out a new project you should at least
have a look at the CLI because it might
be a very good option please bear in
mind that the CLI is in beta so let's
have a look at it let's simply install
the latest angular CLI so we no longer
need to do a NPM install angular CLI ed
went back so if you're in UNIX or a Mac
you might have to throw in a pseudo
let's just do that this will take a
while but the installation will be
completed so now if you do ng minus
minus version you should get the better
14 version so if it says something like
/ web pack it's not the correct version
this is the correct one better 14 so
let's just now scaffold a project using
ng new hello world so this will take a
while but a new angular 2 project will
be generated fully prepared to run
angular 2 final and after a while we
have a new project completely scaffolded
so let's open it here it's the project
hello world and if we inspect the
package.json we can see that everything
is updated to angular 2 final the router
is the version 3 dot 0 so this is a
working angular 2 project let's open
here the main file let's have a look at
the application module so everything is
compliant with angular 2 final
let's run the project so here in the
command line we need to CD into the
folder and there we simply type ng serve
and this will start the development
server one of the advantages of this
development server is that it has hot
reloading working let's see this in
action so after a while your development
server is running so if you go to local
host port 4200 let's do 4200 we have
here a running hello world application
so this is running in development mode
so it's in just-in-time compilation mode
let's take a look at the network tab so
if we refresh the application we can see
that we only have about six requests and
everything loads in about one second so
this gives a very good experience for
development we don't have a lot of HTTP
requests now let's do a modification
let's go to the application component
and as we can see another advantage of
using the CLI version is that we don't
have to fill in here this property
module ID that we need to fill in if we
are using for example system GS at least
for the moment so we can simply type
here the relative path to the template
let's see here in the file directory
structure so this file dot HTML dot CSS
are right next to the component file so
we can reference them simply by using a
relative path and the CLI will be able
to find these files and add them to the
build transparently so no module ID
needed now let's make a here quickly
change to the template so let's just say
angular 2 hello world and we are going
to see how to loading in action so if we
save the file that kicks in our build it
will rebuild the application bundle and
it will trigger hot reloading so we have
here the new change applied
automatically the CLI is also very
convenient for developing new components
and services so it takes away all the
need for boilerplate so if for example
we create a new component so ng
of generate and then we generate a
component let's call it hello if we run
this command we are going to have a
hello component generated we have here
the paths and the files that were
generated so here inside app we have
here a new component ready to use
everything is filled in automatically
for us according to the angular style
guide so this is really very convenient
for development another great thing
about this generated component is that
not only it follows the angular 2 style
guide but also it's ready to use so if
we take the app hello selector of the
component let's simply try to add it
here to the template of our application
so if we apply it directly in a template
and we hit ctrl s this is going to
trigger the rebuilding of the bundle and
we can see that the hello component was
already included in the template so the
generated component is not only
compliant with the style head but it's
ready to be used because it was
correctly registered here in the
application module many other CLI
commands are already available let's for
example generate a new directive so ng g
directive and here let's pass in path
and we are going to call it my directive
or simply my dear we're going to create
directive and we can see here the paths
where the directive is available so here
it is under the shared folder so more
commands are available for the CLI let's
generate a pipe as well and GG pipe and
GG pipe and we are going to call it my
pipe so if we run this also here if we
don't pass in a path it will show up on
the root of the application that might
not be what is intended so as we can see
the pipe is here and again all these
directives pipes services etc that are
generated via the command line they are
ready to be used in the templates direct
another great thing about the CLI is
that the production build is already
usable actually we could create a build
a development build using ng build and a
production build using minus minus prod
and this would create a dist folder
containing the build but in order to use
either build we don't have to run ng
build we can simply run the
corresponding serve command so in this
case ng serve minus minus prod and what
this will do is that it will create a
mini 5 compressed bundle that is also
tree shaped so let's take a look here at
the output log as we can see here in the
law we can see which functions were
dropped in the production build so this
will reduce the size of the bundle as we
can see the application still works
perfectly in production mode now if you
take a look here at the main dot ES file
you can see that the application is
running in production mode but we are
still using just-in-time compilation in
this case so one future announcement
that will further reduce the bundle size
will be to get ahead of time compilation
integrated in the bill so that will be
available in the future but meanwhile
the CLI is a very good solution for
starting to play around with angular 2
as a playground or even if you are
starting a project today why not start
it directly with the CLI you can see
that you get a lot of productivity you
just run a command in the command line
and you get a working component so this
is huge you have a great development
experience with the hot reloading and in
the near future it will be just a matter
of updating the CLI and your build will
still work your application will still
work because there won't be any breaking
changings for the next six months so it
looks like the CLI is the ideal starting
point for starting to learn angular 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
