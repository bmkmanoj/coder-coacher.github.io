from the angular University welcome
welcome to the ng rx reactive extensions
architecture course in this course we
are going to learn how to build an
application from top to bottom from an
empty folder using the NZXT store and
the store design pattern or paradigm in
general we're going to learn about the
flux architecture we're going to learn
what problem it's designed to solve
we're going to learn about the original
face book counter problem that famous
bug that occurred a couple of years ago
in face book itself we're going to learn
all about it we are going to learn how
the face book team fixed it and how it
originated this modern application
architecture we're going to learn how
the original flux architecture gave
origin to single store architectures
like redux and ngrick store we are going
then to reproduce the same problem that
the Facebook team was solving we are
going to build from scratch from an
empty folder shed application and
multi-user shet application where you
will be able to have several users
interacting in a chatroom several
friends several users associated to
different threads we're going to see the
famous face book counter problem and we
are going to see how a store like
architecture a single store architecture
really helps to tackle this kind of user
interfaces we are going to go from the
empty folder build the application step
by step the way that we are going to
structure this course is the following
first a brief architecture introduction
because we need to give some context on
what is this single store architecture
and what are the benefits we are going
to present the face book counter problem
and after this brief initial
introduction we are going to dive
straight into the code we are going to
start to build the
chat application from an empty folder
setup the ng rx store as soon as
possible covered ng rx effects as soon
as possible cover the separation between
the view and view model what type of
data we want to put in the store and why
how to derive view models from the store
data we're going to cover all of that in
this initial section where we will build
the core of our application in this
initial section as soon as it's
practical we are going to introduce the
ng RX dev tools we are going to see how
can we better debugger programs using a
chrome development extension that will
allow us to time travel through our
application we are going to be able to
put our application into any given state
go back and forth between the multiple
states of our front-end we are going to
cover all the usual concepts associated
with store solutions like for example
reducer functions actions how to
dispatch an action we're going to see
what is a selector how to use the ng RX
effects library and we will also
introduce a small debugging utility for
rxjs applications in general to
complement the dev tools so at this
point in the course you will already
have a running shet application and you
will also have a good overview of what
are the strengths what are the strong
points of store based solutions when to
use them and why to which problems do
they apply and how do we design an
application from top to bottom using a
library like ng rx store next what we're
going to do is we're going to do a
guided tool on the ng rx ecosystem in
general we're going to cover the
integration with indexeddb via the ng r
x DB module we are going to cover
immutability we are going to cover how
immutability leverages the use of on
push change detection and what are the
advantages and
advantages of using that and when should
we use that and why we're going to cover
the integration between ngrick store and
Rooter so we are going to go library by
library giving the finishing touches to
our chat application now because this is
a full stack architecture course we are
also going to cover the backend namely
back-end design and what would the rest
endpoint look like if it was designed
and created from scratch to go along
with this type of single store
architecture we are going to use a
back-end that is already ready to go
during our course so that we can focus
on the engineer X library ecosystem so
you will start the implementation from
an empty folder but from the moment that
we need to do an HTTP call we are going
to check out a back-end from an existing
branch and the course will go on using
the existing back-end then at the end we
are going to cover how that back-end was
implemented but the first part of the
course is all about ngrick store and its
library ecosystem so without further ado
let's get started with the introductory
architecture section and what we're
going to do is we are going to start at
the beginning what was the famous face
book counter boy we are going to cover
that we are going to see what was the
main problem what was the main situation
for which a new architecture type
emerged we are going to cover the Flex
architecture we are going to talk a
little bit about unidirectional data
flow what it is why it's such a great
property to have in an application we
are also going to talk about what
typically does not work when we face
something like the face book counter
problem which is global event bus
systems we are going to cover what is
the problem with that type of solution
and why that's
not supported out-of-the-box in angular
by design I mean angular 2 or above
without further ado let's get going
let's learn in the next section what is
the Facebook counter problem it's coming
