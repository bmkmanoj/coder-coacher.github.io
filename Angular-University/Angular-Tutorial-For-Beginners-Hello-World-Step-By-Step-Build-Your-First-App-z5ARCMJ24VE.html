Vasco here from the Angular Academy.
We‚Äôre going to see how to bootstrap our
first Angular 2 application.
Coming right up.
Every Angular 2 application is really a tree
of components.
Even the entry point of the application, even
its root entry point is itself a component.
In our case, the entry point of our application
is this ‚Äúhello-world‚Äù custom HTML tag.
Let‚Äôs see how to implement this.
In order to implement the custom HTML tag
in Angular 2, we need to define a component
class.
So let‚Äôs define a component class ‚Äúhello
world‚Äù.
In order to inform Angular that this defines
how a component should behave and be displayed,
we‚Äôre going to annotate it with the standard
@Component angular decorator.
This informs the framework that this class
defines how a component should behave and
present.
Now the first thing that we do is to define
to which custom HTML tag does this component
correspond to.
In this case, it‚Äôs the ‚Äúhello-world‚Äù
tag.
So we are going to put this here in the selector,
‚Äúhello-world‚Äù.
Not that this is a CSS selector but the best
practice for components is that this corresponds
to the custom HTML tag of the component.
The next thing that we‚Äôre going to define
is how does the component present itself on
the screen.
For that, we fill in the template attribute.
In this case, we are just going to output
an H1 HTML tag saying ‚Äúhello world‚Äù.
Now we need to start the application.
We need to tell Angular that this is actually
the root component of our application because
in theory, it could be any component used
anywhere else on the page.
In order to do so, we use the bootstrap function.
This indicates to Angular what is the entry
point of the application.
If we now try this, we can see that our application
is working.
So congratulations.
You just wrote your first Angular 2 application
and this is just the beginning.
We‚Äôre going to do deep dives on components,
directives, forms, the router, the service
layer, how to build it using observable data
services and NgRx.
We are going to see how Angular Universal
works.
This is just the beginning.
So stay tuned.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
