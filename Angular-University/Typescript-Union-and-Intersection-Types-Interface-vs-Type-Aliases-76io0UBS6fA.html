Union types intersection types and when
to use the keyword type versus
interfaces so let's start with a simple
program we have here a plain JavaScript
object named player that is getting
logged out to the screen so if we run
the program you can see that the object
is printed to the screen as expected now
we would like to make this variable more
type safe because right now it has the
implicit type ne and we're going to see
in a moment how can we prevent that the
typescript compiler adds any implicitly
to certain variables right now we want
to add a couple of type definitions his
name which has two properties first name
and last name and has address which has
a property of address so this player
object actually conforms to these two
interfaces so it has all the three
properties on the two interfaces so we
would like to add here a type that is
different than any that reflects that in
order to do so we can create here a type
Elias and we are going to call it player
so this type Elias is an Elias for a
combination of other types so in this
case we are going to use has name and
has address so any object of the type
player will implement the two interfaces
it will have the properties of both
these types here if we go to the player
variable and we declare it as player the
program will still compile and run as
expected now take a look if we remove
one of these variables here we
immediately get a type error saying that
the variable is missing so let's add it
back for the moment what we have defined
here is what is known as an intersection
type now we can also combine this with
Union times we have seen using Union
types before when dealing with
nullable variables we can say that this
variable here is either a combination of
these two types
or no now we can see here that the type
keyword is being used to define both a
type Elias which is the combination of
these three types and separate object
types this syntax here is actually
equivalent to using the interface
keyword which in typescript is not only
associated to object-oriented
programming so we can define interfaces
that an object can comply to it doesn't
need to be an instance of a class in the
object-oriented kind of way so in
typescript we can define interfaces that
an object should implement not
necessarily a class so instances that
adhere to the interface will have the
properties defined in the interface but
they don't need to be instances of class
in the object-oriented sense as part of
the typescript documentation this is
actually the recommended way that we
should use interface and type so we
should use interface to define
properties that an object will adder two
will have and we should use type elias's
to combine existing types together
either with other types or with null and
undefined which from the point of view
of the typescript to type system are
also types so low and undefined are
types now one thing that is worth
mentioning at this point is that the
type and defined you really probably
never want to use it in your program
directly you probably want to define
things like the player type which
combined either primitive types or
application defined types such as has a
dress or has lame and low so this
implicitly excludes the type undefined
because null is not undefined those are
two different types</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
