take this very simple plain JavaScript
object that has to property so first
name and last name you might think that
the type of this object is object I mean
it should be a type that takes any
property this is what we would be led to
believe but take a look if we cry to add
here another property address we are
going to get an error it says property
address does not exist on type and we
have here what looks like a type
definition which is an object that can
only have two properties either first
name or last name we are going to see in
a moment how to configure the typescript
compiler to allow such situations if we
want to but right now let's focus here
on this person variable it's clear at
this point that the typescript compiler
is already defining a type and
associating it to the parcel variable if
we hit ctrl shift p we can see that the
type is defined here so its first name
and last name so the type define is an
object that can only take these two
properties we could have defined this
type explicitly by adding a type
definition and defining the type here in
line so we will define the first name
that needs to be a string and we are
going to define the last name also a
string so as you can see the program
compiles perfectly and it's equivalent
to the version where the type is
inferred now we might want this to be
just a plain old JavaScript object that
could take any property if you want to
do so we can remove this type definition
and we can annotate here explicitly the
type any this means that this is an
object that can have any property and as
you can see we no longer get here a
compilation error we can do percent
address or person that any other
property and also take the type
definition of what we had before and
find a type let's create a type called
has name and we are going to assign it
here this type definition so his name is
an object with these two properties
which help strings and only with these
two properties we can now use the name
to define that person is of type has
name and now we get back again the air
property address does not exist on type
so as you can see in typescript we can
define our own types and those types
don't have to be the definition for
example of a class or a primitive type
we can define complex types and compose
them together it's also possible to say
that for example the last name property
is mandatory but maybe the first name
property is optional so let's say that
for example we only have the last name
right now this will give us a
compilation error saying that the
property first name is missing but if we
define it as optional using this syntax
now the compilation error disappears at
this moment you might notice that has
named this kind of looks like an
object-oriented interface and actually
if we use here the keyword interface and
we remove the equal sign this is
actually an alternative definition of
the type has name we are going to learn
when to use an interface and when to use
the type definition in a later lesson
right now we are going to show that
there is another important feature in
action here at this stage which is auto
completion so if you do person dot you
will see here the multiple properties
available via auto completion and this
is something that is not available while
using plain JavaScript now one last
example of type definitions we can
compose types together so for example if
we define a new type has address which
let's add here a property street name
which is a string we can now define a
new type and let's call it person and
this is the combination of a name
property which is of
type has name and notice the auto
completion again in action and the
address property which is of type has
address so we can define here person as
being of type person and as you can see
this is no longer working we can have
here a property name and we pass in the
last name inside it we still get an
error this means that the address
property is missing so we can mark it as
optional and now we no longer have
compilation errors so as you can see
these type definitions can be combined
together to produce complex types</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
