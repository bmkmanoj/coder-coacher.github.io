lesson we're going to learn what is a
JSON web token and what are the three
parts that together make a JSON web
token we are also going to learn about
base64 encoding let's quickly head over
to JWT dot IO that is the URL and let's
quickly talk about JSON web tokens so
what are JSON web tokens in a nutshell
JSON web tokens are an open industry
standard for representing claims between
two parties so this is the critical part
they are tokens for representing claims
so as the word J'son means they are a
JSON payload that one party will send to
another and the receiving party will be
able to make sure that the payload that
they received was effectively sent by
another party that they know well the
key property of JSON web tokens is that
they are self verifiable meaning that if
you want to make sure that the JSON web
token is valid you only have to look at
the token itself because the token comes
with that cryptographic signature we
don't have to contact a third party
server to validate the token and we
don't have to keep it in memory between
requests let's go into this in detail so
what does a JSON web token look like
what you are seeing here as you scroll
down in jail with you dot IO this string
here is a JSON web token notice the
colors we have here free strings
separated by dots each JSON web token
has three parts the first part that
corresponds to this part in rail is a
JSON payload that specifies certain
technical properties of the JSON web
token that we are going to cover later
on so how do we get from the J's and
Heather object in red to the string in
red base64 is just a practical format
for encoding data and sending it over
the network so we
not encryption it's just an encoding the
64 characters of this encoding were
chosen because they are represented in
the same way in many different encodings
so we are sure that these string created
in a machine using utf-8 encoding will
also be correctly read in another
machine that uses a very different
encoding the two machines don't have to
know about which encoding each one is
using which is the key benefit of using
base64 we are going to see this encoding
in action in a moment right now let's
move on to the second part of the JSON
web token the second part of the JSON
web token is here between the two dots
so it's the payload this is the claim it
could be a claim about anything but JSON
web tokens are very frequently
associated to authentication so for
example here we have the property serve
this stands for subject the content of
the sub property is essentially a
technical identifier that uniquely
identifies a user so it's not the user
email it's some technical identifier
that would not help an attacker if the
JSON web token was stolen more on this
later right now let's talk about the
third part of a JSON web token that's
the signature this is the part that
ensures that the payload was effectively
sent by a given party let's then see
each of these three parts of JSON web
tokens step by step let's keep in mind
the high level goal of a JSON web token
it's to send a claim between two parties
in a way that the receiving party can be
sure that the information was
effectively sent by who they think it
was sent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
