lesson we are going to finish the
implementation of our tab container
component let's learn how an angular
component can not only have its own
template but also receive template
partials as inputs to implement this
let's switch back here to the component
class so one way of implementing that is
to create here a component property that
we are going to call the header template
and this property will be off typed
template ref and we are going to use the
type any we are going to import this
from angular core using out entered so
template ref is a reference to a angular
template such as for example this
template that we have here to better
understand how ng template works let's
do a view shell query to the tab panel
component template we are going to query
by the template ref type so because in
the template we only have one NG
template tag that's the instance that is
going to be associated to this variable
so this shows that the variable of type
template ref will correspond to an
instance of the ng template element in
our current use case what we want is
instead of retrieving this as a view
shell query we want to retrieve the
template reference as a component input
using the input decorator so let's see
how could we use these input properties
so here at the level of the application
component if we want we can define here
an alternative
NG template so let's do that we are
going to using the ng template tag
define here and alternatives template we
are going to give it a name we are going
to call it Heather buttons
so this ng template here will be
effectively an alternative look and feel
for the tab buttons of our tab panel and
now using these header buttons we could
go here to our tab component and we will
take this header template property and
we would pass in a reference here to
this alternative template
now the components now receives here as
input property these alternative
template so it's just a matter of going
here to the tab panel component template
and instead of always using the default
tabs as a template we are going to test
for the existence of this template
reference input property so we're going
to add here a ternary expression I would
say if the head of template is present
then let's use the header template
otherwise let's use the default template
instead so with this in place we would
now have everything needed to provide an
alternative template to our component
let's then try this out and provide an
alternative template to the tab button
section so let's say that instead of
displaying the tab buttons here as a
list of items let's instead provides an
alternative version of this that we'll
simply use here a couple of buttons so
the first button will simply say login
and the second button will say signup so
right now in this example I'm only
taking the first two tabs so if the
first button login button is click then
we are going to show here this tab and
let's give it a reference we're going to
call it the login tab and this will be
the signup tab so with these two
references in place we could use these
references to implement the tabbing
functionality first let's hit command s
and see that everything is already being
used as expected so now the tab panel is
rendering these two buttons instead of
the default implementation and if we
remove here the header template and we
hit ctrl s we are going to see that we
have the implementation the default
implementation of the tab buttons back
with it in place let's continue the
alternative implementation of the tab
buttons so we would still need to
implement here the functionality for
selecting a given tab so for that we are
going to detect for example a click here
at the level of this button and whenever
the button gets
week we want to call the select tab
method so you can try it like this
select tab and we are going to pass in
as reference the login tab and this
situation brings us to a fundamental
concept about the use of templates and
content projection as well the problem
is this would not work because
everything that is inside here this ng
template any references that we have
here to a function would not be resolved
against the tab panel component where
this is being used this would be
resolved against the application
component but the problem is that the
application component does not have a
select tab function so we would run into
an error so in order to fix that problem
we have added here a tab panel reference
to the tab panel component so this is
the whole component and we are going to
use it to access this function the
select tab function so using it we can
implement here the type selection
functionality so here the signup button
we are going to link it to the sign up
tab let's try this out if we refresh the
application we are going to see that if
we click sign up now the signup form is
being shown if we click login we are
back to the login form and again if we
remove this alternative implementation
we have the default look and feel back
working again so here we have it this is
the final version of our tab container
component let's now add some test
specifications to it before we move on
to our next component we are going to
again increase the level of difficulty a
little bit we are going to introduce
structural directives it will be a modal
component but first let's write the
tests for the tab container component we
are going to see how can we test the
switch tab functionality for example
let's have a look at it this is coming
right up in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
