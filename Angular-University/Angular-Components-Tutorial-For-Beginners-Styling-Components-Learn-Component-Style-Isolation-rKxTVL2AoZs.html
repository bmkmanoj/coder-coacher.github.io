from the angular academy in this lesson
we are going to learn how to give our
components and style we are going to
learn how to apply CSS styles to them in
a maintainable way coming right up
in order to styler component we need to
pass it via the Styles property an array
of strings and each string is a string
literal containing all the CSS styles
that we want to apply specifically to
instances of this component and this
component only so let's paste in some
Styles applying to the button of the
search box and let's see this in action
we can see that the styles were applied
now where are the styles they are in a
head tag in the top of the page embedded
in line by angular transparently we
don't have to worry about this the
styles are there now let's inspect the
styles we can see here that the style
not only is applied to the component but
we have this funny-looking underscore
ng-content
style selector why is this this is
something that angular applies
automatically to the styles that we have
defined associated to the component this
is a unique identifier added to all
instances of this component in the page
what this does and this is a very cool
feature
this increases the specificity of the
style that is applied to the component
so that lets say for example there were
other styles on the page that defined
the background of a button this style in
all likelihood would override it and
take precedence over other styles on the
page so this is a mechanism for
isolating partially the component and
making it styles more reusable this
means that if we include this component
in other pages where other styles are
applied it's very likely that
the component will still be displayed
correctly as we want it so it's a huge
feature of angular 2 this partial
component isolation in a future lesson
we are going to see how in certain
browsers we can get complete isolation
now let's see how we can put the style
in an external file so we just take the
Styles and using the Styles URL property
we are going to paste these Styles into
an external file notice the dot
component dot CSS extension again this
is the best practice we can now include
the Styles in the page using the Styles
URL property and passing in the name of
the CSS file because we have already
applied module dot ID to this component
the Styles will be found by angular
correctly as we can see the styles are
still being correctly applied even in
the external file now we are almost
getting to the point we are going to do
our exercise so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
