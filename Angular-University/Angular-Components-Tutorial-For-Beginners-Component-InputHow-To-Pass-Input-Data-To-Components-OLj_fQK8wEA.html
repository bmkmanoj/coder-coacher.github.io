Vasco here from the Angular University.
We‚Äôre going to see how to pass input data
to an component and even if you are already
aware of these, you might not know how to
pass in a string, a simplified way to pass
in a string property into a component.
Coming right up!
So we have here our search box component.
Let‚Äôs add it an input property.
In this case, we want to configure what the
place holder text will say instead of search.
So for that, we use the square brackets notation
to pass in a property into the component.
Now we assign to the text property.
We‚Äôre going to assign a string.
Notice the quotes around the string.
Without this, this will not work.
Now we are going to declare the property in
the component using the @Input Decorator.
We annotate a property name text using the
@Input Decorator and it‚Äôs all we need to
pass in an input variable to the component.
Now what we want to do is to use the value
of the text variable in the component template.
In this case, we are going to use the interpolation
syntax, so double curly braces.
We‚Äôre going to do a deep dive in the interpolation
syntax in a future lesson.
Right now we just use it to output the place
holder value into the template.
If we now try this out, we can see that ‚Äútype
your search‚Äù is now displayed in place of
the placeholder.
Now for that tip that I mentioned in the beginning
of the lesson, this is a very common scenario.
We just want to pass in a constant string
as an input to the controller.
This variable input will not be variable.
It will never change.
For this, there is a simplified syntax where
we can actually remove the square brackets
from around the text property and we can remove
the quotes from the string and like that,
we have a simplified way to pass in a string
as a constant value for a component input.
Next, we are going to see how we can subscribe
to a component to receive an output event
that it generates.
How can we receive data from the component?
Stay tuned.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
