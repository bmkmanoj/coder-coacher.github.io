from the angular Academy this lesson is
a more advanced example of how to use
components we're going to see how
multiple components interact with each
other
we're going to build a couple of
components we're going to build a color
picker a color previewer and learn a
bunch of component features along the
way so stay tuned what we have here on
this page is only the HTML for the
components that we are about to build if
we click on them
there is no functionality at this moment
let's start refactoring this and start
creating our angular tree of components
this HTML here will be part of our color
picker component and here will be our
color previewer component let's give
each one of these two components a
reference now we saw references on
previous lessons applied directly to
plain HTML elements such as a div or an
input box in this case when a reference
is applied to a component it will point
directly to the component instance so we
can use a reference to a component to
call actions on it in this case the
reset button will have a click handler
that once the button is clicked the
color picker will have his reset method
invoked let's now create some component
interaction the color picker component
will output a custom color event and
when we receive an occurrence of that
event of that custom event we are going
to pass in the color that we received
from the custom event into the color
previewer and again we can do that
directly using a reference so you can
see here this is an example of component
interaction where we did not write any
code in the parent class in this case
the app class we did everything via
template references this is just one way
of many of
making components interact using
references more ways of component
interaction in future lessons right now
let's implement the color picker
component we have passed it here the
HTML that we have previously on the
initial page now we are going to to each
of the color sample divs blue and red
we're going to add a click handler that
once that div is clicked we are going to
trigger the shoes component method and
we are going to choose the color that
was clicked so we are going to create an
output event emitter named color and
when we click on shoes we are going to
trigger the event emitter and send the
new color that was chosen we are also
going to implement the reset method that
we saw before remember that the event
emitter needs to be annotated with at
output otherwise this will not work when
we click reset we are going to emit the
empty string as a color now let's write
our color previewer component we have
here the HTML that we have initially
we're just going to add it an input
property using the input decorator
property named color which is a string
now to apply the color to the text we
are going to use the core directive ng
style we are going to do a deep dive in
ng style in a following lesson right now
let's just use it to specify the color
CSS attribute of the color previewer we
are going to pass it in the color
variable let's see what we already have
here so if we click on the color picker
the color previewer gets its color
updated as expected now let's make the
color previewer
to be a component that takes both inputs
and outputs for that let's assign the
value of the color output event that we
received from the color picker let's
assign it to a variable in the app class
now we are going to pass in this
variable to the color previewer
as an input now we could not name the
input property color because we already
have an output event emitter named color
to solve this we are going to rename the
output to color output instead of color
but we need to tell angular that this
corresponds to the color output event we
do that by specifying that name inside
the output decorator we can now create
the color input property and apply it to
the template using again ng style now
take a look at this everything is still
working and the pick a color title is
also getting the color applied now with
this lesson we are ready to tackle our
exercise where we're going to apply
everything that we have learned so far
about angular components so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
