now create an hello world angular
material project we're going to head
over here to the angular material course
repository and we're going to look here
for the set of instructions with all the
commands to create the hello world
project we're going to look for a file
called in it dot MD this is a markdown
file that is going to contain all the
commands that we will be needing to
create our sample project and the first
command that we need to run is ng new
the name of the project and we're going
to add - - routing so that we have some
initial routing configuration in place
let's then switch over to our terminal
and we're going to start to scaffold our
application let's start by running
engine ooh this is going to take a
moment because we are installing the
packages using NPM after a while our
installation is going to be completed
successfully at this point we have a
scaffolded angular project so we can
already open this folder in our IV in
this case we are using webstorm and
using here the terminal that we can open
using out f12 we're going to be
installing the angular material
dependencies the first dependency is
angular material itself but we also need
the angular component development kit
once these dependencies are fully
installed we are also going to install
the angular animations package this
package is used optionally by angular
material and it's going to allow us to
animate many of our components such as
for example tab containers menus we will
have animations working out of the box
for these elements if we want to use our
application in mobile we need to add
gesture support so that is going to be
implemented by hammer J's that again
angular material optionally uses so
we're going to install it to make our
application mobile friendly once we have
hammer J's installed we're going to
enable gesture support in our
application by importing hammer J's here
into our main dot es angular material is
going to use hammer GS transparently if
the application is running in the mobile
device the next step in our material
setup
is going to be to choose a theme let's
have a look to see which themes are
available here we are going to go to
node modules the angular scoped packages
and we're going to head over here to the
material folder and inside we are going
to have here a folder called pre-built
films these are the multiple themes that
are available out of the box
let's say that for example we want to
use the indigo pink theme in order to
use it we are simply going to head over
here to our Styles dot CSS and we're
going to import this file directly here
using add import this is going to fill
all the components of angular material
according to this theme
another thing that we are going to be
needing in our application is material
design icons so google has a font
available for that we are going to
import it into our application we're
going to head over here to our index dot
HTML and we are going to adhere the
material icons font if you are curious
to see what icons are available with
this font we can head over here to
material dot io / icons and see here all
the icons that are available you have
here a search bar let's say that for
example we need an icon for a phone so
here we have the multiple icons
available and with this in place we have
scaffolded a complete angular material
project let's do a quick test to see
that everything is working as expected
and that the field is being applied
correctly here is what we're going to do
let's start by launching our development
server that we can do using the NPM
start command and we're going to apply
here a couple of simple angular material
components we are going to be using
raised buttons with a couple of
different colors from the theme the
primary color and the accent color just
make sure that everything is working we
are also going to have to import here
this material raised button directive so
in order to do that we go here to our
application module and we are going to
import here a specific module of angular
material that imports all the button
components we need to import these
modules separately in this case the
module that we want to import is the
button module so as we can see webstorm
is added here the import for us
automatically with this module imported
to our application this button here
which is a plain HTML element will no
longer be a plain HTML button this mat
raised button directive which is an
angular material directive is going to
get applied to this button and it's
going to give to a button a series of
special properties let's have a look at
this in action we are going to switch
over here to the browser and we are
going to head over to localhost 4200
let's have a look at what we have here
so as you can see we have here the basic
button a button with a primary color and
an accent button and we can see here
this drop shadow if we click on it we
get a ripple effect with an animation
all of these is working out of the box
using angular material this conference
that our setup is working correctly
we have animations in place we have a
theme in place we can import angular
material components and with this in
place we are ready to start building our
angular material sample application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
