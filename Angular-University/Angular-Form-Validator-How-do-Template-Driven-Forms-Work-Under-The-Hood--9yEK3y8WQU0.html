angular University and in this lesson we
are going to learn what is this magic
all about of template driven forms how
does this work
we are also going to see some standard
validators that come with the framework
so coming right up you might be
wondering how does this all work well
it's a testament to the power of angular
2 forms and directives the mechanisms
that we have seen before all the forms
module is made with directives basically
these are just plain angular 2
directives you could have written them
yourself but they come packaged for us
already there is a form level directive
that is applied to the form element so
it has a selector which has formed in it
and that's basically it it's as simple
as that
so there will be a form directive that
keeps track of the validity of the whole
form and which form fields which form
controls does the form have then
whenever you apply ng model to an input
that will also create a directive that
gets applied to that input element and
that directive will create a form
control that will also register itself
in the form directive so remember
directives can inter communicate via
different mechanisms whenever you apply
the required attribute well that's also
a forms standard directive that gets
applied to this element that will
register a validation rule with the form
control but enough about the theory
let's see this in practice so it's very
simple the same way that you have the
required directive that gets applied to
mark fields in mandatory there are many
other directives that allow us to do
form field validation such as minimum
length for example let's see how this
works if we specify a minimum length of
10 characters and we
start typing on the field the field will
be read until the moment where we type
at least 10 characters or more let's try
another standard validator the max
length validator so if we say max length
15 we start typing it becomes valid and
now we cannot type anymore so this
directive mimics the standard behavior
of the html5 max length validator let's
try another standard validator for
example let's say that the duration
field can only have numeric characters
let's use the pattern validator and we
can pass it in a JavaScript regular
expression that defines what are the
acceptable characters for the field if
you enjoyed this tutorial you can always
subscribe to my channel for more
upcoming angular 2 tutorials also have a
look at the website of the angular
university to see what type of angular 2
tutorials you find there that you might
like as you can see you can only type
numbers in this field as expected now
that you know how template driven forms
work under the hood you can understand
that you can add your own validations to
a form by creating a directive we are
going to see that in an upcoming course
also you know that this is just
directives under the hood doing this
functionality this is very useful you
will see in the next lesson how can you
use this to disable the form button
until the whole form is valid it's
