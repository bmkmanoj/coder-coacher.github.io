when talking about ng our exes we are
going to go over the original Facebook
problem that originated the flux
architecture that later gave origin to
architectures like read X or it's
derived project or its angular 2
equivalent the ng RX store library let's
understand the original Facebook problem
so what happened a couple of years ago
that gave origin to a new type of
application architecture let's try to
understand the problem that the Facebook
team faced a couple of years ago it had
to do with their unread messages counter
here is a simplified version of the
facebook chat system so the problem
occurred in their shed system they had
here a counter of unread messages in the
Facebook main page and they wanted to
keep track of how many messages the user
still had to read so there were multiple
threads in their shed and there was a
shed window where the user could type in
here new messages so as new messages
were streamed back from the back end
using server push this counter was
supposed to be kept in sync with the
messages that were being received from
the back end now the problem with this
type of application is and you will see
a similar problem in other types of
applications such as for example gmail
if you want to have a list of unread
messages per folder or any application
that is similar for example to Microsoft
Outlook anytime that we have the same
data on the screen being represented in
different ways and everything is visible
at the same time on the screen we will
fall into this problem so for example
the messages they are represented here
in this part of the screen but we could
say here that the unread messages come
this is simply another representation of
the same data which is the messages to
which the user has accessed the message
is where the user is a participant in
those particular fred's one projection
of that data is the current thread with
the current list of messages another
projection of that theta is a list of
Fred summaries where we just see the
last message of the frame and we have a
list of participants and yet another
projection of the same data so these are
simply different queries that we would
do to the same domain data the data
consists of the participants the Fred's
and the messages so those are the
multiple business notions that are at
stake here and different parts of the
screen correspond to different queries
to that same data now as the data
evolves over time as we receive new data
from the back end as we produce
ourselves new data via the right new
messages section this data needs to be
kept constantly in sync across the
multiple projections of that same
business data so we need to make sure
that whenever we write a new message or
we receive a new message from afraid
that is not currently selected that we
bump the unread messages counter
accordingly similarly whenever we click
on a Fred that hasn't read messages we
want to decrement the unread messages
counter but only by the amount of new
messages that are on that frame that we
have not yet read so the Facebook
problem can be summarized in the
following way we have an application
that shows multiple representations of
the same domain business data things
like participants fred's messages at the
same time on the same screen you have
multiple queries to the same data this
particular type of application tends to
give rise to problems similar to the
Facebook counter problem i have seen
this problem arise in an application
that was relatively similar to microsoft
outlook for example the problem was the
same counters of unread messages in
folders and multiple representations in
the same screen at the same time so what
is the problem here the problem is that
we want the application to be able to
scale in complexity we want to be able
to add new features to the application
without arriving at a state where we can
no longer maintain or understand the
application for example when we are
writing a new message we want to be able
to send the message to the back end and
at the same time if the message was
correctly saved in the back end we want
to be able to update the list of
messages the list of Fred so we want to
update here the Fred summary with the
last message of the Fred and if
necessary we want to update the unread
messages counter but we want to do that
without creating a tight coupling
between this part of the application and
all the rest of the application we don't
want that every single part of the
application to be aware of the other
sections of the application we want
these components hear the message
section and the Fred section so these
are the container components of our
application also known as smart
components we want these components to
be isolated from each other we don't
want to create tight couplings where we
are looking for example for the logic to
update the counter and all of the sudden
that logic is spread across multiple
parts of the application for example it
would have been very strange to find
logic to update the unread messages
counter here at the level of the create
new message component so it's a problem
of making sure that the application
scales in complexity that we can reason
about an application where multiple
representations of the same business
data are visible where we have multiple
actors modifying these data so this is
very important we have here a
modification
operation but also when we click on each
Fred that is also modification operation
we are decrementing the number of unread
messages for a particular user so to
summarize if you have a complex
application where you have multiple
views of the same data on the same
screen and you have multiple intervening
actors that modify that same data such
as for example the user itself that it's
modifying via a form and the server that
is giving you new versions of that data
and you want to keep a great user
experience so one way of solving all
this problem of synchronization of the
multiple views would be to just refresh
everything all the time but that's what
we want to avoid we want to keep a great
user experience so if you have such type
of application and such type of user
experience requirements you will benefit
tremendously from the architecture that
we are about to present in this course
but you might be thinking at this point
this is not a new problem there have
been other applications that have been
built in the past that are very similar
to a chat system so what is the real
benefit of flex to understand that we
are going to talk about custom global
events which is the typical solution
that we would try to apply to this
problem that would not scale in
complexity and we are going to see why
and why flex is a much better
alternative let's cover that in the next
lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
