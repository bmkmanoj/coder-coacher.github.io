from the angular University welcome back
in this course we are going to be using
the yarn package manager' we won't be
installing a lot of dependencies other
than angular but still the use of yarn
will be very useful that's because we
have to guarantee that whatever
installation I did on my machine that's
the exact same tree of dependencies that
is going to be installed in your machine
so this is great for course stability
and to make sure that you don't run into
issues due to differences between the
libraries that we have both installed
now to learn a little bit more about
yarn let's switch over to its website
Yan package comm so what is your yarn is
a fast reliable and secure dependency
management package manager so this is
built by Facebook and if we go over the
documentation we have here the key
points so this is basically a better NPM
why is it better well you might have
noticed when you use NPM sometimes so if
you have been using it for the last few
months the last year you will notice
that sometimes you do an NPM install the
NPM install fails then you do a second
NPM install and all of a sudden it works
this is because there are some race
conditions in the NPM installation that
are one of the causes for this you might
have struggled with the dependencies
that change so for example you have a
dependency that gets deployed on the NPM
repository you pick that up
via semantic versioning so in your
package dot Jason you define a range of
versions you get a version that breaks
something and all of a sudden you don't
have reproducible deterministic builds
so yarn provides a solution for all
those problems you get reproducible
builds that are faster and you get the
ability to freeze node dependencies more
importantly you get the ability to
freeze your whole dependency tree in a
deterministic way
and p.m. also have a similar mechanism
called shrink wrap but it wouldn't give
reproducible results for example if you
would shrink wrap your dependencies then
call npm install' then call shrink wrap
again you would get different results
also the yarn package manager is
designed from the beginning to support
offline mode which is important in
certain environments such as enterprise
build systems where we are not
guaranteed to have a consistent
connection to the Internet let's try air
right now to install our repository so
if you open here the folder of our main
repository you will see here a yarn dot
lock file we shouldn't edit this file
directly but we can open it and we can
see that it's simply a plain text file
so inside here we have the information
about the complete dependency tree of
our application so this file determines
in an unique way what are the exact
dependencies that we need to build our
application it's our log file it will
responds to a given snapshot of the
dependency tree in time so I'm running
it here on my computer if you download
this repository and you simply type yarn
in the same directory where you have
your yarn log file you will see that the
yarn package manager is now populating
your node modules so it's downloading
the dependencies of our project that are
defined here in our package that Jason
but we have the strong guarantee given
by the package manager that the
dependencies that you are installing on
your machine are the exact same
dependencies that were installed also on
my machine at the moment that this yarn
dot log file was initially generated so
how does yarn work let's say that you
were installing the package that reason
dependencies in a project that does not
have yarn yet set up well the behavior
of yarn would be identical to do an NPM
install yarn would expect the package
not Jason determine the tree of
dependencies
and download it so the only difference
there is that the download would be
faster and that if you do multiple
installations on your machine there is a
more efficient cache that is set up by
yarn in your local machine now the first
time that you install yarn yarn is going
to download the penances and create the
log file specifying exactly what were
the dependencies that you downloaded at
that moment in time when you first
called yarn on a project we are going to
see that in the next lesson from an
empty folder but right now we can see
here that you have already a yarn dot
lock created so when you install here
yard you got exactly the same
dependencies as I got here on my
computer so I know that if my
application works on my computer it is
also going to work in your computer the
yarn dot lock file should be checked in
into source control and it should not be
edited manually we are going to talk a
little bit more about yarn in this
course and we are going to use it
whenever it's practical specifically to
scaffold our application right now we
are already taking advantage of many of
its benefits you are getting a working
bill that will not break with the
publication of new NPM packages because
of yarn so right now you should have
here a success message saying that the
build completed successfully
so with this the installation of the
lessons code is now completed what you
have here is the full repository of the
course but we have installed it just to
make sure that everything is set up
correctly so no npm yarn the angular CLI
everything is set up and ready to go as
well as your IDE so that you take the
most out of this course right now in the
next few lessons we are going to start
from scratch from an empty folder the
first section will focus on the why of
reactive programming why do we need
reactive programming what problem does
it solve and how does that relate to the
observable pattern it's coming right up
in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
