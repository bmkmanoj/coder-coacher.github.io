material design widgets in action we are
going to show how to run their official
demo showcase application we are going
to use the angler to CLI for it and
we're going to see the angular to CLI
hot reloading mechanism in action ok so
let's get started
let's head out to the github page of the
material to design widgets project so
here we have it we can see that you have
here a getting started guide you can
follow this guy to set up an application
from scratch from the beginning but
notice here in this folder there is also
a demo application that itself uses
already the angular 2 CLI so what we are
going to do here is we are going to
clone the github repository of the
material design project for angular 2 we
are going to clone it and we are going
to CD into the directory and we are
going to npm install it this process
might take around 5 minutes and once
it's completed we now open the material
design project the whole project in our
IDE and let's take a look at the package
dot J'son of the project so we have here
that we have an NPM script for running
the demo application which is using the
angular 2 CLI so this ng command is the
angular CLI we have here two NPM scripts
that we need to run the application so
the first is the build npm script that
will simply call the angular 2 CLI to
build the whole application in
development mode to run this script you
can simply type in the command line npm
run build and you will have your whole
application built in development mode in
the build folder now that we have our
application built we are going to start
our development server from the command
line it would be npm run demo app and
this will start the server at port 4200
running our demo showcase application
this is the official showcase of the
angular 2 material widgets let's have a
look at
and so here we have the official
showcase up and running so every
angular2 material widget that is being
developed will have here some examples
of how to use it so let's open the side
menu and see what do we have already
available in the current version of
angular 2 material so you can see here
there are already a lot of widgets
available for us let's explore a bit
what is available today remember
when you see this video just go ahead
and install the demo following the
instructions probably there will be more
widgets available we have here the
buttons the material button so we have
several types of buttons we have normal
buttons we have fab buttons mini fab
buttons and here to the left we can see
the examples of the code to which this
corresponds to so this is the template
of this page that we are seeing here on
the right notice that buttons in
angular2 material are implemented as
directives and not as components these
are decorating directives that are being
applied to standard HTML button elements
now let's see the live reload
functionality in action of the angular 2
CLI so this application is being live
reloaded so if we make a change for
example here in the text next to this
button and we just save it the angular 2
CLI is going to detect this change is
going to rebuild the necessary parts of
the application and it's going to
trigger a browser reload so here we have
the new changes applied now let's
quickly see what are the widgets that
are available for angular 2 material so
let's have a look at the toggle buttons
that are available we see here that we
have exclusive selection toggle button
so only one of these buttons is active
at a given time but we also have already
available the multiple selection toggle
button one very important element of the
material design specification our card
you can very quickly create a very
good-looking UI by using cards properly
so cards are here available in angular2
material we can add them a title and a
subtitle another component that it's at
its early stages is the dialogue so here
we have a very simple demo of a dialogue
that it's open and then an action that
gets triggered in the parent component
that opened it depending on the data
that was entered in the dialogue so the
dialogue is a completely dynamic
component it's not like it's hidden on
the page it's created on-demand and the
goal is that it will be out-of-the-box
resizable and draggable with angular 2
material we will be able to build
beautiful user friendly forums so take a
look at this notice that when we edit
the input field the label gets resized
and moved up it stays associated clearly
to that input field but we can very
easily edit it as you can see there are
many widgets available but what I would
like to talk with you about is the fact
that angular 2 material is much more
than a widget library so there is a
framework component to it actually you
could see third-party libraries that are
actually built on top of angular 2
material reusing the accessibility
functionality and also reusing for
example the portal functionality so what
is the angular 2 material portal
functionality let's give a use case
imagine a very dynamic dashboard will
let's say 10 or 20 different items that
the user might want to add or remove
from a its screen at a given time let's
say that it's a dashboard that controls
what's going on in a factory depending
on the user same different graphics
might be displayed in that - world well
that could be doable with the router but
that would be actually very cumbersome
you could do that with ng-if as well but
the portal functionality allows you to
split your page into multi
all sections each one will contain a
given component that it's dynamically
assigned to the section at runtime so
the powerful functionality allows you to
build very dynamic applications that are
very configurable by the end-user if you
enjoyed this tutorial you can always
subscribe to my channel for more
upcoming angular 2 tutorials also have a
look at the website of the angular
university to see what type of angular 2
tutorials you find there that you might
like so I hope that this gives you an
overview of what is available in the
angular 2 material library what I
suggest you is simply from time to time
download the demo application run it
following the instructions in this video
and you will have a very quick look at
what is available I want to thank you
for watching and I hope to see you again
in another of my angular 2 videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
