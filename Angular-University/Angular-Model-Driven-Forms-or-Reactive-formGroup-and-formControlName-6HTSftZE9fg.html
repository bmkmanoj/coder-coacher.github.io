University and in this lesson we are
going to start learning a completely
different way of making angular 2 forms
model driven or reactive driven forms
why do we need two ways of doing forms
what's the difference when to use each
is coming right up so first let's take
the same form that we did in the
template driven forms section it's just
a clean HTML form that you're looking at
we're going to write it in the model
driven way
the main difference towards template
driven forms is that in this case we are
going to create the form and its
controls programmatically and then we
are going to bind it to form elements as
opposed to using a set of directives to
create implicitly behind the scenes the
form and its controls for us but enough
about the theory let's see this in
practice to create a model driven form
the first thing that you have to do is
to import the reactive form directives
into your template otherwise this will
not work
this is turn off by default actually
forums are turned off by default you
have to enable them with provide forms
now let's create the form actually let's
use the form group directive to assign
to this element an existing form so we
are not creating it in the template I
cannot stress this enough so in this
case my form is the form associated to
this HTML form all the reactive form
directives start with form so we can see
that they make a consistent group now in
our controller let's define a variable
my form which is of type form group that
represents the form now let's start our
program and let's see what happens here
we have not initialized the my form
variable so we get an error
this is expected again reactive form
directives bind form element
two variables that we need to initialize
ourselves programmatically so in this
case we need to initialize my form and
we are going to create a new form group
instance we're going to pass it in for
the moment an empty configuration object
let's try this out again now the error
is fixed we have created our first
reactive form now let's add some
controls to the form before we were
doing that using ng model in this case
we are going to use the form control
name directive and we are going to
assign to each form control a name like
the directive says now let's run this
what will happen try to guess of course
we get an error because again this
directive is only binding to an existing
control that we need to create ourselves
so let's do that let's create free-form
controls one for each input field the
title the duration and the description
if you enjoyed this tutorial you can
always subscribe to my channel for more
upcoming angular 2 tutorials also have a
look at the website of the angular
university to see what type of angular 2
tutorials you find there that you might
like we are going to create the form
controls inside the configuration object
that was passed on to the form itself so
each property of this object each
property name is the name of the control
and the value is the control itself that
we are going to create with new form
control and we're going to pass to each
control its initial value let's try this
out
so as you can see the form controls have
been initialized with the initial value
and we have no errors on the console so
congratulations you have created your
first reactive form why is it called
reactive what's the point what's the
difference we're going to start to
understand that already in the next
lesson where we are going to go over
validation in reactive forms so stay
tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
