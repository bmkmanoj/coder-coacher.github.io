lesson we are going to be exploring the
material datepicker component let's
start by talking about the multiple
output formats of the datepicker it's
possible to have the material datepicker
to output plain JavaScript dates but
this is actually not recommended instead
it will be better if we use the material
moment date module that is going to be
using moment yes that's a JavaScript
library that is the de facto standard
for handling dates in JavaScript it's
much easier to use then the date itself
this library is a much more practical
way of handling moments in time and
dates in JavaScript so we are going to
have the material date picker to emit
moment yes instances let's then start
adding the material date picker to our
form we're going to start by adding here
a new form field the date picker that we
are about to build is a combination of
free elements one is a plain HTML input
that we are going to announce with a
material you can fill using the matte
input library and the second element is
going to be a toggle button with a small
calendar and we're going to be adding
this icon right after the input field so
this can be done using the material date
picker toggle that is going to display a
small button and the last component is
the date picker panel itself from which
the user is going to be choosing the
date for that we are going to be using
the material date picker component let's
see how we are going to connect all
these free elements together the first
fingers we are going to do is we are
going to give a name to this date picker
panel we are going to call it my date
picker and the hash here means that this
is a template reference this means that
we can use this name elsewhere in the
template we are then going to use this
template reference to link the date
picker to the input box
this means a couple of things this means
that the value displayed here on the
input is going to come
from the date picker and also it means
that any value that we type on the input
box is going to be reflected whenever we
open the date picker panel in order to
link this material input with the date
picker we are going to be using the Matt
date picker directive and here to the
input property of this directive we are
going to pass a reference here to the
date picker a similar thing will happen
here in the toggle button this is the
little calendar button that is going to
open the date picker here we have a
property named for and we need also to
link it here to this reference to the
date picker panel we also want to
configure here our toggle button so that
it's displayed after the input so for
that we are going to be setting this
property here Matt suffix and we don't
need to pass in any value with this in
place we are almost ready to see the
date picker in action
before doing so let's quickly link this
input field to a form field so we are
going to be using the form control name
and we're going to be linking these
input to the released at field which we
have not added yet let's add it here to
our form so the name of the field is
going to be released at and to show that
indeed the date picker is integrated
with moment.js we are going to be
passing to the date picker and instance
of moment which corresponds to the
current instant we are also going to be
making this a required field and with
this in place we are almost ready to try
our date picker let's just fix here a
small typo this is minuscule P instead
of capital P let's then try a date
picker to see how it looks like we have
refresh the application let's hit edit
as we can see now we have here a new
farm field this is displaying the
current date and now if we click here on
this icon we are going to see here the
date picker this is already set for
today's date and we have here all the
usual functionality of a date picker so
this is ready to be used in our angular
applications
let's select here a new day
it so as you can see this gets reflected
back to the input field because the two
are linked together via the mathlete
picker directive and it is in place we
have a fully functional date picker that
is emitting moment.js instances</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
