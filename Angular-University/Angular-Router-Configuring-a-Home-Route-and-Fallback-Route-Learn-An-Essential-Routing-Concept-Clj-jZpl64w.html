from the angular university and in this
lesson we are going to learn how to set
up an index route and a fallback route
for our application and why that is
important it's coming right up so let's
start with the index route whenever you
go to the root of your application you
probably want to display something to
the user but with our current
configuration that is not the case
because the route route or the index
route does not get associated or it's
not matched with any of the routes that
we have currently configured so let's
add some configuration to it let's add
it an index route and we're going to
give it an empty path we are also going
to give it the home component in an
upcoming lesson we're going to see how
we could have done this in another way
let's try this out so if we access the
root URL of our application we get
displayed the home component which is
the expected behavior now what happens
if we type some other URL that is not
mapped to any route what is the current
behavior what happens is that we get an
error in the console saying that we
could not find a match for this URL in
the right configuration if you want a
better user experience we can redirect
the user to for example the home
component for that we need to configure
a fallback route so let's do that the
path of the fallback route is the double
star wellcare and this is going to match
all URLs we are going to give it for the
moment the all lessons component let's
try this out if we now type an unknown
URL we should be redirected to the all
lessons component and that is the case
let's now just make the fallback
component the home component instead of
all essence now what do you might not
have noticed before is that in the
routing configuration the order matters
the order is very important so let's say
that for example we take the fall back
route and we put it as the first item
in our configuration let's try this out
if we now click around the same links
that we're working before we can see
that everything is being redirected to
the home component that's because the
routes are searched for the match in the
order in which they are defined and so
the first match is always the fallback
route if you enjoyed this tutorial you
can always subscribe to my channel for
more upcoming angular 2 tutorials also
have a look at the website of the
angular university to see what type of
angular 2 tutorials you find there that
you might like so make sure that you
always put the fall back route as the
last entry in your configuration and so
our relative configuration is now at a
good starting point you might have
noticed that when we click around the
top menu that the current menu gets
highlighted in red how did we do that
that we're going to find out in the next
lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
