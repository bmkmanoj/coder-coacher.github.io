lesson we built together the request
that is going to fetch the offline page
from the server now that we have the
offline page we need to store it
somewhere we are going to store it in a
new type of browser cache we are going
to be using the browser cache API this
is a caching mechanism that is
accessible via JavaScript and this is
unlike the traditional caching mechanism
this means that this type of cash can be
programmatically invalidated and it can
be managed by a JavaScript which is not
possible with the standard browser
caching behavior that is based only upon
HTTP headers and then the browser takes
care of all the caching for us let's
then see this new caching mechanism in
action the first thing that we are going
to do is we are going to start by
opening the cache then we are going to
store the offline page the response to
the request that we made here we are
going to store it in this new type of
cache this way in another part of our
serviceworker
we will be able to serve the offline
page in response to a failed HTTP
request let's then cache the offline
page the first thing that we need to do
is to open the cache the caching API is
also promised based like all the PWA
related ApS so we are going to do caches
dot open but the result of this call is
going to be a promise if the promise is
successfully resolved then we will have
here a cache that we can use to store
and delete items but we will need to
call a wait here so that the promise
gets resolved now we need to pass in
here the name of a particular cache
let's for the moment call it AB - cache
now that we have the cache opened let's
store something in it in order to do
that we will use the method cache put
the first argument that we need to pass
in is a request so the key of the
request it's going to be among other
things the full URL and the second
argument that we need to pass to the put
method is going to be the value that we
want to cache
in this case we want to cache the
response to this HTTP request which
contains the offline page we could store
many other things in the cache including
the JavaScript and the CSS files on the
application itself so that the next time
we don't have to fetch it from the
network and that's exactly what we will
be doing in an upcoming section of this
course right now let's start by caching
the offline page and see how this works
in practice we're going to increment
here the version of the serviceworker
that we are running and we're going to
load it because we want to see how can
we inspect the content of the cache
using the dev tools let's then switch
over to the browser we are going to
reload our application and we're going
to see what we have here installed if we
click on the serviceworker we are going
to see that indeed we have here version
6 and we have no errors on the console
so this means that we managed to
populate the cache correctly let's
confirm that we are going to go here to
the cache section of the dev tools we're
going to hit here this drop down and
we're going to see here the new cache
that we just created app - cache as we
can see the content that we have just
cached it's here we can see that we have
here one cache entry for offline dot
HTML this is the path this is the
complete URL for this content type and
we can see here a couple of properties
for example we can see at which time it
was cached we can also see the content
that is cached you can see here that we
have here our offline page also the
headers that get returned to the browser
are also cached this new type of cache
the application cache this is where we
are going to be storing the multiple
versions of our application we are going
to store here everything from the index
dot HTML to the multiple CSS bundles
that the page needs to the JavaScript
bundle that gets returned by the angular
CLI everything is going to be cached
here so the application cache is really
a key component of a progressive web
application this is where the multiple
versions of the application will reside
on the client side notice that this is
very different from the application
cache this is an ancient standard
that we will not be using in this course
right now let's continue the
implementation of our offline page
functionality we are going to intercept
network requests and if one of those
fail we are going to serve the offline
page we can do that because we already
have it here let's have a look at how
can we do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
