angular 2 applications the first thing
that you want to do is to ensure that
you are running in development mode this
will enable some of the techniques that
we are going to show via the console and
also by the browser extension algorri a
simple way to travel shoot certain
situations is to use the J'son pipe this
is a pipe made for development purposes
that allow us to output the value of a
javascript object to the screen as a
string let's see it in action by
outputting the value of the model object
we can only debug so far using this
method in order to really divide the
typescript application we should
configure the typescript compiler to
generate source Maps we can do so via
the source map property in the
configuration file ts config dot JSON
now if we go back to our program and we
add a breakpoint using the debugger
statement we will see that when the
breakpoint hits in the browser we can
actually view the typescript code and
not the generated JavaScript code take a
look at the name of the panel its hello
world dot TS and we can see here the
full typescript hello world class
another thing that we can do is to
inspect the current state of the
application using the console via the ng
probe functionality let's have a look at
how that works here we have clicked with
the mouse in the input field and
therefore we have assigned it the dollar
0 variable as we seen in previous
lessons now let's use dollar 0 to
extract angular specific information to
the console we can see that there is a
component instance variable here let's
take a look to see what it contains as
we can see it has the state of the hello
world component so with ng probe we can
print to the console the state of any
component in the component tree
now let's try to modify the value of
message see what happens the change is
applied to the variable but take a look
the screen has not reflected the change
for that let's manually trigger change
detection via the console as we can see
the change that we made to the message
variable has now been applied debugging
via the console is very useful
especially in situations where we are
not administrators in our machine so we
might not have chrome available or be
able to install Chrome extensions but if
we can we have the augury Chrome
extension that allow us to inspect an
angular 2 application we can access it
here in the console via the augury menu
we can see that augury presents us the
same information that we have via the
console but in a much more user-friendly
way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
