are going to cover firebase data
modeling essentials stay tuned it's
coming right up
so let's talk about firebase data
modeling and the push keys so why did we
model the data like this so we have it
here a node of courses and we added a
node of lessons and we added here a
third node lessons per course so why
would we want to do this well to
understand this let's go back to our
program here in the constructor of our
application component we are creating a
reference to the root of the database so
this root node corresponds to let's
collapse all the actually there is a
button here collapse all date the root
corresponds to this the final project
recording node so when we subscribe to
the value of this node notice that this
is an open subscription this function
this callback will be called each time
that we receive a new value and we will
receive a new snapshot so if we just run
this program what we are going to
receive here as value take a look this
is the whole database so whenever we
select a node in firebase we get
everything literally everything under
that node we cannot let's say that for
example we had put the lessons inside
courses there was here property named
lessons if we would query a course we
would also get all of its lessons but
maybe we just want to show a list of
courses so this is why in firebase it's
important so it's the same thing as in a
relational database you want to
denormalize your data you want in
firebase to keep your data as flat as
possible so do not use multiple levels
of nesting instead of that insert your
entities in lists and if you want to
link them together
one way of doing it is to create an
association know where you associate the
increase together
so to summarize in five ways you should
try to always keep your data as flat as
possible preferably put your entities in
a top-level node which has the name of
the entity like for example courses or
lessons if you want to associate the
data together make sure to use an
association node where you link the data
using its key so we are going to learn
more about what are these push keys
exactly remember the structure of the
database is arbitrary so nothing
prevents you in firebase from using data
nesting you could put the lessons nested
inside the courses assuming that a
lesson only belongs to a course but
let's say that for example in the future
that is not true anymore you could have
a lesson that belongs to two courses
that would be quite troublesome to fix
to refracture also let's say that you
assume initially that there aren't many
lessons per course
so you wouldn't fall into performance
problems also that could very easily
change in the future you could have
courses with a lot of lessons again
refactoring that would be very
troublesome I would advise you to
normalize your data as much as possible
from the beginning and systematically
this is probably the safest and most
future-proof approach for structuring
your data in firebase now that we know a
bit about data modelling it's time to
answer the question what are these
strange-looking
push Keys we will not wait any further
we are going to go through it in the
next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
