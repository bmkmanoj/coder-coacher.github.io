here a plain HTML page with standard
tags like main aur div or Heather we're
going to create our own custom HTML tag
the hello - world tag and that will be
our component to create a component we
need to define a typescript class this
is just a plain class but it's annotated
with a decorator at component this is
the angular 2 specific decorator that
informs the framework that this class is
actually a component the first thing
that we do is to define to which HTML
tag does this component belong to we do
that via the selector attribute in this
case this means - angular that anytime
that it finds the custom tag hello world
in an HTML page it will apply this
component next what we define is the
template of the component in this case
it's just a plain input box that says
hello world anytime that angular finds
in an HTML page the hello - world tag it
will apply this input box and that's it
as simple as that that's our first
component but it could be any component
angular doesn't know that this is the
entry point of our application we need
to inform angular of that via the
bootstrap function with it we will be
able to run our application if we try
this out we can see that our application
is working if we now inspect the HTML we
can see that inside the hello world
custom tag we have the contents of our
template as we would expect let's now
try to output some data to our page
we're going to define a model object
containing a message hello world and to
output it to our page we use the double
curly brace interpolation CIN text which
we can pass an expression if we now try
this out we can see that hello world is
being out
put it successfully let's now see the
angular event syntax in action if we
define here an event handler using
normal braces and inside the name of the
event in this case we are going to
detect the cube event and when a kiap
event occurs we are going to trigger the
update model method let's now update the
message while the cube event is pressed
for that we need to pass the value of
the input box to a plate model for that
let's create a local variable that
points to the input box using hash input
now using it with input not value we can
pass in the value to update model inside
update model we are going to assign the
value of the input box to the message
variable if we now type in the input box
we can see that the message is kept in
sync with it on each key event and this
is what we're seeing is one of the most
useful features of angular to our data
model and our view are kept in sync
automatically at all times by angular we
don't have to take care of this
synchronization ourselves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
