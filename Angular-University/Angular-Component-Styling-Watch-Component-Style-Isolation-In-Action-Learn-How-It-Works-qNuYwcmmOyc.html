lesson we're going to start learning
about component styling angular
introduces a new way of styling
components and pages it uses style
isolation we have that feature working
out of the box but as you know CSS is
usually not isolated in the page the
only way to make sure that a style is
only applied to a certain element is to
use a more specific selector so then how
this angular style isolation work we are
going to find out in this lesson let's
start styling our component and we are
going to take the opportunity to learn
how the style isolation mechanism works
under the hood so now let's start
styling our font awesome inputbox
so for the moment we have here a value
and input that is hard-coded we are
going to implement this part in a later
lesson right now let's focus here on the
icon here the envelope the lock etc and
we are going to see how do we style an
angular component so associated to the
component we have here a style sheet
that is on the same folder as the
component file itself and it has been
generated by the angular CLI inside it
we can put styles that are specific to
this component so let's say that we have
here a class that we are going to add
always to this icon so we are going to
add here the attribute class and we are
going to add it here the icon class this
is a new class that we are going to
build and also because we are always
adding the F a class actually we can
remove this from here and another way of
doing it is to simply add it here
directly at the level of the class of
this icon element so if we hit ctrl s as
we can see everything is still working
as expected now another thing that we
can do here is add specific styles here
to the icon class so let's do that in
this file we are going to start styling
via Aitkin let's see
we added here a width of 20 pixels and
more than that let's add a couple more
styles that have to do with text
alignment and padding but most
importantly we want to add here a white
background to the icon so this is a
default style because the default style
of input background is white so that's
why we are using this class here so if
we hit ctrl s we should see that it's
hardly noticeable here on the image
because of the borders but the
background is now white I'm going to
quickly zoom in here so you can see this
is white this is because of the border
but now we do have some Styles
associated to this icon let's have a
look at them we are going to inspect
this style to see how this is working so
we are going to enlarge here the console
and we are going to have a look here at
what styles are applied so you can see
that these styles that were applied here
the icon styles they have here these
strange prefix I'm going to enlarge a
little bit here the window so we can see
that they actually have this strange
attribute and the score ng-content - c1
we can see here that angular whenever it
rendered the Dom of this font awesome
component it added here a custom
attribute and it used the same custom
attribute to append it here to the style
that we defined the reason why this was
done is to make the style more specific
so if the dot icon class would simply
have been applied that cell could have
been easily over aidable by external
styles because we have added here an
attribute to the definition of this
style we have made the style much more
specific so much less likely to be
overridden by external cells this is not
full component isolation using the
shadow Dom but it's a very good level of
style isolation that in practice tends
to work exactly as expected so these
Styles here are very unlikely to
be overridden by external styles if we
put this component in a page that for
example uses bootstrap or any other CSS
framework now you might be thinking at
this point how did these Styles end up
in the page because if we go here to the
index dot HTML we can see that we only
have here the font awesome Styles we
have here the vowels that help to style
the menu etc but this CSS file how did
it end up being included in the page
well the angular CLI has included this
here as a style tag so if we go here to
the top of the page we are going to see
that a few Styles were added here to the
page and this was added by angular at
Build time so if we open this up we will
see that everything that we have defined
at the level of the component has been
added here by angular with this
attribute selector that has been
automatically generated and appended for
us to make the style more specific so
let's keep this in mind where to find
these Styles auto-generated by angular
if we leave them for troubleshooting
because these will come in handy for us
later in the course and so in a nutshell
this explains how the angular style
isolation mechanism works it works by
increasing the specificity of our
component style shift adding them an
attribute to those styles that will make
sure that the style is only applicable
to that particular component or inside
the particular component now the styles
are not 100% isolated we are going to
learn more about style isolation further
in the course right now let's continue
implementing our font awesome component
we are going to learn a couple of new
features of angular including content
projection this is coming right up in
the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
