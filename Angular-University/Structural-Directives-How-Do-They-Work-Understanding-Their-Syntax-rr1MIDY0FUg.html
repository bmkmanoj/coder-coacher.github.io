lesson we are going to present the
notion of structural directive we are
going to understand what is that type of
directive how does it work and we are
going to understand its syntax so the
very common star ng-if and star ng4
syntax we are going to implement a
structural directive as part of our
model let's start implementing now the
functionality for opening and closing
the Mogul in response to different
events this could be the clicking of a
button or a menu item or this could be
hitting the Escape key if the model is
open or clicking elsewhere on the page
outside the model we will be providing
an auxiliary structural directive to
support those very common use cases but
notice that if we have a more advanced
use case that is not covered by those
auxiliary directives we could simply use
here ng if and open and close the model
depending on some complex condition like
for example certain elements of the page
are enabled disabled so for more
advanced use cases we don't need the
directive that we are about to build to
open and close the model we could
already use the component independently
of that simply by using ng is but it
would be really convenient to be able to
add here a structural directive that we
are about to create that would work like
this so we would start by adding here
the star meaning that is a structural
directive and we would call it simply au
model open unclick so this could be
added to any element of the page Det
while clicking it trigger the opening of
this model so this could be linked here
to this button for example so we would
pass in as input here of this new
directive a reference to a button or if
there are multiple elements of the page
that if click would trigger the opening
of the model we would be able to pass in
to this directive an array so an array
of buttons an array of menu items that
if they are enabled allows the model to
be opened so this is the over
idea of what we are about to build this
is the public API of these new
structural directives which is a type of
directive that we have never built
before so let's see how this type of
directives work we are going to start by
quickly creating the initial version of
the directive in order to do so let's go
here to the command line and let's do
ngg directive so we are about to
generate a directive we are going to put
it in the au - model folder and we are
going to call it au mobile open on click
if we open here the directive we can see
that the correct selector was used so
this directive will be applied to any
element of the page that has an
attribute with this same name now that
we have generated our directive it's
important to make sure that it's
configured at the level of the module of
our component so not only here at the
level of the declarations but also here
at the level of the exports otherwise
this would not work now it is in place
let's take a moment to go over how this
type of structural directives work so
another example of this type of
directive is for example ng is that we
are very familiar - or ng for and in
general any of the directives that
starts with a star so we are going to go
over what these star syntax exactly
means let's take here an expression
let's start with ng if so that we are
sure that we have here a compiling
program and let's just say that we are
using here ng if set to true so as
expected this will ensure that the
dialogue is still displaying now let's
take a moment to notice that this syntax
is very different than for example this
syntax right here for passing in a
property to a component and it's the
same syntax for passing in a property to
a directive so what happens here is that
angular is D sugaring this ng if star
syntax to something else what happens is
that angular process this syntax here in
multiple steps so first whenever finding
this
syntax angular is going to implicitly
create the ng template and inside that
ng template angular is going to put
inside it the element to which the
directive ng if in this case was being
applied and then on top of the template
itself angular is going to apply the
directive in this equivalent syntax here
and it's going to pass in the same
expression that we have here so in this
case crew it could be any expression so
this is what happens this syntax here at
the level of the angular model star ng
if gets implicitly converted to this
other version right here so in order to
confirm that that is indeed the case
let's quickly start here our development
server and with the server up and
running let's hide this version that was
using star ng if and leave only this new
version we are going to refresh here the
application once it's compiled
successfully and let's have a look so as
we can see this is still working if we
now switch ng if to false and hit ctrl s
we will see that the model is hidden so
this shows that the two syntaxes
are equivalent but it also raises a
question of how it is working because as
we know the ng template tag will not be
rendered to the screen so if we remove
here the ng if and we hit ctrl s we're
going to see that the model is not
rendered to the screen so this is the
normal behavior of the ng template tag
so this means that this type of
directive a structural directive like ng
is needs to take a reference to the
template and then using that template it
needs to instantiate it it needs to
apply the template in this section of
the page according to some input
property that gets passed to it so in
the case of ng if it will take the
template and it will render the template
to the screen depending on the
truthiness
of this expression that gets passed here
so as we can see this is the only way
that this type of directives could work
they really need to
take the template and instantiate it and
they need a place on the page to apply
the template so it has to be this node
here
so in summary let's build a directive
just like ng is that's what we're going
to do in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
