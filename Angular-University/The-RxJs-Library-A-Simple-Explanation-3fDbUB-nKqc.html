from the angular diversity at this point
in the course we are going to introduce
the rxjs library so let's have a quick
look at our program what we have so far
we have been using these notions of
observer observable so this is the core
concepts and other concepts are needed
to be able to use it effectively such as
the observer or the subject we have been
using this set of concepts that
represent an evolution from this pattern
here so they solve some of the issues
that this pattern in the hell we have
been using these concepts to build our
applications to build a synchronous
programs what we're going to do now is
instead of using these custom types that
we have used here we are going to be
using the rxjs library so I really
encourage you to see the newest rxjs
documentation because it is much
improved if you have a look here
at the public API of the library you
will see that everything is about
subjects it's about the observable it's
about the observer so everything about
the library revolves around these three
concepts so in a nutshell what is rxjs
we can say that rxjs is a toolkit that
allows us to build programs a
synchronous programs around the
observable pattern that we have been
discussing on the previous section if
you now have a look at the multiple
operators you will see that everything
about the library is about creating
observables creating subjects and
combining the two connecting the two
together in the multiple different ways
that we need to build our application so
it all revolves around the observable
pattern so what we're going to do now is
we are going back to our program we are
going to take the version of the program
that we had here we are going to delete
all these custom types that we made and
we are going to replace it with rxjs we
are going to see that rxjs
is simply a toolkit to build programs
around the observable pattern so let's
get started
the
first thing to do is we go to the
terminal and we are going to check out a
new branch for our application we are
going to check out the branch that it's
called introduce rxjs
so again we are going to create here a
local branch and we are going to check
out the remote branch that has the same
name and their origin so with this if
you now do git branch you should see
that you are currently on the introduce
rxjs local branch please ignore the
other branches that you have here these
are just some of the local branches that
I have here on my computer so by
starting in this branch we are going to
run NPM start in the root directory of
the course repository and we are going
to start our application so at this
point we can already start using Eric's
yes we don't need to install it
separately because the angular CLI
already added rxjs to your package Jason
so what we're going to do here is we are
going to delete these concepts the
observer the subject and the subject
implementation as well and we are going
to replace this with some new imports
that we are going to take from rxjs
and now let's start refactoring our
program to use rxjs instead of our
custom types so let's start by
refactoring the data store let's see we
no longer have here a subject
implementation well the subject class
that is imported from rxjs is the
default subject implementation that we
have so we can use it here if you look
inside it's cold it's in every way
similar to what we have implemented
ourselves by hand now if we over over
here the first use of observable we can
see here that the observable that we
import from rxjs is a generic type this
means that whenever we declare an
observable in our program we need to say
what data is that observable emitting so
in this case we know that our observable
will be emitting a list of lessons so we
are going to add here the lesson array
type as
generic parameter of the observable type
now let's continue our refactoring take
a look at the lessons list observable so
remember the dollar means that this is
an observable so what we have here is a
custom implementation of an observable
that is inherently tied or connected to
this subject here so this observable is
essentially directly connected to this
subject what we can do is instead of
defining these ourselves by hand we are
going to delete this and we are going to
use the rxjs library we are going to go
to the lessons list subject type and we
are going to derive from it and
observable directly so the lessons list
observable will emit the values that are
broadcasted via this subject but the
subject is kept private so this is super
important for the observable pattern
there will always be a subject no matter
what observable we are using even if
it's the angular HTTP library even if
it's some other library that we are
using there is always a subject involved
whenever there is an observable so
something in the program is emitting the
new values of data it suggests that we
want to keep that ability of emitting
data private at all times to the owner
of the data so right now we are creating
here a subject and we are deriving an
observable from it so the rest of the
application subscribes to this
observable but does not have access to
the subject which was exactly what we
were looking for so with this change we
have here a compiling data store class
and with this we have introduced rxjs in
our program as we can see it's simply a
toolkit for building a synchronous
applications around the observable
pattern and its associated concepts such
as subjects observers etc so now that we
have refactored the store let's continue
our refactoring our application for
using rxjs instead of our custom
observable implementation this is coming
right up in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
