angular University welcome let's get
started learning reactive programming
first I have a quick question for you
what is the number one difficulty that
you have while building applications
with angular please let me know in the
comments below actually I asked this
same question
many times in my mailing list and the
number one reply that I get is rxjs
and observables so the number one
difficulty is really not the framework
itself it's more what are the advantages
of building applications in reactive
style how do we do that what are the
main concepts around rxjs how do we use
it correctly the good news is that
reactive programming is really not that
hard it's really not that different from
many of the things that you have always
been using for building front ends so
where does this difficulty come from
because reactive programming at its core
it's actually something very simple so
why is it so difficult to learn I
believe that the main reason for that is
that we jumped straight into the rxjs
library but we don't introduce the
observable pattern first and what is the
problem with that well what is rxjs rxjs
is a toolkit that allows us to build a
synchronous applications in reactive
style using the observable pattern so if
we don't understand the observable
pattern and its benefits we will not be
able to make sense of rxjs on the other
hand if we understand the observable
pattern well the library will make
immediate sense including many if not
all of its multiple operators it will
all make so much more sense if we learn
first the observable pattern that is the
basis of reactive programming so what
we're going to do in the next couple of
hours
is we are going to deep dive into the
observable pattern we are going to
understand exactly why it's useful what
are the benefits of building
applications
in reactive style and what better way of
learning that than by first building a
small application that is not built in
reactive style has a set of problems and
then introduced reactive programming and
see what are the benefits of doing
applications that way we will introduce
the observable pattern and its related
concepts the observer and the subject
and also other concepts that are related
to rxjs but the essential of rxjs is the
observable pattern and that's what we
are going to be learning in the next
couple of lessons step-by-step so what
you are about to see corresponds to the
initial part of the reactive patterns
angular architecture course the first
section is only about the observable
pattern then after this first section
the course also includes a catalog of
patterns for building applications in
reactive style both view layer patterns
and service layer patterns and after
that we are also going to do dive on the
rxjs library in further detail covering
some of the operators that we did not
get a chance to cover on the first two
sections so without further ado let's
get started learning reactive
programming by deep diving in its most
fundamental concept at least in the case
of the rxjs library which is the
observable pattern it's coming right up
in the next few lessons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
