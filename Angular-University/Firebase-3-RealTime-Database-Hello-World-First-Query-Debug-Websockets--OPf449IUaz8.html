from the angular University in his
lesson we are going to set up Firewise
from scratch we are going to set up the
firebase SDK and we are going to do our
first fire base query we are going to
know how the SDK and firebase works
under the hood we are going to see how
web sockets are used by fire ways and
how to debug them it's coming right up
in order to have firebase up and running
the first thing that you need to do is
to go to firebase google com and you can
sign in using your google account so in
this case I will sign in with the
account that I used for TS less and so
here we go and then you need to go to
console here on the top right this will
open your firebase console so now i
already have here a project but i'm
going to create a new one from scratch
let's call it final project recording
and we just click create project and
this will set up a new fire ways for us
once this is done you click on the
project and you are going to open here
the welcome screen you can see here the
tutorials for fighter base if you want
but in this case we are going to go
straight to our database which is empty
now take a look at this URL so
everything in firebase has an URL we are
going to get into data modeling in
firebase but remember this URL this will
help you uniquely identify your database
now before we do anything else take a
look at this informational message here
so default security rules require users
to be authenticated actually to start we
just simply want to give read and write
privileges to everyone we will set up
the security rules later but right now
we simply need to give grieve and write
permissions to everyone so that we can
quickly set up some data again we're
going to revisit this in the future
please don't use such a setup in
production it means that anyone could
destroy your data this is just a
temporary setup to quickly get started
with our development so if we go back
here to the overview screen let's now
grab the configuration to add fire ways
to our web application after a while the
config is ready and what you can see
here all of this is public information
there are no secret keys here there are
no private keys that you cannot publish
in this configuration so if we just copy
it let's take this configuration and
we're going to simply add it to our
index dot HTML and we are quickly going
to demo fireplace in action let's start
by writing some data in the database so
let's select the project and we're going
to click here on the database tab and
this gives us the data of our database
we are simply going to say here as a
value as a route value hello world fire
ways now let's read this value from our
database so for that we need to start by
creating a reference to the route load
file final project recording that we
have here for that we are going to use
the firebase SDK we're going to use the
real-time database and we are going to
create a reference to the root node from
here we use the firebase SDK to
subscribe to this node so we will see
this in a moment how does it work but
we're going to subscribe to value and
we're going to pass in a call back the
callback will be called once the value
is available in the browser so we are
going to be passed in the callback a
snapshot we are just going to pass it
snap and we're going to see what the
snapshot is in a moment so for the
moment let's log to the console the
value of the snapshot to see what we
have so we have the angular CLI here
running we just hit ctrl s to save and
the bundle is
now available and here we have just
reloaded the application so let's try
this again we just refresh the
application we can see here that hello
world firebase shows up on the console
and so we have done our first fire base
query let's now understand better what
is going on here so let's switch to
another view we have here the same hello
world application and we just received
here hello world firebase now why is it
called a real-time database let's just
edit here this message we hit enter and
take a look at the console here so we
hit enter here immediately in the
application the new value is reflected
this means that an application that is
connected to a real-time database can
receive in real time as the name says
new values for the data and in a very
performant way this allows us to build a
whole new class of applications let's
see how this is working if we switch
here to the network tab and we turn on
the filter to only filter web sockets
let's just refresh the application so
what is happening here is that the
firebase SDK client is connected to this
fire base via a web socket let's take a
look if we choose the WebSocket
initiated by the firebase SDK which is
marked here we just switch to it and we
see here the data that came over the
console let's just try to change here
another value so hello firebase again
and we are going to see that these camps
via the web socket into the application
the on call back gets triggered and we
receive the value of the data in the
database under the form of a snapshot
the data is under the snapshot dot Val
function call but the snapshot contains
more than just value let's now try a
more complex example let's create an
object as the
root entry of the database so let's just
call it messages and let's have child's
to this messages object let's call it
here message one and message one we are
going to add a property of text and the
value of hello world so let's try this
out we can see here that we have here
created a messages entry under it we
have an entry with a key of one which is
an object which has a property of text
which has a value of hello world so
let's take a look at what we get from
the callback let's modify this message
and see what we receive here in the
console so immediately we receive the
new value let's just open it up and
under the key of one we have the text
with the latest message as you can see
the real-time database is very powerful
if we write to the database we can see
that our clients are being a plated
transparently and in a very efficient
way via a web socket if a web socket is
not possible the firebase SDK will
transparently fall back to an AJAX long
polling request and so you have seen the
firebase real-time database in action
and as you can see it's really super
powerful we have introduced a couple of
concepts of the firebase SDK a reference
and a snapshot let's dig deeper into
these two fundamental concepts in the
next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
