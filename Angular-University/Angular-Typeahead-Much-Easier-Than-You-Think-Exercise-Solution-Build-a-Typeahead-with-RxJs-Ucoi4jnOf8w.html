from the angular University in this
lesson we are going to present the
solution for the exercise of the section
HTTP and services now let's start at the
beginning we are going to first detect
the kiap events on the search box and we
are going to print the current search to
the screen just as a starting point so
we do that with observable from event we
pass until the Dom element input that we
have available of the input box and we
specify that we want to detect the key
event let's simply print this to the
screen using a do statement now we need
to subscribe to this observable again
otherwise nothing happens let's see this
in action so when we type on the input
box we can see that the current search
is being outputted to the screen now how
are we going to implement the type of
head functionality what we want to do is
in each key app event we want to pass
the content of the current search into
an HTTP GET call in the back end so that
the search is returned to us we want
then to assign the result of the search
to the lessons list on the screen how
are we going to do this can you guess
which rxjs operator we need to use it's
one that we have seen before
let's use for example the switch map
operator so each time that the input
stream of key events emits a value
containing the current key we are going
to switch this to another observable
that observable will be the result of
doing a network call to the back end
passing in the value of the current
search we are going to retrieve the
value of the current search using input
dot value and the output of this is of
course also an observable that we can
assign to a search variable but you need
to do is we need to subscribe to this
observable
again without this nothing will happen
to complete this let's assign the value
of these combined observable whenever a
new value arrives from the server
meaning whenever a search result arrives
from the server we are going to assign
it to the lessons variable meaning that
the result of the search will be
displayed on the screen and that's it we
have implemented that type of head using
rxjs
and we have implemented a search service
in angular 2 let's see this now in
action if we now type on the type head
we can see that the results are being
constantly filtered now another
interesting thing instead of using load
lessons let's use lower delayed lessons
if we now type really quickly in the
input box we can see that the results of
the first searches that we made so the
result of the search containing only the
Schachter age for example is canceled
successive searches are canceled because
they have been invalidated by a more
recent search so again this is a good
example of something very powerful that
we can implement easily using rxjs and
observables the reason why this works
like this is that the switch strategy
for combining multiple observables will
only subscribe to one observable at a
time
so you click on age the stream for key
events emits a value and that gets
transformed by a switch map to an
observable now that observable is
immediately subscribed to
now you type e so you have the string
age e from the word hello now you have a
second value in the key stream of key
events that triggers the creation of a
second observable that will send a
search to the back end of H e from the
world hello that also triggers the
unsubscription
from the previous value observable
that's because switch only subscribes to
one observable at a time
and the unsubscription from the previous
observable triggers as we have seen in a
previous lesson the cancellation of the
HTTP request and this concludes our
small course on HTTP and observables you
should now be able to create service
layers for your application using
observables as return types combined
observables with some commonly used rxjs
operators to do commonly needed
functionality in your application
I hope you enjoyed this make sure to
check other sections such as routing
forms and many other topics on angular 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
