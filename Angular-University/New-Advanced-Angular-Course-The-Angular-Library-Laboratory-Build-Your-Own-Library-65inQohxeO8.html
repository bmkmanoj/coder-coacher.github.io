from the angular University welcome to
the advanced angular library laboratory
course in this course we are going to
cover the advanced features of angular
but we're going to do that in a very fun
and practical way what we will be doing
is we are going to use those features on
may be their most typical use case is to
build a series of small open source
components for angular essentially we
are going to be building a series of
small components that can be potentially
reused in just about any angular project
this is going to be something very
concrete that you could actually use in
your own applications the components
will be built from the simplest
component to the most complex so we will
be progressively increasing the
difficulty of the components along the
course we are going to introduce testing
from the very first component or
directive that we built and we will be
testing the components as the course
progresses closer to the end of the
course we are going to introduce
animations in the final component that
we will be building so all the modules
that we will be building will be
compatible with angular ahead of time
compilation they will be available on
NPM and I hope that this will encourage
you to publish your own module it's
going to be a ton of fun because this is
a course about a library building we are
going to be talking about the NPM
ecosystem and how node module
dependencies work we are going to do
that not straight away in the beginning
of the course we will be get going
straight away with the first component
but just to let you know that that is
also included in the course we will be
using the yarn package manager all the
way well except to install yarn itself
we're going to be using NPM but that
will ensure it was stable development
environment where we are sure that the
dependencies that you have downloaded
are exactly the same ones that I had
running on my computer now let me tell
you about the components that we are
going to be building together in this
we're going to start small with a simple
component that will already present a
lot of the advanced features of angular
this component is going to be a font
awesome input box it's going to be
mobile friendly and it's a great
starting point to see how many advanced
features we will be introducing there
you will probably be surprised to see
that several features will be introduced
we will be talking about component
design how to style components and we
will be introducing testing straight
away from the beginning at this point we
will also see in general how to make
components fee mobile meaning they have
a default theme but it's simple to
override it so that the component will
adapt to the look and feel of any
application as an exercise we will also
be building a Google material design
input box so meaning it will be able to
display an icon which is coming from the
Google material design library so this
will be our starting point an initial
component an exercise we have already
tested a library deployed it to NPM at
this stage so we are ready to continue
to increase a little bit the level of
difficulty of the library we are going
to now build a tab container that has a
default theme but it's still fully
customizable so what do I mean by that
is that we will be able to override just
about anything in the tab container for
example to override the look and feel of
the buttons the tab container will be
able to accept new tabs added
dynamically at runtime so at this point
with already three components built and
deployed in NPM we are going to be
building an input mask directive so this
will be the first directive that we will
be using in this course this input mask
directive will help the users to
introduce anything that has a predefined
format such as for example a phone
number or social security number this
will be designed in a way that it's
compatible with the components that we
have been building so far once we have
these initial components and directives
in place so
we are already at four NPM modules that
we have created and deployed so far we
are going to now build a form component
so this form component is going to
combine several of the directives that
we've been building and it's going to
combine them together to produce a
standard payment form with credit card
number etc so this will be an example of
components that it's also a form
component and what are the best
practices that we should adopt when
building that type of component next
what we are going to be building is a
dynamic modal component so like a pop-up
that you sometimes see for login and
user etc this is going to be a
completely dynamic component and what I
mean by that is that the model will not
be hidden let's say with display man on
the page it will be added to the page
last second so it's a completely dynamic
component we haven't done this before in
this course and once we have that in
place so at this point we have already
five or six modules created in NPM we
are going to build a new library that is
also very usable and quite useful which
is we are going to combine all the
directives and components that we have
built so far into a dynamic model
payment component that we will be adding
animations to so this is the part of the
course that will be covering animations
so I hope that this gives you an overall
idea of the content of the course if you
want to know the exact feature that we
will be covering I can give you an an
extensive list so we are going to be
covering the advanced core angular
features such as the templates templates
outlets ng content ng container style
isolation and customization we are going
to be covering äôt or ahead of time
compilation we are going to be covering
a global event debugging with the
angular CLI view children content
children and all the decorators that are
related to all the lotions around the
light numbers
the shadow Dom we're going to be
covering all the directive features such
as host binding and host listener
dynamic components that will be the
model we're going to be covering
keyboard events testing animations so
again this is an an extensive list I
invite you to have a look at the
description of the course in case if you
are looking for a particular feature but
we will be covering a lot of them a lot
of the angular advanced features we are
going to build a series of open-source
libraries it's going to be a ton of fun
I hope that you will enjoy it and
because it's an advanced course we're
going to start straight away we will be
checking out the code with some
predefined styles in place and we will
be diving straightaway into building our
first angular library deploying it on
NPM so without further ado let's get
started building our first angular
library thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
