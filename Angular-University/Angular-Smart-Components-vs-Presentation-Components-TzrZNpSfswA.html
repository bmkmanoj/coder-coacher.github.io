have implemented here these lists so
this table containing a list of lessons
now there could be other parts of the
application and there will be other
parts of the application where this
functionality is also needed for example
let's say a course we want to display a
list of the lessons that we longed only
- that course so in that case we would
need something similar to this
we shouldn't copy/paste it to that other
component we should create a reusable
component also at this moment it's
important to create a distinction
between components such as home
component which are application specific
components also known as smart
components sometimes called controller
components let's agree to call to this
type of components smart components in
the rest of the course this type of
components are inherently tied to the
application itself so they receive in
the constructor dependencies that are
application-specific it would be very
hard to use this component in another
application for example so what we
usually do is we make the top level
component of our view we make it a smart
component we inject it East's data and
then we implement the component by
composing it internally with what we
call sometimes pure components sometimes
presentation components there are
several names for it let's agree on
calling these components presentation
components so these are components like
the table that can take as input a list
of lessons without knowing where those
lessons came from if they came from the
courses service the lessons service etc
so two types of components smart
components which are application
specific and presentation components
which receive data as input without
knowing where the data comes from let's
refactor the home component to reflect
that distinction so let's take here this
table
and we're going to refactor it into a
lessons list component let's create the
component here using the CLI so ng G so
we're going to generate a component and
it will be the lessons list component we
can see the here the component that was
generated so lessons list works and
let's take a look at the lessons list
component it's the empty component
generated by the angular CLI so what
we're going to do now is we're going to
take the content of this template here
so this one we're going to take the
table the table part this will be our
lessons list component right so let's
just copy this here to the HTML template
of the lessons list component so now
what we have here is we need a variable
lessons as an input for this component
now we are not going to inject here in
the lessons this component we are not
going to inject in the constructor the
lessons service instead what we're going
to do is we are going to define an input
for the component so let's just import
input there we have it now lessons is an
input of the component so let's just
define it as such and there we have it
we import lesson we are going to modify
the selector of the lessons list
component to be just lessons list and we
are going to apply it to the home
component so here we receive a lessons
list and what we are going to do is we
are going to pass it in the lessons data
so remember lessons is this variable
here in the home component that gets
assigned to when define all lessons
observable returns we are going to take
these lessons here in the home component
so this is the result of the assignment
of the value that came via the
observable we are going to assign it to
the lessons input of the lessons list
component let's try this out so we can
see that if we refresh the application
we are going to get exactly the same
result now all of the
seems to be working fine but there is
one big catch
concerning the lesson class that we
created and we are going to cover it in
the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
