regular University welcome let's get
started learning reactive programming
first I have a quick question for you
what is the number one difficulty that
you have while building applications
with angular please let me know in the
comments below actually I asked this
same question many times in my mailing
list and the number one reply that I get
is rxjs and observables so the number
one difficulty is really not the
framework itself it's more what are the
advantages of building applications in
reacting style how do we do that what
are the main concepts around rxg is how
do we use it correctly the good news is
that reactive programming is really not
that hard it's really not that different
from many of the things that you have
always been using for building front
ends so where does this difficulty come
from because reactive programming at its
core it's actually something very simple
so why is it so difficult to learn I
believe that the main reason for that is
that we jump straight into the rxjs
library but we don't introduce the
observable pattern first and what is the
problem with that well what is rxjs rxjs
is a toolkit that allows us to build a
synchronous application in reactive
style using the observable pattern so if
we don't understand the observable
pattern and its benefits we will not be
able to make sense of rxjs
on the other hand if we understand the
observable patterns well the library
will make immediate sense including many
if not all of its multiple operators it
will all make so much more sense if we
learn first the observable pattern that
is the basis of reactive programming so
what we are going to do in the next
couple of hours if we are going to deep
dive into the observable pattern we are
going to understand exactly why it's
useful
the benefits of building applications in
reactive cells and what better way of
learning that than by first building a
small application that is not built in
reactive style has a set of problems and
then introduced reactive programming and
see what are the benefits of doing
applications that way we will introduce
the observable pattern and its related
concept the observer and the subject and
also other concepts that are related to
rxjs but the essential of rxjs is the
observable pattern and that's what we're
going to be learning in the next couple
of lessons step-by-step so what you are
about to see corresponds to the initial
part of the reactive patterns angular
architecture course the first section is
only about the observable pattern then
after this first section the course also
includes a catalog of patterns for
building applications in reactive style
both Buehler patterns and service layer
patterns and after that we are also
going to do dive on the RACs
library in further detail covering some
of the operators that we did not get a
chance to cover on the first two
sections so without further ado let's
get started learning reactive
programming by deep diving in its most
fundamental concept at least in the case
of the rxjs library which is the
observable pattern it's coming right up
in the next few lessons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
