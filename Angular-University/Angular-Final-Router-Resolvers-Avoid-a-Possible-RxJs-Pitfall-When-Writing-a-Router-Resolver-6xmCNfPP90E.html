from the angular University welcome in
this lesson we are going to cover the
angular 2 Reuter resolved functionality
how to write resolvers for the angular 2
router specifically we are going to
cover the case of writing a data
resolver using observables if you find
yourself in a situation where you are
trying to do a transition between routes
and the transition is not happening it
might have to do with something that we
are going to talk in the end of this
video it has to do with how we should
write our observables inside our
resolver so stay tuned it's coming right
up so the lesson forum would take here
as input a lesson we should pass it in a
lesson object as input let's first read
it from the database so how can we do
that we could read it directly in the
edit lesson component but we are going
to do it in a slightly different way we
are going to read it using a router
resolver so how does this work
we start by injecting in this component
the activated route in this activated
route we have here available a property
called data this data property receives
input data for the component that was
previously retrieved before the
component was created by the router so
if we subscribe to the data observable
we are going to receive here a data
object in this data object we are going
to extract a lesson that is already
available for us and we are going to
find it under the property lesson of the
data value this property here lesson of
the Edit lesson component will be of
type lesson so let's import lesson now
how do we feel in this lesson data
before the component is even created if
you go back to the router config what we
need to do is to the edit lesson
component we need to configure here a
router resolver to configure a router
resolver let's see what properties we
have here we have here the property
resolved now in here we are going to
configure which data resolvers are
triggered just before we create the Edit
lesson component we are going to create
here a resolver for the lesson property
and we are going to call it lesson
resolver this class does not exist yet
so let's create it we are going to go
here to the shared folder and here in
the model folder we are going to create
file called lesson resolver TS and
inside it we are going to define a class
called lesson resolver now how is this
class implemented in order to be a valid
router resolver well this class needs to
simply implement the resolve interface
this resolved interface takes a
parameter type and we are going to make
it a parameter of type lesson so we
import the lesson and now we are going
to implement the resolve method of the
interface let's see what is the
signature of this method so we take as
first argument activated route snapshot
and here a second argument the whole
router State in this resolve method we
are going to return an observable of any
in this case we are not going to return
a promise in our implementation a
resolver is actually also angular to
injectable so this is just like the
lesson service we should configure it in
the injectibles of our application
let's switch here to our application
module and what we're going to do is we
are going to provision the lessons
resolver here in the providers of our
module declaration now because this is
an injectable this has access to any of
the injectables of the application and
this includes of course the lessons
service that we are going to use to
retrieve the lesson data so how do we
retrieve the lesson data via the route
activated route snapshot we have here
available via the parameters of the
route
the IV parameter we have available the
URL for the lesson so let's use it to
retrieve the lesson using the lesson
service let's do that if we use the
lesson service and we use the find
lesson by URL and if we pass it in the
route params ID property these will
return us the lesson so we can actually
make this observable and observable of
lesson if we go back to the Rooter
configuration we can now import the
lesson resolver now let's go back to the
Edit lesson component as we can see we
are assigning the lesson that we
received from the data lesson property
we are assigning it to this variable to
make sure that this is working we are
going to use the do operator as before
to do a console dot log we are going to
try this out and we are going to run
into a very common observable related
problem take a look we are going to go
to this lesson so this is the first
lesson of the first course and we are
going to click Edit lesson now what we
can see is that the transition is not
made we did not lower the edit lesson
screen and why is that in order to
understand what's going on let's go back
to our lesson resolver so take a look we
are returning here in the resolve method
we are returning an observable of lesson
and this observable is built using fine
lessons by URL which is internally built
using angular fire now the angular fire
observables that I returned by the
angular fire API they are not completed
after the first emission of the first
value so if someone goes let's say here
to the database and they would add it
here the long description that would
trigger the emission of a new value for
the lesson with this URL so what's going
on here is that the resolve method when
it receives an observable it expects
that observable to eventually complete
and only after the observable completion
will the routing navigation be triggered
so in this case what we need to do is
we need to return to the call of resolve
we need to return an observable that
completes and this observable emits one
Valley but then it never completes so
one way of ensuring that this observable
completes after omitting the first value
is it is for example to call first on it
another way would be to call take one so
that would work too let's use the
operator first let's try this out now if
we now go back to the lesson detail
screen and we click on the Edit lesson
button now the routine transition
completes this is because the observable
that we are returning is completing due
to the first operator and this scenario
of a hanging route navigation that we
have just shown this is just one example
among many of how when we are dealing
with observables either returning them
from our API calls etc or sending
observables back to the framework it's
important to bear in mind when this dis
observable complete because that might
lead us to some strange situations like
it's the case here for example there are
XJS operators that won't work if you try
to use them with an observable that
doesn't complete so it's just something
to bear in mind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
