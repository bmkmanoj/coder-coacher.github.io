from the angular university and i will
be your instructor for this course
before anything else this is very
important please be aware that this is
not a beginners course so this course
assumes previous knowledge on typescript
so at least some knowledge on typescript
on angular itself and on rxjs if you are
looking to learn about typescript 2 and
its latest features and leave the
practical course that for example
teaches you how to build a REST API from
A to Z then in that case please check
the typescript to master class which is
another one of my courses if you want to
learn angular as a beginner
please check the complete angular with
typescript course and if you want to
build an application from top to bottom
a simple application but still complete
please check the angular 2 and firebase
build a web application course this
course is specifically about building an
application using a store architecture
which is a variety of the Flex
architecture and it's about the energy
rx reactive extensions library Co system
in general I have a quick question for
you do you think that one single
software bug could give rise to a
completely new software architecture for
our front-end the answer is actually yes
and you are going to learn all about it
in this course you are going to learn
all about the Flex architecture and
original face book and read messages
counter buy that originated it in the
beginning we are going to learn how to
build applications in angular using
functional reactive programming and the
NZXT store ecosystem we are going to
learn about engineering store and direct
store effects the integration with the
router we are going to learn about the
ngrick store developer tools we are also
going to cover immutability and jerax
store freeze but much more than the
separate individual libraries we are
going to learn the
big picture of how everything fits
together and how can we use these
libraries together to build an
application from A to Z we are going to
learn how to structure our components
the different types of components namely
smart components presentational
components we are going to learn how
should we design our API what kind of
data should we bring over the wire we
are going to learn how can we use
typescript
to define custom types for the multiple
types of data of our application and you
might wonder how are you going to do all
of that it's very simple we are going to
build the same type of application that
was causing the Facebook team so much
troubles that it gave rise to a new type
of application architecture we are going
to build something that is very similar
to the facebook chat system a simplified
version of it that illustrates the main
problem that they are trying to solve
and how does the store a sheet Ector
that they came up with solves that
particular problem and how it's a great
way of structuring our application so in
summary this is a angular architecture
course for building applications in a
reactive way that's what this course is
about we will be covering the ng rx
reactive extensions libraries in detail
but this course is really about how do
the libraries fit together to produce a
complete application architecture from
top to bottom I hope that you will enjoy
this course I bet that you are going to
have a lot of fun building this shat
application I invite you to click the
take this course button and let's start
learning angular architecture and the
angular reactive extensions together
thank you for watching and I will see
you inside the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
