How is it going everyone?
Vasco here from the Angular Academy.
In this lesson, we are going to learn how
to organize our components by placing the
HTML of the template in an external file.
We are also going to talk about some best
practices of the official style guide.
We have renamed the search box component file
into “search-box.component.ts”.
This is the recommended best practice.
We also moved it into a “search.box” directory
containing all the files of the template,
also a best practice.
The template HTML file should end with the
extension dot component dot HTML.
So let’s just take our HTML of our component
and let’s move it to the external file.
In order to include the external file in our
component, we need to use the property template
URL instead of template.
Now if we would try this without any further
modifications, it wouldn’t work because
Angular would try to lower this template from
the root of our server and this template is
in the subdirectory.
In order to specify the location of where
Angular should find the template file, we’re
going to use the module ID property.
Now we are going to pass it “module.id”.
This is an implicit variable that is available
in your program if you are compiling it in
the common JS format only.
So in order to make sure that this works for
you, shake your “tsconfig.json” and make
sure that you are using module equals to common
JS.
So this property module here.
This is very important.
Otherwise, you will get a type error undefined
while trying to use “module.id”.
Notice also here at the top of the file that
we have declared the module variable using
“declare const module”.
This is very important.
We are passing to typescript the information
that the module variable will be available
at run time.
If we don’t provide this information to
typescript, it will think that the variable
is missing and throw a compilation error and
we want to avoid that.
If we now try this out, we can see that the
component is still working and that the template
is being loaded in a separate HTTP request.
This is the right way to do it in development.
In production, all the templates will be bundled
so that they are not loaded in separate requests.
More on that later in this course.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
