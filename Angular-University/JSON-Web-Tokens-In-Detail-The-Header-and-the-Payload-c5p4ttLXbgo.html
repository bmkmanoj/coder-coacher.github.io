lesson we have introduced JSON web
tokens on a high level
let's now drill down on the JSON web
token format let's understand exactly
what is a JSON web token Heather payload
and signature it's important to
understand that JSON web tokens are not
encrypted so each of these free strings
that we have here is in base64 so this
payload here is not encrypted and it
should not contain sensitive information
that the attacker could use such as our
example passwords so let's see what this
looks like let's copy-paste this string
we haven't see that this is public
information although it looks like it
could have been encrypted somehow let's
take the string and head over to base64
decode org
we are going to paste the string here
we're going to hit the code and this is
going to transform this string from the
base64 encoding format into another
encoding format in this case the target
encoding is utf-8 as it's specified here
in the drop-down box
so if we now hit the code and as you can
see if you scroll down we have here the
exact same JSON object that we have here
so as you can see the first part of the
JSON web token is simply a base64
encoded string the improper T stands for
algorithm and this provides all the
information necessary to be able to
validate the signature more on the
signature in a moment right now let's
have a look at the second part of the
JSON web token which is the payload that
we can see here in purple let's have a
look at this second base64 string so if
we head over again to the same website
and we paste it here we are going to see
that this is also simply adjacent
objects encoded in base64 which
corresponds
to the payload so here we have the
payload as you can see the payload is
not encrypted so it's very important to
lever put any sensitive information in
the payload of a web token what we're
putting here is just a technical
identifier to a subject that would allow
us to though this request corresponds to
this user we don't need a session ID for
that what we need is instead a self
validating token what would prevent in a
JSON web token for an attacker to forge
a request simply create an object with a
given payload let's say that somehow the
attacker would get access to the subject
it would put the subject here and send
this together with an HTTP request
attempting to impersonate a user what
would prevent is attack scenario given
that the payload is not encrypted and
everything could be edited by an
attacker what prevents that from
happening is the third part of the JSON
web token which is the signature again
let's have a look at it with the decoder
we are going to paste this here to the
base64 decoder notice that we have
cleared here the result
let's hit decode so this time around we
did not get a JSON payload we got a
binary file that got downloaded so the
first part of a JSON web token is not a
JSON payload this is a cryptographic
signature this is the part that proves
that the payload is correct and was sent
by a given third party let's see how the
signature works you will notice here
that there is here a key called secret
we are going to talk about how this key
word is being used to produce a
signature right now let's just
understand on a high level how secret is
being used so this password is going to
be used by the sending party that
created the JSON web token with a given
claim meaning this request belongs to
this user the sending party is going to
the secret keyword this string here is
going to use it to produce the third
part of the JSON web token the receiving
party will also have this string
somewhere in their system the receiving
party will use the secret password to
validate that the JSON web token is
indeed valid and sent by someone that
had access to the secret password using
a shared password between the sender and
the receiver is just one of two ways
that we have available for producing a
signature we have here another way that
does not require sharing a password
between the two parties we're going to
go into that in a moment right now
before going any further let's quickly
summarize what a JSON web token is a
JSON web token is simply a mechanism for
ascending party to send a claim to a
receiving party the claim is a JSON
payload it's typically used for
authentication and it's typically
attached to an HTTP request the token
itself it's just a string with three
parts separated by dots
nothing is encrypted so we cannot put
sensitive information that an attacker
could use in the token the first part of
the JSON web token specifies which type
of signature we are using the second
part contains the payload typically it
identifies the user that the HTTP
request is associated to the last part
is the signature so the presence of a
signature makes the JSON web token cells
validate able token so when we receive a
JSON web token if we want to make sure
that the token is a valid token issued
by the correct party that we are
expecting we only need to look at the
token itself to confirm that we don't
need to call a third party to see if
this token valid or not we don't need to
store it in memory at the level of the
server and then compare it once we
receive a token over the network
we can create the web token and send it
over the network and forget it delete it
from memory the receiving party to
validate the token will only need to
inspect the signature there are two
available mechanisms for signing a JSON
web token HS 256 and RS 256 so we are
going to understand both let's go over
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
