from the angular University and in this
lesson we are going to learn how to use
the rxjs concat operator in order to do
multiple consecutive HTTP requests so
it's an example of how HTTP observables
are easily combined able using plain
rxjs operators let's take a couple of
examples of HTTP requests that modify
something on the server let's say we
have a request for deleting the first
item in the lessons list and a second
request to delete the second item in the
lessons list the building your first
component lesson we can do this by for
example using the rxjs concat operator
the concat operator takes several
observables and creates a combined
observable let's see exactly how that
works we're also going to use a further
request which is we want to reload the
data that is present on the server after
the two deletes occurred so the sequence
will be first delete wait for the reply
second delete wait for the reply reload
everything from the server what we can
do to do these requests in sequence is
that we use the concat operator and
we're going to pass it the delete first
delete second and reload observables
let's have a look at what this will do
in a marble diagram so first we have the
delete first observable so concat will
subscribe to this observable and it will
keep receiving values from this
observable other observables on the list
will not be immediately subscribed to so
what happens here is that the delete
first observable is going to complete
that's what this pipe here means so it
completes and so concat subscribes to
the second observable on its list when
it subscribes it sends another delete
request to the server and it will
receive the result of that delete and it
will also
complete in that case concat subscribes
to the third observable of its list
reload and these will trigger a list of
lessons that gets received from the
server when delete second completes
concat will subscribe to the third
observable that it received the lessons
observable so it will emit a get request
to the server to retrieve the new list
of lessons which will no longer contain
the ones that we deleted when the reload
of zaraba completes combined will also
complete now let's subscribe to the
combined observable and let's output its
values to the console notice that the
combined observable also emits values
whenever a delete occurred on the server
and we cannot really present this to the
user on the screen we are really only
interested in the lessons the new
lessons that came from the server that
don't contain the deleted lessons what
we want to do here is to wait for the
combined observable to complete so we
are going to use the completion Handler
and when that happens we are going to
assign the content of the reload
observable to our lessons observable
notice that when we assign reload to the
lessons observable these will be passed
on to the a sync pipe which will
subscribe to this observable this means
that if you don't use cache here in this
hello observable a get request will be
issued twice which we want to avoid if
we now try this out so the first two
items of the list should be deleted so
the third item says component input how
to pass input data to a component this
should show up now in the beginning of
the list let's try it we click delete
and the two lessons were deleted as
expected we're going to see now other
situations when rxjs operators can help
us achieve commonly needed tasks doing
angular - HTTP it's coming right up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
