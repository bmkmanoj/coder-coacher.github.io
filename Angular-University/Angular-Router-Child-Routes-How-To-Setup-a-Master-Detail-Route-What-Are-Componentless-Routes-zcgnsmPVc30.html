from the angular diversity and in this
lesson we are going to learn about
angular 2 shell droughts as part of our
router course so let's get started shell
routes allow us to navigate deeper into
our application the key thing to realize
about shell Rods is that only one shell
drought can be active at a time and this
might sound familiar to you take a look
at this free top level route so home
courses and lessons also these free
routes are only active one at a time
so we could also see our application as
having one main entry route let's say
the empty path route and that empty
route has free child routes each can
only be active once at a time so this
would be an alternative way of
configuring our application let's try
this new configuration so as you can see
the application still works exactly as
before let's now give a more common
example of the use of a shell route
let's say for example the route courses
typically we would want a shelter out of
it to show the details of a given course
so in the URL we would type slash
courses slash one or two so we would
type the ID of the course something that
uniquely identifies the course let's
configure this we can actually configure
something similar to this scenario even
without using shell routes so let's for
example configure a route course notice
that its course and not courses course /
: ID and then we map it to course detail
to the course detail component let's try
this out if we now type slash course
slash and then a number let's say that's
the idea of a course we can see that the
course detail component is being
displayed to the user another way of
doing this configuration is via the use
of shell routes so under the path
courses we typically have the route path
where we have the list of courses and
then we have a shell route with the
detail of each course well we only want
either the summary route or the detail
route to be active at each time and
never both so this is the ideal scenario
for using a shell rod for this let's
make courses a component less route this
means that the route is there for
routing matching purposes but the route
itself does not instantiate a component
now we are going to configure two shell
routes for the courses route the empty
path route which corresponds to the
courses component the component that
shows the list of courses and paths with
the ID of the course this corresponds to
the course detail again only one of
these two will be active at a given time
let's try this out if we reload the
application and go to the path courses
we still have the courses list being
loaded as expected and now if we type
manually in the URL courses slash and
then we give it an ID we are going to be
forwarded to the course detail route
like we expected you might have noticed
that this file is starting to contain a
lot of routing configuration so it's a
best practice to split the router
configuration across multiple files so
let's create a new routing configuration
file courses router config and we are
going to copy it in the definition of
all the routes that relate to courses we
are then going to import it in the main
configuration file and we are going to
include it by using the array spread
operator if you enjoyed this tutorial
you can always subscribe to my channel
for more upcoming angular 2 tutorials
also have a look at the website of the
angular university to see what type of
angular 2 tutorials you find there that
you might like we are getting deeper
into routing and this is only the
beginning so be sure to watch the
following lessons for learning what is a
log silly reroute and we are going to do
a exercise at the end of the course
where we are going to build a complete
dashboard so stay tuned for the upcoming
lessons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
