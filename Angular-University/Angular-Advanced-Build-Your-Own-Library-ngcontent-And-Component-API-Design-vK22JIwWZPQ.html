talk about content projection and best
practices for the design of the API of
our components so we will get back to
component styling later in the course
right now let's talk a little bit about
component design let's go here to the
template where the font awesome input is
being used so as you can see the
placeholder is still email everywhere
and this is because we are using here a
hard-coded
placeholder so typically this would be a
property so this would be a property
that we would pass on to this input and
this would come from a variable that is
available here at the level of the
component input so we would call it
simply placeholder so the same name and
we are going to define it here so this
will be an input as well this would have
been passed on from the exterior of the
component and this will be a string with
a default value empty string so we can
actually remove the type adaptation in
this case and now if we go back here to
the application component we are going
to be able to pass in here for example
at the level of the lock we are going to
be able to pass in here a placeholder as
an input property so we are going to say
that the placeholder is going to be
password if we hit ctrl s where you'll
see that this functionality is being
applied as expected so maybe we would
think that it would be a good design to
the same thing for all the other
properties of the input but let me give
you a quick example of why this would
not be a good idea because an input HTML
tag might have a lot of properties in a
production scenario so not only the type
and the name if it's part of a form and
the place holder but it could have
multiple validator attributes it will
have the autocomplete attribute this is
a custom striped attribute and if we add
all the accessibility related attributes
we are looking at tens of input
properties for this input so at that
point the vast majority of the code of
the component would just be true
applicate the properties that are
already part of the normal HTML input
there wouldn't be much more
functionality to the component and also
it creates other problems so I will
remove here this example input another
problem that this approach would create
is what is this input would be part of
angular form so we would like to add
here for example the form control
directive we would not be able to do so
here at the level of the template where
this component is being used so if we
want this to be integrated with angular
forms we would also have to duplicate
all the angular forms properties on an
input and that is also not practical so
instead let's look at an alternative
component design this is a general
design practice that is possible we
should avoid wrapping plain HTML
elements especially leaf elements like
inputs or select boxes these elements
are better if they are included here in
the original component and not being
wrapped around in a custom component
because of these problems that we have
just seen so how could we do this
angular provides us a feature that is
meant precisely for this which is called
content projection so the way that these
works is here inside the custom element
our component we can pass in here some
contents that can be used in the
template of the component let's have a
look we can remove this placeholder
property already and if we go here to
the input component actually we can
remove this as well and we are going to
remove this input from the template of
this component instead if the component
needs an input we are going to pass it
here in the content body of the
component tag so we are going to tell
angular to take anything that it finds
here inside this component tag and to
place it inside the template in order to
do that we need to adhere the ng-content
Corps directive so what this directive
will do is it will say that here in this
part of the
font awesome input we are going to put
anything that angular finds here inside
the content part of the element so we
are going to remove here form control
and for the moment we are going to apply
here the placeholder again where it says
the placeholder is email and let's
quickly apply the same system here to
the rest of the elements so here the
input would be password we're going to
remove here the other elements just to
make it simple this demonstration we are
going to pass in here the placeholder
password and here the placeholder let's
say that it will be stripe and here
PayPal so it is in place if we now
refresh the application we are going to
see that the placeholders are being
applied as expected so there are some
styling issues we are going to cover
that in a moment
that's right now we can see that this
content here the content inside the
component tag is being applied here
inside the template using the ng-content
core very active we are going to see
several more advanced use cases of ng
contents throughout the course right now
let's have a look at this styling issue
so our component was being styled
correctly but now with the use of ng
content we see that the border none'
style is not being applied anymore for
example so how is this working what is
going on
is it possible to style elements using
ng content we're going to find out how
to solve this this is coming right up in
the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
