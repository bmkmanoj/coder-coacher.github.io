to a new section of the angular security
master class we are going to learn in
this section about cross-site request
forgery or CSRF which is a very common
security vulnerability the key thing
about this vulnerability is that the
attack is very simple to perform the
attacker only needs your email or
alternatively the attacker only needs to
convince you to click on a link for
example on a message on a public forum
so the attacker does not need to have
any level of control over your machine
we're going to see how to defend against
this vulnerability the first thing that
we are going to do is we are going to
understand the vulnerability by
performing ourselves the attack against
this version of the application which is
currently vulnerable to this problem
let's then go back to our application
code and understand the vulnerability in
detail so what we are doing here is we
are creating JSON web token that
contains the user session information
and we are storing it in a cookie the
cookie is HTTP only and secure and those
are great security properties however
using cookies makes the application
vulnerable to CSRF which is a particular
type of vulnerability that assumes that
you are currently logged into the
application so we have just logged in
and we have a new session now you
probably want to increase the size of
the session during this test in order to
do so let's go here to the session
duration attribute in security utils
and let's increase the size of the
session we're going hit ctrl s so that
we reload the server this way we will be
able to test the vulnerability now if we
reload the application because the
restart of the server has wiped the
users that are in memory we are going to
go here and we are going to create a new
user
so let's hit sign up we have a new user
and we have a new session that is a bit
more long-lived than the sessions that
we were using before so we are currently
logged into our application that is
running in
host port 4200 okay so now somebody sent
you an email and you can see an example
of such type of email here on the CSRF
folder let's open email dot text so
somebody sends you an email that
essentially convinces you to click a
link now this link is an attack link the
way that this works is you are logged in
to your application so you have a valid
session cookie that the browser is going
to send each time that your browser does
a request to your application server now
this link is not towards the application
server this is a link that will leave
you to an attack server under the
attacker control we are going to run
this attack server in a moment right now
let's have a look at the CSRF attack
page that this link is sending us to so
when the user clicks this link this page
is going to be loaded from the domain of
the attacker so this is a completely
separate domain it might even be a link
to IP address directly it doesn't have
to be to the main so this is the attack
page typically nothing gets printed to
the screen this is just to demonstrate
that the attack was successful we have
here a visual message on the screen and
we have here a form now this form here
is a plain HTML form with the post
method so we are triggering here
something in our server we are now doing
a post call to the application so this
is how the attacker is going to attack
the application it's going to learn you
to click into a page under his control
and he is going to auto submit a form
that does a post call to your
application server now because your
browser has a cookie active with a
session and you are currently logged
into the application this post code is
going to be seen from the point of view
of the application it's going to be seen
as a valid request that you made from
your browser that is because the request
will contain your session cookie
the server is going to receive the
session cookie it's going to validate it
and the server is going to process this
request like if you went clicked here
log out there is no way for the server
to distinguish a request that came from
your browser interaction and the request
made by this attack page this
vulnerability is inherent to the way
that cookies work cookies will always be
added to any request that you send to
the server independently of where the
request was made in your application in
the third party page the cookie will
always be added by the browser this
attack however has several limitations
but before going through them
let's first demonstrate the attack we
are going to log out the user in order
to perform this attack the first thing
that we're going to do is to start the
attack server onto which we are
directing the user to lower the attack
page so in order to do that we have
created here an NPM task that will allow
us to start a very simple server we are
using here the HTTP - server module
which allow us to start the server for
development purposes we are specifying
that we are disabling the server cache
and we are serving files from the
current directory where the package dot
Jason is so let's start the server then
we are going to open a third terminal
and on the same directory as the package
that Jason we are going to run NPM run
CSRF server now this utility has started
here in the text server on port 8080
make sure to confirm the port here in
the console because this utility server
will take for example port 8081
if you have already something running on
port 8080 this is important because the
link on the email is using this port so
now we have an attack server running so
let's say that you are on your Gmail and
you have clicked the link the link is
going to open your default browser let's
say that it was the same browser as you
were logged in in order to view better
how the attack works let's switch to a
larger window where we are going to be
opening here our Chrome
have tools here in the network tab we're
going to reload the server before trying
the attack just to confirm that indeed
we still have a session active so now we
have clicked the link so this would have
opened a new browser window and the link
would be pasted here and the page would
be loaded so let's see what happens here
in the network tab we're going to switch
to it clean everything and we're going
to hit preserve log so that we can see
everything that is going on let's paste
the attack link here and see what
happens if we hit enter we can see here
that the attack took place the attack
page was loaded but now let's see what
happened here let's remove the xhr
filter that is filtering only Ajax
requests and see what happened
this option preserve log is going to
keep all the logging information even if
we switch to a new page so this is great
for troubleshooting redirects or any
scenarios that spend multiple pages as
we can see here we have loaded the first
page and two seconds later we have here
an HTTP POST call that was made to a
completely different domain so here we
are running everything on localhost but
on a real attack scenario here we would
have the domain of the attacker or the
IP address of the server of the attacker
and here we would have your domain now
let's have a look at the post request
this post request was made via the
attack page but it still included here
your session cookie that's because you
are sending a request to the domain of
your application so your session cookie
would have been included this means that
you must have been logged out via the
attack page because there was no way for
the application server to know if this
was a valid request there was nothing
about the request that would allow the
backend to identify it as being invalid
it did contain the session cookie after
all so if we now switch back to the
application and we will lower the
application we are going to see that you
have been
logged out so this shows that it's
possible for an attacker which has not
compromised your browser and has not
compromised your server if they trick
you in to clicking a link on the mail
they will be able to simulate a request
on your behalf that the server will not
be able to identify as an invalid
request okay so at this point we now
understand how the attack works and how
it's being performed exactly now that we
know that let's discuss what are the
limitations of this attack what can get
occur actually do in practice with this
attack and most of all how can we defend
our application against CSRF</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
