lesson we are going to understand common
angular change detection errors and we
are going to learn how to fix them let's
have a look at an example on the last
lesson we saw that we had here the
material paginate are up and running but
have a look there's a problem if we head
over to the console we are going to see
that we have here a change detection
error expression changed after it has
been checked ever this is a relatively
common angular change detection error we
are going to understand it in detail and
we're going to fix it together let's see
exactly what's going on here
this has to do with the loading
indicator in our template in our loading
indicator we have here an NG if
expression and this is the source of the
error you are probably wondering at this
point how can we be sure of that that
this is the part of the template that is
causing the problem
currently we cannot know that based on
the message it's not yet specific enough
this is going to be improved but we can
use the JavaScript debugger that is
built in chrome let's have a look at it
here in a larger window where we have
here the expression error another simple
way would be to comment out multiple
parts of the template until the error
disappears but this way it's probably
going to be faster so here is what we
will do we are going to head over here
to the line where the debug error is
being thrown and we are going to have a
look at it this line is being called
when the error occurs so let's add here
a breakpoint and we are going to reload
here our application now the error is
going to be thrown and we will be able
to walk through the stack to see what is
happening so let's go a couple of levels
up the stack you can see here for
example that this is where the error is
being thrown we can see here the old
value that was not being printed to the
screen if we hover here with the mouse
we can see that the old value of an
expression was false and the current
value is true this is what is causing
the
we are going to understand why this is a
problem in a moment right now we simply
want to identify what is the expression
that is causing the error so if we
continue to scroll down the stack we are
going to find here a component let's
have a look at it if we click here we
are going to see that these happens when
we are evaluating this expression so
this is how we identify which part of
the template is causing the error here
is the problem angular is trying to
inspect this template and it's trying to
build a view based on this template in
order to display it on the screen now
here is what is happening when angular
starts building the view it will
evaluate this expression here data
source loading and it's going to apply
the a sink pipe let's have a look at
what is the initial value of this
expression we're going to head over here
to the lessons data source that contains
the loading observable and we're going
to see that the initial value of this
expression is going to be false so
initially no data is getting loaded so
there is no loading indicator that is
getting displayed this is not being
applied to the Dom but then angular does
not stop here building the view angular
is going to trigger the multiple
lifecycle hooks during the view
construction process and one of them is
going to be after viewing it that
triggers here the ng after viewing it
method so this method we don't invoke it
ourselves
this method is invoked by angular while
it's building the view based on the
model the course and whenever it gets
from the data source during that view
construction process we want to make
sure that the data only flows in one
direction from the component into the
Dom we want to make sure that building
the view does not itself trigger further
modifications of the model we want to
make sure that the view construction
process forces unidirectional data flow
the data flows from our components into
the Dom but that process
itself of building a view does not
itself further update the data and
that's exactly what is going on here
with these implementation of ng after
viewing it we are further updating the
data let's see how we are immediately
emitting here a null value that is going
to trigger here the lower lessons method
and all of these happens synchronously
while angular is still constructing the
view and these lower lessons method what
does it - the first thing that it does
is update the loading flag and it's this
update that it's problematic and that
it's causing here our air let's
understand why angular is trying to
build the view right so it first
evaluates this expression and it's false
initially now angular has ran the view
construction process and now has some
Dom to be applied here to show the
latest data to the user that is in sync
with the data that we have here in our
course component now that view
construction process which included here
this call to ng after viewing it has
caused this flag to be set to true so
what should alert display to the user
should angular this plate of user this
loading indicator or not there is no way
for angular to know if this loading
indicator should have been displayed and
that's why angular it's throwing an
error this air is aimed at helping us
prevent this view update itself
problematic scenario that leads to UI
code that is hard to maintain and reason
about this error is being thrown by the
angular development mode now that we
have a good understanding about this
error message and we understand why it's
useful for us why it's avoiding us from
building user interfaces that will be
hard to maintain and reason about in the
long run let's now understand how to fix
this issue this is coming right up in
the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
