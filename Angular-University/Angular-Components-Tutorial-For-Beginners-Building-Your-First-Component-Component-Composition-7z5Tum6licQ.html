Vasco here from the Angular University.
In this lesson, we are going to see how a
component can be inserted inside another component.
So component composition coming right up!
We have here the root component of our application.
This app component is the entry point of our
Angular tool component tree.
It is a best practice not to put any actual
logic in this component and instead import
directly other components.
Letâ€™s create another component and add it
to the root component.
That component will be the search box component,
which is made of a simple input box with a
clear button next to it that will clear the
search.
We can see that we have defined in this component
the search box selector.
This means that if we want to use it in the
root component, we need to use the search
box custom HTML element.
Now if we would try this without any further
changes, it wouldnâ€™t work.
Thatâ€™s because the app component does not
recognize the search box HTML custom tag as
being another Angular component.
We need to configure the app, to recognize
it as such using the directives attribute.
In order for this to work, we need to import
the search box component inside the app component
using the import syntax as we can see here.
If we now try this out, we can see that everything
is working as expected.
So the search box component was inserted into
the app component.
Next, weâ€™re going to learn how inputs work
in components, how we can pass it inputs,
receive outputs and weâ€™re going to see an
example with a more complex tree of components.
So stay tuned.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
