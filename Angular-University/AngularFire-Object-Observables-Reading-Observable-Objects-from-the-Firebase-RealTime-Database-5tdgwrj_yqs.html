from the angular University in this
lesson we're going to learn how to use
the angularfire library to query objects
in firebase it's coming right up
now onto the second biggest construct of
the angularfire library so this is the
primitive that allow us to handle
firebase lists there is an equivalent
primitive that allow us to handle
objects so let's say that for example we
want to query this course here so let's
take the key and we are going to query
it using the angularfire library so
let's simply call annular fire and now
so we again we use database so here we
have another function available which is
object so let's just use it and we're
going to pass it in the path to the
course so it's courses forward slash and
then the key of the course and again we
get back and observable so let's assign
it to a variable ending in dollar your
course dollar is an observable and let's
subscribe to it using the method that we
just saw to quickly log it to the
console if we now inspect the console we
can see that we get back now an object
which the key corresponds to the key of
the course and the properties contain
the properties of the course these two
types the firebase object observable and
the firebase lists observable are the
two most important concepts of the
angularfire library they allow us to
interact with all the data in the
database they also allow us not only to
retrieve specific nodes under the form
of observables but we can also use them
to modify data in the database with
these two API of methods so object and
list we can do just about any query to
the firebase database we're going to see
specifically in the list how to
parameterize the query right now we are
going to learn about write operations in
firebase
we modify the data using angularfire
it's coming right up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
