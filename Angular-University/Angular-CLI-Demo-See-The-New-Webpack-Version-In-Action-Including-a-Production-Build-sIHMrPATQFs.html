set up in your machine note 6 or higher
with this in place you simply type NPM
install - g4 global and then angular -
CLI this will take a moment maybe a few
minutes but at the end you will have a
command line interface ng that will
allow you to bootstrap a project from
scratch with a single command and all of
the generated code respects the angular
2 official style gab so let's get
started using the angular CLI let's
create a hello world project let's type
ng new hello - world and this will
immediately start generating a new
project from scratch it will take a
moment but once it's done and we see
thee into the directory hello - world
we're going to see that we have here a
whole project scaffolded let's now
switch to the IDE that we will be using
for this courses which is webstorm so
you can see here that the whole project
was generative in the hello - world
folder and if we open here for example
the main dot TS this is the entry point
of the application according to the
angular 2 official style guide this is
the convention you can see here that
this is a fully compliant angular 2
final project we have here an app module
which is the root module of our
application then we are using it to
bootstrap the application dynamically in
the browser
please don't worry because we are going
to go over each and every one of these
concepts one by one in separate lessons
what is a component what is a module etc
how to bootstrap your application the
goal of this lesson is just to set up an
angular 2 playground that works reliably
so that you can use it for your learning
experience so let's run the playground
we can run the playground with only one
command ng serve these will start up a
live server that
will automatically refresh the browser
each time that you have a change in your
code each time that you change one of
the files ng server will take a moment
the first time to build your bundles but
the good news is that it will be much
faster afterwards so after a few seconds
you have a running HelloWorld
application in your browser in this case
in port 4200 now let's inspect the
network tab to see how many HTTP
requests were made for this simple hello
world example we can see here that even
in development mode so ng serve runs
everything in development mode what
happens here is that we only have six
HTTP requests so the development
experience is actually very fast also we
have hot reloading working so if we
change here the title of our hello world
message and we hit ctrl s to save the
file automatically the browser gets
reloaded with a new version of our
application now we can also build the
application very easily in production if
you enjoyed this tutorial you can always
subscribe to my channel for more
upcoming angular 2 tutorials also have a
look at the website of the angular and
university to see what type of angular 2
tutorials you find there that you might
like so if we type ng build - brawl we
are going to trigger the production
build which is going to apply a series
of optimizations to our bundles that are
not applied in development mode because
they are a bit time-consuming so you
only want to apply them for production
now we can run the application in
production mode by using the command ng
serve - prod
so we have here a running application in
production mode and so here we have it a
stable working environment that we can
use for learning angular 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
