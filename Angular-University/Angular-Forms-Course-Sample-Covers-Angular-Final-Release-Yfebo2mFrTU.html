angular 2 forms course I'm Vasco from
the angular University and in this
lesson we are going to start by learning
why do we need a full framework module
for doing something apparently as simple
as forums well the main reason is forms
are really not that simple forms can be
a very complex part of our application
especially if there is a very large
amount of fields
if the forum's spend several tabs if
there are editable parts of the form
that can be edited via a dialog forms
can be very complex there can be a lot
of business valuation rules
interdependent validations depending on
multiple fields of the form you could
have a whole tab in error it could have
multiple fields that are related in
error angular 2 helps us deal with all
that it helps us extract the data from
the form in a simplified way so you will
never have to write code that gets the
data from the form and populates an
object that's done for you also angular
2 helps us dealing with validating the
form showing proper error messages to
the user clearly identifying which parts
of the form need to be edited that's the
big added value of the forms module not
every form is that complex take a look
at this example
where we are creating a lesson in a
course so we are going to put the title
the duration and we're going to put the
level either beginning or advanced and
then we click on a button create lesson
now what we want to do in this form is
we want to extract the data that the
user types in from the form let's start
with that that is called data binding
let's configure this in a template
driven way this is the closest that you
can get in angular 2 to the angular 1
way if you are familiar with angular 1
if you are not familiar with angular 1
don't worry we're going to explain now
data-binding for this simple form what
we want to do here is we want to
synchronize continuously the content of
the form we want to bind it to this
lesson object this lesson object is an
instance of the lesson class which has
these properties take a look at the type
annotations in the constructor these are
actually optional because we are
specifying default values for each
constructor parameter so if we remove
the type annotations we still have type
safety in this program this typescript
feature is known as type inference in
order to use angular 2 forms we need to
set them up because they are not
included by default in angular so in
this case we want to use template driven
forms for that we need to import in this
case in our root module we are going to
import the forms module from the angular
slash forums barrel now what we want to
do in this form before using ng model is
we want to turn off certain html5
features that are on by default because
we don't want html5 to be handling the
validation of the form we want angular
to do it for that we simply use the no
validate property in the form we also
don't need autocomplete so I'm just
going to turn it off let's also output
the value of the lesson object to the
screen using the JSON pipe so that we
can see by directional binding in action
now let's configure the title field to
be be directionally bound to the lesson
title property for that we are going to
use ng model and we are going to assign
it lesson dot title this syntax here
with the two parentheses is called the
banana box syntax if we try now this out
and we start typing in the title lesson
field we're going to see that the less
an object is automatically kept in sync
with the content of the input field with
each key event so this is the ng model
functionality in action
we don't need to code anything for doing
data binding it's done for us
automatically but that is only half the
story of angular 2 forums data binding
let's inspect the HTML we have here
several state classes valid or it could
be invalid touched pristine ng model is
also helping us validate this form and
we are going to see exactly how to do
validation in the upcoming lessons so
stay tuned hello everyone how's it going
it's Vasco from the angular University
and in this lesson we're going to learn
a couple of different ways of using ng
model ng model is not only for the
directional data binding there's more to
it so let's take an example sometimes we
simply just want to initialize a form
with certain values that arrived imagine
from our back end but we don't want
necessarily to keep the value of the
form all the time in sync with a certain
object maybe we want to wait until the
whole form is valid before retrieving
the data there could be several reasons
anyway ng model supports that and more
now one aside how do we handle this
radio button in angular 2 we usually
want to assign to a radio button we want
to have it associated to typescript
indium in this case the student level
where you have beginner and advanced the
different levels of a lesson well an
HTML form does not give us any number it
gives us a string simply put the string
that we have specified in the value
attribute of the radio button option in
the form how can we deal with this
since ng model is continuously reading
and writing into the lesson object level
property what we can do is we can use
typescript getters and setters to
transform the in
back into a string and vice versa like
we are doing here now ng-model works
also only for initializing the form you
don't have to use it always for be
directional binding if you just want to
initialize the form with the content of
the lesson object but don't want to bind
to it all the time you can do so by
removing these round brackets from the
ng-model attribute declaration let's try
this out if we now edit the title and
the duration fields the values are not
being reflected back into the lesson
object but if we now edit the student
level innum that is still being be
directionally bound because we are using
the famous banana box syntax for the
student level field but remember ng
model and angular 2 forms in general is
about data binding and validation you
might not want to do any data binding at
all not even setting an initial value in
the form you might only want to use the
validation functionality of forms and ng
model supports that if we want to do
that we simply remove the brackets
notation from the ng model attribute we
simply use it like this let's try this
out as we can see now there is no data
binding at all being done not even an
initial value but validation is still
working the validation functionality
that sets the CSS state classes like
durty touched that is still being
applied to this field by ng model but
okay what can we do with these classes
we are not displaying any error message
to the user how can we do that how can
we give the user a good form user
experience
using angular 2 we are going to find out
in the next few lessons
how's it going it's Vasco from the
angular University and in this lesson we
are going to learn what is this magic
all about of template driven forms how
does this work
we are also going to see some standard
validators that come with the framework
so coming right up you might be
wondering how does this all work well
it's a testament to the power of angular
2 forms and directives the mechanisms
that we have seen before all the forms
module is made with directives basically
these are just plain angular 2
directives you could have written them
yourself but they come packaged for us
already there is a form level directive
that is applied to the form element so
it has a selector which has formed in it
and that's basically it it's as simple
as that
so there will be a form directive that
keeps track of the validity of the whole
form and which form fields which form
controls does the form have then
whenever you apply ng model to an input
that will also create a directive that
gets applied to that input element and
that directive will create a form
control that will also register itself
in the form directive so remember
directives can inter communicate via
different mechanisms whenever you apply
the required attribute well that's also
a forms standard directive that gets
applied to this element that will
register a validation rule with the form
control but enough about the theory
let's see this in practice so it's very
simple the same way that you have the
required directive that gets applied to
mark fields in mandatory there are many
other directives that allow us to do
form field validation such as minimum
length for example let's see how this
works if we specify a minimum length of
10 characters and we
typing on the field the field will be
read until the moment where we type at
least 10 characters or more let's try
another standard validator than max
length validator so if we say max length
15 we start typing it becomes valid and
now we cannot type anymore so this
directive mimics the standard behavior
of the HTML 5 max length validator let's
try another standard validator for
example let's say that the duration
field can only have numeric characters
let's use the pattern validator
and we can pass it in a JavaScript
regular expression that defines what are
the acceptable characters for the field
as you can see you can only type numbers
in this field as expected now that you
know how template driven forms work
under the hood you can understand that
you can add your own validations to a
form by creating a directive we are
going to see that in an upcoming course
also you know that this is just
directives under the hood doing this
functionality this is very useful you
will see in the next lesson how can you
use this to disable the form button
until the whole form is valid it's
coming right up welcome it's Vasko from
the angular university and in this
lesson we are going to start learning a
completely different way of making
angular 2 forms model driven or reactive
driven forms why do we need two ways of
doing forms what's the difference when
to use each is coming right up so first
let's take the same form that we did in
the template children forms section it's
just a clean HTML form that you're
looking at we're going to write it in
the model driven way the main difference
towards template driven forms is that in
this case we are going to create the
form and its controls programmatically
and then we are going to bind it to form
elements as opposed to using a set of
directives to create in place
Italy behind the scenes the form and its
controls for us but enough about the
theory let's see this in practice in
order to be able to use reactive forms
the first thing that we need to do is to
import the reactive forms module into
our application in this case we are
going to import it into the root module
of our demo application now let's create
the form actually let's use the form
group directive to assign to this
element an existing form so we are not
creating it in the template I cannot
stress this enough so in this case my
form is the form associated to this HTML
form all the reactive form directives
start with form so we can see that they
make a consistent group now in our
controller let's define a variable my
form which is of type form group that
represents the form now let's start our
program and let's see what happens here
we have not initialized the my form
variable so we get an error
this is expected again reactive form
directives bind form elements to
variables that we need to initialize
ourselves programmatically so in this
case we need to initialize my form and
we are going to create a new form Group
instance we are going to pass it in for
the moment an empty configuration object
let's try this out again
now the error is fixed we have created
our first reactive form now let's add
some controls to the form before we were
doing that using ng model in this case
we are going to use the form control
named directive and we are going to
assign to each form control a name like
the directive says now let's run this
what will happen try to guess of course
we get an error because again this
directive is only binding to an existing
control that we need to create ourselves
so let's do that let's create free-form
controls
one for each input field the title the
duration and the description we are
going to create the form controls inside
the configuration object that was passed
on to the form itself so each property
of this object each property name is the
name of the control and the value is the
control itself that we are going to
create with new form control and we are
going to pass to each control its
initial value let's try this out so as
you can see the four controls have been
initialized with the initial value and
we have no errors on the console so
congratulations you have created your
first reactive form why is it called
reactive what's the point
what's the difference we're going to
start to understand that already in the
next lesson when we are going to go over
validation in reactive forms so stay
tuned welcome it's Vasco from the
angular University and in this lesson we
are going to talk about how to do form
validation with model-driven or reactive
forms so stay tuned it's coming right up
we can define the validation rules of
our form controls programmatically at
the level of the form control so the
second argument that you pass on to the
form control constructor is an array
containing a list of validators and
validators are just plain functions so
the previous validators that we saw were
required pattern max length etc we can
import those validators from the forms
module let's see here we are going to
import validators not required there are
others validators not min length max
length pattern all this functionality is
available here for configuration
actually internally this code here that
performs this validation this is also
called by the set of directives that we
have seen before apply directly at the
template level like the required
attribute min length max length but
internally those directives call these
validators that we are configuring here
it's the same code let's see this in
action if we try this out we can see
that all the validation functionality is
working mandatory fields are being
marked as read if empty and we can only
type numbers into the duration field so
this works just like template driven
forms but take for example a more
complex case where maybe we would like
to add a validation to a certain form
field but only in a certain condition
depending on the data now that's a more
advanced use case that actually happens
a lot in practice and that we would not
be able to do with template driven form
validation actually everything in
principle that you can do with model
driven forms you can also do with
template driven forms but in the case of
this example it would probably be much
harder you are probably still thinking
okay that's great but why are they
called reactive forms we're going to go
into it in the couple of next lessons so
stay tuned hello everyone and welcome
Vasko here from the angular university
and in this lesson we are going to learn
how to initialize a form with a set of
existing values that might have come for
example from the back end we are also
going to learn how to reset a form and
last but not least we are going to cover
a common pitfall that occurs often when
we are using model driven forms I invite
you to keep an eye on the duration field
during the course of this lesson the
explanation for what you are about to
see is available in the end of this
lesson there are two ways to update a
form either a partial or a complete
update let's start with a partial update
let's create here a button that is
called
partial update it calls a method that we
are going to implement we are simply
going to call the my form so we have a
reference a form group we are going to
call
the patch value method and inside it we
are going to pass it in an object each
of the properties of the object should
correspond to a form field so in this
case we are going to specify the title
property and we are going to give it a
new value note that in the patch value
call we don't need to pass in all the
mandatory fields of the form we can pass
in only the fields that we want to
modify let's try this out if we now
click the button we can see that the
update is working as expected so again
we passed in here a value that we just
art coded but this could have come for
example from the server now what we want
to do is we might want to do a full
update of the form values so let's add a
new button full update and let's
implement it we're going to use the
method my form dot set value and inside
we are going to pass in another object
let's specify for example the mandatory
property title let's try this out to see
what happens so we can see that we
receive an error and the error says that
we did not provide the description
property so let's just add the
description to the object that we pass
in to set value and let's try it again
now we don't receive any error and
everything is working as expected I'm
sure that you noticed during this lesson
that something was wrong concerning the
duration field we're going to explain
that that's the pitfall that we
mentioned in the beginning of this
lesson it's very simple when we called
patch value we passed in a duration
property it did not get applied when we
called set value we would expect an
error if one of the form fields is not
available we didn't pass in a duration
we did not get any error take a look
this is because the duration field
although we created it programmatically
using new form control and we bound it
to this control using the form control
directive that control is isolated it's
not linked to any form take a look at
the form builder dot group call where we
pass in the form fields we can see that
only title and description are part of
the form but not duration so the
conclusion is if you are doing model
driven forms and you are creating
controls programmatically and binding
them using form control make sure to
also add them to the form declaration
otherwise they will not be considered
part of the form let's now learn how to
reset a form so we have rather the first
button reset that simply calls this
method named reset and inside it we
simply call reset on the form it's as
simple as that now take a look at this
we start editing the form and we can see
that the status of dirty touched and
touched etc the CSS state classes of the
form control they have been updated
accordingly now whenever we click the
reset button we can see that not only
the form fields have been reset but also
the CSS state classes have been all
resetted to their initial values and so
this covers how to set a form value now
in the next lesson we are going to learn
when should we use template driven forms
versus model driven or reactive forms
and why it's coming right up
everyone and welcome I'm Vasco from the
angular University and in this lesson we
are going to learn when should we use
template driven versus model driven or
reactive forms and why it's coming right
up let's give an example for example
this is a model driven form so all the
validations and all the controls are
defined programmatically and we are just
binding those controls to the template
using for example form control name and
the form group directives now what we
haven't done so far is that we can
actually combine model driven forums and
template driven forms in the same form
for example the mandatory validation for
the title field we can delete it here
from the programmatic declaration so
it's no longer defined in a model driven
way but we can go now to the form itself
and we can add the required attribute
and this will still work let's give it a
try
if we clear the title mandatory field we
can see that the validation is triggered
so these proves that we can use both
mechanisms of form building together but
you can see even from this simple
example our Fink and start becoming
confusing rather fast if we mix the two
approaches in the same form so we are
best of choosing one approach and using
it consistently through the whole
application there might be cases where
we need to mix the two approaches but
those tend to be the exception and not
the rule
but then what type of form should we
choose and why that actually depends on
the concrete situation for example if
you are migrating an existing
application from angular 1 to angular 2
you really want to go with template
driven forms at least in an early stage
that's one of the main use cases of
template driven forms actually it makes
it very easy to migrate existing angular
1 forms built using ng model 2 angular 2
forms that also use ng
model and the banana box syntax and
bi-directional binding that's really one
of the main use cases now if you have a
simple form in an angular 2 application
it only takes a couple of fields like
three or four fields and it only uses
very basic validation like these fields
are mandatory this field only has this
minimum length in such a simple use case
you can also use template driven forms
they work perfectly there is no reason
to not use them but model driven forms
were built to handle cases where the
complexity increases like for example
enterprise applications imagine a very
large credit application with large
forms that spend multiple tabs with a
ton of fields a lot of business logic
validation so for example certain fields
cannot have this combination of values
that's the clear scenario for using
model driven forms from the beginning
also if you have an application where
you want to add more modern
functionality like autosave or undo redo
you will find it much easier to add that
sort of functionality if you use
reactive forms from the beginning and
remember template driven forms and model
driven forms are using under the hood
exactly the same mechanisms that means
that for both you will have a form group
representing the form and you will have
form controls representing the
individual controls so under the hood
they work exactly the same way this also
means that there is nothing that you can
do with template driven forums that you
could not do with model driven forums
and vice versa but we can see that
certain features are really simple to
implement using model driven forms
things like autosave complex interval
validations those come much more natural
using model driven forms I hope this has
helped you decide which type of forms to
for your application in the next lesson
we are going to see both form types in
action in the exercise of the forum's
course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
