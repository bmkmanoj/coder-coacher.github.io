from the angular University we're going
to dive straight into the angularfire
library which is observables based we're
going to start by the first concept of
the library how to query lists in
firebase it's coming right up so far we
have been using the firebase SDK
directly using its firebase typescript
definitions what we're going to do now
is we are going to use the angularfire
library instead in order to interact
with firebase and we are going to see
the advantages of doing so in a moment
first let's just install the angularfire
library in order to use angular fire we
need to install the angular fire module
in the imports of our application so
let's just do that let's just import it
and we need to call initialize app and
we need to pass it in the firebase
configuration that I have put here in an
external file so firebase atrophic the
TS contains the configuration for
accessing firebase with this our angular
fire module is installed let's now use
the angular fire module to do our first
query what we are going to implement
with angular fire is the equivalent of
what you see here so this is just a
plain query to the courses node where we
are going to print all the courses to
the screen we are going to implement the
same thing with angular fire so for that
let's simply inject here angular fire in
the constructor of our class we don't
need to initialize the application
anymore because it's already initialized
so let's just delete this what we're
going to do is we're going to use
angular fire to query the courses node
and retrieve its contents so take a look
with typescript with auto-completion you
can see here that the angular fire
injectable has either a database or off
properties so we can access the
we want to query the database you know
we have two options either list or
object let's do list for the moment I'm
going to explain the difference between
both in a second so let's just query
courses now what do we get back from
this function call this is actually a
firebase list observable so this is an
observable let's assign it to a variable
so let's call it courses and we're going
to add a dollar at the end of it to mean
that it's an observable the type of this
variable is implicit but let's make it
explicit just to confirm the actual type
so let's make it a firebase and we have
here list observable as you can see
there aren't any compilation errors so
this is the correct type that we are
retrieving from the list call now let's
have a look at what we have here
available in this type so we have a
series of methods that we will be using
throughout the course right now take a
look we have a subscribed method this is
indeed an observable so let's subscribe
to it and simply output its value to the
screen to see what we get let's just do
a console that log of the value and
let's try it out
one thing to bear in mind is that the
firebase list observable is a generic
type so we need to pass in here so it's
an observable but what is the value that
the observable returns and that is the
meaning of the type so for the moment
let's specify it as being any let's see
what we get in the console so if we
refresh the application we can see that
we get here an array so take a look this
is a list call so it makes sense that it
returns an array so what are the
elements of the array let's compare it
to the content of the database so the
first element is a key take a look it
ends it with M underscore M underscore
so it's discourse here right angular to
tutorial for beginners it does match the
same course and the second key is for D
which
corresponds to the second element of the
array which is the angular to http and
services course so notice that under the
variable dollar key we do have the value
of the key of the list item that we just
queried and the other properties are the
values now take a look at this we are
going to clear the console remember we
have subscribed to an observable so what
will happen if we modify anything under
these note courses let's for example
modify here the description of this
course let's add a string to it let's
click enter we have received here in the
console and new value so the
subscription for that observable is not
canceled it's still active so any
modification on the database we have
here the new value that is available
with the string test so the subscription
is still active we are continuously
receiving from the real-time database
any new value if we do any modification
to any node that is below courses let's
do for example here a modification of
the description of the second course
this also triggers here a new value so
we can see here again the string test
but this time in the angular 2 HTTP and
services course so this is a very
important notion with this we can see
that the angularfire library is
completely based around the notion of
observables so the API calls returned
observables and we subscribe to them to
get the contents of parks of the
real-time database we are going to see
that the observable API is really a
great way of modeling a real time
database a real time database can really
be seen as simply a stream of values
over time by the way one interesting
thing what we are doing here is we're
passing to the first argument of
subscribe a function that takes as
argument a value and console logs the
value itself
so what we need is a function with one
argument that outputs the value to the
screen this is actually equivalent to
simply doing subscribe console that log
so we are passing a reference to the
console dot log function so this also
works and it's a little bit simpler to
read so as you can see observables are a
really great API solution for
interacting with something like a real
time database if we would be using
promises they get resolved and they only
return one value that is inherently not
what we are looking for while
interacting with the real time database
the real time database we are
interesting in subscribing to it and
receiving multiple values as they evolve
over time
we are going to see how to take only the
first value if that's what we need for
our application right now let's go to
the second primitive of angularfire
how to lower the objects it's coming
right up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
