lesson we are going to be adding to our
application role-based access control
authorization in other words we are
going to allow different users to have
different roles and access different
features of the application for example
an admin user is going to have access to
a very powerful admin level feature that
allows him to log in on behalf of
another user a normal user will simply
have access to the lessons data the
first thing that we want to do is we
want to associate to a given user a list
of roles and that's what we are doing
here at the level of the database let's
see for example here the two users that
we have here previously configured as we
can see these users have a different set
of roles
let's start with the case of a normal
user student at gmail.com that has the
role student this user can access the
lessons screen but this user should not
access here the admin screen not only it
should not be able to see it here at the
level of the top menu but it should not
access it by typing it into the URL and
it should not be able to do these login
as user requests to the back-end and
impersonate any other user at different
moments in the course we are going to be
logging in with this user so the email
for logging in is student at Gmail at
home which is prefilled in here in this
screen for example and the password is
going to be password 10 with a capital P
that's also prefilled in here at the
level of the login screen now there is a
second user that is pre-configured here
in our in memory database this is going
to be the admin at gmail.com user and if
we have a look here at the roles of this
user we can see that not only this user
can access here the lessons data but it
also has the admin role so this user
should be able to see the screen and it
should be able to login
impersonating other users now that we
are familiar with these two users let's
talk a bit about architecture let's see
how we are going to integrate our air
back authorization solution into the
JSON web tokens based authentication
solution that we also have here running
in this sample application this data
that Associates a user to a given list
of roles only needs to exist in the
server that is creating the new JSON web
tokens so only the authentication server
which is issuing new tokens needs to
have access to this data there is no
need for the application to have in its
database a list of roles associating
them to a given user
this is security related data so it's
best to keep this data together with the
passwords in the centralized
authentication and authorization server
so how will the application know which
roles does the user have that link
between the user and a list of roles is
a security claim so the best way to put
that information is in the JSON web
token payload and that's what we will be
doing in our implementation let's have a
look here at the login route the login
route is issuing a new JSON web token
let's have a look at its implementation
this is similar to what we have
implemented before we are taking the
user and password and we are building
here a response in that response we are
going to be creating a session token
that session token for the moment if we
go over to this function create session
token which is in the security dot utils
file we are going to see that we are
signing a JSON web token using the RS
256 algorithm and we are providing here
the subject but we have not providing
here extra properties in the payload of
this JSON web token we are about to do
so now we are going to pass in here an
extra property called roles and inside
these roles property we are going to be
passing in an array containing the user
role
which are available here at the level of
this database so in order to add the
roles to the JSON web token we are
simply going to add here user dot roles
let's see this in action with our two
predefined users so we're going to
refresh the application and let's for
example log in using the student at
gmail.com email so we are going to type
it in here on the login box and then we
are going to log in and extract the JSON
web token let's hit login we are going
to go over here to our application and
here at the level of the session ID we
are going to take the value of the JSON
web token and we are going to copy paste
it here to JWT dot IO if we do so we are
going to see that here at the level of
the payload we indeed have here a
property which is an array of roles and
this user has the role student this
means that all the security information
about user namely its identity and its
list of roles
everything is here present in the JSON
web token and this information has been
signed by the authentication server this
means that the receiving application
server in order to know which roles does
the current user have it only needs to
inspect the token itself so again the
application server can remain completely
stateless it does not have to have the
information about the roles of a given
user and it does not have to query a
separate server in order to obtain that
information everything is present in the
JSON web token and it's signed by the
issuing server that created the token
with is in place our application server
will have all the necessary information
to really confirm that the user that is
doing this request indeed can perform
this action it does have the admin role
now that we have the list of roles of
each user in the JSON web token and we
have the JSON web token already being
forwarded automatically to the back-end
by our authentication solution
let's then switch to the back end and
see how we are going to use the roll
information of each user to block or
allow access to certain back-end
services such as for example the login
as user service that we are about to
implement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
