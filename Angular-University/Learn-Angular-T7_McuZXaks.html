from the angular University and in this
lesson we are going to build our first
angular 2 application from scratch so
let's get started the first thing that
we need to do is define our route
component let's define a class named app
this will be the entry point of our
application we need to annotate it with
the add component annotation and inside
the add component annotation we need to
pass in a JavaScript object that
contains two mandatory properties one is
a selector so this is a CSS selector
that will define to which HTML elements
in the page this component gets applied
to we are going to give an example of
such a component in a second the second
mandatory property is the template
property we need we need to specify the
template or a template URL we will see
that in a future lesson right now let's
define an inline template which simply
prints a message to the screen saying
hello world how can we use this
component that we just created what does
this look like in terms of HTML if we
see here the HTML of this page we are
going to add to this page a custom HTML
element named app which angular will
associate via the app selector to our
component and so it will replace the
content of this custom app tag by the
message hello world and this is one of
the most powerful features of angular 2
we can create our own custom HTML
elements what we need to do now is to
start our angular 2 application we need
to bootstrap it to use the frameworks
terminology so to do that we have
several ways of doing it the recommended
way of doing it in development mode is
to use the platform browser dynamic
bootstrap module method so what this
x is an angular 2 module definition
which will be used to bootstrap the
application so what is an angular 2
module we are going to go into modules
in detail later in this course right now
for us it's enough to know that the
module is a way of grouping relative
angular 2 functionality will bring
related components directives pipes and
services in a single logical unit our
application has one root module let's
write it so we just need to define a
class that by convention should be
called app module and we are going to
apply it the at ng module annotation
inside it we are going to pass it a
configuration object in this
configuration object we need to define
which components this module recognizes
and we are going to add in of course our
app component the root component of our
application we also should specify which
is the entry point of the application
because we could have many components
that are recognized by this module but
we haven't told angular what is the
entry point of our application in this
case we are going to configure it via
the bootstrap property and we are going
to say that our route component is the
app component so we pass in this module
to our bootstrap call and we should have
a running application right let's give
it a try if we now try this out we can
see that we have here an error in the
console why is that that's because we
have not imported the browser module
that contains all the core angular 2
directives and much more if you are
developing a web application that is
going to run in a browser we should
import the browser module if we are
running in other environments such as
for example native mobile we will have
another module that would replace the
browser module
for the moment let's improve it and see
what happens if we now try this out we
can see that our first angular 2
application is up and running rice each
angular 2 application is a tree of
components and there is usually only one
root component we need to specify a root
bootstrap module that we need to pass to
our bootstrap function this module will
declare which components this
application recognizes what are the
components that make up this application
what we do here is we can import them
one by one in the declarations property
or we can import them together with
directives and pipes and services as
groups of related functionality enabled
modules and we can import modules in the
imports property of the module
declaration if we are building a web
application we need to import browser
module in a root component only we
should not import it elsewhere in the
application we need to tell the
application what is its entry point
there could be several actually notice
that the bootstrap property is an array
but in most cases there is only one
entry point for the application the root
component what we're going to do now is
we are going to write our first nan rout
component we are going to add a visual
component to our application it's coming
right up in the next lesson hello
everyone how's it going it's Vasco from
the angular university and in this
lesson we are going to write our first
angular 2 component let's build a very
simple widget a search box widget which
contains an input box and next to it we
have a button to clear the input box so
let's get started what we really want to
do is we want to define an extra HTML
element to the standard HTML elements
that the page might have we want to
create the search
dash box HTML element and we want to be
able to use it in our application just
like it was a normal HTML element so how
can we do this we define an angular 2
component we define a class let's name
it simply search box we are going to
annotate it with the add component
annotation again this tells angular that
this is a component inside the
configuration object we are going to
define a selector the selector needs to
match the HTML element name that we are
going to use in this case search dash
box so by convention the CSS selector
that we apply here in a component should
be an element selector we should not for
example use property selectors here what
we need to do also is to define a
template for the component what will the
component look like visually on screen a
component night used other components in
this case we were just going to have the
input box to the component and next week
we are going to add simply a clear
button and there we have it we have a
very simple component defined in the
upcoming lessons we are going to see how
to add behavior to this component but
right now we just want this HTML to be
displayed on the screen in place of the
search dash box component HTML tag to do
that what we can do is we can try to run
the application like this what will
happen is that nothing will be displayed
this is because the application is not
aware of the search dash box component
nowhere in our application we have
configured this component we need to do
so by adding it to the module definition
of our application in this case because
we only have one component for the
moment we are simply going to add it
directly in the declarations property of
our route module if we try to use this
component again if you reload the page
we can see that our component is now
working in the next few lessons we are
going to have behaved
here to this component namely we are
going to pass it inputs and we are going
to receive outputs out of it so stay
tuned because it's coming right up
welcome to a lesson of Y angular
University in this lesson we are going
to learn about component inputs if you
already know component inputs in the end
of this lesson I'm going to share a way
of abbreviating certain situations where
we are passing input to a component so
you might not be aware of that so let's
start with a simple example straight
away this is a search box component as
an input box and a clear button now
let's say that we want our placeholder
text we would like this not to be
constant but we would like to take it
from a variable that is part of our
search box component class let's do that
let's define a variable let's call it
text and we are going to assign it the
text that we want now how do we output
this to the component template we are
going to use the interpolation syntax
that we are going to cover in more
detail in a future lesson right now we
are just going to output the value of a
string into the template this durable
curly brace expression is an
interpolation expression so the devil
curly brace is recognized by angular and
tells it that the content inside the
double curly brace is an expression that
angular should evaluate by taking as
context the component itself so if we
inside double curly braces we output
text that will be taken from the search
box component let's try this out if we
now reload the page we can see that the
placeholder is type your search as
expected now we would like to take this
one step further we would like to make
the placeholder text configurable by any
other component that is using the search
box component for that we need to make
the variable text an input of the
component
you can do so by annotating it with the
ad input annotation and notice the
parenthesis at the end of the annotation
without this the annotation will not
work now one thing we don't want the
input that is passed to the component to
be named text that's just an internal
name for an internal variable we want
the input to be named placeholder like
the standard HTML attribute so now how
do we use this input how do we pass in
an input to component so we go to the
component that is using search box in
this case our route component and we are
going to pass it in a placeholder input
variable we do so with the angle
brackets template syntax notation this
is the template syntax notation for
inputs in angular 2 components we are
going to pass into the input variable
placeholder we're going to pass it in a
string the goal is that this drink
overrides the default value of the text
property inside the search box component
so let's try this out to see if this
works as we can see we have custom
placeholder displayed correctly as
expected so the input property is
working now you might think that this is
a very common use case to pass a
constant string as an input yes it's
true that in certain situations this
might be a dynamic property but in this
case let's say that it will always be
constant in that case this syntax that
we have here is slightly verbals for
this particular case where we are
passing in a constant string to an input
property we have an abbreviated notation
syntax that we mentioned in the
beginning of the lesson if you remove
the quotes around the strings and if we
remove the square brackets these will
still work so let's give it a try as we
can see everything is still working and
this looks like just a plain HTML
attribute this is much more readable it
actually looks like a plain HTML
attribute which is also
more intuitive for someone looking at
the template what we're going to do now
is we are going to add behavior to this
component we are going to when the user
clicks the clear button we are going to
clear the input box so we are going to
learn the template syntax for events in
the next lesson which is coming right up
hello everyone and welcome this is Vasco
welcome to the angular diversity in this
lesson we are going to learn about
component events and event emitters so
let's get started what we're going to do
here is we're going to take this simple
component which is the search box
component which has an input and a clear
button we are going to implement the
clear button behavior so what we want to
do is whenever we type on the input
search box when we click clear the clear
button the input box should be cleared
so how do we handle this let's use the
events template syntax for this so what
we want to do here is in the element
where the cliq occurs so the button we
are going to add a click handler and we
are going to use the rounded parenthesis
or normal parentheses for this this is
the template syntax for events in
angular 2 both browser events and custom
events as we will see in a moment now
inside the rounded braces we are going
to type the in this case browser event
to which we want to respond to in this
case the click event on the right hand
side we are going to define how this
event should be handled in this case we
want to call the clear component method
let's implement this method by simply
adding a call to log to the console
let's try this out if we now type in
something and we click the clear button
we can see that our statement is locked
to the console as expected now let's
talk about how could we implement the
clear behavior well one way to do it
let's do it first in plain JavaScript so
let's select using
chrome devtools we are going to right
click on input box and we're going to
inspect it in the HTML panel if we now
switch back to the console the dollar
zero variable contains the last element
that was clicked while inspecting this
on the dev tools so in this case dollar
0 is the Dom element of the input box
how can we clear this we can clear it by
assigning it a value of an empty string
for example so if we do dollar zero dot
value equals empty string this is an
example of how to clear the input box so
let's implement this in angular 2 let's
now implement the clear behavior so what
we want to do here is we want to
introduce a new concept besides events
we want to introduce the concept of
references so we can assign a template
reference using the hash character and
we are going to give it a name to the
input box we are going to call it hash
input so whenever inside the template we
refer to input we are referring to the
Dom element of the input text box so now
we can pass it in as a parameter inside
the clear method for example now what
you can do inside the clear method is we
simply assign it a value of an empty
string and this will clear the input box
let's try this out if we now type in the
input box and we hit the clear button we
can see that the input box is being
cleared as expected now we have seen how
to use the template syntax for events in
an upcoming lesson we're going to see
how the same syntax can be applied to
custom events we will first learn how to
externalize the templates of our
components and how to apply CSS styles
to our components then we are going to
tie everything together in a more
complex introduction to components
example where we are going to have
multiple components interacting with
each other and using custom events using
event emitter so stay tuned
all of these is coming right up in the
next lesson hello everyone and welcome
this is Vasco from the angular
University and in this lesson we are
going to learn how to externalize
component templates in an external file
we are going to learn the best practices
recommended by the official style guide
for that so let's get started we have
here a very simple component with an
inline template define using the
template property in the component
annotation defining templates in line
it's usually okay when we are trying out
something or maybe if your component is
a very small component but in general we
really want to separate the template
into an external HTML file so let's do
that let's extract the HTML template
from the component and let's create an
external file which has the same name as
the component file itself except it has
a different HTML extension we just copy
paste inside this file the template
enough and now we just need to apply it
to the component to do so we go back to
the component file and instead of using
template the inline template we are
going to use the template URL property
as we put the template in the same
folder as the component itself we just
have to type in here the file name of
the template this will work just like
this transparently if you are using for
example the latest angular CLI if that's
not the case then you really have to
give angular some more information on
how to find the template file if you are
using a common J's compatible module
loader like for example system GS you
will have available at runtime a
variable named module you can take it
and use module ID pass it to the
component via the module ID property and
angular will know how to find the
template to avoid typescript errors you
need to declare the module variable
again if you are using the CLI you don't
need this module dot ID variable so it's
one of the many advantages of using the
CLI so these covers how to handle HTML
templates in our components let's now
see how can we add styles to a component
and what is the big advantage of doing
it the angular 2 way stay tuned it's
coming right up welcome this is vasco
from the angular university and in this
lesson we are going to learn how to
style angular 2 components we are going
to learn what is the big advantage of
styling components the angular 2 way we
could always tell a component by adding
simply a link tag to our HTML page that
would work perfectly with angular 2
without any problem but angular 2
introduces a new improved way of doing
CSS let's have a look at it the way that
this works is in each component we can
define styles that are specific to the
component so we have a Styles property
that takes on an array this is an array
of strings each string is just an
extract of CSS so let's just add some
CSS to this component we adhered some
CSS as part of this Styles array and we
refresh the page we can see that the CSS
got applied to the component but let's
have a closer look to see how this was
done the styles were actually added as a
style tag in the head of the page we can
see here that the styles are applied to
the component but notice this property
with a randomly generated name that gets
associated to the component all the
Styles reference this attribute here
this means that these tiles have a very
high degree of specificity because they
all have an attribute in it these causes
these tiles to take precedence over
almost any style that you might want to
apply in a page compared to the
specificity of most commonly used
libraries like
in bootstrap etc these Styles would take
precedence so this is mechanism is a way
of partial style isolation we can define
styles that in the vast majority of
cases will take precedence over any
other style on the page but the
component is not really fully isolated
from a style point of view is still
inheriting for example fonts from the
main page if you are building an angular
2 component it's better to use the
Styles property to define the CSS of the
component this means that for one the
styles of the component are guaranteed
to not interfere with the styles in the
remaining of the page because they are
based on this randomly generated
property also it's much less likely that
styles on the page will override this
style meaning that the component will be
reusable in a larger number of situation
we can also define CSS styles in
external files in a very similar way to
how we did it with templates we simply
create an external file which has the
same name as the component file but a
different extension in this case CSS
what we're going to do is we're going to
copy the CSS inside the file and we are
going to add this file associating it to
the to the component why the Styles URLs
property notice that this is an array so
you can pass in several CSS files in
here so we now have some basic notions
of how to set up a component we can
define its template we can define its
styles and we can define the component
class what we are going to do now is we
are going to tie all these concepts
together together with the notion of
inputs and outputs of components we are
going to build a more complex example
where several components interact with
each other it's coming right up in the
next lesson
hello everyone and welcome miss Vasco
from the angular University and in this
lesson we are going to go through a more
complex example of how to build
components we are going to build
multiple components and we're going to
make them interact we are going to build
custom component events so let's get
started by doing a demo of the final
result so this is the final result you
have here a couple of components one is
a color picker where you can click in
one of the red or blue sections and the
color will be chosen the color is
applied to the title pick a color but
it's also passed as an event to another
component that is interested in
receiving that event which is the color
previewer so if we click in one or the
other color the color previewer will
update its color accordingly so let's
get started by building this example
let's start by building the color picker
component let's start by defining a
class color picker and we are going to
define a selector which is color dash
picker we're going to define a template
that for the moment has only some static
HTML on it so we are going to create a
div with a class color picker and we are
going to add the two divs for the color
samples let's now try this initial
version of this component which
currently does not have behavior we are
going to add the color picker component
to the list of declarations of the root
module / application and we're going to
use the new color dash picker HTML
element in the template of our main
application if we try this out we can
see that the template is being applied
correctly what we want to do now is to
implement the color picker component so
we are going to add it a color variable
which contains the color that was just
selected we are going to make it an
input of the component using the add
input annotation next what we want to do
is we want to use this variable to color
the title of the
colorpicker for this we are going to use
the ng style directive and we will be
covering this directive in detail in a
future lesson but right now we are
simply going to use it to determine the
color of the title here we pass to ng
style a JavaScript object it has one
property named color the value of that
property is the value of the color
variable of our component let's try this
out to see if this is working so if we
pass into the color picker component we
pass it in a variable color with value
red we would expect the title to become
red let's quickly try this out so as we
can see everything is working as we
would expect let's now implement the
behavior part of color picker so
whenever we click in one of the divs we
want to emit an event saying which color
was chosen so how can we do that the
first thing that we need to do is we
need to detect a click event in one of
the divs and we do so with the template
syntax for events with normal braces so
we detect a click on a div and we are
going to call a component method named
shoes now we are going to pass it in the
color that was chosen we have here the
to CSS colors that are available defined
in this constants file let's then use
these two constants to implement the
shoes behavior so what we're going to do
is whenever choose this trigger we're
going to pass in the color that was just
chosen now inside the choose method what
we're going to do is we are going to
omit the shows and color as a custom
event to the outside world to any users
of this component so to do this we need
to create a component event emitter we
do that with the event emitter class we
create a new instance of it and we are
going to assign it to a variable named
color output in order to trigger a
custom event we just need to call emit
on the event emitter and pass it in the
value that we want to omit which is the
new
there is one final thing that we need to
keep in mind to the users of this event
we don't want them to subscribe to the
color output event that's the name of an
internal variable we want the
subscribers of this event to subscribe
to the color event and that's why we
need to put color as a string inside the
ad output annotation let's now subscribe
to the color event so we do so by using
the same syntax that we have used to
subscribe to standard Dom events such as
click when a new event occurs of type
color we are going to call on color
component function and we're going to
pass it in the color that was just
chosen this value is available via the
dollar event angular 2 template variable
if we use this variable we can print to
the console the color that was just
chosen let's try this out so if we click
here in a color sample and we see what's
in the console we can see that the color
was outputted as expected let's now
implement a second behavior of this
component interaction example the reset
button so whenever we click this reset
button we want the color to be reset it
for example to black so how can we
implement this let's start by
implementing a reset functionality in at
the level of the color picker component
so if reset publicly available method is
called we are going to omit the color
black now how can we use this in our
main component we can create a reference
a template reference to the color picker
with hash picker so because these
reference is applied to an element which
is not a standard Dom element such as a
div for example the reference will
become the angular 2 component itself so
we can use the reference on the click
handler of reset to call directly the
component reset method if we now try
this out we can see that whenever we
click on reset black gets applied to the
peaker as expected let's now implement
the last component of this example and
we're going to see an interesting way of
making components interact take a look
at this we're going to implement the
color previewer component this is a very
simple component that takes as input one
color a color variable and we are going
to simply use that variable to output it
to text title like before we are going
to apply the color by using the edgy
style Corps directive we now need to
apply the color previewer component and
add it to the module of our application
in order to be able to use it in our
application templates let's quickly try
out this new component see how it works
so if we add it to the template using
the color dash previewer HTML element we
can pass it in for example a constant
color of red let's see if this is
working so if we try this out we can see
that the color previewer is working as
expected what we want to do now is we
want to make the two components interact
so whenever a color is chosen in the
picker we want to apply it to the
previewer a first way of doing this and
we're going to see a better way in a
second first way of doing this is taking
the color output that comes from the
output event and we are going to assign
it to a variable and then we pass on
this variable as an input for the color
preview there is actually a better and
maybe more declarative way of doing this
let's have a look if instead of storing
the output of the event in a local
variable we instead create a reference
to the previewer using hash previewer
what we can do is we can pass in the
output of the event of the picker
directly to the preview were with this
we no longer need the color variable
actually so we can remove it and we have
here a more declarative implementation
so we need to strike a balance here
there's more logic in the template but
at the same time we have not created
variables that can be mutated and could
be
potential source of air so depending on
the concrete case you might want to
apply this technique or not and so there
we have it this is the basis of angular
2 components by using a set of simple
concepts like component inputs outputs
custom events template references we are
already in position to create a wide
variety of angular 2 components let's
try this out with an exercise in the
next lesson hello how's it going it's
Vasco from the angular University and in
this lesson we are going to learn how to
build our own custom angular 2 directive
it's coming right up so you might have
noticed while coding in plain HTML that
there are certain attributes that we add
two elements that add or remove existing
functionality to those elements such as
for example the required attribute that
marks an input field as mandatory in a
form in this lesson we are going to
learn how to build such a custom
directive again extending the standard
functionality of plain HTML with our own
custom functionality this is what
angular allow us to do the custom
attribute directive that we are about to
create is the collapse on click
directive whenever we apply it to an
element on the page that element once
it's clicked will disappear from the
screen so this is just an example and
the directive can be applied to any
element on the page including to angular
2 components directive in angular is
simply a plain JavaScript class
annotated with the earth directive
decorator in there we're going to pass
it a selector and notice the square
bracket this means that the directive
should be applied to any HTML element on
the page that has a collapse on click
attribute it is a best practice in the
case of attribute directives to always
use attribute selectors instead of for
example
element selectors like we do so for the
case of components please be sure to
check the end of this section for the
exercise where we're going to present an
implementation of collapsible that uses
more features right now we are simply
going to define a CSS selector that says
the following any collapsible section
inside the collapsed element should not
be displayed on the screen so display
none be sure to check the section on
Angie if so this directive will work in
the following way we need to detect
clicks on the element on which the
directive is applied to and that is
known as its host element the directives
host element in this case its dis div
with the CSS classes of card and card
strong next what we want to do is
whenever that click occurs we want to
add or remove a collapsed class to the
host element and that will trigger the
appearance or disappearance of the
collapsible panel let's see how to do
this let's first create a is collapsed
private variable in the collapse on
clicks directive and what we're going to
do is whenever a click event occurs in
the host element so we are going to use
the add host listener decorator to
detect events in the host element
whenever I click occurs we are going to
toggle the value of the private variable
is collapsed which has a default initial
value of false what we want to do now is
add the collapsed CSS class to the host
element depending on the value of the is
collapsed private variable for that we
are going to use the host binding
decorator the host binding decorator
allow us to write two properties of the
host element so in this case what we
want to do is we want to set the
property class collapsed in case that
the property is collapsed of the
directive is set to true so let's now
see our first custom directive in action
for the first time if we now inspect the
HTML we can see that for
when we click on the this page section
is collapsible text whenever we click on
it the CSS class collapsed is either
added or removed from the host element
where the directive was applied as you
can see directives have the potential of
giving us more usable functionality
compared two components any
functionality that we add in a directive
we can add potentially to any component
but directives are really not that
different from components let's have a
look why in the next section hello how's
it going Vasco here from the angular
University this lesson we're going to
learn how to do our first HTTP call in
our lesson service so coming right up
take a look at this version of lesson
service it's still retrieving the
lessons data from a variable in memory
what we're going to do is we're going to
fetch this data from the back end via an
HTTP call a get call for that let's
inject the standard HTTP angular 2
service so this is a service that comes
together with angular we're going to use
it to do a get call using this HTTP GET
will pass in the URL that we want to hit
on the servers in this case / lessons
and let's have a look at the server the
server is just a simple Express server
for testing purposes for demo purposes i
will show you in upcoming lesson how to
set up such a server take a look once
the server gets a get so get lessons is
going to return a JSON object that
contains the lessons data take a look
the lessons data is still the same data
that we saw before but right now it's
going to be served by our back-end in
order to get back the result from the
back end we need to subscribe to the
output of the get method the output of
get is an RX jes observable and we are
going to go in detail on what that is
and how to use it right now we are going
to subscribe to the
put of get and we are going to pass it a
function so this function has one
argument lessons data which is the data
that came from the back end and on the
body of the function we have only one
line where we are going to take the
result that came from the back end so
lessons data and we're going to assign
it to the service lessons variable
notice that we are getting here an error
and this is because what we received
from the gate call is not immediately
what we sent as response from the back
end what we get is a response object
that has other information other than
the data so what we need to do is using
the map or xjs operator we need to
transform the response into only the
data so we do that by calling map and
then response dot Jason these will
transform the response into the output
of response not Jason and like that in
our subscriber method we receive only
the data the lessons note that the HTTP
service like the lesson service needs to
be provided at the bootstrap call of the
application so that it's available for
dependency injection so in this case we
are going to pass in HTTP providers to
the bootstrap call without this the HTTP
service will not be available at runtime
and you will get an error let's now see
all of this in action if we reload the
application we can see that all the data
is still there and if we open the
network panel of our developer tools we
can see that an HTTP request was done
and that will receive the data from the
back end next what we're going to do is
we're going to save some data to the
server using angular 2 HTTP and add that
to our service in the following lesson
coming right up
hello everyone how's it going it's Vasco
from the angular and diversity in this
lesson we are going to set up the
angular 2 router and we are going to
avoid a couple of huge pitfalls from the
beginning to give you an optimal angler
to router learning experience it's
coming right up when setting up the
router the first thing that you want to
define is your base path you can do that
using the html5 based HTML tag and you
should point it to the entry point of
your application so in this case we are
pointing to this particular folder most
of the cases you will have a base of /
meaning it's the entry point of the
server in order to be able to use the
router the first thing that we need to
do is to set it up in our application
because it's not included by default in
angular so in order to do so we need to
go to the root module of our application
the app module and we need to import the
router module but we should not simply
import it we should call this method for
root and pass it in the router
configuration we are going to understand
why this for root method is necessary in
our lazy loading and shared modules
lesson right now this is the
configuration that we need to get things
started when configuring the router what
we are doing is depending on how the URL
changes certain sections of the page
will display a certain content we call
those sections outlets we are going to
define here the primary outlet of the
angular 2 router this means that in this
section of the page the content of this
tag will be replaced by a certain
component depending on the state of the
URL which sections of the page
correspond to which URLs that's where
the router configuration comes in let's
set up our router configuration so it's
just an array of route objects and each
one must define a path so in this case
we want a certain component to display
when we navigate
to home and we are going to display the
home component if you now try to access
the root URL / application we're going
to get an error but this is normal
because we only configure the path to
home not a path to the root folder so we
would think that if we add home to the
URL and we hit refresh to a low the
application that this would work but we
get a different error we get a 404 not
found from the server this is a very
common situation for someone just
starting with the router and it's the
main pitfall that we mentioned in the
beginning of this lesson how to fix this
and what's going on exactly here so
what's going on is that when we modify
the URL and we hit enter we are actually
triggering a full page reload from the
server so we are not modified the URL
using the history API when we modify the
URL manually and we hit enter this is
going to trigger a request to the server
to lower the file named home without an
extension this file does not exist so we
get back a 404 to avoid this problem
what we need to do is to configure our
server so that any and matched requests
will return the index dot HTML file that
contains our single page application so
/home should return this as the HTTP
response the index dot HTML file then
angular will bootstrap itself the router
will kick in inspect the URL and take us
to the homepath let's apply this logic
to our concrete case of our node GS
Express server so we simply need to
create an Express middleware that
redirects us to the index dot HTML file
if the request was not matched by any of
the previous routes that we configured
we will see in a second a better way of
doing this but let's try this out so if
we type in here and unmatched path we
get redirected to index dot HTML and
this file contains our single page
application our application kicks in and
angular takes over from there but this
situation is not
because we created a redirect there's a
better way which is to configure the
server to do instead of a redirect to
return directly the index dot HTML file
so if we do that in express using
response not send file we are going to
get back directly index dot HTML which
is our single page application angular 2
kicks in the Rueter kicks in and notices
I should be displaying / home so it's
going to look up the router
configuration to see which component
corresponds to slash home and it's going
to display the home component I really
advise you to configure your server this
way from the beginning in order to get a
good development experience with the
router otherwise you will just get 40
for all the time and with this you are
all set up to further explore the router
we are going to explore shall routes
auxiliary routes and we are going to
explain why does that contribute for a
much better user experience and allows
to more easily build much more modern
and dynamic applications so let's
continue our deep dive in the router
next step router navigation hello
everyone and welcome this is vasco from
the angular diversity and in this lesson
we are going to learn about angular 2
child routes as part of our router cords
so let's get started shall rods allow us
to navigate deeper into our application
the key thing to realize about shell
rods is that only one shell drought can
be active at a time and this might sound
familiar to you take a look at these
free top-level route so home courses and
lessons also these free routes are only
active one at a time so we could also
see our application as having one main
entry route let's say the empty path
route and that empty route has free
child routes each can only be active
once at a time so this would be an
alternative way of configuring our
application let's try this new config
duration so as you can see the
application still works exactly as
before let's now give a more common
example of the use of a shell drought
let's say for example the route courses
typically we would want a shelter out of
it to show the details of a given course
so in the URL we will type / courses /
one or two so we will type the ID of the
course something that uniquely
identifies the course let's configure
this we can actually configure something
similar to this scenario even without
using shell routes so let's for example
configure a route course notice that its
course and not courses course / colon ID
and then we map it to course detail to
the course detail component let's try
this out if we now type / course / and
then a number let's say that's the idea
of a course we can see that the course
detail component is being displayed to
the user another way of doing this
configuration is via the use of shell
routes so under the path courses we
typically have the root path where we
have the list of courses and then we
have a shell route with the detail of
each course well we only want either the
summary route or the detail route to be
active at each time and never both so
this is the ideal scenario for using a
shell road for this let's make courses a
component less route this means that the
route is there for routing matching
purposes but the route itself does not
instantiate a component now we are going
to configure to shell routes for the
courses route the empty path route which
corresponds to the courses component the
component that shows the list of courses
and the path with the ID of the course
this corresponds to the course detail
again only one of these two will be
active at a given time let's try this
out if we reload the application and go
to the path courses we still have the
courses list being lowered as expected
and now if we type manually in the URL
courses
and then we give it an ID we are going
to be forwarded to the course detail
route like we expected you might have
noticed that this file is starting to
contain a lot of routing configuration
so it's a best practice to split the
router configuration across multiple
files so let's create a new routing of
Eurasian file courses router config and
we are going to cop it in the definition
of all the routes that relate to courses
we are then going to import it in the
main configuration file and we are going
to include it by using the array spread
operator we are getting deeper into
routing and this is only the beginning
so be sure to watch the following
lessons for learning what is an
auxiliary route and we are going to do
by exercise at the end of the course
where we are going to build a complete
dashboard so stay tuned for the upcoming
lessons hello everyone and welcome to
our angular to form scores I'm Vasco
from the angular university and in this
lesson we are going to start by learning
why do we need a full framework module
for doing something apparently as simple
as forums well the main reason is forms
are really not that simple forms can be
a very complex part of our application
especially if there is a very large
amount of fields if the forum's spend
several tabs if there are editable parts
of the form that can be edited via a
dialog forms can be very complex there
can be a lot of business validation
rules interdependent validations
depending on multiple fields of the form
you could have a whole tab in error
could have multiple fields that are
related in error angular 2 helps us deal
with all that it helps us extract the
data from the form in a simplified wait
so you will never have to write code
that gets the data from the form and
populates an object that's done for you
also an
or two helps us dealing with validating
the form showing proper error messages
to the user clearly identifying which
parts of the form need to be edited
that's the big added value of the forms
module not every form is that complex
take a look at this example where we are
creating a lesson in the course so we
are going to put the title the duration
and we're going to put the level either
beginning or advanced and then we click
on a button create lesson now what we
want to do in this form is we want to
extract the data that the user types in
from the form let's start with that that
is called data binding let's configure
this in a template driven way this is
the closest that you can get in angular
2 to the angular 1 way if you are
familiar with angular 1 if you are not
familiar with angular 1 don't worry
we're going to explain now data binding
for this simple form what we want to do
here is we want to synchronize
continuously the content of the form we
want to bind it to this lesson object
this lesson object is an instance of the
lesson class which has these properties
take a look at the type annotations in
the constructor these are actually
optional because we are specifying
default values for each constructor
parameter so if we remove the type
annotations we still have type safety in
this program this typescript feature is
known as type inference in order to use
angular 2 forms we need to set them up
because they are not included by default
in angular so in this case we want to
use template driven forms for that we
need to import in this case in our route
module we are going to import the forms
module from the angular / forums barrel
now what we want to do in this form
before using ng model is we want to turn
off certain html5 features that are
owned by default because we don't want
html5 to be handling the
relation of the form we want angular to
do it for that we simply use the no
validate property in the form we also
don't need autocomplete so I'm just
going to turn it off let's also output
the value of the lesson object to the
screen using the JSON pipe so that we
can see be directional binding in action
now let's configure the title field to
be be directionally bound to the lesson
title property for that we are going to
use ng model and we're going to assign
it lesson title this syntax here with
the two parentheses is called the banana
box syntax if we try now this out and we
start typing in the title lesson field
we're going to see that the less an
object is automatically kept in sync
with the content of the input field with
each key up event so this is the ng
model functionality in action we don't
need to call anything for doing data
binding it's done for us automatically
but that is only half the story of
angular to forums data binding let's
inspect the HTML we have here several
state classes valid or it could be
invalid touched pristine ng model is
also helping us validate this form and
we are going to see exactly how to do
validation in the upcoming lessons so
stay tuned welcome its vast go from the
angular University and in this lesson we
are going to start learning a completely
different way of making angular 2 forms
model driven or reactive driven forms
why do we need two ways of doing forms
what's the difference when to use each
is coming right up so first let's take
the same form that we did in the
template children forms section it's
just a clean HTML form that you're
looking at we're going to write it in
the model driven way the main difference
towards template driven for
is that in this case we are going to
create the form and its controls
programmatically and then we are going
to bind it to form elements as opposed
to using a set of directives to create
implicitly behind the scenes the form
and its controls for us but enough about
the theory let's see this in practice in
order to be able to use reactive forms
the first thing that we need to do is to
import the reactive forms module into
our application in this case we are
going to import it into the root module
of our demo application now let's create
the form actually let's use the form
group directive to assign to this
element and existing form so we are not
creating it in the template I cannot
stress this enough so in this case my
form is the form associated to this HTML
form all the reactive form directives
start with form so we can see that they
make a consistent group now in our
controller let's define a variable my
form which is of type form group that
represents the forum now let's start our
program and let's see what happens here
we have not initialized the my form
variable so we get an error this is
expected again reactive form directives
bind form elements two variables that we
need to initialize ourselves
programmatically so in this case we need
to initialize my form and we are going
to create a new form group instance we
are going to pass it in for the moment
an empty configuration object let's try
this out again now the error is fixed we
have created our first reactive form now
let's add some controls to the form
before we were doing that using ng model
in this case we are going to use the
form control name directive and we are
going to assign to each form control a
name like the directive says now let's
run this what will happen
try to guess of course we get an error
because again this directive is only
binding to an existing control that we
need to create ourselves so let's do
that let's create free form controls one
for each input field the title the
duration and the description we are
going to create the form controls inside
the configuration object that was passed
on to the form itself so each property
of this object each property name is the
name of the control and the value is the
control itself that we are going to
create with new form control and we are
going to pass to each control its
initial value let's try this out so as
you can see the form controls have been
initialized with the initial value and
we have no errors on the console so
congratulations you have created your
first reactive form why is it called
reactive what's the point what's the
difference we're going to start to
understand that already in the next
lesson where we are going to go over
validation in reactive forums so stay
tuned hello everybody and welcome this
is vasco from the angular university and
in this lesson we are going to learn how
to build custom form control validators
we will start with model-driven forms
and you will be surprised at how simple
it is let's take a look a custom
validator for a model-driven forum is
really just a plain function it's as
simple as that take a look we're going
to create a new validator it's going to
validate the duration field completely
so not only it will validate it see if
there are only numeric fields but we can
only have durations less than 10 let's
say 10 minutes in order to use the
validator we just need to pass it to the
configuration of the form control it's
as simple as that a custom validator
function needs to follow certain
conventions it takes as input the form
control itself so we can access
the valley using control dot value the
function can return several things in
this case we are going to return either
an object or no so if the function does
not find any error it should return no
but if the function does detect an error
it can return an object which contains
the errors that it found and some extra
information so we are going in this case
to return an object which contains a
validate duration object and inside we
are going to set the property value to
false this property is mandatory to
return notice here this Const valid
equals false so this is the result of
the validation itself I'm setting it to
false initially so that the validation
gets triggered I just want to make a
quick test to see if the function is
correctly set up as you can see if we
test this as it is the error is always
being thrown this is a good sign that
the function is at least correctly set
up now let's implement a validation
itself we want to return a valid value
if the control value exists it's a valid
numeric number and it's smaller than 10
let's give this a try to see if it's
working so if we type Valley numeric
values but that are larger than 10 we
still get an error let's try with a
couple of values so values below 10 they
are mark this correct and if we try to
type nandamuri characters we still get
an error so as we can see adding custom
validation to a model-driven form is
really very simple template driven
forums has a bit more to it but we're
going to provide you a nice recipe for
doing it then learning the differences
between the two modes when to use each
and our exercise that it's coming right
