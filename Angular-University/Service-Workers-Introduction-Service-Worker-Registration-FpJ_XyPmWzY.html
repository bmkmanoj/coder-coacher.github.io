section of the course we are going to do
a deep dive on service workers we are
going to add an offline page to a sample
web application and we are going to add
download and installation and version
management capabilities to that same
application that we have running here in
production in the second part of this
course we are going to be using the
angular service worker but right now we
want to learn first service workers in
general so that's what we will be doing
in this section we are going to hand
code a couple of examples starting with
an offline page let's start implementing
our first service worker let's have a
look here at the diagram to see how
service workers work in the browser
let's say that you have a given domain
your domain calm in your browser you
might have multiple tabs open to your
web application running under your
domain all these tabs will share the
same Service Worker instance this
service worker instance will intercept
the HTTP requests that are made by any
of the tabs of your application and it
will forward them or not to the network
a service worker is essentially a
middleware that is downloadable and
installable and when it's running its
scoped to your application it cannot
access other applications that you are
running in your browser although it
might not look like it the service
worker is the key browser component that
is going to allow us to give to our web
application native like capabilities
such as for example download an
installation background sync of data
offline support and notifications let's
have a look at how this works
we are going to create our first Service
Worker for that we are going to need a
registration script let's switch back
here to our application we are going to
create our service worker here right
next to our index dot HTML the service
worker registration file is usually
called by convention SW - register dot
yes we are also going to add this script
as a script tag here at the level of the
header of our application this way this
script will be added to the page since
the very beginning of the download of
the single page application with this in
place we are ready to start writing our
Service Worker registration script the
first thing that we are going to do is
we are going to test to see if the
browser does support service workers if
the browser does not support service
workers we want our application to still
work correctly let's remember that
service workers and people with
technology in general is supposed to be
used in an incremental way so if there
is browser support for it
then we can go ahead and add these
capabilities to our application
otherwise everything should still work
like in a normal web application so we
are going to test the presence of the
Service Worker functionality by making
sure that the Service Worker property
exists in the Navigator global object so
if that is the case then we have Service
Worker support let's then start using
the service worker API to create a new
service worker we are going to use this
object that we just tested for the
existence navigator dot service worker
and we are going to call the register
method this is going to register a new
service worker instance this method
takes a couple of arguments the first
argument is going to take the name of
the service worker file that we are
going to call SW dot Jes the second
argument that we need to pass is a
configuration object in this
configuration object for the moment we
are just going to specify one property
which is the scope of the service worker
we are going to configure this service
worker to intercept all HTTP requests
that are made by this web client so for
example all the requests to slash API
will be intercepted all the requests for
fetching HTML Javascript and CSS every
single request is going to be
intercepted by the service worker notice
that if we have put here slash
APA then in these service workers we
would not be able to intercept a call to
for example bundle dot CSS assign a
service worker that was scoped to slash
APA so let's configure our service
worker to intercept all HTTP requests
but typically we want to do something
after the registration is completed at
least log to the console that the
registration process went smoothly so in
order to do that we are going to use the
promised return by the register call in
general all the browser API s-- that
revolve around PWA and service workers
they are all promise based and this
called register also returns a promise
so we are going to call dot then on that
promise and we are going to pass in here
a plain JavaScript function that is
going to receive a registration object
and because we are running this code in
the Chrome browser we already have
built-in support for the arrow notation
so we are going to be using that and in
general we are going to be leveraging
the es6 JavaScript features in these
examples we will also be using for
example a sink await notice that if you
are using a clean installation of
webstorm you should be getting now and
there and that's because the es6
features like for example the arrow
notation are not active so let's quickly
activate them we are going to go to the
webstorm Preferences menu and we are
going to search here for the language
JavaScript we're going to click into it
and we are going to change here the
JavaScript language version instead of
ACMA script 5.1 we are going to set this
to es6 we are going to apply this we're
able to click OK and we are going to
configure here no we don't want the file
watcher to transpile this so now all the
errors are fixed and we get here our
registration object we are going to be
using this later right now we simply
want to log to the screen that the
registration process ended successfully
so we are going to add here simply this
console dot log and we are going to move
on to right
our first service worker we are going to
be having an offline page to this
application and we will show how to
download an installation of an
application version manage multiple
application versions right now what we
want to do next is we want start
learning about the Service Worker
