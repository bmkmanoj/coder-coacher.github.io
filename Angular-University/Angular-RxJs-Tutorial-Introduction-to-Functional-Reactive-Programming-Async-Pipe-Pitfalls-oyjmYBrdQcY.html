from the angular University and in this
lesson we are going to learn how to more
easily consume data coming from
observables using the standard a sink
pipe we are going to see a way of
building our programs that is closer to
the functional reactive programming
paradigm so stay tuned we can see here
that we are using a state variable in
our component lessons this contains an
array of lessons so this is OK but
imagine that we would prefer to build
our program around the notion of streams
and observables only so in this case we
are going to define our program in a way
that our views our components simply
react to the arrival of new data and
display it on the screen but they
themselves don't contain directly any
state so the application does have state
it always has state the state is for
example at the Dom level the state can
be somewhere in your application it
doesn't have to be in your application
code state variables are actually a
source of bugs so mutability is a
well-known source of bugs in
applications in general so the more
state variables we can avoid the better
as long as it's still practical to write
our program and does not present a lot
of cognitive overhead for the developer
we can do that by instead of using state
variables using observable member
variables instead of using a lessons
array variable we are going to use a
lessons observable so it's just an
observable that each value is an array
of lessons let's now try to pass it to
our template to see what happens if we
try this out as it is we will see that
we will get an error saying for example
cannot find a supporting object ng 4
only supports binding of iterables
so this basically means that we have
passed to the lessons list
something else other than what it was
expecting and we got an error if we want
to pass in data coming from observables
into components that are not expecting
and observable we can use the standard a
sinc pipe let's try that we just do pipe
a sink and what this a sink pipe will do
this is an impure pipe that will
subscribe to the observable and it will
retrieve its last known value and it
will pass it to the component so this
also works for promises as we can see
now the lessons list receives correctly
the lessons just like we wanted now if
we want to pass the observable to
another place in the template we need to
apply pipe a sink again let's give an
example let's print out the total number
of lessons to the screen if we try this
out without further modifications we can
see that we get an error that says
cannot read property length of null this
is because the pipe has subscribed to
the observable but while the observable
does not return its first value the
value will be no so if we try to call
null dot length we will get this error
we should guard against this error
condition in our template by using
simply the Elvis operator like we saw
before
so using observable member variables is
just a possibility that we have to build
our program it's not in any way
mandatory it's just an interesting
possibility one thing to avoid in at
least in retrieval operations is to call
the service layer directly from the
template so for example instead of using
lessons pipe a sink we will do lessons
service dot load lessons pipe a sink
this is really something to avoid
because the template is continuously
being regenerated and it's expressions
are continuously being re-evaluated so
you would have a series of network calls
being made to the back end and you might
not understand
really why speaking of which we are
going to learn in the next lesson what
is maybe the biggest pitfall that you
can find while using angular 2 HTTP so
it's coming right up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
