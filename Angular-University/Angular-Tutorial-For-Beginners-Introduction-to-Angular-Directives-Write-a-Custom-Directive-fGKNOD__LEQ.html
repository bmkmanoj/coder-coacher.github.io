angular University and in this lesson we
are going to learn how to build our own
custom angular 2 directive it's coming
right up so you might have noticed while
coding in plain HTML that there are
certain attributes that we add to
elements that add or remove existing
functionality to those elements such as
for example the required attribute that
marks an input field as mandatory in a
form in this lesson we are going to
learn how to build such a custom
directive again extending the standard
functionality of plain HTML with our own
custom functionality this is what
angular allow us to do the custom
attribute directive that we are about to
create is the collapse on click
directive whenever we apply it to an
element on the page that element once
it's clicked will disappear from the
screen so this is just an example and
the directive can be applied to any
element on the page including 2 angular
2 components a directive in angular is
simply a plain JavaScript class
annotated with the death directive
decorator in there we are going to pass
it a selector and notice the square
bracket this means that the directive
should be applied to any HTML element on
the page that has a collapse on click
attribute it is a best practice in the
case of attribute directives to always
use attribute selectors instead of for
example element selectors like we do so
for the case of components please be
sure to check the end of this section
for the exercise where we are going to
present an implementation of collapsible
that uses more features right now we are
simply going to define a CSS selector
that says the following any collapsible
section inside the collapsed
element should not be displayed on the
screen so display:none we should check
the section on ng
if so this directive will work in the
following way we need to detect clicks
on the element on which the directive is
applied to and that is known as its host
element the directives host element in
this case it's dis div with the CSS
classes of card and card strong next
what we want to do is whenever that
click occurs we want to add or remove a
collapsed class to the host element and
that will trigger the appearance or
disappearance of the collapsible panel
let's see how to do this let's first
create a is collapsed private variable
in the collapse unclicks directive and
what we are going to do is whenever a
click event occurs in the host element
so we are going to use the add host
listener decorator to detect events in
the host element whenever a click occurs
we are going to toggle the value of the
private variable is collapsed which has
a default initial value of false what we
want to do now is add the collapsed CSS
class to the host element depending on
the value of the is collapsed private
variable for that we are going to use
the host binding decorator the host
binding decorator allow us to write to
properties of the host element so in
this case what we want to do is we want
to set the property class collapsed in
case that the property is collapsed of
the directive is set to true so let's
now see our first custom directive in
action for the first time if we now
inspect the HTML we can see that for
example when we click on the this page
section is collapsible text whenever we
click on it the CSS class collapsed is
either added or removed from the host
element where the directive was applied
as you can see directives have the
potential of giving us more useable
functionality compared to components any
functionality that we add in a directive
we can add potentially to any component
but directives are really not that
different from com
let's have a look why in the next
