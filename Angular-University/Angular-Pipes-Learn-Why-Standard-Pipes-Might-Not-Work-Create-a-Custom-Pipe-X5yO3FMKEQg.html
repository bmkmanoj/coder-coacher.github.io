a transformation mechanism that allow us
to process our data when inserting it
into the template we will go over the
standard pipes by processing the data
that we have on this controller there's
one thing that you might not know about
certain pipes and without it they will
simply not work at least in certain
browsers
let's see further on this lesson let's
see a couple of simple pipes in action
here we have the uppercase and lowercase
pipe so any expression passed into these
pipes will be transformed accordingly so
the uppercase pipe will make hello world
all uppercase let's see this in action
let's introduce a couple more pipes for
example the sliced pipe it follows the
same semantics as the JavaScript slice
operation you can pass it an array you
can pass it a string it behaves as you
would expect the replaced pipe also
follows the semantics of the JavaScript
string replace operation it can take
also regular expressions as we can see
pipes can be customized by passing them
arguments separated by that colon
character now take a look at this we are
going to introduce a new pipe the date
pipe it's for formatting dates we can
pass it in the format on which we want
to display the date as we can see the
month May has been displayed on the
screen now take a look at what happens
if we run the exact same code in the
Safari browser we immediately get an
error can't find variable and the
program crashes so what's going on here
this happens because the date pipe like
several other pipes made available to us
by angular are dependent on the browser
internationalization API the problem is
that this API is not yet available in
all browsers and that's why we have an
error in Safari but not in chrome the
best solution is to install a polyfill a
polyfill is simply as
a script library that installs on the
browser a missing feature that the
browser has not yet available it will
let startup time detect if the feature
is present and if not it will install
itself and provide that feature
sometimes partially if the feature is
already available on the browser then
the polyfill will not install itself
what we need is a polyfill for the
internationalization API a good source
for polyfills is polyfill dot IO let's
add a polyfill here in the index dot
HTML if we now switch back to Safari
everything is working again another pipe
that also needs the internationalization
API is the number formatting pipe we can
configure it with a string in this case
5 is the number of digits left of the
comma of the number that we want to
display this will be left padded with
zeros and 1 and 2 are the minimum and
the maximum amount of decimal digits
that we want to display next is the %
pipe to display percentages this can be
configured using a configuration string
that follows the same format as the
number pipe the last standard pipe that
we are going to see in this lesson is
the currency pipe we can pass it a
three-digit code containing the currency
a flag stating if we should print the
symbol of the currency instead of in
this case for example USD and a number
formatting string that follows the same
mechanism as the previous numeric pipes
last but not least let's learn how to
build a custom pipe so for that we are
going to implement the sort a rate
sorting pipe that can take one argument
that determines the sorting order we are
going to apply the sort pipe to the data
array now let's see what the custom pipe
looks like here we have it we need to
annotate it with the add pipe annotation
give it a name which should be the name
that we are going to use it to apply it
on templates and it should implement the
pipe transform interface this interface
only has one method transform that takes
this first argument the
input data of the pipe that we want to
transform and the second argument the
argument of the pipe in this case if the
sort order is asked or desc let's create
a simplified version of this pipe this
is for demo purposes only we are going
to sort the array next we are going to
detect is the sort order descending and
if so we are simply going to reverse the
array we simply need to add this pipe to
the list of pipes recognized by the
component using the pipes property let's
try it out as we can see the pipe is
working as expected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
