from the angular University and in this
lesson we are going to build our first
angular 2 application from scratch so
let's get started the first thing that
we need to do is define our root
component let's define a class named app
this will be the entry point of our
application we need to annotate it with
the add component annotation and inside
the add component annotation we need to
pass in a JavaScript object that
contains two mandatory properties one is
a selector so this is a CSS selector
that will define to which HTML elements
in the page this component gets applied
to we are going to give an example of
such a component in a second the second
mandatory property is the template
property we need we need to specify the
template or template URL we will see
that in a future lesson right now let's
define an inline template which simply
prints a message to the screen saying
hello world how can we use this
component that we just created what does
this look like in terms of HTML if we
see here the HTML of this page we are
going to add to this page a custom HTML
element named app which angular will
associate via the app selector to our
component and so it will replace the
content of this custom app tag by the
message hello world and this is one of
the most powerful features of angular 2
we can create our own custom HTML
elements what we need to do now is to
start our angular 2 application we need
to bootstrap it to use the frameworks
terminology so to do that we have
several ways of doing it the recommended
way of doing it in development mode is
to use the platform browser dynamic
bootstrap module method so what this
kake's is an angular 2 module definition
which will be used to bootstrap the
application so what is an angular 2
module we are going to go into modules
in detail later in this course right now
for us it's enough to know that the
module is a way of grouping relative
angular 2 functionality we will bring
related components directives pipes and
services in a single logical unit our
application has one root module let's
write it so we just need to define a
class that by convention should be
called app module and we are going to
apply it the @ng module and notation
inside it we are going to pass it a
configuration object in this
configuration object we need to define
which components this module recognizes
and we are going to add in of course our
app component the root component of our
application we also should specify which
is the entry point of the application
because we could have many components
that are recognized by this module but
we haven't told angular what is the
entry point of our application in this
case we are going to configure it via
the bootstrap property and we are going
to say that our root component is the
app component so we pass in this module
to our bootstrap call and we should have
a running application right let's give
it a try if we now try this out we can
see that we have here an error in the
console why is that that's because we
have not imported the browser module
that contains all the core angular 2
directives and much more if you are
developing a web application that is
going to run in a browser we should
import the browser module if we are
running in other environments such as
for example native mobile we will have
another module that would replace the
browser module for the moment let's
include it and see what happens if we
now try this out we can see that our
first angular 2 application is up and
running rise each angular 2 application
is a tree of components and there is
usually only one root component we need
to specify a root bootstrap module that
we need to pass to our bootstrap
function this module will declare which
components this application recognizes
what are the components that make up
this application what we do here is we
can import them one by one in the
declarations property or we can import
them together with directives and pipes
and services as groups of related
functionality enabled modules and we can
import modules in the imports property
of the module declaration if we are
building a web application we need to
import browser module in a root
component only we should not import it
elsewhere in the application we need to
tell the application what is its entry
point there could be several actually
notice that the bootstrap property is an
array but in most cases there is only
one entry point for the application the
root component what we are going to do
now is we are going to write our first
non root component we are going to add a
visual component to our application it's
coming right up
in the next lesson hello everyone how's
it going it's Vasco from the angular
University and in this lesson we are
going to write our first angular 2
component let's build a very simple
widget a search box widget which
contains an input box and next to it we
have a button to clear the input box so
let's get started what we really want to
do is we want to define an extra HTML
element to the standard HTML elements
that the page might have we want to
create a sir
- box HTML element and we want to be
able to use it in our application just
like it was a normal HTML element so how
can we do this we define an angular 2
component we define a class let's name
it simply search box we are going to
annotate it with the add component
annotation again this tells angular that
this is a component inside the
configuration object we are going to
define a selector the selector needs to
match the HTML element name that we are
going to use in this case search - box
so by convention the CSS selector that
we apply here in a component should be
an element selector we should not for
example use property selectors here what
we need to do also is to define a
template for the component what will the
component look like visually on screen a
component might use other components in
this case we were just going to have
input box - the component and next to it
we are going to add simply a Clear
button and there we have it we have a
very simple component defined in the
upcoming lessons we are going to see how
to add behavior to this component but
right now we just want this HTML to be
displayed on the screen in place of the
search - box component HTML tag to do
that what we can do is we can try to run
the application like this what will
happen is that nothing will be displayed
this is because the application is not
aware of the search - box component
nowhere in our application we have
configured this component we need to do
so by adding it to the module definition
of our application in this case because
we only have one component for the
moment we are simply going to add it
directly in the declarations property of
our route module if we try to use this
component again if we reload the page we
can see that our component is now
working in the next few lessons we are
going to have behave
here to this component namely we are
going to pass it inputs and we are going
to receive outputs out of it so stay
tuned because it's coming right up
welcome to a lesson of the angular
university in this lesson we are going
to learn about component inputs if you
already know component inputs in the end
of this lesson I'm going to share a way
of abbreviating certain situations where
we are passing input to a component so
you might not be aware of that so let's
start with a simple example straight
away this is a search box component it
has an input box and a Clear button now
let's say that we want our placeholder
tags we would like this not to be
constant but we would like to take it
from a variable that is part of our
search box component class let's do that
let's define a variable let's call it
text and we are going to assign it the
text that we want now how do we output
this to the component template we're
going to use the interpolation syntax
that we are going to cover in more
detail in a future lesson right now we
are just going to output the value of a
string into the template this double
curly brace expression is an
interpolation expression so the double
curly brace is recognized by angular and
tells it that the content inside the
double curly brace is an expression that
angular should evaluate by taking as
context the component itself so if we
inside double curly braces we output
text that will be taken from the search
box component let's try this out if we
now reload the page we can see that the
placeholder is type your search as
expected now we would like to take this
one step further we would like to make
the placeholder text configurable by any
other component that is using the search
box component for that we need to make
the variable text an input of the
opponent and we can do so by annotating
it with the add input annotation and
notice the parentheses at the end of the
annotation without this the annotation
will not work now one thing we don't
want the input that is passed to the
component to be named text that's just
an internal name for an internal
variable we want the input to be named
placeholder like the standard HTML
attribute so now how do we use this
input how do we pass in an input to
component so we go to the component that
is using search box in this case our
route component and we are going to pass
it in placeholder input variable we do
so with the angle brackets template
syntax notation this is the template
syntax notation for inputs in angular 2
components we are going to pass into the
input variable placeholder we're going
to pass it in a string the goal is that
this drink overrides the default value
of the text property inside the search
box component so let's try this out to
see if this works as we can see we have
custom placeholder displayed correctly
as expected so the input property is
working now you might think that this is
a very common use case to pass a
constant string as an input yes it's
true that in certain situations this
might be a dynamic property but in this
case let's say that it will always be
constant in that case the syntax that we
have here is slightly verbals for this
particular case where we are passing in
a constant string to an input property
we have an abbreviated notation syntax
that we mentioned in the beginning of
the lesson if you remove the quotes
around the strings and if we remove the
square brackets these will still work so
let's give it a try as we can see
everything is still working and this
looks like just a plain HTML attribute
this is much more readable it actually
looks like a plain HTML
a tribute which is also more intuitive
for someone looking at the template what
we're going to do now is we are going to
add behavior to this component we are
going to when the user clicks the Clear
button we are going to clear the input
box so we are going to learn the
template syntax for events in the next
lesson which is coming right up
hello everyone and welcome this is Vasko
welcome to the angular diversity in this
lesson we are going to learn about
component events and event emitters so
let's get started what we're going to do
here is we're going to take this simple
component which is the search box
component which has an input and a Clear
button we're going to implement the
Clear button behavior so what we want to
do is whenever we type on the input
search box
when we click clear the Clear button the
input box should be cleared so how do we
handle this let's use the events
template syntax for this so what we want
to do here is in the element where the
click occurs so the button we're going
to add a click Handler and we are going
to use the rounded parentheses or normal
parentheses for this this is the
template syntax for events in angular 2
both browser events and custom events as
we will see in a moment now inside the
rounded braces we are going to type the
in this case browser event to which we
want to respond to in this case the
click event on the right hand side we
are going to define how this event
should be handled in this case we want
to call the clear component method let's
implement this method by simply having a
call to log to the console let's try
this out if we now type in something and
we click the Clear button we can see
that our statement is locked to the
console as expected now let's talk about
how could we implement the clear
behavior well one way to do it let's do
it first in plain JavaScript
so let's select using the chrome dev
tools we're going to right click on
input box and we're going to inspect it
in the HTML panel if we now switch back
to the console the dollar 0 variable
contains the last element that was
clicked while inspecting this on the dev
tools so in this case dollar 0 is the
Dom element of the input box how can we
clear this we can clear it by assigning
it a value of an empty string for
example so if we do dollar 0 dot value
equals empty string this is an example
of how to clear the input box so let's
implement this in angular 2 let's now
implement the clear behavior so what we
want to do here is we want to introduce
a new concept
besides events we want to introduce the
concept of references so we can assign a
template reference using the hash
character and we're going to give it a
name to the input box we are going to
call it hash input so whenever inside
the template we refer to input we are
referring to the Dom element of the
input text box so now we can pass it in
as a parameter inside the clear method
for example now what you can do inside
the clear method is we simply assign it
a value of an empty string and this will
clear the input box
let's try result if we now type in the
input box and we hit the Clear button we
can see that the input box is being
cleared as expected now we have seen how
to use the template syntax for events in
an upcoming lesson we are going to see
how the same syntax can be applied to
custom events we will first learn how to
externalize the templates of our
components and how to apply CSS styles
to our components then we are going to
tie everything together in a more
complex introduction to components
example where we are going to have
multiple components interacting with
each other and using custom event
using a venti meter so stay tuned all of
these is coming right up in the next
lesson
hello everyone and welcome this is Vasco
from the angular University and in this
lesson we are going to learn how to
externalize component templates in an
external file we are going to learn the
best practices recommended by the
official style guide for that so let's
get started we have here a very simple
component with an inline template
defined using the template property in
the component annotation defining
templates inline it's usually okay when
we are trying out something or maybe if
your component is a very small component
but in general we really want to
separate the template into an external
HTML file so let's do that let's extract
the HTML template from the component and
let's create an external file which has
the same name as the component file
itself except it has a different HTML
extension
we just copy-paste inside this file the
template in off and now we just need to
apply it to the component to do so we go
back to the component file and instead
of using template the inline template we
are going to use the template URL
property as we put the template in the
same folder as the component itself we
just have to type in here the file name
of the template this will work just like
this transparently if you are using for
example the latest angular CLI if that's
not the case then you really have to
give angular some more information on
how to find the template file if you are
using a command J as compatible module
loader like for example System GS you
will have available at runtime a
variable named module you can take it
and use module ID pass it to the
component via the module ID property and
angular will know how to find the
template to avoid typescript errors you
need to declare the ball
variable again if you are using the CLI
you don't need this module dot ID
variable so it's one of the many
advantages of using the CLI so these
covers how to handle HTML templates in
our components let's now see how can we
have styles to a component and what is
the big advantage of doing it the
angular 2 way stay tuned it's coming
right up welcome this is Vasco from the
angular University and in this lesson we
are going to learn how to style angular
2 components we are going to learn what
is the big advantage of styling
components the angular 2 way we could
always tell a component by adding simply
a link tag to our HTML page that would
work perfectly with angular 2 without
any problem but angular 2 introduces a
new improved way of doing CSS let's have
a look at it the way that is works is in
each component we can define styles that
are specific to the component so we have
a Styles property that takes on an array
this is an array of strings each string
is just an extract of CSS so let's just
add some CSS to this component and here
some CSS as part of these Styles array
and we refresh the page we can see that
the CSS got applied to the component but
let's have a closer look to see how this
was done the styles were actually added
as a style tag in the head of the page
we can see here that the styles are
applied to the component but notice this
property with a randomly generated name
that gets associated to the component
all the styles reference this attribute
here this means that these styles have a
very high degree of specificity because
they all have an attribute in it these
causes these styles to take precedence
over almost any style that you might
want to apply in a page compared to the
specificity of most commonly used
library
like styles in bootstrap etc these
styles would take precedence so this is
mechanism is a way of partial style
isolation we can define styles that in
the vast majority of cases will take
precedence over any other style on the
page but the component is not really
fully isolated from a style point of
view he's still inheriting for example
fonts from the main page if you are
building an angular 2 component it's
better to use the Styles property to
define the CSS of the component this
means that for one the styles of the
component are guaranteed to not
interfere with the styles in the
remaining of the page because they are
based on this randomly generated
property also it's much less likely that
Styles on the page will override this
style meaning that the component will be
reusable in a larger number of
situations you can also define CSS
styles in external files in a very
similar way to how we did it with
templates we simply create an external
file which has the same name as the
component file but a different extension
in this case CSS what we're going to do
is we are going to copy the CSS inside
the file and we are going to add this
file associating it to the to the
component by the Styles URLs property
notice that this is an array so you can
pass in several basic notions of how to
set up a component we can define its
template we can define its styles and we
can define the component class what we
are going to do now is we are going to
tie all these concepts together together
with the notion of inputs and outputs of
components we are going to build a more
complex example where several components
interact with each other it's coming
right up in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
