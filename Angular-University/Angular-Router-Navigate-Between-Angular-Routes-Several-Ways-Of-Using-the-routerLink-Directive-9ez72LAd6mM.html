here from the angular University and in
this lesson we are going to learn about
the router link directive learn a couple
of different ways to use it there's more
than one and we're going to see how it
can actually be applied to different
elements on the page not only links it's
coming right up to start let's configure
a few more routes in our application by
the way our application is a small
elearning system where we will have a
list of courses we click on it we can
see the lessons so it's a small
elearning platform in this section of
the router we are just simply going to
focus on the routing but in an upcoming
section we are going to build the whole
application including the backend we are
going to use firebase so let's get
started let's first configure a couple
of extra routes we are going to
configure besides the home route we are
going to configure the courses route we
are going to show the courses component
and the lessons routes where we are
going to show the all lessons component
let's give this configuration a quick
try so if we type in the URL home we get
displayed the home component now let's
try it with courses this is the courses
component containing just a list of
courses and this is the lessons route
where we have a list of all the lessons
available this confirms that the routing
configuration is working now what we
want to do is to create a top menu where
we can click in one entry and navigate
directly to that section so let's do
that using the router link directive
let's start by applying router link to
an anchor tag so we can apply it by
simply passing the path to which we want
to navigate the angular to router path
that is so the directive will cancel the
navigation that is associated to a
normal anchor HTML element and it will
instead trigger the router let's
configure another menu entry like this
and let's show another way you're using
router link you can also pass it in an
expression
are not forced to pass it a string so if
you pass it an expression you should
pass it an array containing the
different paths to which you want to
navigate in this case we want to
navigate to the lessons path the router
link directive is not only meant for
anchor elements you can apply it
actually to any element on the page so
let's apply it to the home icon what
happens here is that the click on
element will be detected and in response
to the click the route will be triggered
if you enjoyed this tutorial you can
always subscribe to my channel for more
upcoming angular2 tutorials also have a
look at the website of the angular
university to see what type of angular 2
tutorials you find there that you might
like notice here that in this component
we have included in its directives array
the router directives without this
router link will not work also any other
routing directive would not work without
this so this is already a good start you
have an application you have a couple of
routes configure you have a menu what
you want to do from the beginning in an
application is to configure a fallback
route and also a default home route we
are going to see how to do this in the
upcoming lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
