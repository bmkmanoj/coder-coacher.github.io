the first thing that we need to do is
start defining the application state so
we're going to create here a store
folder this is really a great place to
start or implementing our store solution
let's simply define here a custom type
definition which is the application
state this state will be composed of
primitive types like participants
messages etc so classes that are defined
here on the model folder let's define
here a type that we will name
application state the application state
typically has two components a part of
the state is the data that we are
storing so the fred's
the message is the participants that is
purely the data the slice of the data is
that we are keeping in memory another
part of the state is not directly the
data but it's for example what is the
currently selected thread that we want
to highlight so what is the ID of the
current selected thread or also what is
the ID of the currently selected user so
that is another type of state that we
also want to put in our store so what we
usually do is we are going to define
here a couple of other files one will be
the stored data so this will be a custom
type that will define what is the data
that we store exactly in our store
the second custom type that we want to
define is the UI state the UI state will
for example store what is the currently
selected user and so the application
state will be composed of two properties
the first property is the UI state which
is of type UI state and the second
property is store data which is of type
store data it's important to keep this
distinction from the very beginning of
our store implemented
let's start by defining our user
interface state our UI state so going
back to the screenshot of our
application our application really has
two elements of UI state the currently
selected user and currently selected
Fred so let's jump into UI state and
define these two properties so the first
property is the user ID which will be a
number and the second property is the
current thread ID which will also be a
number now let's define the store data
so what will the store contain so the
store data is a small in-memory database
on the client side so we should define
the data in our store to have a similar
structure to the one that we have in our
database assuming that the database is
in its normalized form so let's open
here the DB data file what we have here
is a list of participants with a key
which is the participant ID and a file
which is the participant then we have a
similar arrangement for Fred's
and messages this is the way that our
database is organized so this is typical
of either JSON databases like MongoDB or
fireplace but a similar arrangement
occurs in relational databases so you
can imagine that participants is a
database table and these are rows in a
database table and this is the primary
key
now our stored data should have the same
structure as the database that we are
bringing to the client-side a small part
of it so we will have here a
participant's map and the key to this
map we are going to define it here
inside square brackets the key is a
number which is the participant ID and
the value is a participant of course so
notice that we are using the participant
custom type available here in
the shared folder in the model folder so
this is our participants the next data
that we have here in memory is the
Fred's of the user so all of this data
that is in memory in the client side is
typically per user so these are the
participants for the Fred's that the
user can see these are the Fred's that
the user can see so Fred's per user
would also be a good name this Fred's
property is also a map so again the map
the key is a number and this number of
course is the Fred ID and the value of
the map is a Fred now a similar
arrangement will happen with messages we
are going to store our messages per
message ID and the value will be the
message itself so what we have here is
the definition of our store data as our
application is running we are going to
bring from the back end a small part of
the database that contains the data that
the user can view and we are going to
store it in memory on the client side we
are going to store it at a single place
and we are going to notify parts of the
application that want to display that
data we are going to notify them
whenever a new version of the in-memory
data is available next up we are going
to cover actions action dispatching and
reducers it's coming right up in the
next few lessons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
