from the angular a university and in
this lesson we're going to learn when
should we use template driven versus
model driven or reactive forums and why
it's coming right up let's give an
example for example this is a model
driven forum so all the validations and
all the controls are defined
problematically and we are just binding
those controls to the template using for
example form control name and the form
group directives now what we haven't
done so far is that we can actually
combine model driven forums and template
driven forms in the same form for
example the mandatory validation for the
title field we can delete it here from
the programmatic declaration so it's no
longer defined in a model driven way but
we can go now to the form itself and we
can add the required attribute and this
will still work let's give it a try if
we clear the title mandatory field we
can see that the validation is triggered
so these proves that we can use both
mechanisms of form building together but
you can see even from this simple
example our things can start becoming
confusing rather fast if we mix the two
approaches in the same form so we are
best of choosing one approach and using
it consistently through the whole
application there might be cases where
we need to mix the two approaches but
those tend to be the exception and not
the rule
but then what type of form should we
choose and why that actually depends on
the concrete situation for example if
you are migrating an existing
application from angular 1 to angular 2
you really want to go with template
driven forms at least in an early stage
that's one of the main use cases of
template driven forms actually it makes
it very easy to migrate existing angular
1 forms built using ng
model to angular 2 forums that also use
ng model and banana box syntax and be
directional binding that's really one of
the main use cases now if you have a
simple form in an angular 2 application
it only takes a couple of fields like
three or four fields and it only uses
very basic validation like these fields
are mandatory this field only has this
minimum length in such a simple use case
you can also use template driven forms
they work perfectly there is no reason
to not use them but model driven forms
were built to handle cases where the
complexity increases like for example
enterprise applications imagine a very
large credit application with large
forms that span multiple tabs with a ton
of fields a lot of business logic
validation so for example certain fields
cannot have this combination of values
that's the clear scenario for using
model driven forms from the beginning
also if you have an application where
you want to add more modern
functionality like Auto save or undo
redo you will find it much easier to add
that sort of functionality if you use
reactive forms from the beginning and
remember template driven forms and model
driven forms are using under the hood
exactly the same mechanisms that means
that for both you will have a form group
representing the form and you will have
form controls representing the
individual controls so under the hood
they work exactly the same way this also
means that there is nothing that you can
do with template driven forums that you
could not do with model driven forms and
vice versa
but we can see that certain features are
really simple to implement using model
driven forms things like autosave
Complex interviewed validations those
came much more natural using mod
even forums I hope this has helped you
decide which type of forums to choose
for your application in the next lesson
we are going to see both forum types in
action in the exercise of the forum
