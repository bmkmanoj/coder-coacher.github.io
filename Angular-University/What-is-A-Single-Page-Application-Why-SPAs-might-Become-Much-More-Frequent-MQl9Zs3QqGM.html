from the angular University I'm really
excited to bring you this course on the
angular 2 router as you might know the
angular 2 router allows you to build
single page applications in angular 2
now you might be wondering what is a
single page application and what's in it
for me as a developer why would I want
to build an application that way in the
end of this lesson we are also going to
learn why if this is such a great way of
building applications why hasn't
everybody been using it everywhere until
now and why that probably will change in
the future
let's give you a quick demo take a look
at this page this is the page of the
angular university it's of course an
angular 2 single page application and
take a look when you start clicking
around this is not in fast-forward mode
this video this is in real time you can
see how fluid the experience is when you
change from one menu to the other when
you click on a filter in a data table
when you go to another page in a data
table when you navigate between lessons
notice that the back and the forward
button work perfectly and notice also
the URL it's just a plain HTTP URL but
this is too fast for having a page
reload between each of these transitions
you can see here that the URL changes
but the page updates almost immediately
so let's see what's going on here let's
have a look at the network tab to try to
see what's going on so if we now
navigate between pages we can see that
after the initial load of the HTML from
the server what happens during
transitions is that we are simply doing
Ajax requests that only retrieve data
under the form of JSON from the backend
there is no more retrieval of HTML from
the backend there are no more full page
reloads we stay on the same page even
though the URL changes that's why it's
called a single page application now how
does this work
it's very simple we are using under the
the standard browser history API let's
see here in Cana use comm the history
API is available in basically all
browsers that are Internet Explorer 11
or above if by some reason you find
yourself in a situation where you cannot
use the browser history API we have a
lesson for that in the end of this
course the router is not only about
building a single page applications it's
about structuring very dynamic
applications that the user can customize
according to its preferences where there
are several regions of the page that can
contain different content depending on
the state of the application and what
the user shows to display with the
angular2 router we can create
applications that have a great user
experience that are deep linkable and
very dynamic and configurable and you
might be wondering well why isn't the
whole internet built as single page
applications they have been around for
years right the most important reason
for that was up until recently search
engine optimization so single page
applications had trouble getting indexed
correctly by search engines when
compared to plain HTML applications
according to Google themselves this has
become now much better and the Google
crawler is now much more able to crawl
correctly a single page application so
you shouldn't be surprised if you start
seeing a lot more single page
applications in the next coming years
now that's all great but how do we build
a single page application that's what
we're going to learn in this course
let's start our deep dive in Y angular 2
router coming right up in the next
lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
