going Vasco here from the angular
University
welcome to the angular security master
class this course is a web security
fundamentals course where the sample
application that we will be using during
the course is an angular and node
application but the concepts that you
will learn during the course are not
specific to this stack they are
applicable to any technology stack that
you use in your concrete project all the
front-end code in this course will be in
the latest version of angular and the
back end will be in node specifically
all the back end code will be in
typescript during the course we are
going to be using several open source
packages from off zero
so using these packages let's see how we
are going to tackle learning these
advanced topics so as you know security
is maybe the number one advanced topic
in web development here is what we're
going to do we are going to take an
application that is already working and
that it's in a fully and secured state
so there is no security as in to it
there is no user management we are going
to secure that application and we are
going to submit that same application to
a series of web security attacks then we
are going to put in place the necessary
defenses against those same attacks so
this means that we will be learning web
security via a series of practical
examples of what an attack looks like
and how should we defend against it so
we will be continuously switching our
black hat and our white hat during this
course let's start at beginning we will
have the application running using HTTP
and we will see that that does not
ensure by itself that the application is
secure we will start by having user
management to the application we are
going to start by implementing the user
signup functionality from scratch we
will be using a node.js server a REST
API we will be storing the password
in the database we will learn best
practices for storing passwords we will
learn about hashing and solving and
other cryptographic concepts those
concepts are usually considered very
advanced but please don't feel
intimidated by these concepts we are
going to approach them in a very
practical way we are going to focus not
so much on the internals of how those
mechanisms work but how are they useful
to implement security when should we use
each cryptographic tool and why during
the implementation of the sign up
functionality we will introduce the
first category of web security attacks
that we will learn to defend against it
will be offline dictionary attacks so we
will learn how to start passwords in a
way that defends us against those type
of attacks after that we will move to
the login functionality so again
everything implemented from scratch we
are going to start by implementing
traditional login system where there is
a stateful service in the server and
there is a temporary identity token that
we will be starting in a cookie so that
will be our first implementation then we
are going to refactor that and we are
going to move to a stateless solution so
no state is kept on the server and we
will be using JSON web token so we will
introduce JSON web tokens and we will
see what are the several advantages of
using them and how they can be used to
implement authentication in our
application JSON web tokens are the main
technology used behind many security
related solutions on the Internet
such as for example firebase
authentication it uses JSON web tokens
and also of 0 itself is based on them so
at this point we will have a working
solution based on them that is starting
the JSON web tokens on a local storage
we are going to see that that makes the
identity token vulnerable to a certain
type of attacks we are going to perform
a cross-site scripting attack on this
application where you can see why the
attack happen what kind of defenses were
not in place at the level of angular
itself to allow the attack to happen we
are going to see how to steal a
temporary identity token and send it to
an attack server just as an example
we're going to see how that can be used
to impersonate any user even if we don't
have the password with us after that
what we're going to do is we are going
to be found our JWT based implementation
we're going to defend against that
attack by using cookies again as a
storage mechanism so cookies and JSON
web tokens they are not alternative
technologies we are going to learn in
this course how to combine them so we
are going to see how these two
technologies can be combined to create a
better solution for our identity token
where we see then that that
implementation just made us vulnerable
to a cross-site request forgery attacks
or CSRF we are going to learn how to
defend against that attack as well so at
that time we will have a fairly solid
solution for user management we are then
going to focus again on the original
cross-site scripting vulnerability of
our application that allows the attack
to be performed in the first place you
are going to fix that and then we might
be surprised that still with all these
protections there is a problem with the
design of our application that still
makes it vulnerable for attacks so we
are going to learn at these points and
common design pitfalls that introduce
security breaches in our systems and how
many times the best defense against
security attacks is software design we
have implemented this user management
solution from scratch from first
principles but in many situations what
we want to do is to use a third party
solution such as for example of zero so
we will be making a demonstration of off
zero in this course at this point and we
will also talk about how security is
typically implemented in enterprise
scenarios by talking about pre
authentication we will then move to
another major secure
the topic authorization we are going to
start on the client side we are going to
learn how to implement certain UI
features that are only available for
users with a certain role
so we will write custom directives that
will allow us to add or remove for
example certain buttons certain menu
entries depending on the role of the
active user we are then going to
introduce the angular router in the
context of client-side authorization and
we are going to see how the router or
any client-side the functionality in
general cannot really ensure true
security for implementing that we need
to switch to the server-side and always
implement authorization at the level of
the server we will be implementing this
using Express middleware we are going to
implement the server-side functionality
of allowing someone to log in as another
user so this is usually an administrator
only functionality where an
administrator can log in on behalf of
any user for example for investigating
an issue report at this point we will
have an application with a high level of
security and we would have covered the
fundamentals of authentication and
authorization plus we are familiar with
a series of very common attacks and how
to defend against them so let's then
learn together web security fundamentals
in a fun and practical way join me in
this course and let's get started
defending our application I want to
thank you for watching and I will see
you inside the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
