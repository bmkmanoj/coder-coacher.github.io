lesson we are going to talk about the
load async await mechanism for writing a
synchronous code in a synchronous
looking way these newest sinkovitz
mechanism is essentially syntactic sugar
on top of promises but as we will see in
this lesson it makes it super convenient
to write a synchronous code what we have
here a starting point for this lesson is
the crypto random bytes API email
promise forum so it is in place let's
use these to create the user session we
are going to export this constant so
that it's available also here in the
create user route file and the way that
we could try to use this initially is
after first creating here the user we
are going to then create also here the
session so we could try something like
this we are going to define here a
constant which is a session IV and we
are going to call this function here
random bytes and we are going to
generate here our session IV in order to
do so we are going to have to import
here the random bytes function and we
need to pass in here the number of bytes
that we live let's say that we are going
to create a session with 32 bytes notice
that the result of calling random bytes
gave us back a promise so it did not
give us back the result of evaluating
that promise so in order to do that we
are going to be using the typescript a
weight keyword so what your weight
keyword would do would be to take the
result of evaluating this promise here
so the result would be the session ID
and we would be able to assign it here
to this constant but we have here a
problem notice the error message it says
that a weight is only allowed within in
a sync function now just see that this
would work with could create here an
anonymous inline function so let's do
that we are going to create here a self
evaluated function and we are going to
apply it here the async keyword so if we
will move
here this call to a wait inside of it
now we will not get back the compilation
error so this would work sometimes we
need this trick but in general what we
want to do is instead we want to
refactor this code so that these all
happens inside a function that is
annotated with the a sync keyword so
that we can use a single wait everywhere
and have a more synchronous looking code
so we are already using here another
promise for calculating the password
digest let's list and refactor
everything we are going to create here a
new function we are going to add it here
the a sync keyword in the beginning we
are going to call it simply create the
user end the session and inside this
function we are going to do all the
operations needed for creating the user
and creating the password digest as well
so let's see how we could create the
password digest using the sync await
syntax again we are going to define here
a constant we are going to call it
singly password digest and we are going
to assign it the result of calling here
aragÃ³n to hash so the result would be a
promise here we will need to pass in
here the credentials here to this
function so the result of calling this
hash function would be a promise but
again if we apply here await this is
going to resolve the promise and
assigned to this constant the result
because the function is a sync we don't
get here this error so now in the next
line and without creating here a second
level of implementation we are going to
be able to continue our program so this
effectively solves the callback problem
we are going to be able to create the
user here on the next line we're going
to log it here to the console here we
have the session we are going to need to
store the session somewhere on the
server memory and we can actually
complete here the result of creating the
user by calling the response with the
status 200 and sending back the user
data for that we are going to be needing
the response that is going to be the
first argument passed on to this
function so we can remove here
everything in the else clause and here
is what we are going to do we are going
to call the function that we have here
create user and session and we are going
to pass it in the response and
credential so the function now has
everything that it needs to create the
user we are going to log also here to
the console we are going to log here the
session ID that we just created let's
just see this in action
to see that everything is working
correctly we are logging the session ID
as expected
also this session ID here is not yet a
string we need to convert it into a
string so in order to do that we are
going to add here a 10-block we are
going to take here the bytes that were
generated and we are going to call to
string on the bytes we are going to say
that we want a string in the X format
now let's also remove here this logging
that we had copied pasted here in order
to avoid duplicate logging because we
are also logging everything here at the
create user method so you might notice
that the create user is slightly
different than the version that we
implemented before then it's just here
some extra logic for testing if there
are duplicate users with the same email
but other than that everything is very
similar to what we had and at this point
we have here an a sync function that is
returning a promise and it's being
called here and the result is not being
assigned to anything so we might expect
that when we run the server at this
stage that we would not get anything
created at the level of the database
let's see if that is the case we have
now here a server running let's see what
is the current behavior of the
application we are going to refresh here
the application we will head over to the
sign-up screen and let's create here a
new user
after entering twice the password let's
see what shows up here on the server
we click sign up so as we can see even
though the result of calling the asynch
function will return a promise this code
here was still executed despite of that
this might be a bit surprising but it's
the normal behavior of promises when we
create a promise it's going to be either
resolved or rejected this is unlike the
behavior of observables where we have to
subscribe to be observable in order to
trigger it here with promises we don't
need to do that so we could imagine that
we would have here a ten-block
associated to this promise that was a
sign here an empty function so if we
would come across this inside our
program it would be much more apparent
that indeed this code here would have
been executed so we are going to be
using this normal syntax instead and at
this point we have the session ID
created and we know how to use the async
await functionality with load now what
we're going to do is we are going to
store the session IV in memory on the
server so that we can later retrieve it
we are going to associate the session ID
to a given user and we are going to
somehow link the session ID to the HTTP
request so that subsequent requests by
the same user are going to be linked to
the session ID let's see how we're going
to do that in a safe way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
