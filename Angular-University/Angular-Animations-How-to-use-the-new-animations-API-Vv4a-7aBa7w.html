start implementing the animation of
saving in and out our mobile components
first let's head over here to our
application module so as you can see we
have already imported the browser
animations module and we have added it
here to our root module so we can now
start adding animations to our program
so let's see how we can do that we are
going to be using the angular animations
module which is essentially a DSL or the
main specific language so it provides a
series of functions that can be combined
together to define animations in a
declarative way we are going to define
our animation in a separate file we are
going to call it animations TS so this
file will contain all the definitions of
our animations we are going to be
defining two animations phase-in
animation and a fade-out animation and
then we are going to link that animation
here to the mobile component we are
going to define the animation in a
reusable way so that it could be applied
not only to the model component but to
any other component that we would like
to fade in and out so we are going to
import a couple of functions here from
the angular animations package we are
going to import the animation function
that allows to define animations we are
also going to import the style function
and the animate function so these are
the three functions that we will be
using to define our faith in and fade
out animations let's start with the
definition of fade in so we are going to
define here a constant and we are going
to assign it the output of a call to the
animation function so the output of this
function will return the definition of a
concrete animation this function will
take multiple arguments in this case we
are going to pass it the first argument
which is an array and this array is an
array of the intermediate steps of the
animation so let's start with the
initial step where
to define the initial step using the
style the SL APA we are going to say
that initially as we are saving in the
opacity of the elements that we are
failing in is going to be set to zero
meaning that it's invisible so this is
the first step of the animation then we
are going to define the second and last
step of this animation so there could be
several steps but in this case there are
only two we are then going to define the
final step of this animation where we
are going to say that the opacity of the
element is going to be 1 so the element
will be animated from zero opacity until
opacity of value 1 meaning that it's
fully visible on the screen notice that
what we are defining here is the final
state of the animation so if we want to
go from opacity 0 to opacity 1 we are
going to wrap this style definition here
in a call to animate so animate is going
to take a couple of arguments the first
argument is going to be the duration of
the transition that we want to do let's
add here 500 milliseconds and the second
argument of animate is going to be the
final styles that we want to apply at
the end of this transition and with this
in place we have defined the animation
the phrase in animation which takes in
no parameters so a definition of an
animation could potentially take input
parameters we are going to add that
later on in this course right now what
we're going to do is we are going to
define the phase out animation these
second animation that we are defining
only has one animation step so we are
going to use the animate API call and we
are going to say that in 500
milliseconds we want to go back to a
style where the opacity is set to zero
meaning that the element has been
transitioned and to the point where it's
invisible on the screen and with this in
place we have defined a couple of
animations what we are going to do next
is we are going to see how can we apply
these animations to the model via the
application template let's have a look
at it
is coming right up in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
