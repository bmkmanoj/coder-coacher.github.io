from the angular University
welcome to the complete typescript
course it looks like typescript 2 will
be the language that will finally allow
us to build our front-end and our
back-end full stack all in the same
language this is something that the
industry has been looking for for a very
long time write once run anywhere this
is possible with typescript 2 we can
build our front-end in typescript and
then we can build our back-end we can
build for example a REST API with
typescript and we can access for example
a relational database get back to
results everything in typescript that's
what we are going to learn how to do in
this course we are going to learn the
language features one by one we are
going to group the features together
where it makes sense because many of the
features are really meant to be used
together and don't make so much sense
when learned completely in isolation but
we will add them progressively to our
course we are going to learn the ACMA
script six features that typescript
allows us to use today even though they
are not available for use in all
browsers we are going to dive deep into
the type system of typescript 2 and
cover all the new features of typescript
we are going to build a REST API from
scratch from an empty folder we are
going to build a small front-end that
it's going to call it using angular 2
and we are going to build our program in
node.js and typescript using some very
popular nodejs libraries like Express
and sequel eyes so the API will of
course be a very small API but it gives
you a very good example of how you can
build a program full stack in typescript
sharing a small part of the code between
the front end and the back end defining
custom types we're going to cover all
the new typescript to functionality
including ad types how to install for
party types to make our program
progressively more typesafe we
to learn how to build a program a
full-stack program that takes the most
advantages of the type script to
language the focus will be on functional
programming so the final program will
not be using classes even though we will
also cover object-oriented constructs in
this course with typescript 2 we can
build perfectly typesafe back-end not
using classes using only typescript type
definitions so that's the priority here
in this course we are going to learn how
to build the backend using functional
programming principles and the
typescript 2 type system so without
further ado let's get started we are
going to install typescript
we are going to install an IDE we're
going to be using webstorm we are going
to learn how to configure the IDE and we
are going to dive deep into the language
features starting immediately in the
next few lessons so I want to thank you
so much for taking this course and I'll
see you in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
