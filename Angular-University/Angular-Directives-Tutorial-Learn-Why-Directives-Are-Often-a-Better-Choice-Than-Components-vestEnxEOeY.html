known as attribute directives also known
as decorating directives it's a
mechanism for adding functionality to
existing components or existing plain
HTML elements components are so powerful
that we tend to use them for almost
everything but we should always be on
the lookout for the possibility of
extracting certain functionality from
components in to attribute directives
these will make that functionality much
more reusable for example take a look at
this tab container component we are
going to implement it not as a component
but as a series of free
intercommunicating directives this is
our starting point a plain HTML page
with no functionality as we can see when
we click nothing happens and all three
tabs are shown we are going to make the
tab panel functionality generic by
saying that inside a certain part of the
page delimited by the show one container
attribute directive there are several
elements decorated with a show one
directive that are only visible one at a
time each one has an ID which one is
visible that is determined by the
visible property of this show one
elements and we can switch which element
is visible when we click in an element
decorated with a show one trigger
attribute directive we are going to
identify which show one element is
active and which show and trigger
element is active using the active
property on each under the form of
directives this functionality becomes a
lot more reusable we can take it and
apply it to other components such as for
example a wizard where the same
situation occurs we only want to display
one element at a time the wizard panel
and we want to be able to trigger
activation based on previous and next
buttons first let's implement the show
one trigger directive which takes as an
input and ID Superman Batman or flash
and an optional active flag let's pass
in the ID using at input and let's bind
it to the show one trigger attribute
property
let's also pass the optional flag giving
it a default value of false directives
can interact with the element on which
they are applied and this is known as
their host element in this case we want
to add a click listener to the host
element of show one trigger we're going
to use the a toast listener annotation
for that in this case let's just log to
the console whenever a click occurs now
let's see this in action if we open the
console and we click in one of the tab
buttons we can see that hello world is
being locked to the console now the show
one trigger directive needs to interact
with the show one container directive
whenever the click occurs we want to
notify the container that another show 1
should be displayed for that let's
inject the show one container directive
in the constructor of show 1 trigger
this should only be done if the two
directives are tightly coupled which is
the case here the trigger directive
needs to register itself with the
container one way of doing it is to make
a call to the container here in the
constructor let's implement the add
method we are simply going to push the
trigger into an array of triggers a
better way of doing this will be shown
in a moment let's now implement the
functionality of showing a tab panel
when a tab button is clicked what we
want to do is notify the show 1
container that if the trigger with ID
Batman is clicked
then the show an element with ID Batman
should be shown we can see here
typescript helping us out
show one container is not a show one
trigger property that's because we
injected it in the constructor but we
did not assign it to a property let's do
that and also mark it as private using
the private key word to implement the
show functionality the show one
container needs to have a reference to
its show 1 children for that let's
inject them here directly using add
content children the query list is
dynamic meaning that unlike the case of
manually populating the triggers array
this list will be kept up to date if a
new show one element is added to the
page that will eventually be reflected
back to the list in order to implement
show let's loop through the items on the
list we are going to set the item with
the ID that we just clicked as active
and the other ones as inactive let's add
the ID property to the show one
directive we can see here in the HTML
that it's being passed using the show
one property so let's use add input to
link the show one HTML property to the
ID controller property let's now show or
hide the panel to the user depending on
the value of its active property to
implement this we are going to use the
hidden Dom property check the lesson on
ng-if to understand why it would be
better to implement this by completely
adding or removing the whole panel from
the Dom let's use the host binding
annotation to write to the hidden Tom
property of the host element so the
hidden property will be true if the
active flag is false as we can see here
in this Gator notice that we need to use
the string hidden in the host binding
annotation to specify that the output of
this method should
written to the hidden host dump property
this is not done automatically based on
the name of the method let's see what we
have so far as you can see only the
active panel is being shown and when we
click on the tab button the
corresponding panel gets displayed
let's now mark the active tab button as
active for that we are going to use the
host binding annotation to add the
selected class to the host element if
the flag active is set to true we can
now see the Superman tab button marked
as active with a white background but
when we click on the other tab buttons
they do not get marked as active let's
implement this final feature of our tab
container what we want to do is whenever
show is called we want to loop also over
the triggers and mark the one with the
ID that was just clicked as active and
the others as if active we have now a
working tab container as we can see the
directives functionality just like
components is extremely powerful let's
keep this in mind while building our
components and search for opportunities
to extract functionality into directives
where it can be reused across multiple
components</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
