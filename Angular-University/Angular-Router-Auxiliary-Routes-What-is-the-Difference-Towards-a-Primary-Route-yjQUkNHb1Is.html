angular University and in this lesson we
are going to explain in detail auxiliary
routes in the angular 2 router it's
coming right up so first of all what is
the use case for auxiliary routes let's
give an example for example we go here
to the courses screen we would like when
the user clicks in an item in the
courses list we would like a playlist to
be displayed here in the right-hand side
of the page this playlist is a section
of the page that might contain different
content depending on where we navigate
in the application now we could
definitely add the playlist as a
component inside the courses component
right that would be a solution but
imagine that this section of the page
will always be filled in with a certain
playlist no matter where you navigate in
the application so here in the courses
screen it's showing the playlist of
lessons of a given course but in the
lessons route it might display something
else so the lessons route contains a
list of the latest lessons well the
playlist might display in that case the
list of the most frequently viewed
lessons in other words we want this
section of the page to behave like if it
was a mini browser window with its own
navigation URL separate from the main
URL so that when you go back and forth
to a given route we can match it to a
different component if you find yourself
in this situation where you have
multiple regions of the page that you
want them to react differently to the
URL let's say dialog boxes for editing
forms or the left side menu that you
want to adjust each time that you
navigate this is a good case for an
auxiliary route okay so then let's
configure a route an auxiliary route for
the playlist so we are going to use the
playlist path and when that path is
routed - we are going to associate it to
the playlist
and now we are going to mark this as an
auxiliary route by filling in the outlet
attribute we're going to call this
outlet playlist now to which section of
the page does this outlet correspond to
we're going to configure that by having
a second router outlet tagged to the
page with the name playlist so the only
difference between an auxiliary route
and the standard primary route is that
it must have a name the default route
does not have a name for my definition
and it has its own separate outlet which
specifies the section on the page to
which the routing is going to be applied
well you must be thinking then how do we
access this route using just the URL
let's find out so if we access this page
we are going to see that there is
nothing in the playlist section because
we have not routed to it in our URL we
only specify that we want the primary
route to display the home component but
we did not mention anything about the
secondary route and how could we do that
because after all there is only one URL
in the browser window right how can we
specify the second URL of the auxiliary
route angular provides a special syntax
for that so here inside parentheses we
are going to say first which outlet we
want to route to we're going to say it's
the playlist outlet now we add a colon
and after that we are going to add the
URL of that outlet to which we want to
route to and it's as simple as that
if we try this out now we can see that
the playlist is being displayed as
expected let's give another example
let's say that when we are routing to
the playlist path inside the playlist
outlet we want to display let's say
completely different components the
course is component let's try this out
if we not advocate to playlist
- path inside the playlist outlet we are
going to see again the courses component
so this shows that this outlet really
has its own separate
routing configuration where there is a
separate URL if you enjoyed this
tutorial you can always subscribe to my
channel for more upcoming angular 2
tutorials also have a look at the
website of the angular university to see
what type of angular 2 tutorials you
find there that you might like one key
thing to understand about auxiliary
routes is that they are just plain
routes so they have all the properties
of a standard primary route you can
define channel routes etc you can nest
them one inside the other it's really
like you have a different section of the
page
with a completely separate URL to which
you can provide a completely different
routing configuration we are going to go
deeper in this course in auxiliary
routes this is just beginning actually
in the end of this course we are going
to use auxiliary routes extensively to
build a dashboard with multiple
auxiliary routes next up we are going to
see auxiliary route parameters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
