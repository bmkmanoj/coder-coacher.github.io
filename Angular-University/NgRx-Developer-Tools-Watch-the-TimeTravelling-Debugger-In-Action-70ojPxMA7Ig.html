from the angular university in this
video we are going to have a look at the
ng rx store dev tools in action and the
best place to see this is to go to the
edgy rx example app repository and what
we have here is a demo application of
the ng rx store and many of its
associated ecosystem including the store
dev tools so if we clone the repository
and we npm install it and run it
so it's an angular CLI application we
will have it here running at localhost
4200 now let's have a look at the dev
tools in action if we go to the ng rx
store dev tools repository you'll see
here that we need to install the rebec's
dev tools extension so this is a Chrome
browser extension that you can download
and install so with this with the
application running with the browser
plug-in installed let's have a look at
the dev tools in action and the sample
app so here it is running on port 4200
can go here to the book collection we
can go here to browse books and let's
say that we search here for a book on
Amazon before searching the book let's
see here the dev tools already in action
if we do inspect and here in this menu
we select redux we are going to turn on
the dev tools so there we have it the
dev tools in action we have here already
a couple of actions that were emitted
this is the initial action that the
store emits this is some routing that
happened so the left tools are
integrated with the angular 2 Reuter so
we can do routing via dispatching an
action and when we hit back on the dev
tools when we jump to a certain state we
can also trigger Rueter transitions we
are going to see that in a moment
so the dev tools are integrated with the
router so let's go back here for example
to my collection so currently the
collection
is empty and take a look we have here
actions like open side nav closed side
nav these are triggered via the store as
well you have here update location which
was the transition in the path that we
did from my collection of books to
browse books so let's keep this open and
let's go back here to find a book we are
going to find a book in Amazon let's say
that we are looking for books on drones
so recreational drones we're going to
see here drone for them is aerial
photography and videography let's add a
couple of books to the collection so we
can see here that the different actions
are happening over time so we are going
to click on drones for them is and we're
going to add this book to the collection
now we hit back and we're going to add
here aerial photography for example add
book to collection now let's see the dev
tools themselves in action so we have
here all the actions that are being
dispatched to the store what we can do
here for example is we can inspect the
content of the search complete and we
can see here that this is the data that
was returned from the server and this is
the action the trigger lit now notice
here this slider this is the
time-travelling feature of the dev tools
if we start sliding back so let's hit
here the arrow each time that we hit the
arrow we are returning the application
back to its previous state so you can
see here that we are highlighting the
state where we are at so we click back
and we can time travel through our
application using the dev tools you can
also click a state here in the list and
you will go directly to that state so
let's go back to the beginning we should
be able to see here the actions that we
have been doing over time so we can see
the multiple times that the menu was
opened and we can see the search ongoing
we can see the search result we can see
that the book was added to the
collection etc so this is the time
traveling debugger
in action so the time traveling feature
is just the most spectacular feature of
the dev tools but there are many other
useful features like for example we can
import state let's say that in
production a bug occurred at a certain
state we can import state from a given
client running in production we would
have to record it in production of
course we would have to have
infrastructure to do that in production
but this gives us a hook to easily
record state in productions for let's
say a customer that is having problems
and being able to replay its actions
using this dev tool so the left tools
are extremely powerful let's see what
else we have you can also pause the dev
tools you might not necessarily want to
record all the actions and if you click
here the dispatcher you can dispatch
here manually an action to try it out to
see what happens
you can also save some state that you
have for later usage or maybe for using
it in a unit test to test a particular
error condition that you would like to
make sure that it's working you can
extract here a test so as you can see
there are many features we have only
covered a few in this video but this
gives an idea of what we can do with the
dev tools so the most spectacular
feature is really that time-traveling
debugger when morphing the demo
application is also integrated with the
browser index TV database so this data
here is being saved to our index dB
let's open it here we go here to the
application tab we select index TV you
can see here that there is a books app
database here and we can see here that
there are two books so as you can see
the database contains two books and this
means that if we refresh the browser we
will still get the data here so the data
is being stored here in a database at
the level of the browser in an index DB
database this is being done by this
package here that is also available here
demonstrated in the demo app and grx
slash
so as you can see the development tools
are very powerful if you want to take
the example application for a spin the
repository is ng RX / exemple
