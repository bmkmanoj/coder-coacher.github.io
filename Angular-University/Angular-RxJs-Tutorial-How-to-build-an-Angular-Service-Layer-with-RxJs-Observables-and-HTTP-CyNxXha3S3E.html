angular University and in this lesson we
are going to understand how to use
angular 2 HTTP so the module the
standard module to build our service
layer it's coming right up so we have
learned before that angular 2 HTTP
returns observables so how should we use
it
should we just inject HTTP everywhere
and just call it directly the answer is
no we should use HTTP inside our service
layer and our application our components
should call the service layer and get
back observables the application doesn't
know actually where the data comes from
it can come from a rest back-end it can
come from firebase that is transparent
for the application itself it's the
service that knows where the data comes
from so let's see this in action let's
pass to a list of lessons the lessons
data coming from the backend for that
let's call the lesson service and call
the load lessons method this method will
get us back an observable of lessons so
an observable whose values are arrays of
lessons let's assign this to a variable
lesson dollar again this is an
observable now like any other observable
we need to subscribe to it let's do that
and let's assign the result of the value
returned from the back end to a variable
that we can pass in to our lessons list
the member variable lessons is of type
array of lesson and lesson is just a
plain typescript class that we have
defined we can see it here so in our
success handler we receive the next
value of the stream which is an array of
lessons we are simply going to assign it
to our member variable lessons we are
now going to pass the lessons variable
to our lessons
component and this should print our
lessons to the screen but now what does
exactly the lesson service look like
let's have a look let's now implement
the lowered lessons method in our
lessons service service so what we're
going to see here is typical of how
service learns are often implemented
this is just an option there are other
options we're going to call HTTP so HTTP
stays inside the service layer and it's
not used directly by the components we
call it we call get lessons and we get
back an observable we map it into its
data and we return it this is very
important we return it from the service
layer and the consumer will get an
observable to which it can subscribe
while returning observables from the
service layer it's a good idea to add a
type annotation to specify what is the
type of the data returned in this case
it's an observable of lessons array now
that we have added the type annotation
in the return of our function in the
service layer the application code so
the component that called the service
layer no longer needs to use type
annotations itself the lesson observable
variable will be immediately known by
the typescript compiler as being an
observable of lesson array so this is
type inference at work helping us build
our program if we try this out we can
see now that the lessons data is being
retrieved from the server and injected
into our lessons list as expected now
this concludes our introduction to
observables and HTTP the reminder of
this course of services in detail is
going to be about the several common use
cases of using observables
for example combining multiple HTTP
requests doing an HTTP request after
another but only if the first request is
successful retrying and operation
counseling an operation this is what
we're going to cover right in the next
few lessons who are going to conclude
in the end with an exercise so stay
tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
