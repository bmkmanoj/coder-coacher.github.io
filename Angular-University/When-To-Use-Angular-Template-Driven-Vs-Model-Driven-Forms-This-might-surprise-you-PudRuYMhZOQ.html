from the angular a university and in
this lesson we're going to learn when
should we use template driven versus
model driven or reactive forums and why
it's coming right up let's give an
example for example this is a model
driven forum so all the validations and
all the controls are defined
problematically and we are just binding
those controls to the template using for
example form control name and the form
group
directives now what we haven't done so
far is that we can actually combine
model driven forums and template driven
forms in the same form for example the
mandatory validation for the title field
we can delete it here from the
programmatic declaration so it's no
longer defined in a model driven way but
we can go now to the form itself and we
can add the required attribute and this
will still work let's give it a try if
we clear the title mandatory field we
can see that the validation is triggered
so these proves that we can use both
mechanisms of form building together so
the key thing to understand about
template driven versus model driven is
that those are just two distinct ways of
thinking about forums but your concrete
case might fall somewhere in between for
example you might want the standard
validations like acquired min length max
length and even pattern to be applied in
the template because they don't take
that much space and it makes sense to
add them there but if you have very
specific business logic related
validations like these two fields cannot
have this combination of values
well it's simpler to define that
probably in a model driven way you can
also define it in a template driven way
you can always choose the best scenario
that fits your use case but in general
we want to give some concrete guidelines
so for example
if you are migrating an existing
application from angular 1 to angular 2
you really want to go with template
driven forums at least in an early stage
that's one of the main use cases of
template driven forums actually it makes
it very easy to migrate existing angular
1 forums built using ng model to angular
2 forums that also use ng model and the
banana box syntax and be directional
binding that's really one of the main
use cases now if you have a simple form
in an angular 2 application it only
takes a couple of fields like 3 or 4
fields and it only uses very basic
validation like these fields are
mandatory this field only has this
minimum length if you enjoyed this
tutorial you can always subscribe to my
channel for more upcoming angular 2
tutorials also have a look at the
website of the angular university to see
what type of angular 2 tutorials you
find there that you might like in such a
simple use case you can also use
template driven forms they work
perfectly there is no reason to not use
them but model driven forms were built
to handle cases where the complexity
increases like for example enterprise
applications imagine a very large credit
application with large forms that span
multiple tabs with a ton of fields a lot
of business logic validation so for
example certain fields cannot have this
combination of values that's the clear
scenario for using model driven forms
from the beginning also if you have an
application where you want to add more
modern functionality like autosave or
undo redo you will find it much easier
to add that sort of functionality if you
use reactive forms from the beginning
but remember you can always start simple
using template driven forms and you can
very easily convert a template driven
form to a model
and form and vice-versa and remember
template driven forms and model driven
forms are using under the hood exactly
the same mechanisms that means that for
both you will have a form group
representing the form and you will have
form controls representing the
individual controls so under the hood
they work exactly the same way this also
means that there is nothing that you can
do with template driven forums that you
could not do with model driven forums
and vice versa
this is important to keep in mind it
really depends on what is the simplest
for your use case or what is the
convention that you adopt for your
application that might be a factor as
well we are going to see this in action
in the next exercise that we're going to
do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
