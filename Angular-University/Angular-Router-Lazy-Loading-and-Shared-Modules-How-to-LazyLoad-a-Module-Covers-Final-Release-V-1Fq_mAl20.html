from the angular University and in this
lesson we are going to learn about one
of the most useful features of the
angular 2 router lazy loading it's
coming right up so what is lazy loading
and why is it useful imagine this
situation you have an application that
grows in size over time you will
eventually get to size in your
application where your startup time
takes a long time and that causes a user
experience issue when your application
grows beyond a certain scale what you
want to do is you want to split it up
into multiple chunks so that not
everything needs to be loaded at once at
startup time take for example this small
application imagine that it's a very
large application actually for example
we would only want to load the courses
functionality if the user clicks for the
first time on the courses menu like that
we don't have to serve all the
functionality related to courses at
application startup this will reduce the
application startup time and it would
improve the user experience let's give a
concrete example let's extract the
courses functionality and put it in a
lazy loaded module and let's see what
that means in practice at runtime so you
can see here that the root module of our
application the application module is
importing the courses module let's take
a look at this module so it contains all
the courses related functionality such
as the courses courses list and course
detail component and we can see that the
common module is being imported so this
is a normal feature module that is being
loaded together with the rest of the
application so what we are going to do
now is we are going to configure the
router to lazy load this module the
courses module so the first thing that
we need to do is to remove the import of
the common module from our application
root module
this way there is no reference between
our application and this common module
the second step for making a module lazy
loaded is to configure the router to do
so so we need to go here to the router
configuration and we need to remove all
the routing configuration that relates
to courses in place of this
configuration we are simply going to
configure the following if any URL
starting with courses is hit we are
going to load this module and via the
property lowered children we are going
to point to the courses module file next
we want to take the routing
configuration which is specific of
courses and for the moment we are going
to define it in a route config variable
inside the courses module file what we
want to do also is to take any services
or any injectables that were specific of
the courses functionality and will only
be used by the courses functionality we
want to take them out of the providers
of the route module and we want to move
it to the providers of the courses
module be sure to see the next lesson on
shared modules and lazy loading because
this will not always be the way that you
want to do this but these two route
cards are specific of the courses
functionality so it's okay to put them
here in the courses module so there we
have it we have everything set up so
let's see lazy loading in action let's
try this out so if we now load the
application only the functionality
related to home and lessons to these two
menu options with loaded if we now hit
the courses menu we are going to trigger
the lazy loading of the courses module
so let's inspect the network tab and see
this in action as you can see only when
we click courses is the courses module
loaded and then the components of the
courses module follow but we can also
see here that there is
error in the console let's inspect it so
we have here the error message cannot
find default in the lazy loaded module
so what is the cause of this remember
when we configure this module to be lazy
loaded via load children we only define
the name of a file but a file might have
multiple exports there could be multiple
constants classes etc defined as exports
in the same file so this error means
that the file was found and it was
loaded but we don't know which export of
this file to take into consideration to
fix this we need to mark the courses
module with the default keyword this
will make it the default export of this
file so let's now try this out to see if
it's working if we try this out we can
see that we get a different error here
what happens is that the courses module
functionality does not know the router
link directive so even though we have
imported the routing directives in our
application module this does not mean
that a module that gets imported by the
application module also knows the same
set of directives that's why for example
we had to import common module inside
the courses module to recognize standard
directives so this means that we also
need to import the routing directives
inside the courses module also we need
to pass in the routing configuration for
the courses functionality you'll notice
that the variable is still unused so in
order to do both of these things we are
going to call router module for shell
and inside we are going to pass in the
routing configuration for the courses
functionality
what for child will do is that it will
add this configuration to the already
existing application configuration
without overwriting it if we now try
this out we are going to run into a
difference issue let's take a look at
the error message it says if lessons
list is a web component at
cetera so this means that lessons list
is not known inside the courses module
as a component because we have not added
it to its declarations let's now do that
and see what happens if we now try this
out we can see that we get another error
and this time the error says type
lessons list is part of Declaration in
two modules this is because we have
added lessons list both to the root
application module and to the courses
feature module and one component can
only belong to one module so how can we
solve this what we need is a shared
module that contains components that are
used by multiple modules of the
application to fix this last problem
with lazy loading setup we need to start
by removing lessons list from both the
application module and the courses
module we are going to create a new
module shared module we are going to do
that in a separate file we are going to
simply annotate it also with ng module
the Shedd module is simply a feature
module like we saw before that contains
one component lessons list in order to
use it we need to import it both in our
application root module and in our
courses module which is lazy loaded we
now have everything in place for lazy
loading to work so let's see it in
action if we refresh the application and
we now hit the courses menu we can see
that the courses module and all its
components are being correctly lazy
loaded let's confirm that everything is
working correctly
using the dev tools so if we inspect the
network tab we can see that the courses
module is only lazy loaded when we click
on the courses menu and also we have no
errors on the console and so here we
have it lazy loading in action there is
one final pitfall that concerns shared
modules and the Declaration of services
inside them and lazy loading in general
and we are going to cover that in the
next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
