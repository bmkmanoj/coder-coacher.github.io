we are going to learn about the main
advantage of using NPM 5 or higher and
why we can use it now instead of the
yarn package manager at this point we
have closed the repository of the
angular security course so if I do
NPM - V we are going to see that it's
adopt version of the 5 release and this
version number is going to be extremely
important for this course because we
want to have at least version 5 this is
because we will be using this package
lock JSON file if we want to upgrade our
NPM version to the latest which is
always a good idea to catch all the bug
fixes that were lately released what we
can do is NPM install - g for global
installation and then we are going to
install the npm module so here we are
using NPM to upgrade itself and this
will bring us the latest NPM version
after a while the NPM installation will
be completed and we can see that if we
now do NPM - V we are going to see that
we have the 5.3 dot overton so we have
the latest version of NPM installed this
is always a good idea to make sure that
we have the latest functionality of the
package manager with this in place we
are now ready to install our
dependencies so we are going to simply
do NPM install and this is going to
install all the dependencies according
to the contents of the package locked up
JSON file so it's very important that
you don't edit this file manually this
file is the equivalent of the erm log
file so it provides essentially the same
functionality we can open it up to see
what it contains
so it's a JSON file that contains the
exact versions that are meant to be
downloaded in your machine so that you
are sure that whenever you install the
lessons code you will have the
that same dependency tree that I have
here on my machine so this is a great
feature to use not only for the course
but for all your projects in general
because it ensures that you will never
run into semantic versioning issues
where the dependencies on one machine
are not exactly the same dependencies
that are installed on another machine
this could be another developer machine
or even a build server so you will never
run into problems caused by dependency
version differences so I really
recommend you to upgrade to the latest
version of NPM 5 and start using this
feature which was only recently
introduced but it's really an essential
feature for your project we really want
to avoid semantic versioning issues as
much as possible because those problems
are very time consuming to troubleshoot
so it is in place let's start the
development server and do a guided tour
of the sample application that we have
here before starting adding security
features to it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
