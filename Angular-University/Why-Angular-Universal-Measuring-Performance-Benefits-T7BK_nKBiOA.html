starting to transform our angular
application into an angular universal
application let's learn about reasons on
why would we want to do that in the
first place why angular Universal what
are the main benefits in order to
understand the advantages of angular
universal let's switch here to a larger
window where we can inspect our page
using the chrome dev tools let's then go
over the first reason for using angular
Universal probably the most common
reason for doing server-side rendering
is performance let's have a look for
example at this application this is an
angular single page application that is
fetching all its data from fire store
now whenever we refresh the application
we are going to see that after we get
here this initial blank page it still
takes a moment for us to see some data
on the screen we could see that we had
there a lag of several seconds but let's
remember that we are running this
application in development bold let's
then measure the time for first render
on this application when we run it in
production mode let's switch over to our
IDE we are going to head over here to
the terminal and we are going to serve
the application in production mode in
order to do that we are going to run the
command ng serve - - prod this is going
to build our angular application in
production mode and it's going to start
the development server so we can see
here that we already get the warning
that we don't use this server in
production because it's meant for
development purposes after a while the
production build is going to be
completed and we can see that this is
indeed the production build because we
are going to have here these hashed
files as the output that gives them an
unique name so if we now switch back to
the browser and we were in lower the
application we are now going to have the
application running in production mode
and as we can see the data was displayed
a bit faster than before but let's
measure exactly how fast we're going to
head over here to the performance tab
and we're going to profile our applet
with screenshots so we are going to stop
the profiler at the moment that we see
the full application let's now try to
measure when did we have data to display
to the user around here the one second
and 300 milliseconds mark we can see
that the application was fully rendered
we can see that we have here on the
screen shot all the course cards and of
course the images are still being
downloaded from the local host server
that's still going to take some time so
the application ended up renting here at
around the 4 second mark but we can see
that the angular application remained as
a blank page until the one second and a
hundred milliseconds or 200 milliseconds
mark and that the application was fully
rendered at the level of the Dom at
around 1.2 seconds and this is the best
case scenario where we are serving the
Java Script bundles from local servers
so there is almost no network overhead
let's switch here to the network tab and
have a look here at the production
bundles of this angular material
application we can see here the CSS
bundles and the JavaScript bundles of
this application so these files would
take a lot longer to download in a
production application not running on
localhost and we would have a initial
rendering time much higher than 1.2
seconds so this is the first reason on
why would we want to use angular
Universal to show some content to the
user as fast as possible this is
essential especially on mobile devices
let's remember this page that gets
served initially is essentially empty if
we do view page source and we have a
look here at the HTML that got sent from
the server we can see that this is a
completely empty page with just a couple
of script tags and a CSS bundle we can
see here that the only HTML that we have
here is the application root component
which is empty and that explains this
blank page that we can see here on the
performance tab this initial blank page
happens because there is nothing to show
to the user at this point in time at
this point we only have the source that
came from the server and this does not
contain any HTML and also it does not
contain any CSS because have a look here
is the bundle with all the CSS that
still needs to arrive from the server
with angular Universal we are going to
improve a lot the situation we are going
to bring back from the server a lot more
HTML and CSS we are going to be able to
display to the user this initial page
faster so this is the first reason for
using angular Universal for improving
the perceived startup performance of our
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
