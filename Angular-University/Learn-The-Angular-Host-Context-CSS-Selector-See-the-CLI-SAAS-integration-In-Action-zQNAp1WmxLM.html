lesson we are going to cover the angular
CLI SAS integration we are going to have
a look at the several features of sass
and we are going to see how those
features help us to write more readable
and more maintainable styles for our
components
let's now complete the read theme by
adding here some styling also to the
border so now let's try to sell the
situation where we have the input focus
added to our input box let's change the
color of the shadow to be of a red tone
so if we now try this out we reload the
application and we can see that the
shadow is still of a blue tone and that
is because we are trying to apply this
class here to a child element of the
host element if we want to apply this to
the host element itself we need to
remove this place here so if we hit ctrl
s we're going to see that now the shadow
is red as expected now as you can see we
are starting to have here a little bit
of repetition we are rewriting here the
host context red theme selector again if
you want to improve a bit to readability
of our styles we can use the sass
integration of the angular CLI and to do
that we simply have to rename this file
to have the extension s CSS so sassy CSS
or sass for short if we simply rename it
and we can also make it a sass partial
by adding an underscore to it to follow
the conventions of sass the usual
conventions of sass so as you can see
everything is still working as expected
but this is now a sass file so we can
use all the features of sass let's for
example define a variable for that color
we are going to simply say that the
border color for this theme is going to
be red now we can reduce variable here
inside this template let's try it out we
are going to replace all the occurrences
of red with this variable here so this
is one of the many features of
says that helps us to write more
maintainable CSS so we can define
variables just like in a JavaScript
program another feature is for example a
nested Styles which usually we tend not
to leave when we are defining styles
inside a component because these Styles
already are very specific but in this
case for example we are repeating here
this selector so it would make it more
readable if we could take this style
here and nest it inside this style so
this is the parent style this is the
shell style now because we don't want to
apply the input focus to a child element
of this shell style but to the element
itself we are going to use the ampersand
sass syntax here so this will create a
selector which was identical to having
here input focus like we have just below
so if we now try this out by hitting
control space we are going to see that
everything is still working as expected
and these are only a few examples of how
to use sass and it's multiple features
to better style our components what
we're going to do next is we are going
to have a deeper look into how the
component styling mechanism works all
the isolation of the Styles work and
what are the different isolation modes
that we can have for creating angular
components let's have a look at it this
is coming right up in the next lesson
