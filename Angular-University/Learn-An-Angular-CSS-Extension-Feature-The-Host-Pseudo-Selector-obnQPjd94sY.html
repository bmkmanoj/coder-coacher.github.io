continue learning about angular
component styling so style isolation is
not the only feature that the way that
angular handles styling brings us let's
learn in this lesson as simple extension
to HTML that will allow us to write
simpler CSS in our component style
sheets let's remember the component
style sheet is specific to only the
components let's have a look at the host
pseudo selector angular styling feature
right now let's continue styling here
our component so as you can see for the
moment we have here this border at the
level of the input of our component so
the input that sits next to the icon we
would like to remove this border we
would like to remove the outline of the
component and we would like instead to
wrap around this complete component so
around the input and the icon we would
like to add a border that is in every
way similar to the one that we have here
and also notice this blue selection
whenever the input has focus we would
like to reproduce that behavior too in
our custom component so how can we do
that because we have learned that these
styles that we put in here are applied
to elements inside the component and
what we want to do here is not to style
any element inside the component but we
would like instead to style the host
element of the component itself so let's
select it here we would like to style
the whole ausa input directive so this
gets an HTML element that we are
essentially creating to extend HTML with
our own tags we would like to style this
element so one solution would be maybe
to wrap everything in a div and style
the div but angular provides us a better
way let's have a look at it we have here
these special selectors that we can use
these special CSS selectors that will
allow us to style the host
of the directive or the component so
let's start exploring those special
selectors that angular has available for
us so the first one is the host - the
selector so this selector will allow us
to style the host element of the
component itself so the HTML tag that we
have defined here this HTML tag so let's
start using the host selector to define
a border around the whole component so
we are going to say that this has a
border of 1 pixel solid light gray so
let's try this out we are simply going
to hit ctrl s and as you can see now we
have a border around the whole input but
we still have this border the default
browser border that browser add to any
input we still have it there so we would
like to delete this so that we have only
one border so let's quickly add those
styles we are going to say that any
input inside the font awesome component
is going to have no border and let's try
this out just see how this looks on the
screen so as you can see it's looking
better we still have here this outline
and the border the bottom border is not
visible for example in chrome so in
order to fix this let's add here a
little bit of padding in the bottom of
the whole element so just one pixel of
padding in the bottom so now we have
here a clearly defined border for our
whole input but take a look we still
have here this outline defined so we are
going to add here outline then as well
so now we have here the initial look and
feel of the component so we currently
don't have the focus functionality but
at least we don't have that outline that
was making the input not look like a
normal input so we are going to add that
functionality later right now let's
continue styling our component and let's
talk a bit about component styling best
practices and how to split up the styles
into multiple different types of styles
and learn another extended CSS features
of angular this is coming right up
in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
