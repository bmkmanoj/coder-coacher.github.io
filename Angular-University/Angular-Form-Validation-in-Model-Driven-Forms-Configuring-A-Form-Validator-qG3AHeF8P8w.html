University and in this lesson we are
going to talk about how to do form
validation with model-driven or reactive
forums so stay tuned it's coming right
up we can define the validation rules of
our form controls programmatically at
the level of the form control so the
second argument that you pass on to the
form control constructor is an array
containing a list of validators and
validators are just playing functions so
the previous validators that we saw were
required pattern max length etc we can
import those validators from the forms
module let's see here we're going to
import validators not acquired there are
others validators not min length max
length pattern all this functionality is
available here for configuration
actually internally this code here that
performs this validation this is also
called by the set of directives that we
have seen before apply directly at the
template level like the acquire
attribute
min length max length pattern internally
those directives call these validators
that we are configuring here it's the
same code let's see this in action if we
try this out we can see that all the
validation functionality is working
mandatory fields are being marked as
read if empty and we can only type
numbers into the duration field so this
works just like template driven forms
but take for example a more complex case
where maybe we would like to add a
validation to a certain form field but
only in a certain condition depending on
the data now that's a more advanced use
case that actually happens a lot in
practice and that we would not be able
to do with template driven form
validation if you enjoyed this tutorial
you can always subscribe to my channel
for more upcoming angular 2 tutorials
also have a look at the website of the
angle
University to see what type of angular2
tutorials you find there that you might
like actually everything in principle
that you can do with model driven forms
you can also do with template driven
forms but in the case of this example it
would probably be much harder you are
probably still thinking okay that's
great but why are they called reactive
forms we're going to go into it in the
couple of next lessons so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
