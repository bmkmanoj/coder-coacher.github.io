led and the const keywords that we have
been mentioning so far but we didn't say
what are those keywords useful for so
let's do that right now before going any
further so plain JavaScript just has a
VAR keyword that allows you to define a
variable and what could go wrong with
declaring a variable right that's one of
the base functionalities of any language
well the VAR keyword in ACMA script 5 so
plain JavaScript it has a problem
compared to equivalent features of other
languages let's have a look at it let's
write a slightly more complex program
where we are going to test for the value
of message so we are entering here a
block so in this block here we want to
define another variable which let's say
we are going to call it E and we're
going to define it as a number using a
type annotation now I will just paste in
here some very simple code that it's
just a for loop it's going to loop
through the eve area below and it's
going to print it three times to the
console so let's try this out notice
that you don't need to run again the
typescript compiler from the command
line your IDE is actually continuously
compiling the program so any changes
that you made to the program you simply
hit ctrl s to make sure that it's saved
and that will trigger a new hello -
world file with your latest changes so
you can simply refresh the browser and
you can see here that we have printed to
the console the value of the e variable
0 1 2 which is what we would expect but
now take a look this variable here e
number that we have defined inside this
scope this block this is actually still
visible outside the block scope which is
rather surprising for developers coming
from other languages other than Java
Script let's print it out to see what's
going on if we simply print e to the
screen after this
Loup we would expect maybe that this
would be undefined because this is a
block scope variable but take a look the
value of e is still present there okay
so this means that e the e variable is
visible outside the scope of this block
this is because in plain JavaScript
using the VAR keyword the VAR keyword is
not block scoped so if you define
several blocks several if blocks that
are nested inside each other and you
would like to have a local variable that
is only visible inside the block scope
that is not possible with the VAR
keyword and that is exactly the problem
that the let keyword solve so if now
instead of declaring E as a var we
declare it using the let keyword take a
look at what happens so this is still a
variable but you now get an error here
cannot find name e so E is now a block
scoped variable so it's not visible
outside this block the if block it's not
visible in this statement here the
console dot log block scoped variables
are possible using the led keyword this
might lead to the question should we
still use the VAR keyword while doing
typescript programs I don't think so I
think that if you have a variable you
should always make it a block scoped
variable and use the let keyword var is
just there for backwards compatibility
with plain JavaScript does this mean
that we should declare all our variables
using let well actually I am going to
suggest to you to prefer another keyword
by default instead of lead so one of the
best practices of developing programs
that are easier to read them to maintain
is to avoid mutable state so if we
declare here this variable as a Const we
have effectively declared it as a
constant so this means that this
variable is only populated at
initialization time and then later in
the program if we try to reassign it to
another string so the empty string would
be a valid valid for a string but we
have here
left-hand side of assignment cannot be
at constant so const is really a simple
way of declaring a block scope immutable
variable so let's summarize the three
key words VAR let and Const so where
does not have block scope it should not
be used while building new typescript
programs you should either choose let or
Const instead and which one of the two
two-shoes we should use Const if we want
to declare the variable as being
immutable and this is generally a good
idea to set a variable its value and
initialize it only once and try to build
our program without relying on variable
mutation this is generally a good
approach that leads us to less bugs but
if we need mutable variables block
scoped mutable variables we can do that
using the led keyword one important
thing to bear in mind about Const is
that when we apply it to a variable that
it's an object only the object reference
is immutable try to assign message to
now we get back the never saying that we
cannot do a second assignment to a
constant after it has been initialized
but let's say that for example we want
to change the property hello let's try
that as you can see the program compile
so declaring message as cons does not
mean that the whole object is immutable
it's only the reference to the object
which is immutable so to further
illustrate this let's say that we
declare here a second reference to the
same object and we make it not a
constant but a variable so we use let
and we are going to point it to message
now these second reference to the same
object can be mutated because it's
declared with LED
so if we say message two equals null as
you can see the program compiles
successfully so it's important to
understand that Const is not about deep
immutability of an object it's really
about creating an immutable reference an
immutable variable
so I hope that this explains the
difference between the free keywords and
when to use each if you would like some
of the code of this lesson you have here
the gift tag section - one - - where you
can go directly to this version of the
hello world program so now let's
continue exploring more features of
typescript more features of the ACMA
script 6 standard that we can already
use today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
