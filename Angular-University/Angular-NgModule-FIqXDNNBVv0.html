from the angular University and in this
lesson we are going to learn how to
create our own angular 2 module but most
of all we are going to learn why would
we want to do that
why it's useful it's coming right up so
far we have been using the standard
angular 2 modules such as the browser
module or the HTTP module and we did
create our own module the application
root module but this is not the only
modules that might make up our
application imagine that you have
created a set of reusable widget
components that's a good case for
creating a module because you want a set
of components to be available to several
parts of your application or even to
several applications now those
components might be internally composed
of smaller components that you don't
want necessarily to expose to the users
of your component such type of module is
also known as a feature module let's
give an example in our small application
we are going to create a lessons module
this lessons module will contain one
component the lessons list and it will
contain one service the lesson service
an angular 2 module is simply a class so
let's write a class lessons module in
order to make it a module we need to
annotate it with the ng module
annotation the first thing that we need
to configure in ng module is which
components directives and pipes are
known to this module so we are going to
configure the declarations property and
we are going to add it in the lessons
list component next we need to configure
the lessons service for that we need to
configure the providers property and
inside it we are going to pass it in a
list of injectables that we need to add
to the dependency injection system of
angular so we are going back to our
application
module and we are going to remove the
provider for lesson service we're going
to add it in to the module one word of
caution here you might not always want
to add providers to your module we're
going to see that in the lazy loading
and shared modules upcoming lesson now
for this concrete case we are going to
try this module out so let's see if this
is working we are going to have the
lessons module to the application module
and we're going to start our application
try to guess what happens if we refresh
the page we can see that there is an
error and let's inspect the air it says
can bind to NG for off this means that
angular does not recognize the ng for
directive and we thought this directive
is implicitly available everywhere in
angular so how can a angular not
recognize this directive inside lessons
list because it's inside lesson lists
only that this problem is occurring the
reason for that is that lessons list
belongs to the lessons module and the
lessons module did not import the
angular common module so it does not
know the ng for directive so if we
import the common module this error will
be fixed if we now try this out we see
that we get a second error and why is
that it's because the lessons list
component is not recognized by angular
but how can it be because it's part of
the lessons module that we are importing
the problem is we have not declared the
lessons list component as being part of
the public API of the module so it
remains private to the module it will be
visible inside the module but not to any
other importing parts of the application
in order to mark it as public we need to
declare it inside the export array
property if we now try this out we can
see that everything is working as
expected our application is working as
expected and
refactoring is successively completed we
can see our modules can be useful in
structuring our application by allowing
us to split it into several reusable
parts but in the lazy loading lesson of
the router course we are going to learn
why that might also help us improve the
performance of our application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
