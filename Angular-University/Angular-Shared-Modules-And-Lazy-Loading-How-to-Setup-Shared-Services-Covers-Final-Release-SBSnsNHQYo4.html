going to cover lazy loading and services
we are going to see how should we
configure our services in the case that
we have a shared module that is used in
both the root application or one of its
synchronously loaded feature modules and
other modules that are lazy loaded it's
coming right up let's first understand
the problem that we are trying to solve
so take a look at this simple example
the lessons service this is a simple
service we are just going to log a
message to the console in its
constructor we are going to take this
service and we are going to add it to
the providers of both our lazy loaded
module the courses module and to our
root application as well
the lessons service like most services
but not all is meant to be an
application wide singleton
this is probably the most common use
case for a service so we are going to
use this service in multiple places of
our application let's inject it in the
courses component and also in the main
component of our application if we now
try this out we are going to receive an
error in the console no provider for
lessons service this means that we have
not configured the dependency injection
system to be able to inject the lessons
service in the application because the
lessons service is shared by both the
application root module and the lazy
loaded course module we are going to add
it to the providers of the shared module
if we now try this out we are going to
see something that can be quite
surprising at the initial application
startup time we have the creation of one
instance of the singleton lessons
service as expected but take a look at
what happens if we now click on the
courses menu triggering below a link of
the courses module what happens is that
we have two more instances of lessons
service
created so what is going on here because
lesson service is supposed to be an
application wipe singleton so why two
instances when instance comes from the
fact that we have added lesson service
to the providers of course module and
the second instance comes from the
shared module which we have imported
into the courses module in order to fix
this we need to understand what's going
on here
whenever we lazy load a module what
angular will do is it will create a
dependency injection sub context for
that particular module which is a shell
context of the root dependency injection
module so in a lazy loaded module with
providers the services inside those
providers are only visible to the module
itself this is unlike when we import a
feature module not vile is loading in
that case the services will be injected
in a global dependency injection pool
why does this happen why is the
dependency injection behavior different
for the case of lazy loaded modules
there is a good reason for that imagine
that a lesson service implementation
used by the main application is actually
a completely different implementation
than the lesson service used by the lazy
loaded module those might be two
different versions of the same service
for example when we lazy load a module
we want to make sure that none of the
services that it brings overwrite
anything in the main application
otherwise we might fall into very hard
to troubleshoot error situations where
the behavior of our application is
dependent upon the sequence of
navigation actions that triggered lazy
loadable modules the first thing that we
need to do to fix this issue is to
remove lesson service from the list of
providers of the shared module we're
going to create a static four root
method
that is going to return a module with
providers object so the ng module
property is the module itself with all
its component definitions and here we
give the providers that are associated
to the module so if someone simply
imports the shared module it would not
receive the lesson service so how can
the main module still have access to the
lesson service well instead of importing
shared module we now need to call shared
module dot for route this means that the
application module will see all the
components of the shared module and the
lesson service will still be
instantiated and added to the global
dependency injection pool just like
before the difference is that now
whenever we import the shared module
into the courses module which is being
lazy loaded a duplicate instance of
lesson service will not be creative but
courses module will still see the
components of the shared module one last
thing let's remove this declaration of
lesson service from the providers list
as well if we now try this out we will
see that we still have only one instance
of lessons service being created at
application startup time but if we now
select the courses menu we are going to
trigger the lazy loading of the courses
module we can see that no more instances
of lessons service were created and this
is the behavior that we intended meaning
that lesson service is an application
white singleton it's the same instance
that gets used in our main application
module in any feature module that is
synchronously loaded and also in any
module that gets lazy loaded and so
discovers lazy loading and the router as
we can see it's a very useful feature
for improving the performance of large
applications and it's very simple to
configure in the router we are now going
to go over an X
sighs to put several of the concepts of
routing together it's coming right up
in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
