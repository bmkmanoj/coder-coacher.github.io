from the angular Academy this lesson we
are going to learn the template syntax
for events we are going to learn how
components can output custom events
coming right up what we want to do here
is to add a click handler to the Clear
button so when the user types something
in the search box and click clear that
value is erased
to do that let's add a click handler
using the parantesis syntax so inside
the parentheses we can specify the event
to which we want to respond in this case
the click event this could be Mouse down
mouse up mouse over keydown keyup or any
standard Dom event in order to clear the
input box we are going to pass it as a
reference inside the clear method for
that we need to give it a name and we
can do that using the hash tag syntax so
hash tag box assigns the name box to the
input to clear the value of the input we
just assign the empty string value to
the input box let's see this in action
if we type something in the search box
and we now click clear the value is
deleted now let's say that our component
search box has an output event called
search which is the content of the
search box whenever the user types on it
and presses enter other components that
are interested in receiving the latest
search will subscribe to this custom
event to create custom events we need an
output event emitter we can create one
in our component by creating an event
emitter instance and annotating it with
at output decorator now let's start by
detecting when a new search is available
to implement this
let's start by detecting the keydown
event on the input box and specifically
the enter key and remember this syntax
because we are going to need it in an
upcoming exercise now when the user
clicks
enter while typing on the input box we
are going to trigger an Unser's method
and we are going to pass it int the
value of the input box for the moment
let's just output it to an alert box to
see this in action if we now type
something in the search box and press
ENTER then the alert box will be
displayed what we want to do now is
instead of showing an alert box we want
to generate an output event for that we
simply use the emit method of event
emitter and we pass it in the value of
the new search now a component that is
interested in subscribing to this output
event will use the same syntax used for
Dom events so with parentheses we are
going to subscribe to the search output
event and the name of the event is
determined by the name of the output
event emitter property let's add an
event handler to the search event when a
new search is available we are going to
trigger the Unser's method and we are
going to pass it in the value of the
last search and we have it available in
dollar event dollar event contains
whatever we have passed to the event
when we triggered it via the emit method
to see this in action let's simply take
the output of the custom search event
and output it to an alert box so the
alert box will contain the value of the
search when the user pressed enter now
this is the tip that we mentioned in the
beginning of the lesson take a look at
this syntax in typescript with backticks
and strings this is called a string
literal and we can output variables in
the body of the string using the dollar
curly brace syntax if we now type on the
search box and click enter we can see
that the output of the search box shows
in the alert box as expected we now know
how to handle events in angular 2 and
how to create our own custom event
next we are going to see how we can
organize our component templates how can
we add CSS styles to the component and
we are going to see a larger example
with a more complex component tree
everything coming right up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
