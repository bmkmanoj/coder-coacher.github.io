angular Academy we are going to set up a
beginner friendly angular 2 playground
coming right up
in order for you to try angular 2
quickly we are going to set up a simple
playground this playground aims that we
at the sweet spot for learning purposes
for someone just starting with angular 2
so don't use this in production the
playground starts quickly it creates a
bundle with the angular 2 library
dependencies and then your application
is recompile each time that you save
changes in a typescript file so you have
a fast application start up with only a
few HTTP requests and at the same time
you still have a fast development
turnaround so it seemed to be a good
experience for someone starting out you
can get the playground at this URL right
here and you can either clone it if
you're into gate or you don't load it as
a zip file like with it here next you go
into the directory of the playground and
having node an NPM installed on your
machine you're going to type NPM install
and these will install the playground
which does not need any global
dependencies to start the playground we
just use the standard and VM command NPM
start and the playground will be
available at port 8080 let's try it out
we can see here that when we type in the
input box that change detection is
working now take a look at the network
tab you have here a bundle containing
angular 2 rxjs that was prepared at
startup time and that it will not be
recalculated while we are making changes
into the playground if we change our
component and we hit control s
typescript will be triggered and the
changes will be compiled when we refresh
the browser our changes are visible once
angular CLI is stable I'm going to show
you how to setup a playground using it
but right now it's still at an early
stage of development
so while we don't have it enjoy angular
2 using ng 2 minimal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
