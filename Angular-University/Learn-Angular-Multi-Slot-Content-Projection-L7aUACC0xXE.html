introduce a new angular feature
multislot projection so let's have a
look we are going to open the model here
is what we would like to implement we
would like to implement here at closing
mechanism for this model we would like
to implement here a small cross icon
that whenever we click it the model will
be closed so it's a very common
functionality there are many first party
libraries such as font awesome or the
Google material icons for implementing
such close icon for example here we are
already using in our index.html the font
awesome icons and they are here so that
we can have this font awesome input and
we have the icons here available so here
at the level of the model component we
would not want to have to bring
third-party dependency SVG font
dependency in order to be able to have
the close icon so the way that we are
going to implement this is we are going
to provide the possibility here at the
level of the public API of the model we
are going to give here the possibility
of specifying a custom close icon so
let's see what that would look like we
are going to provide here at the level
of the content of the model we are going
to provide the icon tagged so this is
the ancient italic formatting tag that
has been meanwhile reused for icons it's
a very common pattern so we are going to
be fine here an icon tag and let's say
that this icon tag would have the font
awesome and font awesome times icon so
this corresponds to a little cross
because we will see now what the mobile
component will do is here in the
template here at the level of the model
body we are going to take via projection
we are going to take that icon tag and
we are going to use ng content as we
have used before but we are going to add
here a content selector property so we
are going to select here the eye
contacts that
present here in the content part of the
model so in this case this would
correspond only to this icon tag right
here and this would not interfere here
with the use of ng content so the way
that this works is ng content will take
everything that was not selected by any
of the selectors so if we go back here
and we take here the content of the tab
by now let's remove this from inside the
template and let's switch it back here
to the content part of the model so what
will happen is that this selector here
at the level of the header of the model
body using this select property is going
to query the content part and it's going
to retrieve the icon the clothes I held
and then ng content will take everything
else on the content of the model that
did not correspond to any selectors so
we could have multiple types of
selectors we could do a selector based
on a given attribute property we could
have selectors based on CSS classes this
time we have used a selector based on a
particular HTML element the icon element
so before trying this out
let's switch here to the application
component and we were still passing here
accidentally the body property so we
were passing in here an empty template
by removing the body property the
content of the model will come now via
ng content so let's try this out if we
open here the model we are going to see
that we have here indeed a close icon as
we can see this projection slot here is
projecting here the icon which is coming
here from the content part of the model
and the rest corresponds to this
template here where we are projecting
the reminder of the content here via ng
content so if we now go back here to the
application component let's see that
this is still working if we pass a
template so let's remove this here from
the content part of the model and let's
paste it back here at the level of the
template now we leave the proper
the body again so we need to pass him
the authentication model body via this
template reference property here so
let's try this out if we open the model
we can see that everything is still
working as expected
but now the body of the model is coming
from the template and not via this
default projection slot now with this in
place
let's now implement the closing
functionality of the clothes I can but
before them so let's fix its positioning
so what we want to do in this case is we
want to position the icon here to the
top right so that is the typical
positioning of the close icon
notice also let's add here a div here at
the level of the close icon that is
going to wrap the projected content to
the projected I can element we're going
to have here a class we are going to
call it close I hen simply and given
this class we are now going to add here
some styles that are going to be
applicable to protected content so as we
have seen before in order to define such
a style we start with the host modifier
then we apply here the CSS class of the
div to which we want to limit our
styling we are going to use the deep
modifier and we are going to target all
the icon tags inside the close I can
live and these will affect both the
projected icons or any icons that we
might have added manually to the
template so in this case there are only
projected icons via this projection slot
here so the styles that we are going to
add is we are going to simply say that
the position of this icon is going to be
fixed and let's leave a small amount of
space to the top and to the right of the
close icon
we are going to leave 5 pixels for both
sides now let's add also a little bit of
styling to the close icon this itself so
let's set it to 100% and let's give it a
height of let's say 20 pixels so let's
see how this looks like on the screen we
now open the more
we are going to see that the close icon
is now being displayed correctly as
expected we can also add here some
styling to the cursor so let's say that
a pointer should be displayed whenever
we hover over the close icon so we'd be
styling in place
let's see how can we implement the
functionality for closing the model upon
click so what we're going to do here is
we are going to go to the application
component template and we are going to
detect here the click event on the close
icon and whenever this click event
occurs we are going to trigger the close
method here at the level of the model so
we are going to create here a template
reference using the hash and from inside
the click handler we are going to
trigger the closing of the model let's
quickly rename hear this message so
instead of close model
let's hit shift f6 and we are simply
going to rename it to close so this will
refactor all the usages of this method
everywhere and now we can use this
method here we are going to use model
dot close so model being this template
reference that we have just created so
let's try this out if we now open the
model and we hover over here that close
I can let's hit close so as you can see
the model is closing as expected so as
we can see our model component is really
coming along we are still going to add
some features to it we are going to add
namely the feature of passing it some
input parameters so that we can define
which tab should be initially displayed
the login tab or the signup tab
depending on which button was clicked we
are also going to do some preventive
refactoring to make sure that we don't
create memory leaks in programs that are
using the model and we will also add
some tests to this model this is coming
right up in the next few lessons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
