download webstorm so if we head over to
JetBrains comm slash webstorm we have
here the download page of the webstorm
javascript ide
if we hit download we are going to
download a trial version of webstorm
so this is the most stable version of
webstorm that you will find if you want
to try out the latest features of
webstorm you can also search for the
webstore early access program and this
gives you a new version of webstorm that
is not yet released but contains maybe a
lot more features if you want to try
them out in this course I will be using
the stable version of webstorm once we
have webstorm downloaded we are going to
open it and we are going to find a
screen similar to this one saying
welcome to webstorm we're going to click
open and we're going to navigate to the
folder where our code was unzipped in
this case we are going to open the
folder at this location and this is what
the opened project in webstorm will look
like if you hit alt f12 you are going to
open the terminal
that we will be using a lot in this
course now before doing anything else
we're going to setup typescript inside
the IDE so for that what we're going to
do is we are going to first install
typescript so we head over to the
command line and we confirm which
version of node we have installed to do
so we head over to the command line and
we type load - V so this shows that we
are running node 6 dot 9.0 now let's
install typescript globally to begin
with later we are going to learn how to
install it locally to the project and
what are the advantages of it right now
we are simply going to install it
globally by using NPM install - JEE
typescript remember as usual you might
have to throw in here in the beginning
as su do if you are in Mac or Linux so I
will just go ahead and do that and
install typescript globally this should
take a moment
but very quickly you should have
installed your typescript executable
that we will be using in the first few
sections of the course to confirm that
the typescript compiler is installed
correctly you can type TS C - V and you
should see here some version of the
typescript
- compiler so in this case at the moment
of recording we have 2 dot 0 dot free
now in order to ensure you the best
experience possible you should at this
stage before doing anything else
configure webstorm to use the same
version of the typescript compiler as
you will be using from the command line
this is to make sure that you don't get
different error messages in the command
line and in the IDE which would be
rather confusing so you find out where
your typescript executable is so in this
case I have used the which command in a
Mac which would also work if you are
using git bash in Windows so you copy
this path that we will be needing and we
are going to head over here to the
webstorm settings so preferences we are
going to setup typescript here so first
we should use the node interpreter we
should use also the version 6.90 that we
are using from the command line so this
is to avoid discrepancies between the
webstorm environment and the command
line environment so here we will switch
from version 6.3 that one to the version
6.9 not oh that we are also using from
the command line and we are going to set
up a custom version of typescript we are
going to point webstorm to the same
version that we are using from the
command line
so we paste here the path to the TSC
executable but we are not going to click
OK at this point we are going to delete
here a couple of top-level directories
and we are going to open the 6.9 dot Oh
folder so here what we are going to do
is we are going to open Lib and we are
going to drill down to load modules we
are going to find here the type
script folder and here we have a Lib
directory so this is the one that we
should select we click OK so you should
have something like the directory where
your nodejs
is live not modules typescript live and
you will see here that this is the
typescript live directly so this custom
director should point to the typescript
live directly where a couple of files
are found so this is the correct one
we're going to click OK and you have
here a custom version so currently
webstorm is using the custom version of
typescript that we just pointed it to
now we are going to click enable the
typescript compiler and we're going to
see in a moment why this is necessary
for the moment we will not use a TS
config dot J's in' so let's click apply
and ok at this stage you should now see
here at the bottom at typescript pane
where you will see the typescript
project errors so this step that we took
of configuring webstorm to use the exact
same version that we're going to using
the command line of typescript is really
important if you use separate versions
you might get separate error messages
and it would just be confusing so please
take the time to get this setup correct
so that you can better enjoy the course
if you have follow these steps you
should now have a solid develop
environment to take the most out of this
course so let's get started writing our
first typescript program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
