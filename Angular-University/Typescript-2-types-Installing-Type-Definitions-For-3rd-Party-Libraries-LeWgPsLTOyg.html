a great feature of typescript but what
about third-party libraries let's
install here a very commonly used third
party library in our project
it's called lodash this will allow us to
do data manipulation for example to
handle arrays of data in order to
install it with type NPM install lo - -
- save after a moment the latest version
of lo - will be installed and lo - will
be added here as a dependency in our
package Jason now we can use lo - in our
program so let's simply import it here
by using the command GS require
statement we are going to import lo -
and we are going to assign it to this
constant now notice one thing we have
here a typescript error cannot find name
required so the typescript compiler does
not know the require function this is a
node.js specific function we're going to
see how to solve this problem in a
moment first I would like to show you
that despite the fact that there is an
error the compiler is still producing an
output that can be executed so let's say
that for example we have here an array
of colors we could use lo - even though
we have a compilation error we could use
lo - to extract the first color from the
colors array so if we do consult that
log we should expect to see red in the
console if we try this out we can see
that the color red is being printed
which shows that the program is still
working
despite the compilation error now we
might not want this behavior we might
prefer to prevent the typescript
compiler from generating an output if it
finds an error so in this case we need
to go to our TS config dot jason and we
choose the no omit on error option which
is by default false but we are going to
set it to true if we go back to these
file learning types and we delete the
output of the compiled
we hit control s and we're going to see
that now no output is being generated
because an error is found cannot find
name required so how do we fix this
besides this error cannot find name
required there is another problem here
the underscore variable we don't have
auto completion to know which methods
are available in the underscore library
so this is a situation when we are using
third-party libraries we want to import
a type definition for the library if
it's a plain JavaScript library so that
we can use the features of typescript
even though the library itself was not
written in typescript with typescript 2
we can import type definitions directly
from NPM
so let's first install the type
definitions for the node runtime
environment which will include the
require function so to install it we
simply install NPM install ad types
slash node so this will import us all
the type definitions for a node.js
runtime so that we can write nodejs
programs in typescript we are going to
add - - safe dev or if you prefer the
shorthand - D this will install the
Taipings here and there with node
modules you now have here a folder head
types and if you open it you can see
here that you have the type definitions
for the node runtime and also you can
see that the typescript compiler is by
default configured to implicitly look
inside this directory so you do not need
to add any specific configuration to the
TS config dot jason defining the
Taipings routes etc for using it with ad
types any type definition that you
install using ad types will be
implicitly added to your program now
let's take a look at the required type
definition if you go here and we hit
command shift F and we search by the
word required we can see here in the
search result that require is defined
here
require is of type no the require
function so this is a function type
definition we are using an interface
with a single method and you can see
here what the declaration of the node.js
runtime typing's
look like so this gives us Auto
completion for all this functionality
that is available in the runtime so
let's now do the same for low - if we do
end game install at types slash low - we
are going to have the low - types here
installed as well so if we go to package
dot JSON we have here as development
dependencies that types slash low - if
we go to load modules we can confirm
that the low - types are there but we
are still not using them in our program
because we are using the require
statement so how can we take advantage
of the low - type definitions in order
to know the type of the functions that
are exposed by low - we should import it
not using the required statement but
instead we should import it using the
atmos with 6 syntax so we are importing
from the low - module we are importing
anything that the module is exporting so
it should only export one variable so
the command GIS module of low - should
only export one well in order for this
to work and we are renaming whatever we
receive from that export as low - let's
try now Auto completion to see what
functions are available so we can see
here that all the type definitions for
the functions that are available in the
low - data manipulation library are here
available via Auto completion and this
is very useful to build our program
notice that the node types are global so
that is typically the use case for ad
types we don't need to always install an
ad types module in order to add types to
a given module there are many modules
already available like firebase
angularfire - which already come with
their own types whenever we install them
for those specific modules the
typescript compiler will take the type
definitions from the module itself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
