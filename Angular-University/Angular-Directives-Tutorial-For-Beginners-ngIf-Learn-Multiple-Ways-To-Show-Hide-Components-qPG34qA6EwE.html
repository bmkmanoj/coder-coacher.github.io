we have here a panel name toggle me that
we want to toggle by pressing this
button named show when the button is
clicked a toggle show controller method
is triggered that toggles the value of
the show boolean property let's now use
it to pass it to ng if so use the syntax
star ng if and we pass it an expression
that should evaluate to a boolean so if
the boolean is true the toggle panel
will be displayed otherwise it will be
hidden if we now click the button we can
see that the toggle me div it's hidden
or displayed again let's inspect the
HTML to see how this works you can see
here the toggle panel when we click it
it completely disappears from the Dom if
we click again show it will be displayed
again so this is how ng-if works in
general
it completely adds or completely removes
elements from the Dom most of the times
this is exactly what we want and when in
doubt you should always use ng if when
compared to other methods of showing and
hiding elements for example another way
of doing it is via the hidden dump
property but it's not the same thing
let's add a second button that when
clicked it will toggle the hidden Dom
property let's use the input properties
template syntax to write to the hidden
Dom property now let's see what happens
when we click the hidden button as you
can see the div still hides and shows
like the case of ng if but if we inspect
the HTML we can see that when we click
the hidden button the toggle me Dom
element is not removed from the Dom
instead the CSS display:none property is
assigned to this element by the browser
this is a browser functionality that
will assign display none
to any element with the hidden attribute
this means that the element is still
present in the dome if this is a large
element we will pay the performance
penalty of having it in the dome even
though it's not visible to the user
he then might be a valid option if for
example we have an element with a high
construction cost and we want to prepare
it in advance so that it's ready to be
displayed to the user this is a corner
case and not the common scenario the
common scenario is we should use ng if
we are now going to add a third button
that will toggle the CSS visibility
property so we will add here a property
visibility we are going to set it to
visible and we are going to add a toggle
visibility controller method that will
toggle the visibility property between
hidden and visible let's now write to
the visibility property of toggle me
using the input property template syntax
so style that visibility equals the
visibility property if we now click on
the visible button we can see that
toggle me is still hidden and shown as
before but with one big difference the
space that it occupies on the page is
still there even though it's hidden this
is the normal functionality of the CSS
visibility property which in some cases
is very useful as a general guideline we
should try to use ng if as much as
possible but with this lesson we are
aware that there are two other options
that might be useful in certain use
cases</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
