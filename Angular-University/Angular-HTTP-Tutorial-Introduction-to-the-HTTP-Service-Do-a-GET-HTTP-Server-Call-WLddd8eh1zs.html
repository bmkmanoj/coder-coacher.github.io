angular University in this lesson we're
going to learn how to do our first HTTP
call in our lesson service so coming
right up take a look at this version of
lesson service it's still retrieving the
lessons data from a variable in memory
what we're going to do is we're going to
fetch this data from the back end via an
HTTP call a get call for that let's
inject the standard HTTP angular 2
service so this is a service that comes
together with angular we're going to use
it to do a get call using this HTTP GET
we pass in the URL that we want to hit
on the servers in this case slash
lessons and let's have a look at the
server the server is just a simple
Express server for testing purposes for
demo purposes I will show you in
upcoming lesson how to set up such a
server
take a look once the server gets a get
so get lessons it's going to return a
JSON object that contains the lessons
data take a look the lessons data is
still the same data that we saw before
but right now it's going to be served by
our back-end in order to get back the
result from the backend we need to
subscribe to the output of the get
method the output of get is an RX j s
observable and we are going to go in
detail on what that is and how to use it
right now we're going to subscribe to
the output of get and we are going to
pass it a function so this function has
one argument lessons data which is the
data that came from the backend and on
the body of the function
we have only one line where we are going
to take the result that came from the
backend so lessons data and we're going
to assign it to the service lessons
variable notice that we are getting here
an error and this is because what we
received from the get call is not
immediately what we sent as response
from the back end what we get is a
response object that has other
information other than the data so what
we need to do is using the map rxjs
operator we need to transform the
response into only the data so we do
that by calling map and then response
dot Jason these will transform the
response into the output of a response
dot Jason and like that in our
subscriber method we receive only the
data the lessons
note that the HTTP service like the
lessons service needs to be provided at
the bootstrap call of the application so
that it's available for dependency
injection so in this case we are going
to pass in HTTP providers to the
bootstrap call without this the HTTP
service will not be available at runtime
and you will get an error let's now see
all of this in action if we reload the
application we can see that all the data
is still there and if we open the
network panel of our developer tools we
can see that an HTTP request was done
and that will receive the data from the
backend next what we're going to do is
we're going to save some data to the
server using angular 2 HTTP and add that
to our service in the following lesson
coming right up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
