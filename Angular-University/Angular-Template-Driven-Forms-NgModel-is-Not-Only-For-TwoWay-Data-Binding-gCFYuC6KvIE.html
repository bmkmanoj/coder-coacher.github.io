angular 2 forms course I'm Vasco from
the angular University and in this
lesson we are going to start by learning
why do we need a full framework module
for doing something apparently as simple
as forums well the main reason is forms
are really not that simple forms can be
a very complex part of our application
especially if there is a very large
amount of fields
if the forum's spend several tabs if
there are editable parts of the form
that can be edited via a dialog forms
can be very complex there can be a lot
of business valuation rules
interdependent validations depending on
multiple fields of the form you could
have a whole tab in error it could have
multiple fields that are related in
error angular 2 helps us deal with all
that it helps us extract the data from
the form in a simplified way so you will
never have to write code that gets the
data from the form and populates an
object that's done for you also angular
2 helps us dealing with validating the
form showing proper error messages to
the user clearly identifying which parts
of the form need to be edited that's the
big added value of the forms module not
every form is that complex take a look
at this example
where we are creating a lesson in a
course so we are going to put the title
the duration and we're going to put the
level either beginning or advanced and
then we click on a button create lesson
now what we want to do in this form is
we want to extract the data that the
user types in from the form let's start
with that that is called data binding
let's configure this in a template
driven way this is the closest that you
can get in angular 2 to the angular 1
way if you are familiar with angular 1
if you are not familiar with angular 1
don't worry we're going to explain now
data-binding for this simple form what
we want to do here is we want to
synchronize continuously the content of
the form we want to bind it to this
lesson object this lesson object is an
instance of the lesson class which has
these properties take a look at the type
annotations in the constructor these are
actually optional because we are
specifying default values for each
constructor parameter so if we remove
the type annotations we still have type
safety in this program this typescript
feature is known as type inference now
the forms module is optional if we want
to make use of it we need to configure
it in your application we need to pass
it to our bootstrap function we need to
call there the provide forms function
from the angular slash forms import
barrel now what we want to do in this
form before using ng model is we want to
turn off certain html5 features that are
on by default because we don't want
html5 to be handling the validation of
the form we want angular to do it for
that we simply use the no validate
property in the form we also don't need
autocomplete so I'm just going to turn
it off let's also output the value of
the lesson object to the screen using
the JSON pipe so that we can see by
directional binding in action now let's
configure the title field to be be
directional bound to the lesson title
property for that we are going to use ng
model and we are going to assign it
lesson dot title this syntax here with
the two parentheses is called the banana
box syntax if we try now this out and we
start typing in the title lesson field
we're going to see that the less an
object is automatically kept in sync
with the content of the input field with
each kept event so this is the ng model
functionality in action we don't need to
cause anything for doing
databinding it's done for us
automatically if you enjoyed this
tutorial you can always subscribe to my
channel for more upcoming angular 2
tutorials also have a look at the
website of the angular university to see
what type of angular 2 tutorials you
find there that you might like but that
is only half the story of angular 2
forums
data-binding let's inspect the HTML we
have here several state classes valid or
it could be invalid touched pristine
ngmodel is also helping us validate this
form and we are going to see exactly how
to do validation in the upcoming lessons
so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
