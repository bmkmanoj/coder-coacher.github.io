from the angular University this is the
exercise section for the services an
HTTP part of our course what we are
going to implement here is a type-ahead
what we're going to do is whenever the
user types on this search box here we're
going to send an ajax request to the
server so that we search for a lesson
with this keyword in its description and
we're going to get back a result that we
want to display on the screen now what
we want to do is as long as the user
types on the input box each time that it
types a key we should send a request to
the server we could throttle this but
this will make it more interesting we
send a request to the server now if the
user types very fast and the new search
is available before the result comes
back from the server what we want to do
is to cancel the previous request so
let's give it a try we're going to give
you a hand on this you will need access
to the Dom element of the input box we
are simply going to make it available to
you here in this input variable we have
used a lifecycle method after view in it
this is a life cycle hook that gets
triggered once the view is completely
initialized we will get into this in
future courses remember you can tap into
the stream of kiap events in the input
box using observable from event now
let's have a look at how the lessons
service was improved in order to
accommodate the search functionality
what we're doing here is we are passing
in an optional parameter search you can
see that it's optional because it's
initialized in the method declaration
with a default value so if the parameter
is not present in the method call the
default value will be taken instead this
is another nice typescript functionality
that we have available to us now the
search bar
is passed on to the back end via the
HTTP GET call as a URL parameter in the
back end we'll see that we will check if
the search parameter is filled in and if
so we're going to filter the array of
lessons returned in order to search for
the keyword provided so it's just a very
simple implementation for our exercise
if you want to see cancellation in
action you can always call the delayed
lessons method on the back end instead
it also implements the search
functionality so good luck with the
exercise have fun I think it's a really
good example of the power of rxjs and
this new functionality that angular 2
provides us it's really clear that we
can implement certain things that before
were rather hard to implement
now don't forget in the next lesson we
are going to present the exercise
solution so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
