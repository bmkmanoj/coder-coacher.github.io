template syntax feature properties okay
so let's grab an example to get us going
take the following color sample div so
this is not an angular component it's
just a plain Dave ok so this div like
any other document element has an
Associated Dom element and let's see
what that looks like ok so we click the
element and we switch to the console and
we output the variable dollar zero okay
so dollar zero is a chrome console
feature that prints the last element
that we clicked in the elements panel
okay so it looks we can see here it
looks like we are just printing the HTML
tag but this is actually the Dom element
itself in order to prove that let's
manipulate the color of the div via the
style development property so style
background equals blue so as you can see
dollar 0 is the Dom element as we've
mentioned so there are numerous dump
properties like style and many others
that allow us to do all sorts of useful
things let's now change the color of
this div by using the angular properties
in texas tail so using the angle bracket
notation we set the background color to
red we refresh and the div is now red so
as we can see the template properties in
text can be used as a generic mechanism
for reading and writing to dom
properties so let's now see what else we
can do with it let's now for example use
it to disable a button let's just add a
button and set the disabled on property
of the button to true now what's really
important to realize is that the
disabled property is not an angular
specific mechanism okay so this is the
native dome property and we are just
using the template mechanism to write to
it so if we now refresh the page we can
see
that the button is now disabled so
everything is working as expected but
there's something else going on here to
see it let's now use the property syntax
to make an input field mandatory so we
create an input field and we mark the
required property to true if we now
refresh the page we can see that the
input is marked as mandatory but this
time let's inspect the HTML
so as we can see the input now has a
required attribute and we might be led
to believe that it was the template
syntax that added this attribute to the
HTML tag but that was not the case so
what happened here is that we did right
to a dump property but for certain
properties like it's the case of
required the browser will keep in sync
an HTML attribute with the corresponding
dump property we can also use the
property mechanism to hide elements
using the Dom hidden property all those
we will see we should prefer ng if so if
we refresh the page the div is hidden as
we would expect and these are only a few
examples with this mechanism we have
access to any of the numerous dump
properties that browsers make available
now what happens if we write to a
property that is not used by the browser
let's try it we create a div and we
write to a property that is not a native
dumb property so as we can see angular
now frozen error this is because we are
writing to a property that won't be read
neither by the browser nor by your
application as a component input so this
is most likely an error maybe just a
typo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
