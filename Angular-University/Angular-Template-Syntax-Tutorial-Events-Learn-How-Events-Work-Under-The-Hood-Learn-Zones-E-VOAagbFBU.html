introduce the template syntax for events
and explain how events work under the
hood in angular by introducing the
notion of zones so let's get going let's
start with something rather intriguing
let's just create a simple example of an
input box and using a reference we're
going to output in the template the
value of the input box right next to the
template so input not value now try to
guess what will happen when we refresh
the browser and we start typing in that
box what do you think it will happen so
let's try it we start typing and nothing
happens ok so the view is not being kept
updated with the value of the input
what's going on here more on this later
right now let's just add a button with
the normal template syntax so we create
a click handler for the click event as
simple as that and inside we are just
going to show a plain JavaScript pop-up
to the user let's type again in this box
to change the message and we now trigger
the pop-up take a look when we close the
pop-up the message was updated so how
can it be what's going on here in order
to find out let's add a debugger
statement to try to find when exactly
the message is being updated so now we
refresh the browser and we reproduce the
same situation so let's just edit the
message trigger the pop-up again and by
the way the source maps for the examples
are working take a look the pop-up is
hit the breakpoint is hit and take a
look at this moment the message has not
yet been updated so what's going on here
let's release the breakpoint if we
release the breakpoint we can see that
the message is
updated so conclusion somehow the
message is being updated immediately
after our clickhandler finishes its
execution and before the control is
yielded back to the browser let's think
about it for a second together what's
going on here we can see here that we
are at the end of our click Handler so
the control will be yielded back to the
browser in a moment once we release the
breakpoint but somehow angular found a
way to update the view between this
moment and the moment that the browser
has again control
how can it be because there is no code
after this point how does this work the
view gets updated after these
occurrences a Dom event and Ajax
callback set timeout gets trigger set
interval all the same a WebSocket
callback is called an alert like we saw
or a prompt and other after other
browser a sync API is are called how can
that be this is all made possible by a
library called zones or zone dot J's
which allows to install custom browser
functionality at the startup of your
application it allows to patch the
browser API is like an event listener
set timeout and add your own
functionality so the way that this works
is there's a browser an event listener
the standard native browser add event
listener at startup time we're going to
keep a reference to it and then we're
going to override it because in
JavaScript everything is over rideable
by design in the runtime environment so
we're going to replace an event listener
with our own angular specific version
that we'll call the original add event
listener and it will trigger any
callback that we pass to it in the same
event of course but after the callback
is executed we are going to execute some
angular specific functionality and what
we are going to do is we are going to
run change detection and if something
changed we are going to update the view
now this is not the exact code that gets
executed it's just four explanatory
purposes but this explains what was
going on with our example let's go back
to our example now we can understand
much better what was going on here
initially we only had the input and a
message there was nothing that could
have triggered the change detection
mechanism of angular there was no event
handler there was no Ajax callback
there was no trigger once we added the
button we have a Krieger for the change
detection mechanism so that's why the
message was being updated at that moment
let's now see how we can use events
properties and references together with
other mechanisms to create angular 2
components</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
