tree of sub components here we have two
components one is a color picker when
the user clicks in one of the color
panels a color is outputted the other is
a color previewer it's this line saying
preview text color it will adapt the
color of the text
depending on the color received let's
then implement these two components this
section here will be the color picker
component so let's replace that with a
custom HTML tag let's do the same for
the color previewer component and let's
give each one a reference now the
reference here will point directly to
the component instance because the
reference is being defined in an element
that has a component linked to it if the
reference would have pointed let's say
to a plaintiff it would have referenced
the Dom element of the div instead to
implement the reset button we're going
to add a click handler and inside it we
are going to use the color picker
reference to call a reset method
directly on the color picker component
let's define the public API of these two
components the color picker component
only has an output which is the color
event it outputs a new color each time
the user clicks one of the panels in the
event handler we are going to use the
reference to passing the color directly
to the previewer via dollar event our
event will contain the new color as we
can see the syntax for component outputs
like for example the color output event
is exactly the same syntax as for
example registering click handlers or
Mouse up event handlers so it's the same
syntax as for native Dom events so
component outputs is a mechanism that
allow us to create our own
some events this is the initial draft
for the color picker component this
contains the HTML that we saw before and
via the selector attribute we have
linked this component to the color
picker custom HTML tag using a click
handler we are going to detect when the
user clicks one of these two colors
using divs and when it does so we are
going to output a custom color event
with the color that the user just chose
red and blue are defined on this file
and this is how you define a constant in
typescript when the user clicks on a
color sample we are going to call the
shoes controller method and inside it we
are going to emit an output event of
type color so the color is passed in as
a string so that lets define a color
event emitter in the color picker
component and let's annotate it with at
output this identifies this event
emitter as a component output we can
then use the color event emitter to emit
events like we see here via the emit
method and passing in the color
let's now implement the reset button
functionality whenever the user clicks
reset we are going to output the color
black the color previewer component has
one input which is the color let's
define this input by creating a property
and annotating it with the add input
annotation we will now apply the color
to the color previewer using the ng
style directive we are going to go into
detail into ng style in an upcoming
lesson let's see these two components in
action so the color picker if we choose
a color by clicking in one of the two
divs we can see that the color is
selected and passed on to the color
previewer the reset button is also
working if we click it the color
previewer goes back to black notice that
color picker and color previewer need to
be included
in the directives property of the main
component otherwise these components
will not be displayed let's use the
template syntax to pass an input to a
component for example let's store color
in a component variable and now using
the square bracket notation we are gonna
pass it on to the color previewer as we
can see everything still works
now what we're going to do is we are
going to make the color picker component
a component that receives both inputs
and outputs the first thing that we need
to do is to rename the color event
emitter to something like color output
so that it doesn't conflict with the new
property color that we're going to
introduce we need to change the add
output annotation to say that the name
of the event is still color and not
color output now let's apply to the
template the color using ng style we can
see that now when we click a color
sample not only the color previewer gets
the color but also the title of the
color picker as we can see the angular 2
functionality for components is very
powerful with only a very few simple
concepts like inputs outputs references
we can build well isolated and reusable
components and more than that we can
reason about how they interact with each
other simply by reading the templates
where they are being used</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
