lesson we're going to see how can we
send the identification JSON web token
back to the server with each request
we're going to be using an angular HTTP
client interceptor so this is a new
functionality available in the new
angular HTTP client that we are using in
this course the way that this works is
whenever we are doing an HTTP request we
are going to be adding an extra header
that header will simply contain the JSON
web token this means that the server
will always have a token that it can
validate and from which it can extract
the user ID that corresponds to the
request let's then implement our
authentication interceptor and see it in
action we are going to go here to our
application and we're going to create
here a new file we are going to call it
off dot interceptor dot ES and inside it
we are going to define our
authentication interceptor so this is
going to be simply a class we are going
to call it authentication interceptor
and we're going to have it implement the
HTTP interceptor angular functionality
so as we can see this is a functionality
provided by the new HTTP client that is
available here and there angular slash
common this class is going to be a
normal angular injectable so we are
going to add here the injectable
annotation let's import it from angular
core and with this in place let's now
implement the HTTP interceptor interface
we are going to hit alt enter we are
going to choose implement interface and
what we have here is a new method so
let's quickly go over it as we will see
angular interceptors are very similar to
Express middleware so they are both
based upon the same chain of
responsibility design so the first
argument that we're going to need here
is the HTTP request and we also have
here a next function so this is in every
way identical to the next function of
Express we are going to call it in order
to proceed with the
were chained and we also have to define
here a return result so this is going to
be an observable of HTTP event and we're
going to remove here this fro we are
going to now implement this interception
logic the first thing that we're going
to do is we're going to try to retrieve
the ID token from local storage and
we're going to do so using the local
storage get item a PA so we're going to
see here a couple of cases first is the
token present if the token is present
we're going to append to an HTTP header
we're going to append the token itself
let's start by implementing the case
when the token would not be present so
let's add here an else clause in this
case what we need to do is we need to
continue the middle word chain
we should not interrupt it otherwise we
are going to get an error or maybe worse
than that nothing happens and we block
the middle word chain in order to
proceed with the middleware chain we are
going to be using next let's see how
next works next takes one method which
is called handle and handle takes one
argument which is an HTTP request so
this is the request that is traveling
through the middle word chain until it
gets sent to the browser using the
normal standard Ajax API we want to
either modify this request by adding it
extra headers or we want to send it and
change to the rest of the middleware
chain which is what we want to do here
so we want to pass it our requests and
in order to make it travel through the
middle word chain we want to return it
here now let's do the case where we do
have an ID token so what we want to do
in that case is to take the current
request of the middle word chain and we
want to create a clone request this API
is all based on immutability so we
cannot modify the HTTP request object
and added headers but we can clone it
and add modifications to the clone at
construction time so we are going to
clone the HTTP request object and
we are going to modify it we are going
to pass in here a configuration object
that defines which modifications do we
want to do when compared to the original
request which remains unchanged so let's
see what modifications we can do we are
going to hit control space and we can
see that we have here a series of
options one of them here is the headers
property so we can specify here a new
set of HTTP headers and we don't have to
fill them in manually we can go to the
headers of the original request and we
can clone those headers and modify them
by adding a new header the authorization
header so that is the header that
usually contains the information that
allows to identify the user so we're
going to call the set method on it and
we are going to write the authorization
header this method set takes two
arguments the first is the header that
we want to append to the list of headers
and the second value is the value of the
header the authorization header like any
other HTTP header is really just a
string so we could put in here any value
we could put for example directly the ID
token but like so many other headers we
are going to be following some common
web conventions so we're going to split
the header into multiple parts the first
part of the header is going to say what
type of authorization value we have here
so this is a bearer token this means
that we are going to tell the server
give access to the bearer of this token
we are going to have a space added here
and the second part of the authorization
header is the ID token itself which is a
string so we have created a cloned
request and we have added a new
authorization header that is following
this common wave convention but
essentially it simply contains the JSON
web token that we have here in local
storage
now with the cloned request what we're
going to do is we are going to call next
dot handle and we are going to pass in
the cloned request that contains the new
head
and as usual we are going to return this
so that we can proceed with the middle
word chain and with this in place we
have completed the implementation of our
interceptor logic if we would try now
our program nothing would have changed
because we need to plug in this class
here at level of our application module
we are going to configure here a new
provider so I'm going to paste in the
configuration and we're going to review
it together so we are going to define
that this is a provider of type multi so
the flag of multi is set to true this
means that there can be multiple values
for this particular provider so there
could be multiple HTTP interceptors all
organized together in a chain we are
adding here our class our authentication
interceptor class that we have defined
here and here in the provide property we
are going to say to which injection
token do we want to associate our class
with so if we click inside HTTP
interceptors we're going to see that
this is simply an injection token so it
uniquely identifies sort of a dependency
injection bucket where we are going to
register multiple interceptors at the
application startup time what is going
to happen is that angular is going to
retrieve all the interceptors associated
to this injection token so it's going to
receive an array with all the
interceptors with this in place we are
now ready to try out this functionality
because we already have here a valid
token so let's switch to the browser to
a larger window let's refresh here the
application and let's have a look here
for example at the Ajax request that
triggered here the loading of this data
so this code to slash API slash lessons
so let's have a look at the requests in
detail at the request headers if we
scroll down we are going to see that we
have here the authorization header as
expected and it has the value bear and
in front of it it has our JSON web token
that was retrieved from local storage so
this means that now the serve
together with this request here will
also receive the bearer token it will be
able to validate it both for validity in
general to make sure that this could
only have been granted this token to
someone in possession of the user
password and it will also be able to
validate if the token is expired or not
so what we're going to do next is we are
going to add that validation logic in
our server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
