to do strong typing of arrays as well so
we have here an array which is an array
of strings
if we hit ctrl shift P we can see that
actually the type is not array of string
notice the pipes between each of the
elements of the array more on this later
right now let's define here another
array so it's an array of numbers and we
are simply going to assign it the value
0 1 2 for example and again let's expect
with ctrl shift pivot type this is a
type of number array so let's now try to
assign for example to the counters
variable so it's declared with length so
we can assign values to it let's assign
it the person's variable so as you can
see we get an error type string array is
not assignable to type number array so
again we have type inference in action
here we did not have to define the type
for these two variables persons and
counter they have been implicitly found
by the typescript compiler but we could
define them explicitly if we so wanted
to by using a type annotation so let's
annotate the two variables and as you
can see the program's click on files
except for this error here that we can
remove let's go back to the person's
string array if we now hit ctrl shift P
we can see that this is now defined as a
string array but if we remove this type
annotation and we hit again ctrl shift P
we have here something else so what is
this why are there free string equations
here and if we remove one element and we
hit again ctrl shift P there are only
two string elements there so what is
this implicitly typescript is
interpreting this type right now as a
tuple of two strings so let's define
another example of a tuple let's say
that we have a tuple which is a pair of
a number and a name so first element of
the tuple
is a string and the second is for
example a number let's say that it's 5
so we have just defined here a type
which has two elements in it a string
and a number if we hit ctrl shift P we
can see that that is exactly the type
that was defined this way that we can
define a type which is a tuple let's
call to the type the player tuple and we
are going to define that this tuple has
a first element which is a string and a
second element which is a number now we
can say that the variable tuple is of
type player tuple and the program still
compiles correctly and everything works
as expected
so this explains the type that we were
seeing here we are not limited to only
two elements we could define free
elements so we can see here by hitting
ctrl shift P that we have implicitly
associated two persons a type which is
an array which has free strings this
means that we can define a type which is
let's call it free names this tuple
takes three arguments and free arguments
each one we have typed string so we
could say that person's this array here
is of type free names and the program
would still compile correctly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
