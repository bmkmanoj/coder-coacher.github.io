we know what a JSON web token is and how
to use it let's take the concept and
apply it here to the user session
management of our application our server
is going to be completely stateless this
time we don't have here the session
store let's start with the functionality
for signing up a new user so we are
going to go here to the server to the
create user route here at the level of
the security utils file we have already
imported here the private key file and
public key this is an RSA public and
private key pair you can generate these
with online tools for example or if you
install open SSL there is nothing
specific to these keys so that they
could only be used for signing JSON web
tokens these are generic RSA keys if you
want to use your own keys I suggest that
you use this website here or if you
simply look for online RSA key generator
any of the generators will work well for
your production application it's better
to use a key size of 248 hit generate
new keys and you have here a pair of
private keys it's not recommended to use
these keys in production instead it's
better to generate the keys locally in
your machine using a command-line tool
such as for example open SSL it's very
important not to take keys from public
Internet services this is just for test
purposes let's then take these public
and private key pairs and we are going
to use these to implement our user
authentication services now the first
thing that we are going to do is we are
going to create a JSON web token with a
given expiration and then we are going
to start it here at the level of the
session ID cookie we often hear about JW
T's as an alternative to cookies but
here we can see that a cookie is just a
storage mechanism there is nothing that
prevents us from storing a JWT in a
cookie it's actually a good place to
store it if we are getting all our
web tokens from the same domain as we
will see so we can start it in a
domain-specific cookie we are going to
make it HTTP only and secure so the
bearer token which is a JWT it's going
to be invulnerable to cross-site
scripting attacks even if someone
manages to inject JavaScript in our
application they would still not be able
to steal the JSON web token which
represents the user session we are going
to come back later in this course to
this mix between cookies and JSON web
tokens right now let's replace this to
do here with our implementation we are
going to create here a new function and
we're going to call it create session
token' the only argument that we need to
pass to this function that we are about
to define is the user ID so this
function is going to create a JSON web
token that is going to be assigned here
to our session token let's implement it
here at the level of the security utils
file we are going to export a function
we're going to call it create session
token it's going to take one argument
which is the user ID now let's see how
we are going to create the JSON web
token we are going to be using the same
library that we were using before if you
want to learn more about this library
this is of zero MIT licensed library
called no - JSON web token so you have
here on github the documentation for the
library in case you need it
we are going to be using it here to
generate the JSON web token we are going
to do JWT dot sign so it's the same API
that we were using before because we are
not going to be needing any specific
attribute other than the subject let's
pass it in for example an empty payload
we are going to pass us the second
argument the private key needed for
signing new JSON web tokens and the
third argument is going to be an options
object the first option that we will be
using is the algorithm so if we don't
pass in an algorithm then instead of
using RS 256 which
takes two keys public and private we
would have accidentally be using HS 256
and this would not work so the correct
algorithm is Rs 256 we are going to
expire the JSON web token using the
expires in property we are going to
define here this session duration which
is a comfortable session duration so
that the token does not expire all the
time but you will still be able to test
the expiration functionality in our
application without waiting too long in
production again this will depend on
your application we are also going to
pass in here the subject because we will
only be using this JSON web token for
authentication so let's use a subject
the user ID and we would get back here
at JSON web token the problem is that
this coal would be synchronous so we
don't want to block the whole node.js
process as we are generating a new JSON
web token according to the documentation
this sign API call has in a synchronous
version where we pass in here as the
last argument a callback and note style
callback so let's also promise if I hear
this particular function we are going to
call it simply sign JWT and we are also
going to be calling util promise if I we
will be passing it in GWT dot sign and
these will effectively promise if I this
API call so now we are going to be using
here this promise if ID version we are
going to return this here so we are now
returning a promise this has not been
evaluated we are going to mark this
function as a sync meaning that it
returns a promise and it's compatible
with a single wait so because we are
returning here a promise we don't need
to wait for the result here we are going
to import the session token without
enter we have now run here into a
problem this ID is a number and it's not
a string so we are going to call to
string on it because at this point in
the program we are
sure that we have here a number and
instead of taking back here the promise
we are going to await for the resolution
of the promise so now what we have here
is a JSON web token that will then be
stored in the session cookie and sent to
the browser the browser then with each
request back is going to send back again
the same JSON web token and in order to
validate it we simply need to check its
signature let's then see this
functionality in action we are going to
switch over to a bigger browser window
so that we can see what is going on we
are going to create here a new user and
now when we click sign up let's keep an
eye here on the network tab on the Ajax
filter we hit sign up we got here a
first request sign up then we were
redirected to lessons but the first
request is an HTTP POST to the sign up
API we are going to be returning 200 and
have a look here the session ID this is
a JSON web token now so if we switch
over here to the application tab to the
cookies we can now see that as the
session cookie we are storing a JSON web
token it's HTTP only we still can't
access it via JavaScript it's secure
meaning that it will only be sent via
HTTP and it's not simply a random value
that the server had to store in memory
the server has at this moment completely
discarded the value even though the
server did not keep the token in memory
it will still be able to identify the
user we are going to see how in the next
lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
