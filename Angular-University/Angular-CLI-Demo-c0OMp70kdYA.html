from the angular University we're going
to see why there are several reasons
fill out this video why it's a great
idea to use the angular CLI even if you
are just trying out the framework for
the first time and you want a stable
playground as a development environment
or even if you are starting out a new
project you should at least have a look
at the CLI because it might be a very
good option let's simply install the
latest angular CLI so the package that
we need to install is called at angular
slash CLI and if you are in UNIX or Mac
you might have to add a pseudo at the
beginning of the installation command
this will take awhile but the
installation will be completed so let's
just now scaffold a project using ng new
hello world so this will take a while
but a new angular project will be
scaffolded from scratch using the latest
version of angular and after a while we
have a new project completely scaffolded
so let's open it here so you can see
here for example the application module
file of our application so this contains
all the modules that are imported into
the project so as you can see everything
is compliant to the latest version of
angular let's run the project so here in
the command line we need to CD into the
folder and there we simply type ng serve
and this will start a development server
one of the advantages of this
development server is that it has hot
reloading working let's see this in
action so after a while your development
server is running so if you go to local
host port 4200 let's do 4200 we have
here a running HelloWorld application so
this is running in development mode so
it's in just-in-time compilation mode
let's take a look at the network tab so
if we refresh the application we can see
that we only have about 6 requests
and everything loads in about one second
so this gives a very good experience for
development we don't have a lot of HTTP
requests now let's do a modification
let's go to the application component
and as we can see another advantage of
using this CLI version is that we don't
have to fill in here this property
module ID that we need to fill in if we
are using for example system J's at
least for the moment so we can simply
type here the relative path to the
template let's see here in the file
directory structure so this file dot
HTML dot CSS are right next to the
component file so we can reference them
simply by using a relative path and the
CLI will be able to find these files and
add them to the build transparently so
no module ID needed let's now make a
simple change to the template let's
simply say angular HelloWorld and we're
going to see hot reloading in action so
if we save the file that kicks in our
build it will rebuild the application
bundle and it will trigger a hot
reloading so we have here the new change
apply of automatically the CLI is also
very convenient for developing new
components and services so it takes away
all the need for boilerplate so if for
example we create a new component so ng
G of generate and then we generate a
component let's call it hello if we run
this command we are going to have an
hello component generated we have here
the paths and the files that were
generated so here inside app we have
here a new component ready to use
everything is filled in automatically
for us according to the angular style
guide so this is really very convenient
for development another great thing
about this generated component is that
not only it follows the angular 2 style
guide but also it's ready to use so if
we take the app hello selector of the
component let's simply try to add it
here to the template of our application
so if
we apply it directly in a template and
we hit ctrl s this is going to trigger
the rebuilding of the bundle and we can
see that the hello component was already
included in the template so the
generated component is not only
compliant with the style head but it's
ready to be used because it was
correctly registered here in the
application module many other CLI
commands are already available let's for
example generate a new directive so ng G
directive and here
let's pass in path and we are going to
call it my directive or simply my dear
we are going to create the directive and
we can see here the paths where the
directive is available so here it is
under the shared folder so more commands
are available for the CLI let's generate
a pipe as well and GG pipe and GG pipe
and we are going to call it my pipe so
if we run this also here if we don't
pass in a path it will show up on the
root of the application that might not
be what is intended so as we can see the
pipe is here and again all these
directives pipes services etc that are
generated via the command line they are
ready to be used in the templates
directly another great thing about the
CLI is that the production build is
already usable actually we could create
a build a development build using ng
build and a production build using - -
prod and this would create a dist folder
containing the build but in order to use
either build we don't have to run ng
build we can simply run the
corresponding serve command so in this
case ng serve - - prod and what this
will do is that it will create minified
compressed bundle that is also tree
shaped so let's take a look here at the
output log as we can see here in the log
we can see which functions were dropped
in the production build
so this will reduce the size of the
bundle as we can see the application
still works perfectly in production mode
if you are starting a project today why
not start it directly with the CLI you
can see that you get a lot of
productivity you just run a command in
the command line and you get a working
component so this is huge you have a
great development experience with the
hot reloading and in the near future it
will be just a matter of updating the
CLI and your build will still work your
application will still work so in
summary the angular CLI is really the
ideal starting point for starting a new
project with angular</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
