lesson we are going to start doing some
search engine optimization or SEO to our
angular application this is one of the
main reasons why would we want to use
angular Universal to do SEO optimization
on search engines other than Google we
will also learn how to make our
application crawlable by social media
platforms such as Twitter or Facebook
let's then get started doing SEO
optimization of these angular Universal
application we're going to switch here
to a larger window and we are going to
understand the problem that we are about
to solve so let's head over to the
google search engine and do a search on
angular universal we can see here the
multiple titles of the search results
now the question is where does this text
come from this is the Google search
entry title and this is a description
that comes along with the search result
where is the Google search engine
finding this text to display let's have
a look at one of the results if we right
click here for example on the first
results we are going to head over to the
angular universal repository and we are
going to inspect the page with a chrome
dev tools if we open here the head
section of our HTML page we are going to
find here at a given moment a title tag
let's have a look title angular slash
navarre so universal JavaScript support
for angular this is an exact match with
the text that we have here other than
the github prefix this one was added by
Google this text here comes directly
from the title tag of the page and what
about this description this is a bit
different these will depend on the
search that we did here but we can set a
default text for this description if we
have over to the page we have here a
meta tag called description and we have
here as content Universal JavaScript
support for angular so if the Google
search engine can
determing any description that is
dependent on the query that we made then
it's going to use this text as a default
we can see here that this text is a part
of the description that we have here so
now we have a good understanding of
where search engines such as for example
Google take the text results that we
have here from the page this means that
for our angular universal application
it's very important to set the title tag
and the Meta Description tag according
to the content of the page for example
in a given course the title tag of that
course page would correspond to the
title of the course so the content of
the title and the description tag should
not be constant but it should depend on
the page that we are seeing now
concerning that just one side note the
Google search engine can read dynamic
values from these tags so if these tags
are set by JavaScript at runtime the
Google search engine will still be able
to use them for indexing the search
results this is not the case for the
other search engines available such as
for example Bing right now let's start
by setting the title tag and the meta
description of this angular universal
application as we can see the title of
the page is currently constant and set
to angular Universal course if we view
here another course for example the
security course we are going to see that
the title remains the same what we would
like to do is to change this title tag
according to the course notice that if
we lower the whole page even though this
is being server-side rendered the title
that we are getting back from the server
each time is what we angular Universal
course this corresponds to the title
that we have here in our index dot HTML
page let's have a look we are going to
open the index page and as we can see we
have here the title set as a constant in
our index.html so that's what we are
getting from the server we now need to
fill in this parameter dynamically
we want to do that here at the level of
the course component this is the main
component that gets displayed whenever
we click on a given course in order to
set dynamically the title of the page at
runtime using javascript we are going to
read the title service injectable with
this injectable that we have here we
will be able to set the title of this
page to the title of the course
we can do that in the following way we
are going to use the title service and
we are going to call set title and we
are going to set this title to the
description of the course next what we
want to do is to set the meta tag name
description to the long description
property of the course object so we are
going to be using here a second angular
service it's simply called meta this
service allows us to set any meta tag we
are going to start by the tag that is
used by search engines which is the
description meta tag we can set it in
the following way
using the meta service we are going to
call here this method add tag and to
this method we are going to pass a
configuration object in this
configuration object we are going to set
the name of the meta tag so as we know
the name of the meta tag is description
and next we are going to set the content
of the meta tag we are going to set the
content to the long description property
of the course object so here description
we need to pass this as a string and
with this in place we have already set
the two most important meta tags used by
search engines let's now head over to
the terminal and build again our
application in production model we are
going to start by rebuilding the client
application with NPM run build client
app production after a while our
client-side production build is
completed let's now go ahead and rebuild
our server application once our server
build is completed we are ready to go
ahead and start again our Express server
using NPM run start Express server and
with this we have the new version of our
application running on port localhost
now
thousand let's switch again to a larger
window and see the new behavior of the
program so if we head over here to the
main page and we are going to select
here the angular universal course if we
reload this route we are going to get
from the server here the same title as
we had before
but now this is not coming from the
index.html page because if we hit back
here and we select here a second course
let's say for example the security
course now we can see that the title tag
has switched so I'm going to do this
again if we hit back you can see that
the title tag remains if we select here
our first course the PWA course we are
going to see that again the title tag is
being dynamically set by the client-side
application now if we reload this page
we are going to get a fully server-side
rendered page with the title already set
so this title came from the server from
the Express server and we Nord ER to
better see this we are going to view the
page source
and we are going to search here for the
title we can see here that the title
that is coming from the server
indeed corresponds to the course that we
are seeing we have here a server-side
render the meta description that
corresponds to the long description of
the course let's then summarize if we
want to make our application search
engine-friendly
we need to populate a title and
description tags on each page of the
application the title should be
meaningful and reflect the content of
the current page in this example we have
populated the title only for the course
page if we have other pages on the
application that we also want to rank on
search engines then we also need to
provide a title and a meta description
most search engines will leave a
server-side render title and meta
description but that is however not the
case of the Google search engine with
the Google search engine we can set the
title and the meta description
dynamically
runtime using javascript and the correct
tag will still be shown on the search
results</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
