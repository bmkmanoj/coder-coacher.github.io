from the angular University and in this
lesson we are going to learn how to
initialize a form with a set of existing
values that might have come for example
from the back end we are also going to
learn how to reset a form and last but
not least we are going to cover a common
pitfall that occurs often when we are
using model driven forms I invite you to
keep an eye on the duration field during
the course of this lesson the
explanation for what you are about to
see is available in the end of this
lesson there are two ways to update a
form either a partial or a complete
update let's start with a partial update
let's create here a button that is
called partial update it calls a method
that we are going to implement we are
simply going to call the my form so we
have a reference a form group we are
going to call the patch value method and
inside it we are going to pass it in an
object each of the properties of the
object should correspond to a form field
so in this case we are going to specify
the title property and we are going to
give it a new value note that in the
patch value call we don't need to pass
in all the mandatory fields of the form
we can pass in only the fields that we
want to modify let's try this out if we
now click the button you can see that
the update is working as expected
so again we passed in here a value that
we just art coded but this could have
come for example from the server now
what we want to do is we might want to
do a full update of the form values so
let's add a new button full update and
let's implement it we are going to use
the method my form dot set value and
inside we are going to pass in another
object let's specify for example the
mandatory property title let's try this
out to see what happens so we can see
that we receive an error and the error
says
that we did not provide the description
property so let's just add the
description to the object that we pass
in to set value and let's try it again
now we don't receive any error and
everything is working as expected I'm
sure that you noticed during this lesson
that something was wrong concerning the
duration field we are going to explain
that that's the pitfall that we
mentioned in the beginning of this
lesson it's very simple when we called
patch value we passed in a duration
property it did not get applied when we
called set value we would expect an
error if one of the form fields is not
available we didn't pass in a duration
we did not get any error take a look
this is because the duration field
although we created it programmatically
using new form control and we bound it
to this control using the form control
directive that control is isolated it's
not linked to any form take a look at
the form builder dot group call where we
pass in the form fields we can see that
only title and description are part of
the form but not duration so the
conclusion is if you are doing model
driven forms and you are creating
controls programmatically and binding
them using form control make sure to
also add them to the form declaration
otherwise they will not be considered
part of the form let's now learn how to
reset a form so we have rather the first
button reset that simply calls this
method named reset and inside of it we
simply call reset on the form it's as
simple as that
now take a look at this we start editing
the form and we can see that the status
of dirty touched and touched etc the CSS
state classes of the form control they
have been updated accordingly now
whenever we click the reset button we
can see that not only the form fields
have been reset but also the
says state classes have been all
resented to their initial values and so
this covers how to set a forum value now
in the next lesson we are going to learn
when should we use template driven forms
versus model driven or reactive forms
and why it's coming right up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
