from the angular University welcome to
my course on the ng rx reactive
extensions for angular in this course we
are going to learn about store
architectures in general when to use
them and why we're going to go a little
bit over the history of this kind of
architectures we're going to go back to
the original talk of the flux
architecture presented by Facebook
originally to present an architecture
that allows the Facebook team to solve a
very specific set of problems that they
were having in their application namely
in the famous face book counter bug do
you remember this book a couple of years
ago we always had this unread message
this counter on the top we would click
on it and there would be no unread
messages and this bug kept coming back
for the facebook team and it originated
a new architecture called
flux which later gave origin to redux
and to the use of star architectures in
general so in this course we are going
to go over flux then we are going to go
over the variation of the flux
architecture which are single star
solutions like redux or ng rx store we
are going to implement the same
application that the Facebook team used
to demonstrate the use of the flux
architecture so the flux shed
application we're going to implement it
in ng rx using ng rx store so this is
the application that you will build
during the course you will be building a
shat where for example you will be able
to type here a message hello Bob and the
messages will pop up on the other side
take a look this is the counter that
unread messages counter so you will be
solving the same problem that the
Facebook team solved a couple of years
ago that originated the Flex
architecture and all its variations like
for example Redux
and GX star etc this will be the
same problem that we will be solving for
example we have here here user Alice and
Bob but let's say that for example here
we have a third user named Shack that is
writing here a message to Alice and
Alice is meanwhile talking to Bob so if
we say hi Alice here what will happen is
that this is going to bump the unread
messages counter from Alice so let's do
this again
again the unread messages counter is
bumped now the friend is also marked in
red and you receive here the latest
message here that is displayed here in
the Fred summary now meanwhile Alice and
Bob have kept chatting going back and
forth and meanwhile the unread messages
of Alice is still a 2 when you click
here this is going to put the unread
messages to zero
so you will be fixing the same issue
that the Facebook team originally solved
and you will be solving that problem
using not react and the original
flexstar but you will be using angular 2
and ngx
store library so one of the goals of the
course is to understand what gets loaded
in the store
why how to derive view models from the
data that gets stored in the store we
are going to learn how to use typescript
to clearly define the state that the
store can contain and we are going to
use it also to define clearly the
difference between the model of our
application and the view model so we are
going to leverage typescript to help us
build our program you will notice that
for example here in the original Flex
chat demo application because it was
made in JavaScript we don't have really
type definitions for the different
models that are available on the
application this is unlike the
application that we are going to build
where there will be a clear separation
of what is a model what is a view model
when should we use each of these models
what
of models go over the wire when we
communicate between the client and the
server and of course we are going to use
the engineering store
dev tools we are going to learn how to
set up the dev tools how to use the
time-travelling debugger utility we are
going to see how to use the dev tools to
debug our program we are also going to
cover some more debugging techniques for
angular 2 applications in general namely
for example how to divide rxjs
observables how to produce a lock
similar to this one we are also going to
cover the ng rx ecosystem in general
such as for example ng rx effects the
integration with the router and the
integration with index DB so a database
that runs on modern browsers we are also
going to cover immutability and on push
change detection and what are the
benefits of working in such a way and
what are the consequences as well
so to summarize the goal of the course
is to introduce the Flex architecture
and the store pattern and store
architectures in general by going back
in time and seeing what was the original
problem that the Flex architecture was
designed to solve what type of
applications are a good fit for that
development paradigm to introduce the
dev tools to introduce the ng RX
ecosystem of libraries so not only the
store that but everything that revolves
around ng x store so in a nutshell this
course is both an architecture course on
the flux architecture and on store like
architectures like redux and and GX
store in general but it's also a
hands-on course where we will be
building a shed system from scratch from
an empty folder using ng rx store and ng
RX library ecosystem the goal is really
to see how can we build an application
from A to Z using ng Rx so I hope that
you will enjoy the course I hope to see
you inside and without further ado let's
get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
