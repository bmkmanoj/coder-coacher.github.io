from the angular University and in this
lesson we're going to learn what is the
relation between observables and the
angular 2 HTTP module so it's coming
right up the relation between angular 2
HTTP and observables is simple the HTTP
module always returns us observables
every call that we make to it to
retrieve data from the back end to
modify data on the back end we get back
and observable let's see this in action
by doing our first angular 2 HTTP call
now that we know how it works how
observables work so we're going to call
HTTP that gate and we're going to pass
it in slash lessons that's the URL of
our back-end that returns us a list of
lessons that you've used before but this
time we are not using the fetch API we
are using angular 2 HTTP as usual with
observables we need to subscribe to this
observable otherwise nothing happens
so let's subscribe to this response
observable and we're going to print out
the output of its value to the screen
let's see what this looks you can see
here that the output is of type response
so we can safely conclude that response
dollar is an observable of type response
this type comes from the angular 2 HTTP
module so you might have noticed here
that we did not define any type for this
response observable variable this is
implicitly
inferred by the typescript compiler
typescript at this moment knows that
this is an observable of type response
so if we would try to assign it to some
other type this would produce an error
let's draw a marble diagram for this
observable so that we are sure what's
going on so we can see here that the
response observable really does not emit
any value until someone subscribes to it
then it will call the back end and it
will
meet it's single output value the
response and then it will complete let's
see this by having an error handling and
a completion handler function to the
subscription of this observable if we
now try this out we can see that we get
the response printed to the console and
that afterwards the observable completes
so this is an important notion once a
network observable created by angular
HTTP gets its value back it will
complete this is important when
combining multiple observables of this
type now let's consider this we don't
want to use the response most of the
times unless we want to check the status
code or we want to read a response
header from the HTTP response most of
the times what we really want is the
data for that we do a map so we use the
map operator and we take the response
and we call response dot JSON on it in a
similar way to what happened while using
the fetch API this will create an
observable that will have AZ value the
response data that we got from the
server so if we output its value to the
screen we get here the lessons data as
expected so now we know how the angular
2 HTTP module relates to observables it
returns observables but now how can we
use this information in order to build
our service layer how should we use this
it's coming right up in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
