lesson we are going to refactor our
tests in order to produce a more useful
test suit error report so the idea here
is whenever the tests fail just by
looking at the report we will be able to
tell functionally not technically but
functionally we will be able to tell
what went wrong
so if we switch back to the browser we
have here that we have two
specifications and this is the
specification list and the first thing
that we can see is that because we were
having here several classifications here
at the level of the same spec several
expectations we were running to the
problem that whenever the techs fail we
are not sure exactly what happened we
are here testing several things making
several assertions so one way to make
this specification more readable
whenever it fails and also to provide a
clearer picture of what is the
functionality that we are testing is to
actually split this into multiple specs
so this will give us an immediate idea
of what went wrong whenever we simply
look at the test report which is one of
the things that we are trying to do so
in order to make this easier to write we
are also going to initialize here an
email field element and we are going to
have a look here at the result of the
query function so this returns a debug
element so we are going to add here
another variable which is also a debug
element which will be the email field so
with this in place we will be populating
the email field for each test and we are
going to be creating Bogata specs to
give us a much more readable report so
we are going to make sure that the test
application is running we are going to
make sure that the email field was
created so it says here it should create
a font awesome email input but now we
are going to test for the presence of
the icon in this assertion and we are
going to create here another one to make
sure that the input was projected let's
separate these
to two different specs so this is a way
of producing a more useful report many
small specs this is more descriptive of
what we are trying to do so we are going
to rename this instead of should create
a font awesome email input we are going
to rename this like for example should
include the correct email icon will size
the email input for example so this is a
good description of a specification and
here the last spec we have said should
have projected the correct test input
inside the email field so if we now run
this test let's have a look here at the
terminal we are again going to have
failed test so this is the same
situation as before but now we will have
probably a clearer picture of what went
wrong so as you can see we now know what
is the assertion that is failing this
one should include the correct email I
can inside the email input so as you can
see this test report is much more useful
so just by looking at it we have a clear
indication of what is going wrong with
the new version of our component let's
now see how can we debug a test to find
out what went wrong this is coming right
