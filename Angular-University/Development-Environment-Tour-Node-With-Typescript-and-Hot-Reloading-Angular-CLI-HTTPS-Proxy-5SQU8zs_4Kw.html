lesson we are going to see how to run a
node process using typescript directly
without the need of compiling first the
typescript code to JavaScript code we
are going to show how to run the server
in hot reloading mode and we will be
showing also how to run a small HTTP
server in node this will be in the
context of starting at our sample
application we are going to see that we
are going to leave two processes for it
one is the angular CLI development
server and the other is a small node
server that we will be running in HTTP
so let's first start our node server
you're going to have a look here at our
package dot JSON and we are going to see
here a couple of tasks that we will be
using we are going to be using here the
start server tasks so as you can see we
are running here the TS load command and
we are using it to run our server we are
going to be reviewing our server in a
moment right now it's important to
realize that TS load is a command-line
utility that allows us to run load
programs directly in typescript without
having to compile them first so the
compilation will happen on the fly
notice here that this flag here means
that we are running the server in HTTP
mode so we are not going to be using
stack server in this course instead each
time we will be using instead the server
task what the server task does is it
uses a load utility called load Mun for
scanning all the typescript files in the
server directory and each time that we
make a change to our code it's going to
run our server again so this leads that
when you are adding functionality to the
server these really effectively hot to
reload the server so let's start this
task we are going to do npm run in the
command line in the same folder as our
package dot jason and we are going to do
PMR n server as we execute this command
the server will start up and you will
see here on which port so we have here
an HTTP secure server that is running at
port 9000 in parallel with our receipe
server we are going to be running the
angular CLI server we are going to use
this task NPM start we are going to open
a second terminal we can use here the
plus button for that and in this the
second terminal we are simply going to
do NPM start and as the server starts
let's have a look here at the start
command so as you can see we are running
the development server in proxy mode we
are passing in here some proxy
configuration let's have a look at the
configuration file so what this
configuration file means is that every
HTTP request that we do in our
application that starts with slash API
is going to be proxy or it's going to be
redirected to this server here the HTTP
localhost 9000 server which is our REST
API server so this HTTP server is
running with a self-signed certificate
that is not recognized by the angular
CLI server so we are configuring here
the secure flag to false and this means
that the angular CLI server is not
validating this self signed certificate
so now let's have a look here at the
running application we are going to head
over to port localhost 4202 simply hit
enter and we are going to lower here the
application that we are about to secure
let's then do a guided tour of this
sample application this is coming right
up in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
