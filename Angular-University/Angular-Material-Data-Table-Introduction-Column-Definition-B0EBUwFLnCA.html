we have everything in place let's get
started implementing our data table we
are simply going to start by displaying
some data on the screen and then we will
add further features like pagination
sorting and filtering we're going to
start by a table that contains all its
data on the client side which is the
simplest case so we're going to go here
to our course component and we're going
to add here a material table this table
will take a couple of properties we are
first going to add here a couple of CSS
classes we are going to be using the
lessons table CSS class that is defined
here at the level of the course
component CSS file and we can see that
the lessons table class is here so we're
just giving the table some minimum
height so that we can see something on
the screen when the data shows up now
what we are going to do is we are going
to go back to our course component and
we are going to add here the very
typical material design drop shadow to
this table the size of the shadow is
going to depend on the elevation of the
plane where the material table is so if
we want a stronger shadow we need to
choose a higher elevation the next thing
that we need to define are the table
columns we are going to be defining each
column in the ng container element the
ng container element will not get
rendered to the screen but it provides a
template element onto which we can apply
directives such as for example the
material colon definition directive that
we are going to be applying here and we
are going to use it to define to which
column of the table this container is
associated with in our case this first
column is going to be the sequential
number column we're going to have a
couple more columns so the second column
of our table is going to be the
description of the lesson and the first
column is going to be the duration now
that we have the free columns in place
let's have a look-see what we are going
to define
for each : we are going to be defining
what the header of the coal is going to
look like and we're going to define also
what a given cell of the column will
look like a cell with data so let's
start first by than frying here some
elements inside the container that
identify both the header cell and data
cell itself let's start by identifying
the header of this column so this can be
done using this directive here material
Heather cell definition this is a
structural directive that is going to
identify what element inside this
container corresponds to the Heather of
this particular column so it's used to
mark an element as having a certain role
in the material data table the second
element that we need to identify is the
data cell itself this is also possible
via another material structural
directive the matcel definition
directive that we need to annotate with
the star syntax like ng if ng 4 etc and
with these two structural directives we
have identified the header cell and data
cell themselves now let's increment them
let's start with the description :
instead of the secretion of number : in
the case of this column the text is
going to be description and here at the
level of the cell we want to show the
data that corresponds to even role let's
now talk a little bit about how do we
pass in data to the data table because
we haven't done so at this stage the
data is going to come here from the
courses service at this moment when we
initialize our screen we are going to
have here our course so we have a course
identifier and we can use it to call
here at the level of the courses service
the find all course lessons method that
takes a course ID calls our REST API and
it's going to get back a list of all the
lessons of a given course in this case
there is no pagination in place we are
going to get all the data we are going
to have the
data on the client side and we are going
to add more features on top of it right
now to keep things simple we simply want
to load all the lessons of a given
course let's then start by fetching the
data from the backend we are going to
switch back here to our course component
and we are going to call this service
method we're going to call these courses
service find all course lessons this is
going to get us back a list of lessons
we are going to pass in here the
identification of the course that we
have here at this stage we have the
course ID and we're going to get back an
observable of lesson array meaning that
this observable will emit as values a
list of lessons in this case the course
lessons in order for this observable to
work we need to subscribe to it as usual
so that's what we're going to do here we
are going to get back as it's emitted
only value in case there was no error we
get back an array with lessons now that
we have the data on the front-end let's
see how can we pass this data to the
material data table and display it on
the screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
