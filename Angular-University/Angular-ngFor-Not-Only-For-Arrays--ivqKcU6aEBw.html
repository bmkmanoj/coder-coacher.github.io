standard functionality there's one thing
that you might not have realized about
it in the end of this lesson let's use
it to display a collection of
superheroes on the screen for that let's
use the star ng for syntax what is
syntax does is that it marks the element
on which it was applied and its contents
as being a template this template will
be repeated multiple times the let
keyword is used to declare a local
variable hero which is only visible
inside the template ng4 has a series of
utility variables and the first one that
you are going to see is the index
variable so we can assign the value of
index to a local variable otherwise we
won't be able to use it and we can
output it to the template this local
variable is only visible here there are
a few more utility variables in ng for
useful for styling for example there is
also even an odd that is typically used
to style tables to use them you also
need to assign them to local variables
using the let keyword this won't work if
you try to use them directly similarly
to even an odd
there is also first and last that work
in an equivalent way let's learn about
track by this is an optimization aimed
at improving the user experience of the
application when we are dealing with
lists with a very large number of
elements if we don't use track by then
each time that we pass a new list to the
ng4 directive the whole list will be
rendered on the screen and this is not
ideal for the case of large lists due to
performance reasons with track by we can
tell angular how to uniquely identify
each row like that certain optimizations
can be made for example if the ID is new
an angular knows immediately that it
needs to render this element here we are
passing to track by the expression hero
ID to uniquely identify the element
notice the use of the Elvis operator
this is necessary otherwise you will get
a type error and now one interesting
thing about ng4 and a couple of tricks
about components let's make the hero's
component configurable we can pass it a
list of hero tags let's add a new hero
Green Lantern so that we have a
difference towards the previous list now
let's see how the hero configuration
element is implemented
notice the at directive annotation
instead of at component this is one of
the uses of a directive to create
configuration elements another use is to
create attribute directives as we are
going to see in a later lesson in this
course now this is really cool about ng
4 it will accept any implementation of
iterable that you pass on to it it
doesn't have to be an array in this case
let's use add content children to inject
inside the heroes the list of hero
configuration elements we can pass this
heroes variable directly 24 because
query list implements iterable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
