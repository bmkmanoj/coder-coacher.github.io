typescript any type so let's declare
here a variable which is of type any we
are going to use the light keyword and
we're going to name it my bar we are
going to use a type annotation to
specify the disease of type any now what
can we assign to my bar let's try to
assign a number as you can see you get
no compilation errors so assigning
numbers to any works what about strings
also no compilation error an empty
object or erase this also works so we
can assign anything to a variable of
type any including no end and defined so
far this is more or less intuitive
giving the name of the type any but what
might not be apparent at first sight is
that not only can we assign to my bar
anything but we also can take my VAR and
assign it to anything which might be a
bit surprising the first time that we
found this functionality let's say for
example that we have here a variable
which is the number and we are going to
implicitly assign it the type number via
type inference so if we hit ctrl shift p
you can see that we have here a number
as an inferred type now can we assign to
counter the value of my VAR let's have a
look so we can see here that we could
assign my VAR to counter that is
absolutely not a problem i'm going to
remove this assignment here so that it
really doesn't change anything we can
assign to counter type any and what
about let's say a string and this time
i'm going to use a type annotation to
explicitly assign it the type string can
we assign stl to any variable let's give
it a try so as you can see we can also
assign to
a string a type any but at this point we
really have no guarantee that my wire
would have a string this could be for
example an object and the type system is
not throwing us an error so this is
valid code this is the most important
thing to keep in mind about any we can
assign it any value and we can take it
and assign it to anything else any is
really a way of opting out of the type
checking of the typescript to compiler
this is here present in the language
especially for compatibility with
third-party JavaScript libraries that
were not written in typescript so for
those cases any comes very handy to
write our programs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
