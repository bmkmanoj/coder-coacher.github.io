last lesson we have covered the angular
change detection error that says
expression changed after it was checked
this is an error formed by the angular
development mode that happens from time
to time we have covered exactly what the
cause of the error is and in this lesson
we are going to cover how to fix it
going back to our error message as we
can see this error message is actually
very helpful this message is preventing
us from writing a user interface that
would not behave as expected we would be
modifying the data here in our component
and that would not be reflected to the
template that will be the type of bug
that it's very hard to troubleshoot and
reason about we want to avoid that now
that we understand the error let's see
how we can fix it let's go back here to
our course component this is the place
to link the paginate ER with the data
source
let's now understand exactly why this
method is problematic what is happening
here is that we are binding the page
observable with the data source but we
are also here with start with no forcing
the loading of the first page and this
is actually what is causing the error
and in order to show that let's remove
this initialization of the first page we
are then going to reload our application
and see that the first page is not being
loaded but also we see that there is no
error here on the console so this proves
that it's the loading of the first page
directly here on ng after viewing it
that is causing the issue we still want
to load the first page of data but this
time around instead of loading it here
in ng after viewing it which will cause
the problem let's instead load the
initial data of the component here on
the ng own init lifecycle hook so we are
going to be calling here the data source
we are going to lower the lessons for
the current course that we have received
via router we are going to specify that
we don't want
any filtering to be done initially we
are going to specify the ascending order
this is the first page with index 0 and
the page size is free with this in place
let's now reload the application and
confirm that the first page is now
correctly being loaded and we don't have
any error here in the console so this is
the best way of solving this problem
avoiding modifying data inside lifecycle
who calls such as for example ng after
viewing it and instead do data
modification operations in other parts
of our component the best place to
initialize the data of our component as
we can see is the ng on in its lifecycle
hook now that we have understood and
fixed our problem let's continue the
implementation of our data table we are
going to be implementing server-side
sorting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
