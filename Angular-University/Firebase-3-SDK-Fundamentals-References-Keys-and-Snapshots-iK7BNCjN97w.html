the angular diversity in this lesson we
are going to learn a couple of essential
concepts of the firebase SDK references
and snapshots it's coming right up
let's now better understand the concept
of snapshot and the concept of reference
so a reference is a reference to any
node in the firebase not only to the
root node that's for example point to
the messages node we can do so by
specifying here in the ref call let's
just ask for the message is null and
let's print its value so after clicking
ctrl s we can see that the snapshot
value that I receive directly is the one
entry which is an object with the
property of text and a value of hello
world and what happens if I print also
the key so the snapshot comes also with
a key property so this is not a function
call so if we try snap not key what we
get we get ASCII we have messages and as
value we have an object with a property
of text and a value of hello world so
when we point it to the messages node we
received a snapshot that contains as key
messages itself and as value an array
with only one element with an object
let's have another object to the
messages list so let's adhere the knob
jecht under the key of two so the
message will be the second message for
example so now we have two objects in
the list so take a look the key is still
messages but the value is now an array
with two objects so as we can imagine
each object will correspond in order in
this case to the messages that we have
added here and
so what happens if we now query directly
one of the objects is this possible so
let's try it out let's try to read the
message to for example so if we go to
messages
/ - and we hit ctrl s what we receive
here as key is to which corresponds to
this so this is the key of the node and
the value corresponds to the object with
message second message which is this
object right here as you can see the
fire way is real-time database contains
an arbitrary structure just like a JSON
object we can point to any node of the
database using a reference and we can
query it and receive back snapshot which
contains a key and a value did you
notice how sometimes you get back an
array and sometimes you get back an
object be sure to see our lesson on
firebase array support now in order to
better understand firebase we're going
to need some more data let's populate
the data of our development database in
the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
