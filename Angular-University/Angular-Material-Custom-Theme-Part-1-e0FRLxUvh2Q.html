last part of the course we are going to
be building a custom angular material
theme so far we have been using a
pre-built theme for our sample
application if we head over here to our
Styles dot CSS if you remember we have
chosen in the first part of the course
the indigo pink pre-built theme that we
are seeing here on the screen this
indigo pink CSS file that is available
here inside load modules in the angular
build was built using sass sass stands
for synthetically awesome CSS this is a
CSS preprocessor that announced is the
CSS language with a lot of features if
we have a look here we can see that one
of the main features is variables we can
define for example a variable with a
color and use that variable in multiple
parts of the program we can create
functions we can have many of the
standard features of a normal
programming language this language is
then going to be compiled to plain CSS
there are two flavors of it we are going
to be using the s CSS extension as
opposed to the sass extension as you can
see there are several synthetic
differences this is the one that angular
material uses internally to build their
themes and this is the one that we will
be using in our custom theme as well so
we are going to switch back here to our
IDE
let's close the compiled CSS file we are
going to start by seeing how does
angular material produce this file based
on sass and the best way to do that is
to build ourselves the indigo pink CSS
theme so we are going to build it
ourselves in our build pipeline using
the angular CLI and some of the sass
files that are available inside load
modules so in order to do that the first
thing that we need to do is to configure
our angular CLI to build sass files
instead of plain CSS files so if we
scroll down here in our
angular CLI Jason we are going to see
here that the style extension that we
are using is CSS if we simply change
this to sassy CSS now the angular CLI
will be able to process sass files we
are going to go here also to the Styles
folder and we are going to show that
everything is already working at this
stage we are going to rename this tiles
file to a CSS we can see now that this
is being highlighted by the ID as a sass
file and there are no compilation errors
we could already define here for example
a variable which is a primary color that
we could define as blue and we could use
these in multiple places of our style
sheet let's say that for example we have
here a class which is the core CSS class
we could say that the background of this
CSS element would be blue using the
variable primary color so as you can see
all the features of sass are currently
available which include standard CSS
imports so we are currently here
importing the indigo pink CSS theme
directly now we don't want to do this at
this stage we want instead to build this
file ourselves let's see how we're going
to do that we are going to switch over
to the angular material github
repository which is under slash angular
slash material - and we are going to try
to see how the indigo pink theme is
being built with each angular release
for that we are going to use here the
search part we are going to search for
the indigo keyword and we can see here
that there is here a file under the core
theming pre-built directory there is a
file called indigo - pink dot SAS so
this is the file that angular is using
to build the indigo pink theme we can
see here that we are importing here a
series of mix-ins or predefined
functions that we have available for
building a theme we are defining two
color palettes we're going to see what
this is in a moment but we can see here
that we define here a primary palette
and
an accent palette and then we use this
predefined function or mixing to
calculate light theme so we also could
calculate here a dark theme and with
this last call here we are creating the
film so what we are going to do is the
same in our program we are going to take
this code and we are going to switch to
our IDE and we are going to paste in
this code we are going to remove here
this import of the CSS file because what
we want is to build it ourselves and we
are going to fix here this compilation
error what this import is trying to do
is to import a file called fema dot sass
so this is available here and there node
modules angular material we are going to
import it here to our Styles dot CSS
because this is the file that contains
all the mix ins that we are using here
to build this theme so in order to
import this feeling dot sass file we are
going to be using this import statement
to the file angular slash material slash
feeling that if you head over here to
load modules and we open angular and
then we head over here to material where
we see that we have here this file if
you notice it has an underscore here at
the beginning that we are not using here
the underscore means that this is a
partial CSS file so the compiler if it
sees this file in a folder will not
automatically build it
the sass compiler will only build files
that don't have an underscore at the
beginning such as for example the Styles
dot SAS file so this file here is a
partial SAS file it's meant to be used
in another SAS files as an import and
that's what we are doing here we are
going to be going over these multiple
code lines that we have here the two
palettes the construction of the feem
but before going any further let's
confirm that indeed this Col is the code
necessary for building the indigo pink
theme if that is the case we are going
to be using this as a base line we are
going to be defining our own palettes
and we are going to be creating our own
fee
based on the starting point let's then
try to build the material indigo phim in
order to do that we need to head over
here to angular CLI dot Jason and do
another modification we have modified
here the name of the Styles dot CSS file
it's now a sass file so we need to
change here the file name as well and
with this in place we can head over here
to the command line let's do an NPM
start so it's important that you stop
and you restart your angular CLI
whenever you change the angular CLI dot
JSON file and now let's have a look at
what the built indigo film looks like
after a while you should see here a
compiled successfully message so if we
saw here any errors it means that the
film was not built successfully if you
have the compiled successfully message
then let's refresh the browser and see
what we have on the screen so as you can
see we have exactly the same material
indigo theme but this time we built it
ourselves based on this code setup if we
head over here to the matte indigo
variable we will be able to jump into it
because this is coming from the female
file that is inside here load modules so
if we hit command and we click into it
we're going to see that we have here
material pink defined as a variable so
we will be going over what these exactly
means in a moment right now we can see
that in this file we have here called
pallets that are available here so if
for example we now take the material red
theme and we use it here so instead of
material indigo we use this palette here
then we are going to be having a
completely different look and feel to
our application so as we can see we now
have here a red theme just by changing
this variable so let's have a look at
how can we build our own custom theme
based on this setup this is coming right
up in the next few lessons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
