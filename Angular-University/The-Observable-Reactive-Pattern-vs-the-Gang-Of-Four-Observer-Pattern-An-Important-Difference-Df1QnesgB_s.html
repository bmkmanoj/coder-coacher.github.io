from the angular University in this
lesson what we're going to do is we are
going to introduce the observable
pattern as an evolution towards this
existing solution that we presented just
now we are going to see how it improves
upon the solution that we have been
using so far the first thing that we
need to do is to check out a new branch
called observable pattern so you can
simply do git checkout observable
pattern if you already have the branch
available locally if you want to check
it out from the remote repository you
can do git checkout - be give here the
name of the local branch that you are
about to create and then you simply
check out the remote branch origin slash
observable pattern with the new branch
checked out let's go back to the diagram
of the observer pattern which
corresponds to the solution that we have
been implementing so far that it has
started to not scale well in complexity
there are multiple issues with this
solution let's identify here the first
issue so let's identify here one main
issue with the observer pattern that we
have been using to implement our global
event bus well one of the main issues
with it is that we have here the ability
to subscribe to the arrival of new data
so we are mixing here on the same
interface the subject the ability to
observe data with the ability of
emitting that same data so everywhere on
the application everybody has direct
access to the subject meaning that not
only the counter can register itself to
observe the arrival of new data but it
can also implicitly because it has
direct access to the subject you can
also emit any value on behalf of any
other part of the application well the
problem with this is that probably every
part of the application would like to
have the ability to subscribe to any
type of data but only certain parts of
the application should be able to emit
certain events so a major problem with
the observer pattern is that there is no
clear
separation between the ability of
register observers to get new values of
a data and the ability to emit that same
data because everybody implicitly has
access to the subject we would like to
change that we would like to make a
separation between the ability to
register an observer and the ability to
emit data okay so let's now start
implementing that separation
let's do first here some renaming so far
we have been using the terminology of
this diagram but let's change here some
terminology for example instead of
notify we are going to use the name next
for reporting a new value of the data to
an observer also we are going to rename
here the same method notify observers we
are going to rename it to next as well
let's rename register observer to
subscribe and let's simply rename and
register observer to unsubscribe so so
far we have only renamed a few methods
but at this point this might start to be
more familiar to you
to rxjs and observables so we have here
the observer interface that has one
method next in rxjs there are a couple
more methods which allow us to report
errors and observable completion we will
get to that later right now here we have
the subject so we can see here that
there is some similarity between these
two methods here the subject is
inherently tied to the event type which
is a string this is because we were
using it here to implement an event bus
so let's make here the subject have the
exact same method has here the observer
interface so we can see that the subject
extends here this interface so we can
simply be clear that relation here to
make it more explicit so it's the exact
same signature to report a new data
value but we also have these two methods
and if we look at them this is
essentially the ability that we have to
sub
bribe to the subject or unsubscribe well
what we're going to do is we are going
to refactor these two methods into a new
interface that we are going to simply
call the observable and what will this
interface have as methods well it will
simply have the ability to subscribe or
unsubscribe to some set of data we are
going to remove from the observable
interface we are going to remove the
event type concept as well what we are
going to do now is say that the subject
extends both the observer and observable
interfaces so what we have done with
this separation is to split the ability
of being notified of our emitting new
data in the observer interface from the
ability to subscribe to new data which
is available via and observable so in
the case of the subject a subject is
both an observer and an observable but
that might not always be the case in
other elements of our application it
just happens to be so in the case of the
subject so the subject is essentially
comparable to an event wells that we
have implemented before so now that we
have introduced the observable pattern
let's start building our program around
this notion and let's see how using the
observable pattern will improve our
program and let's find out exactly in
which way this is coming right up in the
next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
