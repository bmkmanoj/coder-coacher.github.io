and its features I want you to have an
overall view of what is the big
advantage of using typescript so imagine
that you are a JavaScript developer that
you develop your programs in plain
JavaScript you will notice that the
language is constantly evolving meaning
that there are new features that are
being added to the language that are not
implemented all at the same time in all
the browsers and you can only use the
new feature when it's available
basically in all browsers otherwise your
program will break when you run it into
certain browsers and not others for
example let's take a look at the state
of adoption of the LED keyword we head
over to can I use calm which is the
recommended place to go to find out if a
feature is well supported across
browsers and we type in here let in the
search bar we might be surprised to find
out that the LED keyword is actually
already available in most browsers but
what about other features that we are
going to cover in this course let's take
for example another feature which are
arrow functions that we will cover in
detail but it's a feature that we would
like to use today well take a look it's
not supported in Internet Explorer 11
which is still very used in the Internet
at this day so we ran into this
situation where we have many separate
language features each one being
developed independently and added in its
own schedule to different browsers
across the web so this means that in
many browsers we could already use the
feature but not in others well we would
like to be able to use the feature today
typescript helps us with that and in
what way the typescript compiler takes
the new features and converts them into
plain egg no script 5 JavaScript so let
keyword is converted to var and each
feature has its own way of being
converted into plain JavaScript so this
ensures us that we can use the new
feature of the JavaScript language today
and it will still work across all
browsers
because the typescript compiler
converted the feature into something
that can be run in every browser so
that's one of the big advantages and one
of the big reasons for using typescript
a second common reason to use typescript
a second big advantage of typescript is
the ability of defining types like the
name indicates and that advantage is
already present here even in this very
simple program so this very whole
message has the type string because it
has been initialized to a string the
compiler has implicitly associated to
the string type so if you now go here
and for example try to assign it to a
number you will get an error and if you
over-over the error you will see here
type number is not assignable to type
string if you head over to the command
line and you compile the program again
you will get the same error that we are
receiving here on the IDE so the error
message on the console should be
consistent with what you are seeing in
the IDE we can see how this would be
useful the type system of typescript is
helping us build a more correct program
it's helping us catch bugs while we
develop our program and not at run time
also notice that we did not have to tell
typescript that is variable was a string
that was detected automatically so this
feature is known as type inference but
we could have also declared message as a
string by using a type annotation so in
this case we are explicitly defining the
message variable as a string we are no
longer relying on the type inference
feature of the compiler but if you are a
JavaScript developer you might be
thinking at this point that sometimes
this is exactly what we want to do we
want to be able to pass in either a
string or a number to a certain
configuration API and let the color
handle the fact that those might be two
different types so with typescript we
don't lose the flexibility of doing
these kinds of things we can still do it
we can declare here that this message
very
is either a number or a string as you
can see we no longer get any errors in
the program this feature that you saw
here in action is a union type and we
are going to cover that in detail I hope
that now you have a better overview of
what are the advantages of typescript
that was really what I wanted to
transmit to you in this short lesson so
let's quickly summarize the advantages
of typescript you can use new features
of the language today without waiting
for widespread browser adoption that
might take a lot of years you can use
types in your program to help you write
a better program with less bugs you have
inferred types in your program so you
can take advantage of type safety even
without using a lot of type annotations
in your program you still preserve all
the flexibility of plain JavaScript if
you still need it you can still do
everything that you could do in plain
JavaScript in typescript and last but
not least you can actually build your
full application with it you can build
the front end and the back end with only
one language which would simplify
tremendously our life as software
developers so how do we take it from
here
because there are so many features in
the language how do we approach the
learning of the language let's start by
exploring the new features of plain
JavaScript that we can already use today
such as the LED and the Const keywords
and many other features let's start by
learning them first we are going to
cover that in this next section</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
