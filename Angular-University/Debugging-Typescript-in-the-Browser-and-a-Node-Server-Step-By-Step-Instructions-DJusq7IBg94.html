so the first thing that we need to bear
in mind is that typescript is not the
code that is actually being run in the
browser or a node we are running plain
JavaScript and in order to be able to
debug typescript we need to provide to
the debugger source maps so that it can
map between the JavaScript code and the
typescript code we can see here that in
the TS config dot JSON file we have
source map set to false but if you
expand some of these nodes you might
notice that you have here some ancient
GS dot map files even though we have
here source map set to false these files
were generated by the IDE before we had
added here a configuration file to it so
if we now remove them and we make a
change to the file to trigger its
recompilation we will see that only the
JavaScript file is being generated and
not the map file so if we delete the
ancient map files that we might have
here they would not be generated at this
stage so we would not be able to have
our debugger show us the typescript code
for that for enabling source Maps we
simply change this flag to true now
whenever a program gets compiled in this
case it's being compiled by the IDE but
we could also compile it via the command
line using TSC we have the source maps
that are available now so we can start
debugging our program we will
demonstrate first how to debug this
hello - world es file in the browser
then we will move to the server we are
going to run this program in the server
and we are going to debug it using both
webstorm and the chrome dev tools as
well there is a way to debug node.js
programs in chrome so let's get started
first let's start our HTTP server so if
we go back here tour package that reason
we had heared this small npm script that
would allow us to run an HTTP server
that loads the index dot HTML page which
loads the hello world program so if we
now switch over to the browser we would
be able to see this program working in
the browser we have here in the console
we can see that the program is working
now if we hit the sources tab we can see
here that we have a samples folder and
that we have here a typescript file and
JavaScript file also for HelloWorld dot
J's this means that the source maps are
working that the debugger can do the
mapping between typescript and
JavaScript so if we add here a
breakpoint and we refresh the
application we can see that the
breakpoint is hit and take a look at the
tab here the name of the file we are
debugging the typescript file in the
browser which is exactly what we wanted
so we don't need to debug the transpiled
javascript sources because this becomes
less readable as the program becomes
more complex take a look even in this
very simple example from the moment that
we use modules it becomes a rather
complicated so the typescript source is
much more readable and it's exactly the
program that we are writing so I will
release here the breakpoint and I will
remove the breakpoint here from the
browser we are going to go back to the
code and we are going to learn how to
add a breakpoint programmatically so for
up doing that we simply add the debugger
statement so a single line ending in a
semicolon this will trigger a breakpoint
in the browser so let's switch over to
the browser and reload the page we can
see that the debugger statement indeed
triggers the programmatic breakpoint
let's now go back to the IDE
and learn how to debug the same program
that we just debug in the browser so
it's hello - world yes but this time we
are going to debug it in node.js
as a back-end node process so let's see
how to do this in order to do so we can
add breakpoints to the program directly
to the typescript file by clicking with
the mouse here for example let's add
point here to this line noticed that you
don't have a checkbox yet this means
that the break point was not yet fully
applied so let's see how we can apply a
break point here first we are going to
go to edit configurations and we are
going to create a new node.js
configuration so if you open the
defaults here and select nodejs
we're going to click Add so the plus
button and we have just created a new
configuration and we choose no JL so we
are going to debug and nodejs process we
are going to give it a name so hello
world and we are going to point it to
the same node interpreter that we have
been using so in this case 6 dot 9.0 and
for this particular example we won't be
needing any more parameters so we click
apply and then ok and we will have here
hello world available so we need to
specify here which javascript file we
need to debug so in this case we are
going to debug the hello - world dot JS
file so it's important that you point to
the hello - world JS file that was
generated by webstorm after saving hello
- world yes
if you point to the typescript file this
will not work we need to point to the
JavaScript file because that's what is
going to be executed at runtime by node
and that's what it's going to be
debugged then the source maps are going
to show us the typescript code let's try
this out we click apply ok so now we
have here the breakpoint and we are
going to run the program in debug mode
by clicking here the debug button so
let's do that and immediately the
breakpoint is hit so you can see this
dark blue this means that the breakpoint
was hit if I add here another breakpoint
notice that first the red dot was fully
red and now you have this small tick
that says that the breakpoint is valid
if you hit here on resume program you
are going to see that the next
breakpoint is hit and we have here for
example in this variable Spain we have
here all the variables of the program so
we can debug our
program in typescript in the IDE and we
don't have to debug the sources
themselves that were generated as the
output of the compilation we can do our
debugging directly in typescript we can
also debug in ojs processes using the
chrome dev tools just like we did before
in the beginning of this video for
debugging hello - world in the browser
so for that we can head over to the
command line and we are going to use
certain flags that are available in node
since the release 6 not free so the
first flag that we need is - inspect and
the second flag that we need is - -
debug broker then we need to pass in a
JavaScript file we're going to pass in
hello - world dot J yes so it's
important that we point to the
JavaScript file we hit enter and we are
going to get here a message in the
console saying that if we copy paste
this URL to Chrome we will be able to
debug the hello - world program in
Chrome using the same dev tools that we
were using before so let's try that we
passed in this URL that will receive
from the console and we can see that the
program is stopped at the beginning of
the execution so we can put for example
here a breakpoint we hit resume and you
can see that the breakpoint is being hit
now at this moment in time we cannot
apply the source Maps here automatically
to map this to typescript so this
feature of the chrome dev tools is not
yet available we cannot at this point in
time debug typescript
in node.js processes using the chrome
dev tools but it will be available
shortly so it's a good thing to bear in
mind and to check back from time to time
to see when the feature is available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
