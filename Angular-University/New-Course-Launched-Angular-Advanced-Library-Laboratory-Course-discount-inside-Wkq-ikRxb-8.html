from the angular University welcome to
the advanced angular library laboratory
course in this course we are going to
cover the advanced features of angular
but we're going to do that in a very fun
and practical way what we will be doing
is we are going to use those features on
may be their most typical use case is to
build a series of small open source
components for angular essentially we
are going to be building a series of
small components that can be potentially
reused in just about any angular project
this is going to be something very
concrete that you could actually use in
your own applications the components
will be built from the simplest
component to the most complex so we will
be progressively increasing the
difficulty of the components along the
course we are going to introduce testing
from the very first component or
directives that we built and we will be
testing the components as the course
progresses closer to the end of the
course we are going to introduce
animations in the final component that
we will be building so all the modules
that we will be building will be
compatible with angular ahead of time
compilation they will be available on
NPM and I hope that this will encourage
you to publish your own module it's
going to be a ton of fun we will be
using the yarn package manager all the
way
well except to install yarn itself we're
going to be using NPM but that will
ensure it was stable development
environment where we are sure that the
dependencies that you have downloaded
are exactly the same ones that I had
running on my computer now let me tell
you about the components that we are
going to be building together in this
course we're going to start small with a
simple component that will already
present a lot of the advanced features
of angular this component is going to be
a font awesome input box it's going to
be mobile friendly and it's a great
starting point to see how many advanced
features we will be introducing the
you will probably be surprised to see
that several features will be introduced
we will be talking about component
design how to style components and we
will be introducing testing straight
away from the beginning at this point we
will also see in general how to make
components see mobile meaning they have
a default theme but it's simple to
override it so that the component will
adapt to the look and feel of any
application as an exercise we will also
be building a Google material design
input box so meaning it will be able to
display an icon which is coming from the
Google material design library so this
will be our starting point an initial
component an exercise we have already
tested a library deployed it to NPM at
this stage so we are ready to continue
to increase a little bit the level of
difficulty of the library we are going
to now build a tab container that has a
default theme but it's still fully
customizable so what do I mean by that
is that we will be able to override just
about anything in the tab container for
example to override the look and feel of
the buttons the tab container will be
able to accept new tabs added
dynamically at runtime so at this point
with already free components built and
deployed in NPM we are going to be
building an input mask directive so this
will be the first directive that we will
be using in this course this input mask
directive will help the user to
introduce anything that has a predefined
format such as for example a phone
number or social security number this
will be designed in a way that it's
compatible with the components that we
have been building so far next what we
are going to be building is a dynamic
modal component so like a pop-up that
you sometimes see for login and user etc
this is going to be a completely dynamic
component and what I mean by that is
that the model will not be hidden let's
say with display:none on the page it
will be added to the page last
so it's a completely dynamic component
we haven't done this before in this
course and once we have that in place so
at this point we have already five or
six modules created in NPM we're going
to build a new library that is also very
usable and quite useful which is we are
going to combine all the directives and
components that we have built so far
into a dynamic model payment component
that we will be adding animations to so
this is the part of the course that will
be covering animations so I hope that
this gives you an overall idea of the
content of the course if you want to
know the exact features that we will be
covering I can give you a LAN extensive
list so we are going to be covering the
advanced core angular features such as
the templates templates outlets ng
content ng container style isolation and
customization we are going to be
covering Ã¤Ã´t or ahead of time
compilation we are going to be covering
a global event debugging with the
angular CLI view children content
children and all the decorators that are
related to all the lotions around the
light DOM versus the shadow Dom we're
going to be covering all the directive
features such as host binding and host
listener dynamic components that will be
the modal we are going to be covering
keyboard events testing animations so
again this is an an extensive list I
invite you to have a look at the
description of the course in case if you
are looking for a particular feature but
we will be covering a lot of them a lot
of the angular advanced features we are
going to build a series of open source
libraries it's going to be a ton of fun
I hope that you will enjoy it and
because it's an advanced course we're
going to start straightaway we will be
checking out the code with some
predefined styles in place and we will
be diving straightaway into building our
first angular library deploying it on
NPM so without further ado let's get
started building our first angular
library thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
