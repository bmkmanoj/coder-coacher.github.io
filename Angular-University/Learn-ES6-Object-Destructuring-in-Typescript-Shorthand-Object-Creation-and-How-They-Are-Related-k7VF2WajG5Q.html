six feature which is called object
destructuring so if you want the code
that you see here at this point you can
check out the tag section 14 now what we
have here is a built person data
function that returns a string this
texts input and object and it
concatenates several properties of the
object in order to produce another
string so we pass it in an object person
data that has here a couple of
properties first name last name and
address now what is object this
structuring let's have a look at it also
in these next few examples we're going
to start mixing several features of the
language just to keep it more
interesting so for example here we have
an example of string concatenation if
you highlight this string concatenation
in webstorm and you hit alt enter you
have here an option replace with
template string so as you can see this
creates a template literal that contains
the same concatenation in a more
readable way now let's have a look at
object destructuring this scenario here
is actually quite frequent we are
passing into a function we are passing
it in an object which has several
properties this could be for example a
configuration object of a jQuery API
call it could have a lot of properties
here so accessing them using person data
dot first name etc in multiple places of
a function can be quite verbose so what
we might end up doing is something like
this we declare here a variable first
name and we assign it to person data and
then instead of typing everywhere person
data that first name we simply type the
name of the locally defined variable
first name and we will do the same for
the two other variables this is what the
program would look like after applying
the same logic to last name and address
so this is doable but it's a little bit
verbose we can instead use object
destructuring and say that we are
receiving an object
but we are only going to use inside this
function certain properties of the
object we are only going to use first
name last name and address so let's try
this out we have here defined free
variables if we remove this we can see
that the program still compiles
correctly so the function expects an
object with three properties and it D
structures the object applying something
very similar to what we have here
written but implicitly so first name is
immediately available to be used in the
body of the function now what would
happen if we would pass in here an extra
property this would still work so the
fact that we pass in an object with more
properties other than the first name
last name and address does not break the
compilation of the program what the
district Turing syntax means is that we
are taking these free properties because
these are the only properties of the
object that we need to implement this
concrete method so this gives for a more
readable and simple syntax another
feature of Ahmed script 6 that is very
closely related to object destructuring
which is a syntax for creating objects a
shorthand syntax let's see in which
situations this syntax is useful let's
quickly refactored here the building of
the person data object let's define this
first name as a Const we are going to
initialize it and we are going to do the
same to last name and address so we have
here just defined free constants and we
have initialized them now we are going
to use these constants to initialize the
person data object so the person data
still has a property named first name
which has a value of first names so the
same name here is used to both the name
of the object property and the name of
the variable that contains the value of
the property so we will now pass in here
also last name and address and the same
apply
to address and last name so let's have a
quick look at what we have here so there
is a typo here it's one of the things
that typescript will allow you to catch
at compile time its typos now this
program is equivalent what we have but
take a look there is here some
repetition we have here first name and
we have here first name again here is
the name of the property of the person
data object and here it's the name of a
variable called first name this is a
very common scenario actually this
happens a lot so there is a shorthand
notation for creating objects that are
creative in this situation we can simply
type just first name last name and
address and this is equivalent to what
we had before so this is still creating
an object with free properties whose
values are the variables that have the
same name as the property so it's a very
common scenario and you can see how this
makes the program more readable this
example shows how many of these acma
script six features are actually related
and meant to be used together so object
this structuring is a great way to take
an object as an input and extract only a
few properties and quickly use them in
the body of our function and the
shorthand object creation notation
allows you to for example quickly create
a return type in a function simply using
a few of the values that you have just
defined let's continue presenting some
more es6 features keeping it interesting
showing how they are meant to be used
together mostly but remember very soon
we are going to dive deep into the
typescript to type system and see how it
helps us to build better programs and
you have noticed even in these simple
examples we are getting type safety
errors so even in these very simple
examples typescript is helping us to
write our program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
