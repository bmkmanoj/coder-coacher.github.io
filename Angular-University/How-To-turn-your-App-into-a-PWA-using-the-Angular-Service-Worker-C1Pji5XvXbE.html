start transforming our running angular
application into a progressive web
application now what we're about to do
is we are going to add to this
application the angular service worker
and we're going to configure it if we
would want to scaffold a new application
from scratch from an empty folder using
the angular service worker we could do
so using the angular CLI with the
following command we will do ng new for
a new application the name of the
application and then this flag - -
service worker this is going to add the
service worker from the beginning but
most likely you already have a running
angular application that you want to
turn into a progressive web application
so we are going to do that here instead
of running this command we're going to
see exactly what this command does as
well what changes does it do to the
scaffolded project the first thing that
this command adds to our application is
the service worker itself so we are
going to go here to our dependencies and
we are going to make sure that our
package that jason includes the angular
service worker which is the case here
already in our scaffold application so
if you want to add it to a separate
application make sure to have the
angular service worker manually here and
run npm install in order to have it
available in this case because you've
already executed npm install for this
project you already have the service
worker available in your machine the
next thing that we're going to do is we
are going to configure the angular CLI
build system in order to include the
service worker in the production
application let's see how we're going to
do that we're going to head over here to
the angular CLI configuration file which
is the angular - CLI dot JSON file this
is a JSON configuration file that
configures what the angular CLI does
exactly so we're going to head over here
to our application that we have it's
here on the Apps
arrey and we are going to have here this
client-side application that gets built
in production to this application we are
going to add here a flag that will add a
serviceworker
to the production build and we are going
to add it here below the environments
configuration so we set this flag
serviceworker to true and with this in
place the angular CLI knows that
whenever it's building this application
it also needs to include a service
worker that service worker would already
give us download and install
capabilities to our application out of
the box right now in order for the
angular CLI to be able to build and add
the service worker to the dist folder
and to include it in the running
production application we are also going
to need a configuration file this is a
build configuration file that configures
how the service worker is going to be
built this file should be located here
on your source folder and it's called ng
SW which stands for angular service
worker
- config dot Jason and we are going to
have a look at it if you are turning
your application into a PWI you will
have to add this file manually let's
have a look at this file this file
contains already some service worker
configuration notice that this file will
not be used at runtime by your
application this is a build step
configuration file the first option that
you will need configure is what is your
index page this is the default index
page index dot HTML next we will need to
configure the service worker caching
behavior at run time we are going to
configure here how should the multiple
bundles of the application the
JavaScript and CSS bundles how should
those bundles be cached at run time we
are going to do that here at a level of
the asset groups property we can also
add configuration for caching REST API
data right now for the download and
installation capabilities of our
application we are going to focus on
only the asset groups that is the goal
of this section so we have here an asset
group that configures how the
application itself should be cached
we are running these in mold prefetch
this means that all the files that are
specified here will be downloaded on the
background by the serviceworker once our
application starts up this is so that it
does not disrupt the user experience in
the reminder of this section we are
configuring what files exactly from the
application should be cached by the
serviceworker at startup time here on
the files property we are specifying a
couple of separate files that have a
constant name that is exactly the same
with each deployment of the application
we have here for example the index dot
HTML file itself
which will not change name with each new
build so as you can see the service
worker will cache the index dot HTML
file itself this means that whenever our
application gets offline and we will do
a demo of that we will still be able to
load the page from the cache without
having to use the network for example we
also have here a second file which is
the fav icon this is the icon that gets
used whenever you save a website as a
bookmark we also have here a series of
version files
this version files are going to include
any CSS bundles generated by the
application any JavaScript bundles and
any lazy loaded files that we might
generate with the angular CLI these
files will change their name depending
if the content has changed since the
last build or not we will be seeing
these files in the moment in the dist
folder we also have here some
configuration for some other static
assets this corresponds to the asset
directory here in our source folder this
is going to contain images and other
static resources that our website might
need these have been configured to be
installed in lazy mode this means that
these will only be cached by the
serviceworker the first time that they
are requested let's now see what all
this configuration the behavior that we
have specified for version files for
static assets what does this correspond
to at runtime
start up our application before that we
need to register the service worker on
the application so we need to go here to
the application module and here at the
level of the imports of our application
module we are going to register the
service worker in order to do that we
have registered here the service worker
module and we are specifying here the
name of the service worker file this
name should not be changed and we will
see this file in the dist folder in a
moment we are going to make sure that we
enable this service worker only in our
production build if we would enable that
in our development build we would have
to clear the service worker constantly
on localhost and with this in place we
have all the steps necessary to make
this application downloadable and
installable so let's try this out we are
going to head over to the command line
and on the same directory where we have
our package dot Jason we are going to
use the following command ng build - -
prod with this we will have on the dist
folder the output of our application
together with the service worker let's
have a look at the output once the build
is finished we are going to head over
here to the dist folder and we're going
to have a look at what we have here in
the next lesson we are going to review
the content of the dist folder see what
each file corresponds to and then we are
going to run our first progressive web
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
