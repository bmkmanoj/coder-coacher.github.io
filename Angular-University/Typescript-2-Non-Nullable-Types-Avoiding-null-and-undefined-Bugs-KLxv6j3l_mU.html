functionality nullable types so here we
have defined an mm called player
position and we have defined an
interface player with a name and a
position properties now we have here an
object which is called Kobe which is of
type players so let's add the type
annotation here now this variable Kobe
is of type player but we could also
assign it for example no and we could
also assign it and defined and this
would still compile this would still be
a valid typescript program but we might
not want this functionality we might
want to ensure that this variable is an
instance of player and that by some
reason it cannot be null or undefined we
would like the type system to help us
define that declare this rule in order
to do so let's configure the typescript
compiler to turn on the strict null
check mode to prevent the situation from
occurring for that let's head over to
the command line to the root of our
project so take a look we are in the
root of our complete typescript course
folder repository now we are going to do
TSC - - in it and these created here in
this folder
it created a TS config dot jason this
file is a configuration file that
configures the typescript compiler with
some commonly used options actually
until this moment in the course we were
actually using the typescript compiler
via the webstorm ID and these options
were actually already active so as we've
seen before whenever we use import and
export that Eichner script six syntax
for modules in our program we were
compiling our program to comment yes we
saw that before we were compiling
imports to the require statement and
export to populating the x
it's property as we can see here we were
already using our target as es5 meaning
that we are compiling to a version of
JavaScript that is currently available
in all browsers we could compile
typescript down to es6 for example if
our target platform would be es6 enabled
but we usually we compile to es 5 in
most cases now take a look at these
other two options now implicit any set
to false we are going to cover what no
implicit any is in a moment source Maps
we will also have a specific section for
debugging so these two options will be
explained later right now we want to add
here an option that is available since
typescript 2 that will prevent this
situation from occurring so the ability
to assign undefined
to a variable that should be a type
player so in order to do the property
that we are looking for is strict null
checks which is by default false we want
to set it to true also at this moment we
want to configure webstorm to use this
TS config so use the s config so this is
why it's important that you put the TS
config dot JSON file in the root of the
project so that webstorm can take it
from there if you put it in another
folder webstorm will not be able to use
it and you will have differences between
the errors that webstorm is displaying
you from when compared to the results
that you would get from the command line
so this way you will get the same
results in both environments if we go
back to the program we can see that now
we get an error for this situation so it
would take a moment for the compiler to
be adjusted to the new options but we
can see here that now we get type and
defined is not assignable to type player
you can also see the same error here in
the typescript pain in the webstorm ibe
you have a list of errors of the current
program so we have effectively prevented
this situation
from happening we cannot also assign it
to know if we try to assign the variable
Kobe to know we had type know is not
assignable to type player so this is
exactly what we expected as you can see
this functionality is really very useful
to catch all those little relative
errors that tend to pollute many of our
programs also errors related to n
defined so you might think why isn't
this option turned on by default well
this is so with typescript to do to
backwards compatibility so we want to
make sure that programs that are written
with typescript 1 we want to make it
easier to migrate them to typescript
two if we will have sprit null checks
set to true by default in typescript 2
that will introduce a major breaking
change that it would make quite hurt to
migrate many programs from typescript 1
to typescript 2 so currently it's set to
false by default to make it easier to
upgrade to typescript - but if we are
writing a new program it's a great idea
to turn this flag on since the beginning
because this is one of the main features
of typescript 2 now let's go back to
this program there are situations where
a variable can be nullable so it could
be an optional variable sometimes it's
no and sometimes it contains a player an
instance of player so how can we tell
that to the type system so that this
program compiles correctly we can use a
union type for it we can say that the
Cobie variable is a player or no and now
the program compiles correctly without
any errors notice that if we assign
these two and defined we still get an
error type and defined is not assignable
to player or no so we could take this
one step further and we could add here
the type and defined and with this the
program would compile correctly so now
with typescript 2 we get the possibility
to say which variables are null
which variables can be undefined and
which variables are expected to always
contain a value so in the program that
we are about to write the rest interface
that access a sequel database that we
will be building in a moment we are
going to use strict null checks from the
beginning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
