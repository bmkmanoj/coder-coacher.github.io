components we have here a hero's
component which is a configurable
component that can be configured using
the hero element which is implemented
with a directive the hero directive
receives a Marvel property and we are
going to style the hero differently
according to this property let's start
styling superhero rules if we are adding
only one style we can use the plain
input property syntax to write to the
style dumb property so in this case
let's write style dot color equals red
as a quoted string so remember we are
simply writing to the style dump
property of the Dom element
corresponding to the table row this is a
valid approach if we are changing only
one style but an alternative is also to
use the ng style directive with it we
can pass it an object whose keys are the
CSS styles that we want to modify and
whose values are the value of the
corresponding style here we are passing
it a string constant but this could be
any JavaScript expression ng style also
takes any JavaScript expression so we
can use it to retrieve a variable from
the controller containing an object with
our styles
let's make Styles a calculated property
and implement it with the gaiter the
object containing the Styles can contain
any number of styles let's go over ng
class we are going to apply the Marvel
CSS class to all Marvel heroes and we
are going to apply the Hulk class well
to the Hulk first notice that we can
still use the input properties syntax to
add a single class so in this case we're
going to add the Marvel class if the
hero has the Marvel flag set to true as
can see the Marvel class has been
applied correctly let's now use the ng
class directive by passing it in object
literal the keys of the literal are the
CSS classes that we want to have or
remove to the element and the values are
JavaScript expressions that should
return a boolean if true the class will
be added to the element besides an
object literal we can pass into ng class
any JavaScript expression as long as it
returns an object let's refactor this
and call a classes controller method
that will return an object with the
classes that we want to add or remove
like in the case of ng style we can have
here any number of classes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
