our controller with our view with these
double curlies index right here let's
just use it out put the string as we can
see it's very easy to use we can use it
to output directly controller variables
let's just create a controller variable
message and out put it inside this
interpolation block as we can see it's
very simple to output controller
variables to our template we can use in
general inside an interpolation block
any valid JavaScript expression as long
as it's an expression and not a
statement for example this will evaluate
as expected to true because we can use
any valid JavaScript expression you can
also use the JavaScript ternary operator
let's give an example we have a
controller variable conditions set it to
true and now we can use it inside an
interpolation block so if the come if
the condition is true fee we will output
the string true free otherwise we will
output fall see of course when we
refresh the template we will see that
trophy is printed to the screen now we
don't have to call member variables only
we can also call functions let's call
here a calculated value function that
simply return the string if we now
refresh the page we can see that the
output is as we expected now we don't
have to use a function for a calculated
value if you don't want to we can use a
typescript gator and get rid of these
parentheses for maybe a slightly more
readable interpolation expression what
happens if we try to output a property
of a variable that does not exist in
this case vm viewmodel dot message vm
does not exist as we can see angular
frozen air it says cannot read property
message of undefined vm is undefined we
can work around this using the Elvis
operator which is available to us inside
an interpolation block this is not
standard JavaScript as we can see the
error is gone but not
is outputted the way that this works is
that angular detects that vm is
undefined and as such it will not try to
evaluate the JavaScript expression vm
dot now one last thing about the
template syntax for interpolation
because it's a plain JavaScript
expression actually it's even better
because we have the Elvis operator
available we can give it a default value
by using the JavaScript or operator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
