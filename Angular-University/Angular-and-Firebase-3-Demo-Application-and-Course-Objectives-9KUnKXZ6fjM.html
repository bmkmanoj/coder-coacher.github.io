from the angular diversity and I am
super excited to bring you this build an
angular 2 application with firebase
course so in this course we are going to
assume that you saw the previous lessons
on angular 2 namely that you are
familiar with components directives the
router forums and service layers but for
firebase we will start together from
scratch actually the application will be
built from an empty folder using the
angular CLI in the firebase part of the
course you will learn best practices for
data modeling you'll learn how to
structure your data you will learn how
to use the firebase push case you will
understand how the firebase SDK works
you will also learn how to set up
security rules for your application and
do authentication in fiber you will
learn how to use the new angularfire
observable based library to interact
with firebase the real-time database
also authentication in the angular 2
part of the course you will put in
practice all that you have learned on
previous lessons you're going to set up
an application from scratch from an
empty folder we are going to configure
the router you're going to use the CLI
to generate new components and you are
going to implement them we are going to
implement many of the common patterns
that you will use in just about any
application that you built you will
learn how to set up the master detail
client-side search you are going to
learn how to protect parts of your
application using Rooter guards you will
implement forms for creating new
elements and edit existing elements also
on the firebase part you are going to
learn how to do rest calls to firebase
if you need to and you will also learn
how to build a custom back end in nodejs
if by some reason your system needs a
custom backing that is also possible we
will be using the firebase q library for
that you will also learn about the fire
stack
architecture which enables us to build
applications without any rest api
involved so we will implement a
client-server communication mechanism
that uses firebase cues as the
interaction mechanism let's do a quick
preview of what the application will
look like let's do a quick demo of the
application that we will be building in
this course so it's angular CLI powered
application that you will be able to run
from the command line in development
mode simply typing ng serve once the web
pack will finish is the application will
be available here in Port 4200 the
applications front end is built with
angular 2 and the database that we are
using is firebase so the application is
meant to have many of the common
patterns that you will use in a real
world application such as for example we
have here the home page we can do here
for example some client-side search
let's search for template as you can see
the list adapts as we type in the search
box so this application has for example
a master-detail example here so the
application is a small elearning
platform where you will have a list of
courses so you have here two courses and
if we click view on the course you enter
the detail where you will have here the
first page of lessons for this course so
each entry here is a particular lesson
and you can click to the next page to
the previous page so we will cover
pagination in firebase which is another
common pattern that you will use
probably in just about any application
if you click the lesson you will be
redirected to the login screen so this
is another common pattern in an
application protecting the access of
screens that are only meant to be
accessed by authenticated users after
logging we can access the screen that
was previously protected so it's the
screen that displays a lesson we can
navigate between two lessons of the same
course
let's do that so you can see that the
lesson screen shows the title of the
less and the duration and here it shows
a video this just links to my youtube
channel as an iframe so we are going to
see how in certain cases we will be able
to sanitize HTML that we construct
dynamically and inject it into the page
so this is an iframe that was
dynamically injected in the page it's
another thing that you will might have
to use our location so you can edit the
lesson or you can delete it so if you
have it the lesson we will load here a
form that allows us to edit the lesson
so the course also covers forms let's
say that for example we want to have a
lesson to this course and we have here a
similar form to the previous one but now
it's sort of in new creation mode
instead instead of in edit mode we are
going to see how to implement this it's
another common pattern that will be used
in just about any real application as
I've mentioned the database is in
firebase so you will learn how to set up
your own firebase real-time database how
to understand authentication rules
security rules actually you will learn
how to do rest data modification calls
to firebase you will learn how to date a
model your data in firebase what are
those firebase push IVs and how to use
them best practices for data modeling
and this is only actually a small
overview of what you will learn with
this course I hope you understand the
overall idea the goal is to apply
existing angular 2 concepts to the
building of a small application learn
firebase from scratch and the focus is
on the patterns that you will use always
in any application also the focus is put
on observables observables are used
everywhere from the batch client to the
fire stack example to the service layer
so without further ado let's get started
from an empty folder if you have any
ideas or suggestions
just contact me on social media or via
my website but I hope that you already
have a good idea of the contents of this
course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
