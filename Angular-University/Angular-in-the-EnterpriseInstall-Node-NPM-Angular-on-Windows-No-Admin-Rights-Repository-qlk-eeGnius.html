from the angular University maybe one of
the biggest obstacles to angular 2
adoption our corporate proxies and even
getting it to run in your windows
corporate PC it's really much harder
than one might think while running it
from home for example so the goal of
this video is to get some tips and
tricks on how to get this set up in your
organization and maybe show that
prototype to your boss that will
convince him to adopt angular 2 in your
team so let's get started this is a
quick introduction to the node.js
ecosystem so to load an NPM it's meant
for developers that are just arriving
maybe at the angular 2 ecosystem and
they're trying to figure out nolde NPM
and how to use these tools what we're
going to do here is we're going to go
over how to install node how to switch
easily between node versions how to
install node without administration
rights on your PC and we're going to see
also how to deal with corporate proxies
and the usual obstacles that you will
find if you try to use node in a new
project in a company where it has never
been used before even as a server or as
more frequently a front-end built tool
so the first thing to do is to go to the
website and install node.js you can
download it here usually in angular 2
projects we are using node for front-end
tooling we are not necessarily running
node as the server although we could but
there are many projects where node is
being used as a build tool and as a
development time to Lee sexually so for
those cases it's better to download the
latest version so you want to download
the latest version of node but easier
said and then because these might be
blocked at the level of the installation
it might need admin rights so you don't
need admin rights to install node if you
head over to no GS dot org slash dist
you have here the list of installation
versions that are available
and let's say that we want the latest
version so Version 7.7 here we have it
version 7.2 dot oh we click into it and
we have here a series of downloadable
executables what we can do here is for
example we can download the Windows
version let's say that we want to
download the version 7.2 dot o for
Windows so if we open the package that
we just download with it and we unzip it
we are going to see that the package
contains a no dot X a so this is a Mac
but in Windows you can put this in any
folder in your computer and you need to
add this directory here to your path so
that once you type node in the command
line you would have no training in
Windows so you don't need administration
rights to do this you also have here NPM
and you have NP m dot CMD so when you
put this directly on the path if you
type node - V you should get a working
version of node and any p.m. - V you
should get a working version of NPM as
well you can take a look NP m dot CMD
means that NPM will be recognized as a
command in Windows prompt
once you have not installed the next
thing that you want to install is get
even if your project is using subversion
and will do so for the foreseeable
future it's still great to install git
because it comes with a bash shell that
does not leave any administration rights
to be installed
it's called git bash so it's a terminal
like the Windows terminal but it runs
bash so you can use bash both on the
server and on your computer if you want
and it's great for interacting with git
with NPM it's a great thing to have in
general in your computer so you head
over to get - SCM and you install git in
your computer you will you will
eventually need it for other reasons so
might as well install it and have
goodbye shell it does not require
administration right you have a checkbox
that says I want Windows Explorer
integration so with that integration you
can right click on a folder and you can
do commits on get with it but other
other than that to install git bash and
get itself if you want check that
checkbox you'll be able to install git
bash without any problem in your Windows
PC because those options do not require
administration rights now after having
get and load an NPM installed in your
computer you should have a terminal
where you type node - V and you would
have some ancient version of node maybe
because it was already installed or it's
a fresh install that you just downloaded
and you have the latest version but in a
month in two months you will need a new
node version and you don't want to go
over the process so I would advise you
to install from the beginning a tool
that easily allows you to download
different versions of known this is
great if you have multiple projects each
one depending on different versions of
node so the tool that we can use there a
couple of tools there is a tool called
nvm and there is a tool called Navi so
let's have a look at them here in the
NPM JS org we can see here that Navi has
two thousand downloads in the last day
and let's have a look at nvm so it has a
lot less downloads and we can see here
it has been moved at cetera so at this
moment I would advise you to use Nava
I've been using it for a long time it
works great so in order to install Nava
you need to do NPM install - gee Navi
and if you are in Mac or Linux you will
have to throw in a sudo at the beginning
and the installation should run smoothly
it's a simple tool if we do have a LS
this gives us take a look these are all
the load versions that I have here
installed in this computer so I have a
lot of load
versions so in this case let me see what
was the latest version of node it's 7.2
got old so let's say for example I don't
have here the latest version of node so
how do I install it using Navi I do LS
remote and here it is it's available so
you can also install if you need it you
have versions of i oj s this is the fork
version before the merge let's then use
Navitus tall the latest version of node
you simply have to do Lavie use and then
the version of node that you need so in
this case never used 7.2 . oh it detects
that it's not locally installed so it's
just going to download it and here it's
going to launch a new bash shell so this
has executed a new shell you can exit
from it to go back to the previous shell
right now if you do not - v you have
here the latest version of node
installed so this is a very convenient
way for switching between node versions
so if i now do have a LS i can see here
that I have 7.2 dot o okay so this is a
good start you have a bash shell you
have known you have NPM but typically if
you were in a corporate environment if
you type NPM install at angular slash
core you're going to get a proxy error
so your corporate proxy will not allow
you to install things from the command
line the first thing that you need to do
is to head over to your browser and
there try to see if you have access to
registry dot npm GS dot org so you
should try first with HTTP just to make
sure that you can access it or if you
can't try with HTTP now your corporate
proxy might show you a pop-up saying do
you really want to access this site so
it's a confirmation pop-up that is
trying to see if your Windows user that
is being used to log into your corporate
proxy if you really want to go to that
site you click OK
and many times you can still watch the
site so it's just a preventive measure
in corporate proxies so if at this point
you can access the registry one way or
the other viral browser then we're in
business because this means that in the
last case scenario you could always use
the credentials that your browser is
using to connect itself to the proxy you
could use those same credentials
typically associated to your Windows
user to download your NPM packages as
well so if you can watch it in the
browser you can use those credentials to
download things from NPM as well if you
cannot access NPM GS org then it's
better to request access to it to your
IT department you will end up needing it
any way to search for packages etc and
you might also end up using it to
download node packages or not but it's a
good thing to do at this moment to ask
access for it so let's assume that you
have access to NPM GES dot org if you
are having problems accessing the HTTPS
version of NPM GS dot org and this has
happened to me in the past you might
have to basically turn it off so this is
not recommended but there are situations
where this is necessary and it's I'm
afraid to say rather frequent so instead
of using HTTPS the registry you use HTTP
so you don't want to do this on your
build server this is no long-term
solution the long term solution is to
check with your support team a way to be
able to use HTTPS but if you are just
introducing angular 2 to your
organization and you want to do I don't
know a quick prototype you want to show
something to your boss
you want to have it installed and take
care of the infrastructure issue later
you don't want to get blocked by this
this is a way to do it initially it's
not the recommended long term solution
of course so you can also set the NPM
config
of your proxy so you can configure NPM
to point to your windows corporate proxy
and you can try here you can get this
from your internet explorer settings
typically there are other ways to get
your proxy credentials many times this
will be your windows username and
password sometimes it's different
sometimes there's a common user that the
team will use to go over the proxy
anyway you need to point NPM to your
proxy
you should also point the HTTP proxy and
take a look here again someone is trying
to turn off HTTPS by setting the HTTP
proxies to an HTTP so unfortunately this
is a common situation that you might run
into you want to avoid to turn off HTTPS
of all costs but here is the information
in case you need it
so NPM config set proxy HTTP proxy so
let's summarize we need to do NPM config
said proxy pointed to your proxy config
set HTTP proxy and if this is not
sufficient you need this also at least
temporarily and you might also have to
point the registry to http instead of
HTTPS so again there are security
implications so please be aware of them
and setting these settings in NPM might
get you through the problem but
typically you will still have proxy
problems at this point because the user
is not your Windows user etc if this is
still the case if you are still having
proxy problems
consider the following installing a
proxy server a small proxy process in
your local machine that knows how to
interact with the windows proxy so one
such proxy so this is just a small
process that is running in your computer
is the C ntlm proxy so this is a very
small process that it's very easy to
configure it's just downloadable as a
zip file so we don't need
admin permissions to install it what you
do is you have it running in your
computer and you configure it to point
to your Windows CE ntlm proxy which are
proxies that are notoriously hard to get
around to be able to download things
from the internet so typically if you
can access NPM GS org from your web
browser you could in principle use the
same credentials that you have your
Windows credentials to be able to
connect your command line tools like NPM
like get you can point them all to your
C ntlm proxy so let's say that you
configure your proxy to run on localhost
1899 so it would be a matter of doing
NPM config set HTTP proxy to your
development proxy so you would have
always a development proxy running on
your computer and your tools interact
with the development proxy and your
development proxy forwards everything to
your corporate proxy because not all the
tools will be able to interact with all
the corporate proxies but see ntlm this
would work if you can view NPM in your
browser you should be able to use any
command line tool using this proxy
another proxy this one doesn't have a UI
if you want a proxy even for debugging
other things in your computer you might
need an extra proxy sometimes it's not
sufficient to have only the chrome
network tools to debug certain scenarios
you really want to have a debugging web
proxy this could be used even to debug
other processes that are not running in
the browser like a web service that is
doing another call to another web
service you might want to see what's
going on over the wire so you can
install fiddler from telluric this is a
great tool also that can also be used as
a development proxy and take a look it
not need administration rights so this
is another option installer development
proxy point all the tools to the
development proxy end point the
development proxy to your corporate
proxy once you have a prototype running
and you have a go to introduce NPM node
as a tooling device in your organization
you can use angular 2 you have a running
prototype you will eventually need a
package manager so this is later in the
adoption stages you will need an
internal package manager to store
packages that you want to reuse between
projects if you cannot get NPM
enterprise the proved in your
organization it's very inexpensive it's
like $20 a month or something it's even
less than that but in last case you have
here see Nokia so this is a fork of the
NPM repository server that basically it
doesn't use the couch DB database this
just uses the file system but a lot of
companies use it as an internal solution
for storing their NPM packages so
ideally it would be better to get NPM
Enterprise approved because it's the
official repository and you have you
would have your own NPM installed I will
open it here actually and here NPM
enterprise so this is where this is the
official repository like NPM it's really
not expensive I don't remember the price
but have a look at it it's a great
solution and you can configure security
rules like we can only install angular
these angularjs this version because
this other version might have a security
issue that you want to make sure that
nobody in your organization is using you
can configure those type of rules in
this Enterprise proxy repository you can
store NPM packages to share between
projects you can fork open-source
libraries and apply a patch and deploy
it in your
applications while you are waiting for
an official patch to be released so it
opens up a lot of flexibility and this
will probably be eventually needed in
your organization so I would say npm GS
Enterprise is a good solution it's self
hosted solution I think that there is a
solution to host it also on their
servers but that is not acceptable for
most organizations so middle ground is
to have seen Nokia several companies
have been using it and it works fine as
well it uses the file system for storage
so it's important to keep in mind that
so I hope it helps I invite you to hit
the subscribe button to get notified of
other videos like this have a look at
the rest of my channel I just released
the video demoing the ng rx dev tools
and the time-travelling debugger and
there's a lot more stuff in there that
you might want to have a look at if you
have over to angular universities yo you
will find my website where if you want
