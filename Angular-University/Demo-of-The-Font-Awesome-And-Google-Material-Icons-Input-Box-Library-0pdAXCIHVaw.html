getting started with the implementation
of the library I wanted you to have a
look at the end result so we are going
to be defining here a couple of custom
input components so we are going to
define the font awesome input that you
have here several examples and we are
going to define the material design
input also several examples here so
let's switch to a larger screen so that
we can see the examples better so as you
can see what we have here is a normal
input for comparison and here we have a
series of input fields that contain here
a small icon so this helps improve user
experience by better identifying the
field so as you can see we are using
here the font awesome icons we have
taken them from here so this is public
and open source we can use these icons
in our application it's not a problem we
can use the smaller version all of the
icons you have probably seeing them in
many applications around the internet so
we have here examples of buttons that
use these icons and that are in any
other way identical to a normal input so
that's the idea as we tab through them
we can see that the behavior that this
component has is exactly identical to a
normal input we can use any of the font
awesome icons available also we have
here several examples of some material
design examples this is another
directive that we are about to build
it's very similar to this one but there
is a couple of differences still and in
this case we are using icons from the
material design Google library so this
comes with a set of SVG icons so these
are icons that are defined using SVG and
not images so they are ideally suited
for more well because the download of
the SVG doesn't take a lot of bandwidth
and we have here literally hundreds of
icons that we can use to enhance the
user experience
of our applications so going back here
to our sample application this is what
we are about to build
it's a deceivingly simple looking
component that will bring a lot of the
angular functionality that we will be
using to build more complex libraries we
are going to see things like content
projection we are going to see how to
style components we are going to talk
about API design of components how to
override the encapsulated Styles we're
going to cover many of the most
important notions of component design
and content projection with the simple
example there are actually a couple of
tricks that we will need to use to get a
behavior that is basically identical to
a normal input behavior so compatible
with the have mechanism and shift-tab
with the focus behavior so we are still
going to use quite some tricks to
implement these small components we are
going to introduce testing so being a
small example it's ideally suited to get
an introduction to the testing ecosystem
of angular and we're going to finish off
by publishing this in NPM and looking at
best practices for doing so and please
remember that this is just the starting
point we will be progressively
increasing the difficulty of the
components that we are about to build
but this component will already bring a
lot of functionality so this is coming
right up in the next few lessons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
