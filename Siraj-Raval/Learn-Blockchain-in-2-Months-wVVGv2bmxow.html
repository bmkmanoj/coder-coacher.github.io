to learn some blockchain for me to be
able to write the decentralized
applications book two years ago I needed
to study blockchain technology hard AF
and fast AF and efficiently AF since I
was simultaneously traveling through
different parts of Asia so if I were to
start learning blockchain from scratch
today this is the two-month study plan
I'd make for myself but I'm gonna
open-source it for you wizards since I
love you this is a two month curriculum
dedicated to in order one week of
cryptography two weeks of Bitcoin two
weeks of aetherium one week of other
crypto currencies and lastly two weeks
of decentralized applications but before
you do anything else remember to hit the
subscribe button if you haven't yet to
stay updated on my content this channel
is my life's work as you learn this
technology make sure to follow several
blockchain authorities on Twitter to
keep up with the pulse in this space and
yes in Soviet Russia blockchain
authorities follow you oh and for more
things to remember before we get started
with this curriculum first watch videos
at 2x speed and eventually 3x speed as
your brain learns to adapt to faster
pacing take notes by hand as you watch
for memory retention dedicate at least 2
hours every single day to uninterrupted
learning and yes that includes weekends
and find a study buddy in our slack
channel or someone in real life it will
help keep you motivated remember this is
not a game the links for everything will
be in the video description before you
get into the weeds with crypto
currencies you have to understand why
the word crypto is used in
cryptocurrency crypto short for
cryptography is the art of securing
information given some sensitive data it
asks the question how do we prevent a
third party a
an adversary from reading that data most
people don't realize just how crucial
cryptography is for Humanity pretty much
any kind of money transfer
authentication flow and mission-critical
system relies very heavily on
cryptographic techniques to help
maintain secrecy and cryptography itself
sits at the intersection of math
computer science and even physics but
luckily for us its prerequisites aren't
worthy of dedicating weeks of study to
we can pick them up in a single well
structured cryptography course after
reading some reviews it seems that the
intro to cryptography course on Coursera
is the best option here to get started
it's a seven week course that we're
going to complete in a single week don't
do any of the graded projects until you
finish all of the videos knock them out
one by one at the end of this week do
the final exam for week seven really put
in an effort then double check your
answers to learn from your mistakes
now on to weeks two and three we're
gonna focus on the blockchain that
started it all Bitcoin so normally I
almost never recommend reading books to
learn this kind of thing since videos
are so efficient but sometimes there are
exceptional books out there like the
deep learning book and Where's Waldo in
this case I'm gonna recommend my friend
Andreas Antonopoulos book mastering
Bitcoin it's open source and available
to read on github Andreas does such a
great job of breaking down all the
moving parts of the Bitcoin protocol his
technical writing skills are next-level
there are 12 chapters in this book we're
gonna read two to three chapters every
single day until we finish them all
pacing ourselves included in the book
are technical instructions for
configuring and using the Bitcoin
protocol go ahead and do those via your
terminal if you get an error at some
point try to fix it but if no luck don't
get too caught up on it for too long
just move on after you've completed the
book go ahead and
the official Bitcoin white paper
specifically an annotated version to
make it easier to understand those
concepts then download a Bitcoin wallet
and buy some Bitcoin it can be a really
small amount but it's mostly just to
feel like you're a part of the network
and experience the cryptocurrency world
firsthand for the second week of Bitcoin
learning take the Bitcoin and
cryptocurrency technologies course on
Coursera when you're done with that
spend the rest of the week building a
blockchain that uses the proof-of-work
consensus algorithm from scratch in your
favorite programming language of choice
I'd recommend either Python or
JavaScript there's a great article that
explains how to do this that I'll add to
in the links add as many features to it
as you can to get some hands-on
experience in blockchain technology now
that you've got a handle on Bitcoin it's
time to go down the second rabbit hole
theory on Bitcoin removed the need for
an intermediary when sending someone
money over the Internet recording all
transactions on a public database the
etherium developers realized that they
could use the same underlying blockchain
technology to remove the need for an
intermediary for running code think of
it like a world computer a decentralized
virtual machine to build unsensible
applications on top of there's a free
really short aetherium course on udemy
that you should first check out to help
you understand the etherium architecture
then you should read the annotated
aetherium white paper for a better
understanding it's much more complex
than the Bitcoin one so really take the
time to go through all the details it
will help you as soon as you start
building
aetherium apps using the solidity
programming language oh and speaking of
solidity once you've finished the course
you can learn solidity using this crypto
zombies game where you learn how smart
contracts work by building them and
applying them to this game world is
actually pretty fun
lastly black geeks.com has a collection
of really in-depth articles on aetherium
that I'd recommend checking out just hit
them up one by one once you search for
the etherium keyword until you
understand all the parts of the
architecture so Bitcoin and aetherium
are out of the way but what about the
other billion crypto currencies out
there with all of their unique features
and ideas are they worthless Yes No
some of these projects have synthesized
some really great ideas so we should
dedicate this week to learning about
some of those best ideas I've got a
great playlist that goes over the crypto
currencies I find the most interesting
right here on YouTube
that you should definitely check out
remember to go through the Associated
code and helpful learning links in the
video description for each of them to
get a better understanding you can
spread this bit out to an entire week
there are rabbit holes you could go down
for any of the crypto currencies I
talked about from Minh arrows ring
signatures to cardano's settlement
slayer let your curiosity guide you this
week and for the last part of this
curriculum you're going to wrap it all
up by learning about the longer-term
vision for all of these technologies
decentralized applications start off by
reading my book on the topic you can
find a free version if you google the
name with the word free afterwards also
if someone posts a link to the free
version in the comments I'll pin it so
you can check it out that'll take you a
full week and a lot of the code is
deprecated now because of all the
dependencies being updated over time but
the pseudo code the ideas and the
theories remain for the very last week
build a decentralized application
yourself pick an idea ride sharing or
social networking for example and use
the fastest method to prototype approach
to build something in a single week and
that's it I just launched my
decentralized applications course at the
school of AI but we
currently got a full class so sign up
there if you want to be notified when
the next course opens up I hope you
found these tips useful please subscribe
for more programming videos and for now
I've got to upgrade the web so thanks
