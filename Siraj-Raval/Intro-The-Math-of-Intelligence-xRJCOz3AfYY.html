Suraj and welcome to the math of
intelligent
for the next three months we're going to
take a journey through the most
important math concepts that underlie
machine learning that means all the
concepts you need from the great
disciplines of calculus linear algebra
probability theory and statistics the
prerequisites are knowing basic Python
syntax and algebra every single
algorithm we code will be done without
using any popular machine learning
library because the point of this course
is to help you build a solid
mathematical intuition around building
algorithms that can learn from data I
mean let's face it you could just use a
black box API for all this stuff but if
you have the intuition you'll know
exactly which algorithm to use for the
job or even custom make your own from
scratch as humans we are constantly
receiving data through our five senses
then somehow we've got to make sense of
all this chaotic input so that we can
survive thanks to the evolutionary
process we've developed brains capable
of doing this we've got the most
precious resource in the universe
intelligence the ability to learn and
apply knowledge one way to measure our
intelligence against the rest of the
animal kingdom is using a ladder ours is
indeed the most generalized type of
intelligence capable of being applied to
the widest variety of tasks but that
doesn't mean that we are necessarily the
best kind of intelligence in the 1960s a
primate researcher named dr. Jane
Goodall concluded that chimpanzees had
been living in the forest for hundreds
of thousands of years without
overpopulating or destroying their
environment at all orcas have the
ability to sleep with one hemisphere of
their brain at a time which allows them
to recuperate while being aware of their
surroundings in some ways animals are
more intelligent than us intelligence
consists of many dimensions think of it
like a multi-dimensional space
of possibility when building AI the
human brain is a great road map after
all neural networks have achieved
state-of-the-art performance in
countless tasks but it's not the only
road map there are many possible types
of intelligence out there that we can
and will create some will seem familiar
to us and some very alien thinking in a
way we've never done before like when
alphago played move 37 even the best go
players in the world were stunned at the
move it went against everything we've
learned about the game from millennia of
practice but it turned out to be an
objectively better strategy that led to
its win the many different types of
intelligence are like symphonies each
comprising of different instruments and
these instruments vary not just their
dynamics but in their pitch and tempo
and color and melody the amount of data
we're generating is growing really fast
no I mean really really fast in the time
since you started watching this video
enough data was generated for you to
spend an entire lifetime analyzing and
only 0.5% of all data ever is creating
intelligence isn't just a nice-to-have
it's a necessity put in the right hands
it will help us solve problems we never
dreamed could be possible to solve so
where do we start
at its core machine learning is all
about mathematical optimization this is
a way of thinking every single problem
can be broken down into an optimization
problem once we have some data set that
acts as our input
we'll build a model that uses that data
to optimize for an objective a goal that
we want to reach and the way it does
this is by minimizing some error value
that we define one example problem could
be what should I wear today I could
frame this as optimizing for stylishness
instead of say comfort and define an
error that I want to minimize as the
amount of ratings a group of people give
me that are negative or even what's the
best design for my iOS apps homepage
rather than hard coding in some elements
I could find a data set of app designs
and their ratings from you
if I want to optimize for a design that
would be the highest rated I would learn
the mapping between design styles and
ratings this is the way every single
layer of the stack will be built in the
future
sometimes our data is labeled sometimes
it isn't there are different techniques
we can use to find patterns in this data
and sometimes optimizing for an
objective can happen it's not through
the frame of pattern recognition but
through the exploration of many
possibilities and seeing what works and
what doesn't
there are many ways that we can frame
the learning process but the easiest way
to learn is when we use labelled data
mathematically speaking we have some
input there's a domain X where every
point of X has features that we observe
then we have a label set Y so the data
consists of a set of labeled examples
that we can denote this way the output
then would be a prediction rule so given
a new x value what this associated Y
value we've got to learn this mapping
which is an unknown distribution over X
to be able to answer this so we have to
measure some error function that acts as
a performance metric so what we do is
choose from a number of possible models
to represent this function well
initially set some parameter values to
represent the mapping and we evaluate
the initial results measure the error
update the parameters and repeat this
process optimizing the model again and
again until it fully learns the mapping
was it convex or concave functions that
were easier to optimize I think convex I
really hope my lab partner is advocate
optimization I guess I should be
thankful not many data scientists get a
grant concerned to detect the Higgs
boson was her name again
no Elise I think yeah she did win an
award from ICML I wonder if she's cute
that doesn't matter
I am NOT going to mix business and
pleasure not this time suppose I've got
a bunch of data points these are just
toy data points like what Apple probably
trained Siri on they're all X Y value
pairs where X represents the distance of
person bikes and y represents the amount
of calories they lost we can just plot
them on a
like so we want to be able to predict
the calories loss for a new person given
their biking distance how should we do
this well we could try to draw a line
that fits through all the data points
but it seems like our points are too
spaced out for a straight line to pass
through all of them so we can settle for
drawing the line of best fit a line that
goes through as many data points as
possible algebra tells us that the
equation for a straight line is of the
form y equals MX plus B where m
represents the slope or steepness of the
line and B represents its y-axis
intercept points we want to find the
optimal values for B and M such that the
line fits as many points as possible
given any new x value we can plug it
into our equation and it'll output the
most likely y value our error metric can
be a measure of closeness which we can
define like this so let's start off with
a random B and M value and plot this
line for every single data point we have
let's calculate its associated y-value
then we'll subtract the actual Y value
from it to measure the distance between
the two we'll want to square this error
to make our next steps easier once we
sum all these values we get a single
value that represents our error given
that line we just drew now if we did
this process repeatedly say 1337 x for a
bunch of different randomly drawn lines
we could create a 3d graph that shows
the error value for every Associated B
and M value notice how there is a valley
in this graph at the bottom of the Sally
the error is at its smallest and so the
associated enm values would be the line
of best fit or the distance between all
our data points and our line would be
the smallest but how do we find it well
we'll need to try out a bunch of
different lines to create this 3d graph
but rather than just randomly drawing
lines over and over again with no signal
what if we could do it in a more
efficient way such that each successive
line we draw brings us closer and closer
to the bottom of this valley
we need a direction a way to descend
this valley what if
a given function we could find a slope
of it at a given point then that slope
would point in a certain direction
towards the minima of the graph and when
we redraw our line over and over again
we could do so using the slope as our
compass as our guide on how best to
redraw as we towards the minima until
our slope approaches zero in calculus we
call this slope the derivative of a
function since we are updating two
values B and M we want to calculate the
derivative with respect to both of them
the partial derivative the partial
derivative with respect to a variable
means that we calculate the derivative
of that variable while ignoring the
others so we'll compute the partial
derivative with respect to B then the
partial derivative with respect to M to
do this we use the power rule we
multiply the exponent by the coefficient
and subtract 1 from the exponent once we
have these two values we can update both
of these parameters from our function by
subtracting them from our existing vnm
values and we just keep doing that for a
set number of iterations that we
predefined so this optimization
technique that we just performed is
called gradient descent and it's the
most popular one in machine learning so
what do you need to remember from this
video 3 points the derivative is the
slope of a function at a given line the
partial derivative is a slope with
respect to one variable in that function
we can use them to compose a gradient
which points in the direction of the
local minima of a function and gradient
descent is a very popular optimization
strategy in machine learning that uses
the gradient to do this the winner of
last week couldn't challenge it to go
hog he created an encryption algorithm
that's pretty complex written in C++
that I've never heard of before
definitely check it out
links in the description great work
wizard of the week now it's your turn
I've got a coding challenge for you
implement gradient descent on your own
on a different data set that I'll
provide check out the github link for
detail and the winner will be announced
in a week please subscribe for more
programming videos and for now I've got
to memorize the power rule
