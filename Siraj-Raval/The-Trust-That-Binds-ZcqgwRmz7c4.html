everything they had to emigrate from
India to the u.s. in search of a better
life and when I was born they loved me
unconditionally no matter what happened
in my life I always knew that I could
trust them
in fact I first learned what it meant to
trust from my relationship with them
Trust is the foundation of every human
connection culture community in fact our
entire civilization depends on trust
it's the ability to predict what others
will do it governs every interaction we
have with humans in personal
relationships trust means exposing your
vulnerabilities to someone and believing
that they won't take advantage of that
openness when you first meet someone you
can't predict where that relationship
will go but if you're willing to give
them your trust you can get to know them
their hopes and fears their wildest
dreams and their darkest secrets and as
all that trust compounds over time
the benefits of closeness and intimacy
far outweigh the possibility of pain and
betrayal part of the human condition is
to make predictions
we are constantly forecasting ahead by
building internal models of the world
based both on our experiences and what
others tell us then use these to guess
what will happen next we trust that
people will take their responsibilities
seriously that they'll abide by whatever
rules apply to the task at hand we trust
teachers to educate our children chefs
to serve a sanitary food and co-workers
to do their part we've collectively
built systems of trust all around us to
facilitate our interactions with each
other and the data shows that in
countries where people highly trust each
other
there also tends to be low levels of
income inequality as well as high levels
of political and economic stability so
how do we know who to trust a 17th
century English philosopher named Thomas
Hobbes argued that in order to maintain
civil peace
and social unity in a society there
needed to be some kind of sovereign
power responsible for protecting the
security of the Commonwealth and granted
absolute authority to ensure the common
defense
he called this power the Leviathan the
first Leviathan
was organized religion the idea was that
if people put all their trust in God and
followed his will on how to interact
with others they behaved themselves but
soon another Leviathan emerged the
nation-state
it offered to handle the complexities of
managing society through the creation of
laws and the enforcement of those laws
via a uniformed police force but now we
are witnessing the rise of a new
Leviathan the network with the rise of
the network anyone in the world can
communicate with anyone else and because
of that we also now have the ability to
trust anyone in the world Trust was once
an expensive pursuit in order to convey
it banks
elite schools and government offices
were built from luxurious materials to
declare solidity and tradition but the
network has changed all of that
now we're prepared to place our lives in
the hands of people we know nothing
about because of the emergence of
networked services that enable two
strangers to trust each other we share a
rise with uber stay in homes with Airbnb
hire workers with up work the list goes
on these services have codified
reputation they build webs of trust the
number of stars next to someone's name
makes it possible to trust them even
though we've never met them but these
systems of trust we've created have been
abused many governments across the world
have shown that they can't be held
trustworthy the series of pro-democracy
protests across the Middle East and as
the Arab Spring or hampered when local
governments cut off the protesters
internet access the Chinese government
routinely censors data from its populace
which accounts for about a fifth of the
world and even in more developed
countries like the u.s. trust in the
federal government is at an all-time low
as income inequality continues to rise
this has led to the rise of the incubate
Trump with his diehard followers
demanding he drained the swamp
the corporation's that have built on the
neutral playing field of the web now own
most of our personal data and we've
learned that several of them have
breached our trust in many ways using
personal data and time and time again
corporate banks have stolen money from
countless people and influenced the
direction of entire governments with the
power we've entrusted in them the sheer
size of these institutions we built make
the situation look hopeless competing
with the government banking cartel is
illegal and can be severely punished
they define monetary policy and our need
to use money that depends on them has
become our straitjacket but a few years
ago a paper was posted in a cryptography
mailing list detailing a system called
Bitcoin that could challenge the most
powerful monopolies in the world it was
the first system to show that it was
possible for two people to exchange
value over the Internet without the need
to trust a third party like a bank
Bitcoin currently has a market cap of 80
billion dollars and has remained secure
after all these years soon people
started wondering what if the underlying
technology of Bitcoin could be used to
remove the need for a trusted third
party in other areas the blockchain
bitcoins data structure and its
associated proof-of-work
algorithm are starting to be applied to
other concepts insurance law healthcare
anywhere where a risky amount of trust
is involved can be a space where
blockchain technology can improve the
system by offloading some of the Trust's
necessary from humans to machines for
example there's a blockchain enabled
micro grid service in Brooklyn that lets
individuals sell their excess solar
energy directly to neighbors without
involving a central utility company we
can create new organizations like this
that are distributed in autonomous
systems that are open trustless and
meritocratic with humans at the edges in
automation at the center but last year
we learned something really important
one of the most popular blockchain
communities aetherium second only to
Bitcoin and market cap part forked what
that means is after a hacker stole 60mm
their internal currency the community
collectively made a controversial
decision to rewind the blockchain so the
money would go back to the original
owners this shocked many people in the
wider community since one of the core
characteristics of a blockchain is its
ability to remain immutable the hard
fork proved that block chains are not in
fact immutable and it also proves
something much more significant that the
blockchain is not in fact a trustless
system yes we don't have to trust any
one party like a bank to utilize it but
we do trust three parties when you hold
cryptocurrency in your wallet you are
trusting the miners to secure the
network and validate transactions the
developers to maintain and improve the
code and the users to use the platform
so you're not trusting one party you're
trusting the entire community block
chains don't offer a trustless system
but rather a reassignment of trust
amongst many parties instead of one the
more distributed the trust is the more
the risk of fraud decreases so instead
of building systems that try to
eliminate trust maybe we should build
systems that strengthen it not more
trust less but more trust ful imagine
apps that are run by the community that
uses them that means a rider in a driver
not needing a for-profit third party to
help them find and trust each other or a
consumer owning their own demographic
profile and choosing what to disclose to
service providers in exchange for
economic value
so while Trust is necessary in every
interaction we have with humans there
are many cases where minimising it is
beneficial and we can use blockchain
technology to do that
but the need to trust won't go away and
that's okay we can't escape human
reliance as fallible and imperfect as we
are there will always be some risk
involved in our interaction with humans
and the higher the risk the higher the
reward as we build better systems that
nurture and nourish trust we'll be able
to extend our capabilities in every way
by augmenting our intelligence with the
power of the web becoming ever more
connected with each other and when I
think back to the dreams my dad had for
me as a child or the ones that all the
eager young developers I've met have for
success or the ones I have in my most
intimate relationships I realized that
trust can be the bridge between where we
are now and where we all want to be home
you
hey guys hope you liked the video the
winner of last week's coding challenge
is Zacharias bowler Zacharias created a
decentralized machine learning journal
using IP FS so awesome I've already
bookmarked this for my own use he's got
some great documentation too so
definitely check it out very well done
and the runner-up is a noob Kitab who
created a decentralized dropbox on ipfs
