much hey done pretty good do you mind if
I ask you 67 questions yeah go for it
alright let's do this Oh what project
are you currently working on so we just
launched universe and I'm working on
some of the follow-up releases we're
gonna do for that awesome how would you
describe the culture at open AI super
cool I love everyone I work with here
very open lots of good mentorship what
was it like attending MIT as an
undergrad really really great mit has a
lot of cool sub communities they're all
super creative you went to school at NYU
do you miss New York City I tell you my
friends there but I don't miss the
weather favorite internship uh Amazon if
you could repeat one experience again
what would it be
I'd like to go back to Japan why do you
think deep learning has gotten so
popular recently it's really well for a
lot of problems but I think people are
sort of confusing it for like the last
big innovation that there's more to come
what is your favorite operating system
ubuntu nice if you could spend an
evening with one famous person who would
it be
it's a Michelle Obama do you play any
sports I do rock climbing what time do
you go to sleep like midnight most
adventurous thing you've ever done
what skydiving what's one source you use
to stay up to date in ml ah so Jack
Clark who does PR for us has this
newsletter called import ai it's great
programming language of choice for
machine learning definitely Python
favorite professor ah
let's go Josh Tenenbaum at MIT name one
person you really admire um also
professor Fei Fei Lee she does a lot of
AI and also outreach neuroscience stuff
how are you liking the bear great
there's a lot of cool communities here
what drives you to be an engineer I'm
really like building things and
especially the things that I build can
help other people what's the most
beautiful thing in the world
mmm why I say it's helping out other
people even if you don't agree with them
or if you're different from one another
what's your favorite exercise I do
Japanese taiko drumming favorite food uh
croissants what's more fun computer
science theory or implementation I think
implementation but you might think
differently
what website do you waste time on I
spend a lot of time on Facebook my
friends read a lot of cool stuff their
last person you emailed emailed a
candidate in robotics that I met at nips
you get an all-expenses-paid trip to one
city where do you go I've never been to
Africa so maybe Cape Town would you
visit Mars not unless it was cheap
what's one thing you can't live without
um my bicycle what's one of your
favorite genres of music
Spotify tells me that I listen to a lot
of ambient electronic so let's go with
that what's one skill you wish you had
I was just better drawing what's the
first thing you do when you wake up I
hit snooze what text editor do you use
Emacs but it's not a holy war I promise
what open-source libraries do you really
like I've been really requests in Python
recently it makes HTTP super easy what's
one of your favorite movies the original
matrix what was a hard problem you
recently solved at open AI we were
dealing with some weird bugs when the
environments were resetting in universe
so trying to figure out why that was
going wrong was tough what inspired you
to get into machine learning I've always
been really interested in how humans
think and the existence of these sort of
interesting biological cognitive agents
but what if you could build one yourself
what was the first program you ever made
um the first interesting program I ever
made was to figure out how to spell your
name using chemical element symbols well
what's one book you really like um man a
wizard of Earthsea
or split win what's a big misconception
about you not realize I was born in
Australia what's one thing that excites
you um me the future I mean who knows
how it's going to turn out best advice
you've ever received
um someone pointed out that I've already
got a lot of the things that I want so I
should stop being so stressed out about
it
what's the bravest thing you've ever
done quitting grad school was super
tough I had sort of planned it reject me
for my life and having to change that
really hard what's one piece of advice
you'd give yourself 10 years ago I'd say
ask for more help I kept trying to do
things on my own you spend more time on
the internet or
real life definitely real life but often
in front of a screen code do you have
any pets
no what's something you've learned in
the past month uh what it's like to
release a big project do you like spicy
food sometimes what's a movie that made
you cry
uh the end is the Lord of the Rings if
you're in the world
what is one law you didn't act I think
freedom of the press is great and there
should be more of that do you think
we'll solve intelligence in your
lifetime I think probably build systems
as capable as humans but we won't
understand how to work yet who is one
person you looked up to when you were in
college
what up up to all of us she was my
mentor for my master's thesis
she was combining computer science and
neuroscience in a way I was really
inspired by what deep learning libraries
do you use the most I we now use
tensorflow I've used more theano in the
past and ruang once said machine
learning is like the new electricity
do you agree yet but maybe in the future
if you were to start from scratch today
what is the learning resource you would
use to learn machine learning with a
good book like Bishop's book but then
actually try and implement the stuff
yourself don't just read it and bring it
out brain and cerebral I actually try it
what is one career goal you have lead a
big project someday what's more
interesting the brain or the universe
well the brain is part of the universe
but I do think pretty interesting part
if you could be a superhero who would it
be a lot of people say that the thing
about Batman that's cool is that he
doesn't have any like superpowers or
magic abilities I kind of like that
what's your spirit animal uh say that
I'm you know I'm really friendly I like
get along well with people oh maybe my
spirit animal head louse do you think
one shot learning will gain momentum it
kind of has to if we're gonna really get
somewhere with intelligence we have to
be able to learn from less data would
you ever go to Coachella no Instagram or
vine gram mac books or microsoft
surfaces mac books but I get a surface
is not bad pen or pencil pencil would
you ever wear the iWatch I try anything
once all right Catherine that's it for
my 67 questions thanks so much for
answering those awesome alright again
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
