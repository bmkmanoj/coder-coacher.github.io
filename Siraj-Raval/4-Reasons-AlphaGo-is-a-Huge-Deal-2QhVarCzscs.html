let's talk about four reasons alphago is
a huge deal
alphago is an AI created by a team of
researchers at Google designed to play
the ancient Chinese game of go and go to
players take turns placing black or
white stones on a board trying to
capture the opponent's tones or surround
empty space to make points of territory
the first reason is that it beat the
best human player in the world at a game
that is orders of magnitude more complex
than chess think of solving chess like
painting a line and solving go like
painting the Mona Lisa one is just way
more complex than the other
remember IBM's deep blue and when it
beat world champion Garry Kasparov at
chess in the 90s at the time that was a
huge deal because no program had ever
done that before
what deep blue did was it would examine
all possible moves and all the possible
counter moves and all the possible
counter counter moves and so on until it
had searched every single possible play
and then picked the best one this is
called a brute-force search and it
worked
but that method wouldn't work for go
because and go there are more possible
plays and there are atoms in the
universe crazy right
so alphago can't just try all possible
plays it has to use intuition like human
players would what it felt would likely
be a good play to do this alphago uses
something called a neural network a
neural network is an algorithm that
tries to mimic how the brain works
roughly you have a bunch of neurons that
are connected to each other in layers
you have an input layer middle layers
and an output layer each neuron performs
some preset calculation on the data and
outputs the result to all the connected
neurons this process continues until the
data goes all the way from the input
layer to the output layer so a few input
photos of Trump which really just breaks
down to a bunch of ones and zeros if you
think about it like all data and feed it
into the input layer what's doing is
recording commonalities across all the
photos this is called training and
machine learning so given enough Trump
photos eventually it can start
recognizing Trump when it sees a novel
photo outputting data that means yes
this is Trump or no this is not Trump
the team created a neural network and
input 30 million expert moves from go
until it could output yes is an expert
move when it saw it then they had it
play against itself countless times
until it got better and better through
trial and error this is called
reinforcement learning we do - whenever
we
practice shooting hoops or playing an
instrument practice makes perfect
this gave alphago a sense of reflection
when evaluating a move it could look
back on simulated results but they also
wanted to give it a sense of intuition
so they created another neural network
that observed the moves from the
simulations so by combining these two
networks together alphago is able to
give an estimate of how good a move is
by using a mixture of reflection and
intuition so in a live game every turn
alphago uses this move evaluator on a
bunch of possible moves before deciding
on the best one and playing it it's not
a pull on brute force search but a more
educated and smaller search it's called
a Monte Carlo tree search so cool the
second reason is that this took one year
instead of ten years to build leading
experts particularly it would take a
decade to build a machine capable of
beating the best human player at go it
only took one year this is just another
sign of the exponential progress of
Technology think of all the trends in
computing that this upholds Moore's law
states that computing power will double
every two years the law of accelerating
returns by director of engineering at
Google Ray Kurzweil states that
technological progress in general is
exponential not linear 80 percent of the
world's data was created in the last
year and we are all building and
creating off of each other's data at an
exponential rate the third reason is
that this creates a new field AI
psychology in the second game against
lee sedol alpha played a move that no
human would ever play move 37 that move
represents the promise of AI when
alphago played it Lisa Dole was
completely baffled Fenway the other go
master said it's not a human ever seen a
human play this move before and later
kept calling it beautiful so beautiful
alphago thinks differently than the best
of our species at this task even the
craters don't understand how it happened
that's the beauty of machine learning
programmers don't code every single rule
they give it the building blocks to
learn by itself and unleash it on
massive amounts of data we can study
alphago and learn new ways of thinking
the fourth reason is that this
technology hasn't yet been applied to
other fields think about the recent
breakthroughs in quantum computing
Google proved
first of all that a quantum computer was
possible and second of all that it's
solved a specific algorithm 100 million
times faster than a classical computer
now think of how smart alphago would be
if it ran on a quantum computer robotics
genetics physics climatology economics
this is just the beginning of new
breakthrough discoveries in these fields
scientists have tons of data that no
human could possibly sit through CERN
probably has a new particle somewhere in
its data set we just don't have the
intelligence necessary to sift through
the noise and find a meaningful bits
alphago and the promise of AI is going
to help us solve some of the world's
biggest problems and we should all keep
a very close eye on the space for more
