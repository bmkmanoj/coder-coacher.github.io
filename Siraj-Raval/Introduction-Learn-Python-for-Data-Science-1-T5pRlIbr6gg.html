the learn Python for data science series
in this video we're going to set up our
Python environment and write a 10 line
script that can classify anyone as male
or female given just our body
measurements data science is the study
of data and a data scientist is someone
who solves problems by studying data so
pretty much all science is data science
we observe we make predictions we test
and we update our ideas so if we were
given a data set of meteorite landings
over the past 10 years we could come up
with questions that we think the data
might help us solve like what area is
most likely to get hit or how does
atmospheric pressure affect meteorite
trajectory then we could write a little
code that trains a machine learning
model on that data and predicts the
answer we can use an existing model and
there are a lot of them or build our own
traditionally you needed a PhD for this
stuff but with the world's data doubling
every two years and machine learning
algorithms getting more powerful anyone
can become a data scientist you just
need time and motivation if you have
those two things you'll be able to
complete a bunch of data science
projects and upload them to your github
github is the new resume it's not about
how many degrees you have it's about
what you can do machine learning
democratizes scientific discovery ok I'm
talking to you yes you sitting right
there you can be a data scientist anyone
can and the tool we're going to use to
help us learn from our data is the
Python programming language I'm going to
teach you Python but not just by talking
about syntax
you'll learn by doing in each episode
we're going to focus on a different data
science project I'll give you a coding
challenge at the end that extends that
project and you'll learn Python along
the way I'm picking Python for two
reasons it's designed for readability
and its general purpose check out this
speech recognition app it uses a library
called Sphinx to read an audio file
convert it to text and print it out
that's just five lines of code and we
can still read what it's doing since
every word is descriptive and compact
now let's look at a similar app in C++
that's about a hundred lines
I love you so beautiful to build our
gender classification app there are four
steps we'll install Python set up our
environment install our dependencies and
write the Python script let's start by
installing Python if you're on a Mac or
Linux machine Python comes pre-installed
if you're on Windows it doesn't know
what the regardless you'll want to
download the latest version of Python
three point five point two as of today
on Mac you can download the installer
package and go through the necessary
steps to install it then you'll be able
to compile your scripts from terminal
using the Python keyword like so on
Linux you can download the source then
in terminal type in three commands to
install it you'll then be able to run
Python scripts using the Python keyword
on Windows you can go download the
Installer make sure add Python DXE to
path is set to be installed on your
local hard drive and once it's finished
you can run Python right from
command-line now that we have Python
installed let's set up our environment
the text editor we'll be using for this
course is sublime text since it's super
simple to use but what about Emacs no
both Mac and Windows have an installer
that you can use to install it for Linux
you can install it via the apt-get
package manager with these three
commands once we have it installed we
can type our Python code in there and
compile it with terminal by pointing our
Python interpreter to our script that's
it we only need terminal and our text
editor to run our scripts so we've got
our environment set up let's move on to
installing our dependencies dependencies
our packages that our code depends on we
call them at the top of each script we
write with the import statement any
programmer can write a package to say
figure out who shot Harambee in a
thousand lines of code upload it to the
Python package server and we could
download it and call it with a single
line of code all code is part of a
greater whole it's all linked together
in a grand chain of dependencies it's
like building a house in order for you
to be able to build the roof of a house
it'd be nice if you already had the
dependencies the Python package manager
pip helps us install dependencies and
we'll use it right from command-line you
can install pip for Python 3 using these
commands for whichever operating system
you're using the only dependency we'll
be using in this video to build our
gender classifier is scikit-learn a
machine learning package with a bunch of
pre-built models for us to use dope we
have our dependencies installed and now
we're ready to write our script
we'll start by importing it first as we
should for all the
tendencies we're going to use a specific
sub module of scikit-learn called tree
that will let us build a machine
learning model called a decision tree a
decision tree is like a flowchart that
stores data it asks each labeled data
point it receives a yes-or-no question
does it contain X or not if the answer
is yes the data moves one direction if
the answer is no it moves in the other
it'll build every node in the tree the
more data points it receives then when
we have a new unlabeled data point we
can feed it to the tree it'll ask it a
series of questions until it labels it
that label is our classification the
more data we train it on the more
accurate the classification let's start
by creating our data set
programmatically we'll write our first
variable X as a list of Lists a variable
is a value that can change and we'll
store a list of Lists in it a list is a
data type in Python that can store a
sequence of values here each value is a
list itself that contains three numbers
that represent the length width and shoe
size of a person we'll write 11 of these
so our data set size is only 11 people
will write one more variable called Y to
store a list of labels each label is a
gender and is associated with a list of
body metrics in the previous list well
write them as strings which is a data
type used to represent text instead of
numbers now that we have our data set
we'll want to define a variable to store
our decision tree model let's call it
CLF short for classifier and it'll store
our decision tree classifier we can
reference our tree dependency directly
by calling it here and initialize the
decision tree by calling the decision
tree method on the tree object now that
we have our tree variable we can train
it on our data set we'll call the fit
method on the classifier variable which
takes two arguments will store our x and
y variables as the arguments and the
result will be stored in the updated CLF
variable the fit method trains the
decision tree on our data set let's test
it by classifying the gender of someone
given a new list of bodymetrix we'll
create a variable called prediction to
store the result and call the predict
method of our decision tree to predict
the gender given these three values in a
list then we can print it out determine
all via the print command we can run the
script in terminal by saving it as demo
dot PI and running it via the Python
demo dot PI command so to break it down
data scientists solve problems using
data and because easy to use machine
learning libraries and abundant data are
now available everywhere you can become
one Python is a programming language for
both beginners and experts and
emphasizes readability and a decision
tree is a model that classifies data by
creating branches for every possible
outcome the challenge for this video is
to use any three different classifiers
from the psyche alarm package on this
same data set compare their results then
print the name of the best one sometimes
you have to try a few models to see what
gives you the most accurate predictions
post your github link in the comments
I'll pick a winner within one week and
mention them in the next video please
share this video if you liked it and
subscribe for more programming videos
for now I've got to drink some Soylent
so thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
