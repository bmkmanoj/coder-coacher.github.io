the base impact hackathon in San
Francisco there's a ton of great
sponsors and partners that made this
entire event possible
thank you sponsors where's that guy I
don't know so what are you saying though
who are you saying though
well maybe you find that you maybe find
you possible in the day that it'd be
really really cool in a certain data
intern data or if you could if you could
prove supersymmetry or just or not up
disprove specifically that's what people
looking for maybe you'll find new
physics that will be reading something
new physics would be awesome you should
go for it oh yeah you are you because
you you study that stuff right I don't
have a physics
what kind of physics you do I do your
article solid-state physics specifically
quantum computing okay could you
introduce yourself just in general in
general all right my name is Tobias are
you physicists with background economics
I'm from Germany currently working at
the UC Berkeley and today we're gonna do
some data magic oh yeah oh wow and what
what got you interested in machine
learning
I think machines are gonna take over the
future and we'll be part of it
awesome and are you excited for this
hackathon how are you feeling I feel
kind of tired yeah very honest but I'm
very happy because we found really cool
room and I love drawing on whiteboards
one interesting fact and then why you're
here today
sure why don't you sit back um in June
I'm biking from Vancouver to Tijuana and
why I'm here today I think that these
impacts mission is pretty it just
exciting especially in Silicon Valley
where I can like
people are solving Catholic Natas as
fundamentally important problems I'm at
for me I've always been interested in
the data science research with its face
I used to work in data science
healthcare space for me and interesting
fact I'm half Filipino I don't want to
work on this because I feel like when we
are technology workers we put a lot of
energy behind making technology but I'm
a little concerned that policy might not
catch up so I really want put a lot of
energy behind that as well I feel is
this is very solution oriented business
like the output is very light you can
grasp it yeah it's like this is what we
have this is what we can do this is what
you should do kind of decide so from
from a data science perspective what
what are we trying to do
like what okay so we have all this how
do we figure out what you suggest to
people is it just based on why people
other people have chosen or so that's
one way to do recommender system well it
depends on what kind of data we have a
balloon
oh yeah
we got the good stuff
we got the good stuff
Tobias are you excited to eat
are you excited to bias such excited
much hi Marie
then you have pixels popular grace
cryptic really shows your industry
growth average wage these are like
recommended jobs and yeah search and
it's just going to slice the data but
when you say I'm going to query they've
got similar jobs you don't take you to
monster page so far this is gonna
so we yeah hi guys it's midnight so it's
time for me to leave the hackathon check
it out a lot of people here
hey guys I just woke up it's 9:00 a.m.
the next day I'm heading back judging
ceremony is happening let's go see what
happens okay
how you feeling great the Tigers go to
long
how you feeling BAE
it is not working free demo blue we have
the wheel of death
if it
well like
our result was a tool that we call the
financial marketplace referee referee
has detection module is the price tech
potentially anomalous fraud or malicious
behavior that's probably in certain
groups</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
