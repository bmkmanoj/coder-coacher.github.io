the first video in the decentralized
applications course this video is called
web 3.0 explains pretty self-explanatory
title but what I'm gonna do is explain
why we need web 3.0 how it works how a
blockchain works and at the very end
we're going to write out our own smart
contract in the solidity programming
language to the language of aetherium so
it'sit's gonna look kind of like this
well we'll say okay here's an integer
create it's gonna create a value in this
contract object and this is on a
decentralized virtual machine I know
right now it sounds like a bunch of
crazy what are you talking about but
don't worry we have so much to cover in
this video I'm so excited so just sit
back relax and get ready for some
amazing amazing stuff because this stuff
is just it's it blows my mind every time
I look at it it blows my mind so that's
that's the demo at the end of the video
but we have some things to cover first
so this is the only part that's gonna be
non-technical at the beginning and that
is the why why does web 3.0 matter okay
now it's very important so web 1.0 we've
that was the birth of the internet web
2.0 was the creation of the services
that we all know and love Google you
know all these social networks the
snapchat everything that's web 2.0 now
we need to move to web 3.0 so I'm gonna
explain why okay so this is actually a
multivariate problem there are multiple
reasons why we need to move to web 3.0
so but I think the easiest reason the
easiest the main reason I could give
people that people would care about the
most is that if you want to build a
startup that can compete with the big
giants this is the only way to really do
that or it's the best way it's the best
way to do that so if we look at web 2.0
the first problem is there is no room
for competition
look at these services that control the
internet at this point all traffic goes
through Google and Microsoft and
Facebook Baidu Amazon these companies
have the most money they have all the
data they have the best talent to create
the best algorithms they have the most
computing power how is anyone supposed
to compete with these people right they
have everything they have
all the resources how are you supposed
to start a start-up in this day and age
well the answer is decentralized
applications so that's just the first
problem with web 2.0 the second problem
is that we have a shrinking economy
it's a winner-take-all economy right now
what I mean by that is the rise of these
services the rise in terms of the
valuation and the data and the computing
power and the talent as they grow bigger
and bigger and bigger they have created
this kind of winner-take-all economy via
the internet and it's responsible for a
lot of the income inequality because all
these services that used to be that used
to belong to the creators to say for
example the music industry now it's all
those profits are being concentrated
centralized into these giant what Jerome
Lanier one of the pioneers of the
internet calls
siren servers Amazon Google Facebook etc
so take the music industry for example
the internet liberated the distribution
of music great Spotify Pandora iTunes
but what happened is working-class
musicians their earnings have
consistently gone down over the years
and they become this underpaid
underclass who can no longer count on
royalties as the basis of a sustainable
middle-class life the internet rocked
everything in the music industry right
and now musicians can't get paid so this
is a this is a problem right this is
this a real problem because in a good
economy we should be monetizing more and
more but in a bad economy or monetizing
less and less and that's exactly what's
happening as all the data the real value
in this new world that we're building
all of it is being owned controlled and
monetized by a few key entities you are
not owning your data which brings me to
the third problem data ownership we no
longer feel like we can control our data
you don't own it you're giving away your
free data in return for a free service
and this works well enough however its
cause the economy to shrink over time
your data is being used to spy on you
take prism for example advertise to you
two things you wouldn't even know I was
talking to a friend the other day and
then I saw the ad for the topic I was
talking about show up in my facebook
messenger they are listening in our
phones they're listening in our Google
homes they're listening everywhere okay
and they can do that because we've given
them the permission to do that we're
giving them all our data and they are
profiting off of our data we should be
profiting off of our data fourth point
accountability right Edward Snowden
became infamous when he told the world
about prism right that US government NSA
surveillance service
he said well look all of these companies
have partnered with the NSA to give away
your email your chat your videos your
photos all this stuff and we can't
really do anything about it right
there's no oversight it's there's no
transparency into what these services
are doing with our data there's no that
it's a one-way street you give them your
data they decide what to do with it
that's it hands-off
they'll govern how it's used this is a
problem okay so another person is
Tristan Harris so Tristan Harris is an X
design ethicist at Google and Tristan
Harris says that these siren servers
like Facebook Google Amazon are
competing for attention we are moving to
an attention economy the Facebook
newsfeed for example is optimizing for
your attention because that's what
drives their ad revenue business model
however this is a problem because what's
what gets your attention isn't
necessarily what's beneficial to you it
isn't necessarily what's good for you
what they should be optimizing for is
your time well-spent and that's the
movement that he's working on election
tampering we have no say in the
governance of how these systems are
created fifth point artificial general
intelligence okay we have got way too
many problems in the world climate
change existential crises like asteroid
impact and pollution and disease and
warfare and this is way too many
problems in the world but if we solve a
AI
we can say solve for X and it will solve
literally everything if we solve real
intelligence aka artificial general
intelligence so it is to be seen that
AGI is the most important thing we
can work on to solve all these other
problems beneficial AGI maybe there is a
missing link to creating AGI what is
that missing link so if we think about
an AI as a control system right a
control system that has a controller it
has a state it has systems for sensing
the world motor sensors from moving
around internal forwarding mechanisms to
transmit all this data you don't
understand all this right now this is
kind of just an abstract general idea of
how an AI runs how can we let this AI
make decisions on its own and learn by
itself in a way that's not controlled by
human right now we store our AI on a
server and we control everything about
it but what if we let it free and live
into the live in the world and make its
own decisions what we would need some
kind of decentralized service not
controlled by anybody right so if we
create what's called an AI distributed
autonomous organization don't worry if
you don't understand that word but what
that means is it's a new breed it's
another word for decentralized
application Dao Dao it's a new way of
creating companies of entities on the
web so if we link these two technologies
together AI and blockchain we can see
that the AI it's getting its missing
link resources like cryptocurrency that
it doesn't depend on any central third
party right and the DAO the blockchain
gets its missing link autonomous
decision-making so we put these things
together and we create something like a
living entity that lives on the web and
the last the last problem is data
permanence so there's this idea of
book-burning right in the middle-ages
book-burning was considered heresy it
was considered one of the worst things
that anybody could do because books were
the store of information right so
book-burning was a really bad thing so
right now the way we store our data it
can be lost over time right yes it's
stored in a data server and yes you know
that server could go down but maybe
there's a backup but ideally all data is
replicated hundreds of times across the
web so you could never never never
destroy data think about all the things
that really matter to us scientific
discoveries and Diaries and memories of
your loved ones and lost you know things
over time you never want it to lose so
we need a way to create
data permanence so six six reasons okay
so six reasons for this so I'm gonna
take all those reasons and provide a
single solution called a decentralized
application okay so what is now possible
with the advent of the the Bitcoin
blockchain a couple years ago we
discovered that it was possible to
create what's called a decentralized
application that is an application that
that is not controlled by any single
entity so if we look at this map of
different types of networks the
centralized network is like this where
the main all the other nodes like let's
say humans or computers rely on a single
server okay so that's the centralized
model there's a distributed network like
this okay the one on the far right where
there it could still be centralized but
it's not just dependent on a single node
it can have it can be distributed so for
example its type of system can be both
centralized and distributed Facebook for
example it doesn't have a single server
it's got multiple servers but it's
controlled by a single entity
so it's both centralized and distributed
across the world but it's still
controlled by a single entity
now decentralize is a new type of system
that was enabled by Bitcoin it was the
first decentralized system what that
means is if you take away one of those
nodes the system will still run because
it doesn't depend on any node however
for a distributed network that's
centralized you take away the central
node the whole thing collapses but for a
decentralized system you can never
destroy it so you can now create an app
that's number one open source and
profitable that's never been possible
before either it's closed source like
Microsoft Office or app anything but
Apple and it makes money or it's open
source like Ubuntu or Firefox and you
don't make any money for the first time
you can make an application that's both
open source and profitable second of all
this can be a community governed /
controlled application all of these
actions that we perform inside of this
network whether that be you know what to
spend our money on what a hire how to
market the product how to make sales we
can create a structure using the
blockchain
we're the people who use the app can
also opt in they can also say let me
vote on what we should be doing I'll get
into how all this is possible later on
and lastly it can create we can create
apps that are censorship resistant so
this is an example of you know the app
store rejecting a certain app because it
it's it doesn't abide by Chinese law etc
you know the Chinese firewall blocks a
lot of applications from entering
because all of the apps that are
mainstream on the Internet today are not
censorship resistant but if we build a
decentralized app no one that the
Chinese government not any kind of
negative entity could block your
application like the Chinese government
can't stop Bitcoin they can also not
stop any other kind of decentralized
application that we built so there's a
lot of hype behind the centralized
applications ok but the problem is it's
kind of like this trade-off right so
right now a lot of the decentralized
applications out there we are
sacrificing speed and cost and
scalability and sometimes even user
interface for one single thing and that
is censorship or resistance however as
more people build these decentralized
applications this seesaw is gonna is
gonna tear this way so it's gonna be
more even and then all those things will
go to the to the left side so we're
gonna gain back some of these things
that we're sacrificing for the sake of
censorship resistance so that's what
we're building we're trying to get there
we are getting there very fast all these
problems are being worked on so how do
we get started ok so how do we get
started with web 3.0 well it all starts
with what I like to call the linked list
so this is in Python don't worry if you
don't understand it it's just a very
very basic class with some functions but
the linked lists is a simple data
structure that we learn in data
structures 101 the linked lists is
basically a way to store data so a link
looks is like this let's say you have a
phrase like hello Stack Overflow and you
want to store that in some kind of data
structure let's say a linked list this
is how it would look
ok so we'd say let's create a class it's
called class node and this represents a
single node like this
little box inside of a linked list now
this note is gonna have several
functions that will create the first
function is the constructor function
we'll say what is the data that we want
to give this and what's the next node in
the list so we'll say initialize it with
hello and then say self dot next equals
none but we're gonna set what the next
note is so just kind of block out all
the other other two boxes there's only
one box and now we'll see create
functions for getters and setters
so get data says return whatever we
store it in that single note which would
be hello get next we'll say we'll get
the data in the next node that it's
connected to set data will say set
what's inside of that node so we'll say
set data hello or whatever we want to
store in there and lastly set next we'll
say we'll set the data in the next node
which would be stack and then set next
again would be overflow so now we have
this linked list of hello stack overflow
three different strings stored in three
different nodes the whole thing is
considered a linked list so this linked
list is a immutable data structure we
can change the values in this linked
list but what if we could not change the
values in this linked list what if it
was an immutable linked list so once you
store data in there you cannot change it
so if we create what's called in an
immutable linked list we would call it a
block chain okay
that is what a block chain is a block
chain is a glorified linked list an
immutable linked list and instead of
calling them nodes we call them blocks
and inside of these blocks we store data
the data is in the form of what are
called transactions okay so I'm going to
explain how this works so a block chain
is essentially a linked list that you
cannot change the values of what's
inside of there you cannot change how
does this happen
well satoshi said let's create a system
Bitcoin was and it's gonna use this data
structure called the blockchain on my
computer I'm gonna store this linked
list a blockchain of transactions you
know Bob sent to Mary Mary sent above
all these transactions of people sending
money I'm gonna store it on my computer
and
and other people let's say ten other
people will store the same exact data
structure okay the blockchain how do I
make sure that no one can change the
values in this list right you don't want
your bank changing the values in your
account right yeah it would change your
account balance right that's what we
have banks but what Satoshi said was oh
I have it I have a genius way of
preventing people from changing the
value in this blockchain Satoshi said in
order for someone to change the value in
their blockchain they would have to have
more computing power than the majority
of the network and what happened was the
Bitcoin network grew so fast it it it
had more computing power than the 500
fastest supercomputers in the world
combined so in order to change any of
those values in a single block a bad
actor would have to have more computing
power than the 500 fastest
supercomputers in the world combined and
no one has that much computing power so
the blockchain has remained immutable
and this has been a revolution right for
the first time we don't need to trust a
bank or any kind of central party to say
we're not going to modify your your data
structure now we have this network where
no one can change that no one controls
now we can use this to apply it to
different things but the way the
proof-of-work algorithm works is by
doing several things the first is a node
is so a node in the blockchain a minor
will say I'm gonna retrieve a pending
transaction okay so they're gonna
retrieve that transaction it's got
several features a hash a block ID
transactions hash and then what they're
gonna do is they're gonna calculate the
proof-of-work it's gonna take some time
they're gonna send send the block and
proof to the node update the blockchain
and then broadcast so what does the
proof of work look like so the proof of
work looks like this they're gonna say
okay here are some proposed transactions
okay I get you I get the transactions
now I'm going to hash it using what's
called the sha-256 hashing algorithm
don't worry if you don't understand this
we're gonna go over this in the future
but let's just say the block will take
the the miner will take this transaction
and try to compute some random string
from this transaction if the computed
hash is below a threshold value then
he'll say okay
won the game and now this is my
proof-of-work but if it hasn't it's got
to redo it again she's got to keep
redoing that hash calculation over and
over and over and over and over over
again until the value is below this
threshold and then it could say okay
this is the proof of work I proved it
I've solved it done that's the basic
idea now if all the miners do this
they all do then the amount of computing
power that the network has is giant
gigantic right because there's so many
miners and that's why it's secured that
no one can change it because they would
have to have more computing power than
all these miners or half of them which
is no one has that much computing power
so the best way to really explain how
this blockchain thing works is by
looking at a visual demo that I found by
this guy Anders calm so here's so
hashing is basically taking some value
and creating some fixed output so taking
an input doing some kind of function to
it some series of operations and then
computing an output which we couldn't
call a hash so let's say I have some
data like yo notice how every letter I
type the hash below changes so if I type
in ABCD a unique hash shows up let me
try it again
ABCD the same exact unique hash shows up
so no matter what if someone has if
someone wants to create a hash that
looks like this
the only input data that could create
this hash is the word ABCD that's it so
that's that's the hashing function okay
that and then so Bitcoin uses what's
called the sha-256 I'll go into the
details of that later on but it's a type
of hashing function so that brings us to
the block okay so for a block we're
gonna say let's have some data and it's
got this hashing function okay so this
is block number one so what what a miner
will do is they'll mind that block to
find what's called the nonce
the number only used once it's called a
nonce but it's got a fine what is what
is the what is a valid nonce for this
data to create a hash so I'll hit mine
okay and then it shows this correct
nonce so now it's mine the block it's
computed like exactly what I said before
from from the proof-of-work demo right
here
what is that threshold value got it
here's the nonce it's it's kept trying
to calculate this nonce for this data
such that the hash looks just like this
okay so that's how mining works now a
blockchain then is like this so it's a
series of these blocks until miner will
say okay here's the data for this block
let me mine it okay so in order to be
able to mine any of these blocks the a
miner has to have the the previous block
before it's right so each block depends
on the hash value of the previous block
what happens is the people is with the
longest chain are considered the most
valid because they've been around the
longest time so if I try to break any of
this fight if I change the value here
notice how this one turned red as well
the whole block chain breaks so the
miners with the longest chain are
considered the most valid during this
proof of work mechanism I just want to
give you a kind of flyby overview of how
a blockchain works we'll go into more of
those details later but I just wanted to
give you some idea of a blockchain it's
not some you know a super complicated
thing it's actually a very simple thing
it's a glorified linked list that's
immutable that a bunch of people store
secured by a proof-of-work
algorithm which uses hashing which is a
which is a topic in computer science
which I'll go over in detail later so
let's move on to the web 3.0 stack so
for web 2.0 if you want to build an app
you use for computation use Amazon ec2
Heroku right these are services that
provide computation in the cloud but now
you can use what's called aetherium okay
I'll talk about that in a second for
file storage you would use s3 Google
Cloud
Floyd hub one of these storage providers
but now you can use what's called ipfs
for external data you'd use a third
party API to pull data from the web but
now you use what's called an Oracle for
monetization you would say okay it's got
to be the ad model but now we've got the
token model for payments you use PayPal
Visa Amex all of these depend on banks
but now we can use Bitcoin litecoin
aetherium so each aspect of web 2.0 is
now decentralized and we can use all of
these services so am I going
talk about every single one of these
etherium ipfs Oracle's token in this
video no that'd be far too much we've
got a lot to cover like I said okay we
understand the basics of how a
blockchain works which is fine for now
now let's just go over aetherium just
just a little bit just a very little bit
we have so much a cover don't worry I
know it's a lot but if the idea behind
aetherium was the founder said let's
take this idea of Bitcoin well we have
this blockchain an immutable data
structure and say well we don't have to
trust a bank to store this data what
else can we use this for well we can use
to say we can basically decentralize
everything that exists right now right
insurance social networks we have to
trust the third the central party for
social networks ride sharing everything
games you know Blizzard and World of
Warcraft there's always some kind of
central middlemen that we have to trust
between all these services so we can
basically disrupt everything and just
apply blockchain to every single idea
and now it's a new type of startup that
couldn't have been possible before so
what they said was let's create a
blockchain that we can store code inside
of okay
not just transactions transactions are
fine but what if we stored code inside
of this thing well then we can
decentralize what's called like Heroku
right computation now it's a world
computer we can create an app and let it
live on this network not Heroku but on a
network that nobody controls so it's
essentially an unstoppable application
no one can shut down this application so
that's just the first bit right there's
a lot of different things going on here
and notice how the ethereum blockchain
looks similar to the Bitcoin blockchain
except there's a whole bunch of other
features and variables in there we don't
have to worry about that just notice the
code bit right here that's it for now it
stores code it's it's like the Bitcoin
blockchain except for except it doesn't
just store transactions it stores code
it's a decentralized Heroku that's it
okay so when I say it's stores code it
stores a specific type of code that's
called a smart contract and a smart
contract looks like this okay
a cerium has its own language called
solidity which we're going to go into so
much over the coming weeks but it's
called solidity and what you can do is
you can write code in this language that
goes on the etherium block chain that no
one can shut down it's it's unstoppable
unchangeable immutable code and
generally if solidity contracts have
four parts they've got an address that
you know identifies what where that
contract is they've got a balance
they've got some code and they have a
state okay
so what we're gonna do right now is
we're going to code our first simple
solidity contract so what I've got here
is the remix solidity compiler what this
is is is a browser compiler for solidity
so we can compile solidity contracts in
the browser very useful stuff it's that
you can find it at remix
etherium org so all of these solidity
contracts and in dot Sol because is its
own language it's very similar to
JavaScript so we're gonna have to take
some getting used to I'm gonna teach you
a lot about this over the coming weeks
but let's just write a very simple one
okay so the first thing we're gonna do
for solidity is import is say well what
is the version of solidity we want to
use so we always have to say pragma is
just kind of an identifier to say here's
the version of solidity we want to use
and I'm gonna say it's gonna be point
four 0.16
now I'm gonna say okay I'm gonna create
my contract so this is my contract
object and I'm gonna call it test
contract so this is my contract
class okay it's a class object right
object oriented programming this is my
class this is my object it's called test
contract now what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna say okay well this contract has a
single value called int called value
okay that's all it's going to do it's
going to store this value and what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to create getters
and setters to help set the value here
and get the value here so the first
function that I'm gonna create in this
test contract class is called a test
contract and the input is going to be an
integer and this is essentially notice
how this name of this function is the
same as the objects name which means
it's called a constructor exactly it's
called a constructor it's okay if you
don't know that it's
constructor which basically says if I
initialize this object here's the value
I'm setting for that for value right
when we start so I can I can initialize
it as whatever value I want so now I'll
create the set I'll create a set
function called set P which stands for
set payable what this means is there is
this keyword called payable that
solidity contracts use that say whether
or not we can the the contract will
accept any kind of payment in the form
of ether right and this can be used for
different things whether it's a store an
auction a shop you know all these
different things will this function
accept will this object this test
contract accept payments yes or no and
so for this last function is called not
payable and it says well you can't pay
this object anymore
it doesn't accept payments and here's
the value that we want to set it to as
well so for this last part I'm going to
say let's create a getter function so
it's called get constant returns and
it's gonna return the value of value
right right here that's all it does and
then it says return boom just like that
and now that's our contract right we've
created a test contract object it's got
these tests these getters and setters
and now we can run this thing so let me
go ahead and refresh this page and then
say start to compile okay so now I've
compiled it and now I can create some
value for this I'll say well here's the
value I want to add to the test contract
object create so I've initialized this
test contract object it now exists on
the ethereum blockchain this is a test
blockchain exactly it's not the
production blockchain but now it exists
and now I can execute one of these
functions I create a get set not payable
and set payable so I'll say set payable
20 okay and now let's get the value oh
it's 20 right so let me set not payable
to 10 so now it's not payable I can't
pay it and now I get and it's zero right
so if we can set payable I'm gonna say
300 set payable yet and now there now
that that object that test contract
object it's now initialized and exists
on the blockchain on the test blockchain
and it has a value of 300 of 300 that's
that that variable we coded up here so
super simple solidity contract I know
but it's a very easy way to get started
to just have this thing run yourself all
this other stuff gas environment value
the debugger all this stuff we're gonna
get to but just for now be okay with
saying okay I get why we need web 3.0 I
get what a blockchain is basically I get
that the ethereum blockchain is saying
let's take the Bitcoin blockchain and
just put code in it so we can have
decentralized computation and I get that
solidity is the language of etherium
that I can run smart contracts with that
are censorship resistant and this isn't
a this is an example of one if you get
that you're good and I can't wait to see
you next time please subscribe for more
programming videos and for now I've got
to use a theory of more so thanks for
