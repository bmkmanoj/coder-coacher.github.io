three gaps you have to see the first
example is an Israeli startup called
azuz those uses a decentralized version
of uber uber is a centralized
ride-sharing it that means old data
requests and decisions go through a
central server owned by uber uber
decides how much drivers get paid you
can see where your ride is going
whenever they want to those is
decentralized because it's owned by the
community instead of a few people who
own a giant server the app uses its own
internal currency called zoos tokens
these tokens are crypto currency like
Bitcoin except there are no minors
maintaining the network with computing
power so no proof of word algorithm
instead the miners are drivers who
maintain a network with the amount of
miles they driven they get rewarded with
zhuzh tokens based on how much they
drive it's an algorithm called proof of
movement riders be the drivers with the
same tokens for rides so how does
everyone get tokens
well Zeus has something called the
crowds in a crowd sale in adapt is kind
of like an IPO on day one the creators
of the death decide how many tokens they
want to create and then sell them at
some initially decided price these
tokens act as both currency in the app
as well as equity since you are an early
adopter you should be rewarded for being
one of the first to use the DAP the more
valuable that that becomes the more
valuable the tokens become so you can
trade the tokens for fiat currency to
spend on other things if you like since
the app is peer-to-peer that means data
moves from phone to phone with no server
intermediary and the app is open source
so if you want to develop for it or set
up a team of developers and contribute
you can do that you can post a proposal
for how much you like to get paid as
well save for designers or marketers the
community decides on bond allocation
there are different ways to reach
consensus and these are being
experimented with currently but overall
it's a more democratic system where the
people who use the app get to
participate in how the app itself is run
the founders created illegal corporation
and the bylaws require that they obey
the will of the community vote so it
looks like it's already off to a good
start the second example is called open
Bazaar open Bazaar visit centralized
eBay eBay decide what you can account
sell takes a hefty cut of all
transactions and you have to be in a
country that allows eBay to use big open
Bazaar is a platform that lets buyers
and sellers connects directly to sell
their goods without involving a third
party to host data and charge a
transaction fee the creator's really
wanted to build on the idea of creating
a truly free trade platform I mean there
never really has been anything like the
bazaars the past on the internet bazaars
work peer-to-peer marketplaces where
buyers and sellers could interact
directly with one another without any
middleman in between able to observe the
transaction open Bazaar doesn't have its
own token but it does use Bitcoin for
payments they've got some dope
algorithms to solve some interesting
problems for example when it comes to
the issue of identity they use an
algorithm called prove a burn to ensure
that a seller can create a million
stores to avoid bad reputation proof a
burn means that every time a user opens
a store they have to spend some bitcoins
that disappear or burn so it's really
expensive to make multiple stores the
app is also open source so anyone can
contribute but they want to get a team
of people to continually maintain the
Apple equality unlike a lot of other
open source projects they should issue
an internal token eventually for
sensitization the third example is
scenario scenario is a decentralized
social network this has been tried a few
times before and failed I'm looking at
you diaspora it always fails because the
technology was never there it's been a
security nightmare to keep user data
secure but I think scenario has a good
shot at making up
social network it uses its own currency
called the amp in traditional social
networks like Facebook and Twitter the
middleman gets all the money for your
data from advertisers but since there is
no middleman since the app is
peer-to-peer if someone wants to pay for
your data or attention they'll pay you
directly with amps all users get a
reputation score based on how many
people like the content they post the
higher the reputation the more valuable
your content is since the network is
peer-to-peer no one can shut it down
like the Chinese government did to
Facebook and you own your data no one at
Facebook can peer into your private
messages with friends since your data is
stored locally instead of on a server
though it is a few I can find that I
thought were pretty cool that's are the
future of software open source
democratic and fair compensation for all
users they're more out there and many
many more to be created in the future
