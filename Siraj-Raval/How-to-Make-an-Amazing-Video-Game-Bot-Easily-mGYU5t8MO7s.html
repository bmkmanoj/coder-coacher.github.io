make a bot that beats you in any game
keep telling yourself that Suresh hello
world it's Suraj and let's make an
amazing video game bot in just 10 lines
of code that can play a huge variety of
games video games have been around since
the 50s when Joseph Cates publicly demo
tic-tac-toe at the Canadian National
Exhibition that bought used simple
scripted actions that ran the same way
every time regardless of whatever moved
the player made his demo got people
hyped though because no one had ever
seen a computer play a game before and
they were lining up off the block to
check it out the game blots that were
invented afterwards for games like NIM
and space work or similar but Along Came
Polly and I mean pong the pong BOTS
paddle had to make decisions based on
the human players actions and that made
it feel more realistic pong marked the
beginning of using heuristics to create
game BOTS heuristics are educated
guesses and pretty much every single
video game bot since pong has used them
a bot will map out a possible set of
decisions as a tree of possibilities
then use one of many techniques to pick
the best one but it's cooler that sound
it still always boiled down to a bunch
of if-then statements if pac-man moves
this way then the blue goes should move
this way if Master Chief sees a grunt
then it should run in circles like my
Facebook newsfeed
if Captain Falcon is being annoying AF
then your team BOTS should help you pone
him squad goals but yeah video game BOTS
have pretty much always sucked because
there are only so many edge cases that a
programmer can predict like if the human
in Fallout 3 has a pistol and isn't
moving and there are no enemies nearby
run into each other we need to think
about this problem differently when you
or I start playing a game we don't know
anything about its environment
beforehand the hallmark of intelligence
it's our ability to generalize but can
we make artificial intelligence that can
generalize to solve any task a team of
researchers at deepmind recently got
close by creating one bot that could be
almost any Atari game knowing literally
nothing about the game beforehand no
gain specific hard-coded rules at all it
was just fed the raw pixels of the game
and it's
trolls using those two things it learned
how to be almost any Atari game it was
given it did this using a technology
called deep learning if you take a deep
neural network and feed it lots of data
and compute it can learn to do a whole
lot of incredible things the field of
deep learning right now is where physics
was in the early 1900's the state of the
art in a huge number of subfields like
vision and speech is being broken almost
every other day it's a very exciting
time right now
the Marie Curie's and Albert Einstein's
of computer science are all alive right
now and newcomers are coming in every
day the mind is awesome and they keep a
good chunk of their code private since
Google uses it to outperform its
competitors but then Elon Musk came
along and it was all like I think it's
important if we have this incredible
power of AI that it not be concentrated
in the hands of a few and so he
co-founded a nonprofit called open AI
whose goal is to democratize AI so
anyone can use it and just today they
released something called universe
universe is a platform that lets you
build a bot and test it out in thousands
of different environments from games as
simple as space invaders to Grand Theft
Auto to protein folding simulations that
could cure cancer you can create a bot
and the better you make it the more
games
it'll learn to become amazing at you can
compete with other bot developers to see
whose BOTS beats the most games and
universe has other environments too or
web interface tasks like managing emails
and booking flights if you create a bot
that's able to defeat any environment
you're not only the dopest coder of all
time you just solved intelligence we
could then use your BOTS to solve
literally everything from global warming
to poverty to all known diseases so with
that let's create our first simple bot
in just 10 lines of Python code in our
first two lines of code will import Jim
and universe Jim is open a eyes original
code base that universe builds on and
extends to include way more environments
and features those are the only two
dependencies we'll need now we can
select our environment we'll define an
environment variable called env and use
Jim's make method to define our
environment parameter there's so many to
choose from
it's hard to pick but let's go ahead and
pick the popular flash game coaster
racer universe lets us
run as many environments at the same
time as we want but for now let's just
use one our next step is to initialize
our environment with the reset method
it'll return a list of what we call
observations for every environment we've
initialized an observation is an
environment specific object that
represents what the agent observes like
pixel data of what it sees and the state
of the game initially we'll just have an
empty set of observations since the game
hasn't started yet
now that we've initialized our
environment let's go ahead and create a
wild statement so our agent will just
keep running indefinitely we're just
going to have our bot do one simple
thing it's going to hit the up arrow
this is formatted by first specifying
the type of event the key then true
which means press it and we'll do this
for each environments observation we'll
call this an action and store it in our
action variable now we'll call our
environment step method to move forward
one time step and use the action as a
parameter this is our implementation of
reinforcement learning our bot will take
an action in our case pushing the up
arrow then it'll observe the result and
may or may not receive a reward if that
action was beneficial to its goal which
in our case is increasing the game score
open AI uses a custom image recognition
module here to read the game score in
order to return a reward
this module is included in the
environment so we don't need to worry
about it if it doesn't receive a reward
we could update our bot to do similar
actions in the future so it gets better
over time through trial and error so the
step method returns four variables an
observation of the environment a reward
a yes or no value if the game is done
and some info like performance timings
and latencies for debugging and it'll do
this for all the environments you train
your bots in simultaneously lastly it
will render the environment so it's
visible to us let's demo this baby I'll
run the code in terminal and it'll
connect to our VNC server in our local
docker container running a flash enabled
Chrome browser
the pre-scripted mouse will click
through the necessary screens to get the
game started then our bot will start
programmatically controlling the game
remotely yeah our bot really sucks but
how dope is this we can do this for as
many games as we'd like and to make it
better we can try different strategies
like random search or hill climbing or
just replicate what deepmind did
they fed the observations that they're
bought received into a neural network
that updated its connections to get
better if it received a reward open AI
already has a starter bot that uses deep
reinforcement learning be a tensor flow
that I'll put a link to in the
description and so to break it down
opening eyes universe is a platform that
lets you train and test BOTS for
thousands of games and other
environments reinforcement learning is
the process of using trial and error
similar to how we learn to improve a bot
and if you create one bot that can
succeed in any environment it's given
you just solved intelligence the coding
challenge for this video is to create a
bot for just coaster racer that is
better than this videos demo code post
your github link in the comments and
I'll give a shout out to the winner in
my video one week from today and I'll do
a one-on-one Google hangout with them
just to say hi and talk about whatever
for now I've got to make a laundry
folding robot so thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
