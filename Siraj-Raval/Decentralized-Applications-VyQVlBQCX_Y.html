incredible advances in artificial
intelligence and blockchain technology
that have enabled a new breed of
applications decentralized applications
or gaps for short these are open source
governed by the community and crucially
profitable for both the creators and the
users open Bazaar
for example lets buyers and sellers
connect with each other directly with
zero restrictions on trade steam 'it is
a decentralized social network where
users get paid for the content they post
opus lets music creators keep all of the
revenue they earn and numr i allows its
users to earn money by contributing to a
crowd-sourced hedge fund this space is
just getting started a new stack is
emerging for developers one that will
fuel the next wave of global companies
etherium acts as a decentralized
computing platform the interplanetary
file system has a decentralized storage
network and deep learning has a layer of
intelligence able to accomplish almost
any task if given the right data set I'm
Suraj of all and this is the first
course in the school of AI I'll show you
how to combine these technologies
together to build your own decentralized
application we'll build apps together
that cover a huge range of use cases
from decentralized gaming to
ride-sharing to social networks along
the way you'll have access to an amazing
community of peers quizzes graded
projects weekly live streams where I
answer questions while building demos
and your own certificate of completion
time stamped on the blockchain for
permanence so if you want to be a part
of the future of the web get hype and
