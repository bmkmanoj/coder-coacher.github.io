going to show you the five steps to
succeed in any programming interview
I've gone through the interview process
dozens of times for a bunch of different
tech companies and I've definitely
gotten my fair share of rejections and
offers these are the key lessons I've
learned from the game interviewing takes
work don't let anyone tell you it's easy
it's not no one talks about the
rejection only their offers it's
essentially a full-time job but if you
follow these steps I promise you you
will succeed so let's start with step 1
study before you even think about
applying anywhere you need to get your
technical skills on point the process of
getting a job as a software engineer is
the same at almost every big tech
company you do an initial phone screen
with a recruiter where they gauge your
interest in the company and if you pass
that you're asked a series of technical
questions that you write answers to on a
whiteboard if you can show the
interviewer that you can think through a
problem and come up with a solid
solution you'll get an offer but the
only way to do that is to practice all
my friends who ended up working for
awesome companies practice a lot they
stuck to a consistent study schedule
it's not about having some divine
intellect it's about how much time and
effort you put into studying so the
question is what do you need to practice
they're not testing you on syntax you
could learn the basic Ruby syntax
overnight if you wanted to but what
can't be taught overnight are computer
science fundamentals and that's what
companies test you on namely data
structures and algorithms there is no
getting around this just ask the guy who
invented homebrew he was rejected by
Google because he didn't know how to
invert a binary tree even those tons of
Engineers equable use a tool daily start
off by taking two courses I recommended
a free intro to data structures course
by my code school and the intro to
algorithms course by MIT OpenCourseWare
those are available on YouTube and will
give you
broad knowledge about these topics then
you can practice what you've learned on
hacker rank and hacker earth those are
online platforms la you earn points for
solving problems it's a lot of fun
actually once you've solved dozens of
problems on both sides read programming
interviews exposed then in cracking the
coding interview those are great books
that will help you practice
problems that tend to show up a lot
during interviews from system design
your questions about time complexity and
when you're done start conducting some
interviews with a friend have them pick
questions and pose your answer on a
whiteboard explaining your thought
process to that you can do all this in
about two months to three months of
studying a couple hours every day step
two is to find the companies you like
when you start the job hunt you have a
limited amount of time you can dedicate
to each company so you don't want to
waste it interviewing for companies that
aren't exciting keeping track of the
interview process across multiple
companies can be really stressful unless
you stay organized use an Excel
spreadsheet to map out the companies on
your radar and where you are in the
interview process with each of it you
can find these companies on AngelList
which is my favorite resource also
hacker news has a monthly who's hiring
which is great this is a somewhat
spiritual process you'll probably go
through some existential thoughts and
that's okay ultimately it's about
deciding how you can best use your
skills to make a positive impact in an
area you care about and then finding
companies that align with those dots
once you've got a list of companies it's
time to build your portfolio recruiters
that popular companies get hundreds of
resumes every day so they're on time to
sift through irrelevant stuff make sure
every single word on your resume counts
and it all fits on one page make a dense
and descriptive remember the less work
they have to do the more likely they'll
be to help you out make it easy for them
and highlight the most important work
you've done you want to fit every single
CS related thing you've done on it
whatever you put down you should be able
to speak intelligently about because all
of it is fair game during the interview
has between two to five versions of your
resume
each tailored to what a certain category
of companies from your list once
personal projects hackathon projects
contributions to open source libraries
github is where you can put your code
where your mouth is it's the new resume
in many respects having a personal
website and give your best projects a
web presence it's professional and
visualization is always impressed step 4
is to get the interview the easiest way
to do this is to just apply to a company
directly through their website but a
company did so many interviewees that
it's really easy to get lost in the pile
you
to find the gatekeeper its ethnical
recruiter you can use a little bit of
keyword magic and Google just like this
and it'll give you a list of recruiters
and people in positions you're
interested in that any company send them
an email and make sure your email is
short and to the point
that means a quick intro introducing who
you are a link to an easily shareable
and relevant project and an expression
of interest to learn more which brings
us to step 5 pass the interview you want
to exude confidence and if you've
studied well and your portfolio is on
point you will sometimes the interviewer
will be more nervous than you are and
that's ok smile shake hands let them
know that you're another human and
you're here to work through a problem
together they'll ask you to code a
problem on a whiteboard and you want to
be able to communicate your thought
process well it's not about the answer
as much as it is about the way that you
think that's what they're judging you on
once you color your first solution
pretty much every time they'll ask if
there's any more deficient solution
there usually is and this is where your
computer science fundamentals will come
in handy and don't forget to ask
questions they're there to help you it's
a collaborative approach they're judging
your technical skills but they're also
judging if they could see themselves
working with you and if you've come
prepared you'll do just fine
there are tons of resources on the web
to help you practice your technical
skills and I've linked to everything
I've talked about here in the
description the interview game takes a
lot of effort the key is to not let your
rejections ever ever ever ever get you
down because with enough practice you
can succeed at any technical interview
believe in yourself stay motivated and
you're going to make it for now I've got
to interview someone for the channel so
