misconception people have about Bitcoin
that it's all about money name one
person you really admire right now I'm
currently digging your videos to rush
what's the most beautiful thing in the
world well that's a hard one
I don't pass what do you want to work on
the most machine learning applications
in blockchain what are the people you've
met at blockchain conferences like well
it depends if it's a blockchain banking
conference it's mostly full of
douchebags and if it's a Bitcoin
conference it's full of cypher punks and
I really dig cypher bugs what is one
thing that excites you meeting people
who care more about the projects the
passionate about than money best advice
you've ever received be authentic
what's the bravest thing you've ever
done ooh my first solo flights in a
plane who's your favorite computer
scientist
favorite that would be Alan Turing you
think you need a PhD to do blockchain
development no I would hope so
I hope not because I don't have one will
the singularity happen it's already
happening what is one area of blockchain
that doesn't get enough love let's see

learning publishing algorithms what is
one really cool use case for blockchain
that you haven't seen done yet
large-scale remittances to third-world
countries do you think will create
mainstream decentralized apps in your
lifetime yes absolutely if you ran the
world what is one law you'd enact
disbanding the authority that allowed me
to run the world what's a problem that
you would love to see solved
concentration of power in fewer and
fewer hands what is a risk that comes
from blockchain that it's co-opted by
centralized powers and has to be
disrupted yet again by something else

about the future well right now I mean
it's really simple I'm excited by
decentralized open public block chains
if you were to start from scratch today
what is the learning resource you would
use to learn blockchain development
I think I tried to learn more about
JavaScript for cramping economist 3
because it's a weakness of mine and I'd

learning awesome well thanks Andres for
answering those questions awesome thank
you sir I have a good one
