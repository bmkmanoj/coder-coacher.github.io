five ways to use Bitcoin the first way
to use it is to make money transfer
faster the current system of money
transfer is centered around banks even
though Bitcoin doesn't require a bank
account I'm so a family idea of a bank
I'm not saying banks are a hundred
percent trustworthy but I am saying I
trust mine enough to use it it provides
security as a service I can put all my
money in my bank account and not have to
worry that it would be stolen because
they built that trust over a long period
of time with many many people I get a
debit card and don't have to carry cash
on me and if my card is stolen in
fraudulent charges are made my bank
order fund me it's great but one thing
that my bank could do better is transfer
money faster things can use the Bitcoin
protocol to make money transfer instant
for example international money transfer
usually takes five business days that's
because the bank system was designed
pre-internet so money has to be routed
through a bunch of different checkpoints
before it reaches the recipient the
Bitcoin protocol runs over the internet
so the recipient will receive your money
instantly to do this things can create
their own internal crypto currency
pegged to their States currency since
bitcoin is so volatile so one bank one
can equal one US dollar always and then
coin can piggyback off the speed and
security of the Bitcoin blockchain to a
user all transaction would occur there
are currency of choice just like always
they wouldn't even know it but under the
hood this technology would not only make
money transfer instant it would also
allow you to send money directly to
Bitcoin addresses not just traditional
bank accounts I mean not everyone has
the privilege of having trustworthy
banks in their country particularly in
the developing world a third of the
world's adult population doesn't have a
bank account in developing countries
financial infrastructure can be totally
totally absent people need bank accounts
faking the global economy to get paid
and as Sloane's and build credit Bitcoin
makes a barrier to entry for getting a
bank account zero open Bitcoin wad and
you're good to go the Bitcoin protocol
can increase the reach' so we can send
and receive money from not to people
with traditional bank accounts but
people with standalone Bitcoin addresses
as well basically anybody with a phone
can have what is essentially a bank
account in their pocket it's pretty cool
right the second way to use it is to
make it easier to earn money online
online transactions involving
traditional currency involve transfer
fees which means you can't really pay
people a few cents at a time because the
payment would be lower than the feeds
stuff Bigpoint allows people to get paid
with really really small amounts or
micro payments since the transaction fee
is almost non-existent that means
instead of being paid every two weeks at
your job you could be able to get paid
by the hour minute or even seconds
people could pay each other fractions of
pennies for data whether that be images
or videos or articles whatever so if you
were to write a song and post it on the
internet you can ask people to give you
one cent or even half a cent per view
and bitcoin finally makes this possible
the third way to use it is to help grow
your startup let's say you want to start
a startup you create a product and
incorporate your company now you use
need a raise money to get started
crowdfunding could be a cool idea but
people might not be as likely to invest
in you if all they get is a free t-shirt
what if you could reward people with
equity or shares in your company using
big one you can create your own currency
with a few clicks and you can think of
your coins as shares in your company
each share would be linked to one coin
you can give them out to people who back
you early on or early adopters the value
of your going to grow as the value of
your company grows just like in a
traditional corporation so not just
crowd funding the crowd equity it's like
an IPO up and on day one it'll allow you
to raise money
much faster and since people will be
more invested in your company's acceding
you get much more exposure but the
possibilities don't end there
advances in robotics and automation
technology are increasing at an
accelerating rate robots are going to
replace a lot of humans for labour based
jobs and then the for a social safety
net for people will become more apparent
while my programmers will allow people
to get paid for their data it might not
be enough to fulfill their basic needs
entirely which brings us to our 4 teams
there could someday be a cryptocurrency
that creates a global basic income
that's right the cryptocurrency that
gives people money for doing nothing we
all be able to do whatever we want while
all the robots do the work travel do
research do drugs
sorry anyway we need to find a way to
prove one person could only create one
account perhaps by verifying existing
government IDs then it can send everyone
who own coins a small dividend every
week just for existing and we can call
it social one there's so many
possibilities I mean there have been
many other cryptocurrencies created
since Bitcoin there's litecoin and
dogecoin and conjugal I am a God kind of
please your hedges falling and all of
them have their own unique features
litecoin has faster transactions grid
coin uses the computing power points
miners to solve scientific research
problems zero point makes transaction
history private the list goes on our
fifth use is officially connecting all
money the future of money is one where
there is a thin layer of software around
all currency and we can just transact in
the currency we're most familiar with
and take advantage of different currency
features under the hood protocols like
stellar and to do just that
two of the biggest problems in the world
war and poverty are directly linked to
the uneven distribution of wealth
globally bitcoin can help optimize how
money is transferred across the planet
and make them world more safe and equal
and free if you have more ideas on way
to use the coin please share them in the
comments below I'd love to read them
