interplanetary file system or ipfs is a
new protocol that could upgrade the
entire internet a protocol is just a set
of rules written with software and the
internet is made up of a bunch of them
they will handle different things email
data transfer page layout a bunch of
stuff the HTTP protocol is the most
popular one nippulini good old website
it says HTTP and at the beginning of the
URL bar that's because your web browser
is using the HTTP protocol to retrieve
the page HTTP was created by a script
gene in Tim berners-lee in 1989 it
defines two entities a client and a
server and it enables each to request
data from the other back and forth
if the request was successful a response
to send back so when you type in an HTTP
colon slash slash google.com in your
browser which is the client it uses HTTP
to a request to Google main page and
Google server using HTTP to send it to
you and the response that's it that
simple protocol is the backbone of the
entire world wide web it connects all of
our computing devices together phones
tablets laptops everything but HTTP
isn't good enough anymore in fact it's
kind of totally broken HTTP is make the
web become totally centralized that
means a handful of apps own all of our
data they profit off of our data that we
really give to them to in return for a
free service well this may seem cool at
first this is actually shrinking the
economy will Indiana data economy data
is the asset of this new world and a
good economy we should be monetizing
more and more but in a centralized
Internet we're monetizing less and less
these central servers are getting more
and more powerful by absorbing all of
our data servers are given a unique IP
address which defines its location but
that location is far away and takes
longer to retrieve
data and because data is location
address if that location gets shut down
that data is lost forever all of it it's
just not sustainable but maybe we can
make a permanent web of web where links
never die that's the vision of ipfs it's
a peer-to-peer protocol there's no
central server people connect to each
other directly that means if you build a
website on ipfs it could never be shut
down by anyone even if a government
shuts down Internet access during
protests people could still communicate
with each other offline with IP effects
that is the potential to save actual
human lives and data would be owned by
us the people not by one group we could
get paper our data instead of one group
profiting off of all of it and because
my PFS has peer-to-peer the inter
transfer is much much faster the network
gives data a content address not an IP
address so if you want to load a website
instead of your computer requesting it
from a server across the world it will
find the nearest copy
maybe that random dude sitting next to
me chemistry has it on his laptop and
your computer would retrieve it from
there directly and if multiple people
have copies of it your computer would
request it from all of them at the same
time the more peers the faster the
download videos we load so much faster
you can download games ten times faster
it's just better in every way i PFS is
going to help our computers talk to each
other much more efficiently and one day
if we become an interplanetary species
ipfs could be the protocol we use to
communicate with each other if you're on
Mars you don't have to with string that
video from Earth if your friend sitting
next you in the Martian dome already has
checkout ipfs stop I vote
learning more about in ways that you can
build decentralized apps with it there
are a couple of great demos to get
started right on the website if you like
to see more technology videos please
subscribe I'd really appreciate it and
as always thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
