four ways to use smart contracts a smart
contract is just a piece of code that is
stored on a blockchain instead of a
server that means no one can alter or
delete it since block chains aren't
controlled by anyone it enabled people
to do business with strangers without
the need to trust a third party the
first way to use it is to bring voting
online the US government has never
brought voting online because of the
security risks involved if they sort
everyone's vote on a server that server
could easily be hacked and votes altered
if only there was some kind of system
that could securely and synonymously
store votes online all right the
blockchain to do this an engineer could
create a smart contract and push it to
the blockchain a smart contract would
then get an address citizens could then
just send a transaction to that address
with their encoded votes and social
security number the contract would then
verify the citizen had never voted
before and then store it because this
code runs on the blockchain a hacker
would have to have more computational
power than the 500 fastest
supercomputers on the planet combined to
break the system ain't nobody got that
much computing power once the government
implements this voter turnout will
skyrocket voting would finally become
just another app on our phone no having
to wait in line at some paper ballot
booth a 30 minute drive away Millennials
would actually vote this would
fundamentally improve that the quality
of the politicians we elect the second
way is to increase spending transparency
think about all the cases of government
corruption or evil corporate dealings
all of them every single one has to do
with money stealing money spending money
on personal interest giving and taking
money from shady businesses the list
goes on with smart contracts we as
citizens of a nation or shareholders in
a company can demand
all spending happened on the blockchain
smart contracts can be instituted to
route money as we see fit so for example
let's say a politician promises to
increase spending on health care for
their state if there is a smart contract
that will route money sent to it every
time 220 hospitals and 10 insurance
companies the public can audited since
all transactions are public on the block
changes ledger and verified to be
unaltered by photography the more
companies and governments that Institute
this kind of transparency the more those
who don't will be pressured to do so
it'll slowly become the norm the third
way is to increase autonomy as our
species has progressed we've automated
more and more we've offloaded more and
more work to our machines this trend
will continue as our machines get better
smart contracts bring us one step closer
to full artificial intelligence to take
ride-sharing for example uber is a
software app run by humans soon uber
will implement self-driving cars so it
will need drivers but with smart
contracts Bluebird could become even
more autonomous even more independence
of humans a self-driving car could live
as an independent entity picking up
passengers paying for its own repairs
filling its own gas parking itself
coordinating with other Carl's if these
tasks were all smart contracts that the
car communicated with it wouldn't mean
humans at all instead of humans having
to run with logistics and plumbing on
uber network they could focus on more
fun creative pursuits the fourth wave is
to create smart property smart property
is an object whose ownership is verified
by the block traditionally we use humans
to verify these things like a stranger
can't rent out your apartment on Airbnb
because Airbnb has verified that it's
yours
but with smart contracts you wouldn't
even need Airbnb to rent out your place
you could create a digital token that
would represent your apartment and then
a smart contract that said something
like if you send money to this address
transfer the ownership token to the
sender for X amount of time and because
there's no middlemen to take a cut you
get more money for renting out your
place this can be applied to ever
from patents to cars to fridges anything
with internet communication capability
the Internet of Things if you like to

keep them coming and as always thanks
