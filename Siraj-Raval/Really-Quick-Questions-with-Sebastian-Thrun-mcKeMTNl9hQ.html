good
can I ask you 67 questions or whatever
okay what's the culture like at udacity
in one word fearlessness will online
learning replace physical learning nose
augment it and make it more accessible
what's something you miss about where
you grew up I would love to have gone on
Silicon Valley where people are screwing
me what time do you wake up I wake up to
be at 8 o'clock or bring my son to
school what website you absolutely love
to spend time on New York Times
Rihanna's favorite machine running paper
of 2016 we have one coming out in nature
in about two weeks and I can clearly be
invited machine learning if you could
meet one person who would it be
I left to meet Albert Einstein but he
said unfortunately favorite car Tesla
used to be a full-time professor at
Stanford what would something surprising
about that experience that I wasn't
kicked out because everybody else was
smarter than me very vast thing you've
ever done I've snowboarded down a cliff
what is one thing that scared you
actually nothing really honestly I live
to be scared and love surprises
hey as a child I follow the saxophone
the veneer yeah it spectrum msot what's
more interesting physics or neuroscience
neuroscience at this point because
systems hasn't changed in a long time
that's present you've ever received the
hug is always the best hug for my family
of my son I love this more than anything
else what is something you do the chill
I run I bike and I ski anything fast
motion I'll see a fly plane so what is
something surprising about you I
recently had an MRI of my brain and
found a gap up here around here but two
point seven centimeters wide I think
that's the normally feels located
because I don't appear do you prefer
cats or dogs dogs how do you come up
with the idea for Google X we wanted to
do innovative stuff they wanted to do
crazy moon shots so Larry's organized it
again and asked what's the best way to
do this favorite Google X project
there's no favorite but the vanna best
known for the self-driving car
what project are you currently working
on my god Udacity making a education
globally accessibility opposite and
double the world's GDP into education if
you could repeat one experience again
what would it be
boy being a start-up captain is very
humbling to be honest and there's many
good moments and many bad moments so I
would love to do it again why do you
think deep learning has gotten so
popular recently it is amazing I think
we reached the critical scale of data
like if you look at the red brain you
can't teach the right super interesting
tricks but it makes me pretty bit larger
the human brain you can do it so I think
in computer we now reach the size of a
human brain what is your favorite
operating system Linux of course I spend
way too much time
hacking Linux kernels in my life - yeah
what's your favorite movie matrix what
is your favorite operating system it is
Linux but I asked question rating before
do you have I changed yes do you play
any sports I run I ski I bike and do
anything it's fast most adventurous
thing you've ever done I know about
abundance an action book I backlit by
snowing over cliffs so then what crazy
ski jumps before when I was young
what's one source you use to stay
up-to-date in ml I love browsing the web
I love some of the people I go to
conferences and a slot of stuff in the
news is a programming language of choice
for machinery for me it's either Python
or MATLAB MATLAB equals the left class
prototyping and I love the umpire in
Python but when I go to production code
go to C++ favorite professor myself
aha just as well as joke my mentor Tom
Mitchell at Carnegie Mellon who's found
with the machine learning department is
just amazing what why do you think
programming is fun it's amazing I love
it I do for recreational purposes I just
programmed a pseudo code problem solver
just because of a dead leg it's fun
because it's a great mental exercise
favorite comfort food oh my god I
actually make my own food I have a
little food invention to make great day
99 minutes and a love fish name one
person you really admire I would say
number one would be Larry Page the CEO
of alphabet and I learned so much from
him what was your first program I had a
pocket
are called Texas Instrument 57 you
should google it it looks like 1980
technology and it had 50 programming of
steps and I spent endless time building
video games on this pocket calculator
what texture what text editor do you you
can email what open-source library do
you really like boy I do a lot of open
Linux of course and I love working on
Python on the library's best advice
you've ever received boy not a take
myself too seriously life is totally fun
do you spend more time on the internet
or real life real life and even one
isn't it for me it's realized because I
interact with people and real people do
you have any pets and though honestly
just kidding though not that I know of
what's something you've learned in the
past month
I learned something amazing about
crowdsourcing our students that produce
software for the serving car are so
amazing strong I think we should do much
more cloud possible for development do
you like spicy food I do if you ran the
world what is one law you didn't act
immediately I would force any kid netid
States to spend one year abroad to
understand that there's more than just
America is the singularity near we in
the middle of it at this very moment who
is one person you looked up to when you
were in college again my mentees advisor
Tom Mitchell whom I met when I was in
college was me like you got to me and he
helped me understand the importance of
not just doing good research or doing
impactful research what deep learning
library do you use the mug
I think tensor show is the best right
now but it's a fast-moving field if you
were to start from scratch today what is
a learning resource you would use to
learn machine learning definitely
Udacity no question I think I see it's
not perfect but have you done I hope it
done really good jobs you can get
accessible we have a new foundation nano
degree on deep learning which is very
easy to understand what is one goal you
have in the next 10 years boy I have so
many of those I'm not learning more
things so I get bored when I'm good at
something so right now I'm learning how
to do instrument piloting of claims but
I also like to understand better how to
make audacity a really
company favorite subject in school when
you were growing up now if you could be
a superhero who would it be
boy I feel I don't feel like Spider Man
on the depressed days but I vitami
Badman what's your spirit animal my
school animal your spirit animal oh my
god Pokemon what do you predict comes
next after the deep learning hype
I think machine one would say this for
quite a while and it's going to be as
big of evolution as the Agricultural
Revolution is going to come in many
shapes but if I were to add one new
thing I think we're going to build
machines they can browse all the
dictionary world all the books in the
world and learn from it and combine
image based learning and data based
learning with book learning coffee or
tea a coffee summer or winter both
google home or amazon alexa definitely
i'm gonna like that because it has a
name and it's significant call it my
name Chrome or Safari Chrome WWDC or
Google i/o definitely Google i/o my
friends Agora amazing awesome all right
Sebastian thanks so much for answering
those questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
