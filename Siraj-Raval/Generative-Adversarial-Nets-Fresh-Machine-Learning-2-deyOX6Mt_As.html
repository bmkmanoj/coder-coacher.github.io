they're both real they're balls what
hello world it's Suraj in this episode
we're going to talk about generative
adversarial networks deep learning has
done a lot for us but its most
incredible successes have involved
discriminative models discriminative
models are great for classification
tasks they discriminate not in that way
obviously models like neural nets
support vector machines and hidden
Markov chains where we map high
dimensional rich sensory input to a
class label a discriminated model
doesn't care about how data was
generated it just categorizes a given
signal there's a secret sauce behind
tools like facial recognition and the
language translation and sentiment
analysis but there's another type of
model that hasn't been as successful the
generative model generative models are
hard to get right due to the difficulty
of approximating some really hard
probabilistic computations a generative
algorithm does care how data was
generated in order to categorize a
signal it asks the question which
category is most likely to generate this
signal anytime you'd like to generate
some novel data based on some input data
whether that be a chat BOTS replies or a
song or even a short story generative
models are the way to go so what is a
generative adversarial network or Gant
well games were introduced by a straight
gene and Ian Goodfellow who didn't give
a byte the basic idea is this you have
two models a generative model G that
generates new data and a discriminative
model D that estimates the probability
that whatever sample data G shows it
came from training data rather than G
itself they're essentially playing
what's called a minimax game minimax is
a well-known strategy of always
minimizing the maximum possible loss
which can result from a choice that one
of two players can make so G is fed a
bunch of training data and attempts to
generate new data based on that input
every time G generates a new sample D
will try to determine if the sample is
from the models distribution where the
training data distribution think of G as
a counterfeiter and D is the police
their adversaries G will keep trying to
produce fake currency and use it without
detection while D tries to detect if
it's counterfeit or not this keeps on
happening and both models improve their
methods until eventually the
counterfeits are indistinguishable from
the real thing so what type of model do
we use for DNA
well many different types of models can
be used in the original paper the author
used something called a multi-layer
perceptron for both to generate
photorealistic images based on a
training data set of images but there's
an even more interesting paper that came
out that you scans that I want to talk
about it came out just last month and
it's called generative adversarial text
image synthesis these guys created again
that can generate a photorealistic image
based on a caption I am dead serious so
when it was given the caption a large
blue octopus kite flies above the people
having fun at the beach he was actually
able to generate an image that showed
just that so how did it do this well
they use a data set of images and their
associated captions as a training data
first they had to encode the data before
they fed it into the models they use an
encoder which was a hybrid neural
network called a character level
convolutional recurrent network it takes
both the image and the caption as input
and creates a joint representation of
both in multimodal space it does this
for both the generator and the
discriminator both models are addy
convolutional feed-forward neural
network once they had the encoding they
fed it into both models and each
generated an image the generator net
creates a synthetic image from the
embedding an image that is close to the
real image but not quite the
discriminator net receives three inputs
the real image with the right text the
real image with the wrong text and a
fake image with the right text it
encodes each of these and compares them
to what the generator shows it looking
for similarity between its inputs and
the generators outputs each time step
they will try to determine if the
generated image was synthetic or real by
doing this comparison after the
determination has been made the weights
of both the discriminator and the
generator are updated so they both get
better over time by the time training is
over the generator will be pretty good
at bullying the discriminator by
producing photorealistic images it look
like they must have come straight from
the training data so let's build our own
gang we're going to build a simple
Python script that demonstrates how gans
work both models will be represented by
learning Gaussian distribution curves
that we plot using pi plot once we have
our dependencies in place we'll want to
define our hyper parameters these are
all different activation functions that
will apply to our models at some point
we'll also want to define how much we
want to train our models as well as a
number of hidden layers we want them to
have well then write for helper
functions the first two will help us
visualize our Gaussian curves in our
plot
she builds the generative Network and D
builds the discriminative Network will
initialize our networks and write a
plotting function to plot both curves
finally we'll train our network using a
for loop we'll draw samples from a
uniform distribution then train both
networks at different intervals we'll
plot the graph as we train our model so
we can visualize the result let's see
what it looks like as it trains as a
trains the generator curve will look
more and more like the true data
distribution curve as it tries to fool
the discriminator Network and there you
have it you might be wondering what are
the real-world use cases for Ganz
well gaming is one it's a daunting task
to create a huge 3d map manually but
with Ganz programmers can write a part
of the map and generate the rest another
is interior design if a designer wants
to visualize what a room will look like
they can just ask the machine for a
photo of say a living room with beige
sofas facing each other and for ninjas
in the scene pretty much anytime you
need help visualizing anything ganz can
help fill in the gaps and augment your
own imagination I've got some great
links for you in the description please

I've gotta go fix a deadlock so thanks
