I just want to start off by giving a
quick shout out to my friends oh hang on
youtube she makes some cool fashion and
illustration educational videos so check
her out links to her will be in the
description anyway hello world it's
suraj let me meet that and it's good to
see you guys Beth glad to be back back
in black not really black this is kind
of like shiny if that's a color it's not
anyway I'm in this new space so that I'm
happy about that that's my picture I
just took of myself
no I'm just kidding that's just
something that's been there but yeah I
mean it's like virtual reality space
right now I've just moved into so
there's going to be a lot of cool crazy
videos that I'm going to make with mixed
reality soon so get hyped let me see let
me refresh this page so I can see your
comments because right now it's loading
and I don't like loading I'm like
loading I want to see there we go okay
so now we've got some people okay Wow
hi guys Wow everybody's in the room
right now we've got 79 people um so I'm
gonna start off this it's 1:00 a.m. in
India okay
sorry guys about this timing up well I'm
not I'm gonna next time we're going to
do it an hour earlier so for everybody
in India you're now earlier okay next
time anyway so hi guys
uh let's do a five-minute Q&amp;amp;A and then
I'm going to explain the concepts and
then I'm going to we're going to code
this thing and so what we're going to
code this time is it's a Python script
that's going to pull twenty of the most
popular words from a Wikipedia article
and then it's going to display the
frequency coupon of all of those words
and this is going to be useful and I'm
going to talk about this why we're gonna
do this in a second but first of all
five-minute
here we go hi sue darshan thanks Kate
Tejas and Josh this session is going to
take 45 minutes um if you want to do a
master's in CS program at Columbia or
any school the prerequisites will do
ughter science undergraduate group cafe
or tensorflow we want to use tensorflow
because cafe uh actually i'm video on
this called deep learning frameworks
explain check that out alright uh hey
everybody what do i do my hair I uh so
there's this guy who he also does Travis
colonics hair who's the uber CEO I
didn't know that I just went to the
salon like y'all was good and then he's
like cutting it he's like oh I do
Travis's hair I was like oh my god I
need to keep you because that's awesome
so that that's the guy his name's like
Anthony anyway ok so um can I build my
own neural network from scratch no
dependencies I'm going to do that in a
later video um if you want to do a
master's in D pointing at Montreal you
should totally do that because that
place is becoming a super cluster for
machine learning research okay you've
got yoshua bengio over there and that
guy's the G bunch of cool stuff um
anyway are you going to use
beautifulsoup yes
- kundo how difficult is it to get into
a master's program uh well it depends on
the school for the one in Montreal I
would say it's gonna be pretty pretty
difficult yeah I mean it's going to be
world class so the harder I mean the
better the quality the harder it's going
to be to to get in with my favorite app
in machine learning um Wow probably just
chat bots in general like I want to see
better and better more human-like chat
BOTS I'm really excited for that got any
tips for getting into deep pointing
research um I would try to find a paper
that you find to be interesting and
replicate the results to find the source
code and then replicate the results may
be in a different deep learning library
or your own version but if you can do
that that would be a great demo code to
show a professor and say hey look I
replicated this code I can do this stuff
and you know a lot of the times
enthusiasm plus a resume on github is
enough to get it is it wise to go in
deep in deep learning with very minimum
machine learning experience uh yeah
because I mean which team learning is
just a bunch of statistical methods
predicting the future using existing
data deep learning is taking what's
existed since the 50s a neural network
that's been around and applying it to
huge data sets and lots of computing
power and guess what deep neural Nets
outperform almost every single machine
learning model almost all the time so
you don't even need to really think
about other things if you can do other
types of ML models if you can do deep
neural Nets well can you suggest any
tutorial for machine learning noobs I
would say my channel my channel is the
best stuff out there download the code
make sure it download the code
associated with each video and run it
locally okay um any videos on Bayesian
approaches I actually do have one on
that it's called one-shot learning what
do you think would be a good approach
for doing sentiment analysis for
plagiarism uh sentiment analysis for
plagiarism I don't think that's actually
sentiment analysis that's that's like um
that's like record cross reference
checking there's an API for that
actually like just Google plagiarism API
alright one more question before we get
started um what is the most impact a
chat bot has created to date to the best
of your knowledge uh hmm I think that
the best one so far has been the most
impactful chatbox so far I mean aside
from Siri and Google now probably like
in terms of use like in terms of people
using it probably like sports even
though I'm not a sports fan like sports
chat BOTS because it give you the game
you know game time score people who
don't do this like look at chat BOTS
I've been using this stuff anyway so
that's had the most impact anyway so
okay so that was it for the QA now we're
going to get started one more actually
one more what if I'm 16 if you're 16
you're at a perfect day should get
started with this stuff don't hesitate
don't wait get started you're going to
be awesome by the time you're 21 plus
okay anyway so now we're going to get
started what we're going to do in this
video is we're going to write a 50 ish
line script in Python it's going to get
20 of the most popular words from a
Wikipedia article that
that we choose and it's going to list
the frequency of those words in terminal
in terms of word count all right so
that's what we're going to do and it's
going to be 50 ish words and the reason
we will we won't even would want to do
this is because recommender systems
could highly benefit from this we could
have recommender systems that you know
if you have a user who like likes you
know Batman for example we could then
query Wikipedia you get the top 20 words
in the Batman article and then show the
user suggested things that they would
like because you know it's related to
Batman we could build chat BOTS right so
if a user says something the chat box
could then pour your wikipedia that get
20 related words what the user is
feeling and then use those to create an
intent of what the next thing the chat
pod is going to do um we could do
sentiment analysis we could do data
visualization we could do market
research it's a lot of possibilities but
the the basic fundamental step here that
I'm trying to teach in this video is how
to scrape data from the web okay that's
what we're trying to do we're trying to
scrape data from the web and to do that
efficiently in Python is going to be
relatively easy and we're going to get
started okay so here we go I'm going to
start coding them so let's see screen
sharing time desktop start the screen
share all right boom and let me show
myself all right so here we go with this
hold on I got to make sure that I'm
visible I'm visible because I like being
visible unless you're my ex-girlfriend
who I just broke up with oh I don't want
to be visible to her anyway because I
don't have time for that I have to do
this okay here we go here we go ah ah ah
move out of the way okay
okay so now so here we go so the first
thing I'm going to do is we're going to
import our dependencies right so let's
import our dependencies and then we're
going to write our script right so let's
import our dependencies this so the
first thing we're going to do is let me
make sure this is a you guys can see
this right like this is a good visible
code like little this the size this is
good right let me know so the first
dependency we're going to import is a
beautiful suit right beautiful too it's
going to let us it's going to pull data
out of HTML and it's going to it's going
to end XML and so we can we can parse it
later so when we pull the data from
wikipedia it's going to be HTML and want
to parse it properly so that's what
beautifulsoup is going to help it's
going to help us do that the next one
we're going to import it's called
request request it's over 7 million
downloads a month it is like the Python
library for dealing with the web like
pulling data from the web push and go to
the web next we're going to import re
which is going to help us perform
regular expressions regular expressions
are they describe a search pattern so if
anything we want to do to a word like
remove the second a character of a word
every time or add a period at the end or
remove a space that's what regular
expressions help us do I'm going to make
this code available later so don't even
worry about all right so now we're going
to import the operator module operator
is basically a wrapper around functions
that already exists in Python like
addition subtraction we're gonna that's
what operators going to help us do it's
just a more readable way of doing these
things for the sake of pretty support
now we're going to pour JSON which is
going to help us parts our JSON which is
what we're going to retrieve from the
web is going to be JSON which is a
format for pulling data from the web
okay and now we're going to import
tabulate so what is tabular tabulate is
it only has one function that's it
that's the only thing this library does
tabulate is going to take a list of
lists and it's going to create a nice
pretty
Abell in terminal where we're going to
display all of our words okay so that's
what tabulate does thanks guys and so
now we're going to import six we're just
going to let us make system calls which
specifically in this is going to let us
get the user input which is the user
input is going to be what's the
Wikipedia article that we want to get
there from right okay so that's sis and
now we're going to import the lacs
library is called stop words well what
are soft words stop words are words that
don't matter a natural language
processing we always want to remove our
stop words before we perform anything on
our data whether it's machine learning
or you know cleaning whatever stop words
are words like a thaw and to enact and
stop words this library is now let us
remove all the soft words at once okay
so that those are our dependencies let's
go ahead and get started with getting
our data from Wikipedia okay so the
first step we want to do is say a create
our link to the Wikipedia API right so
here's our plane and it's going to be
this variable and I'm going to paste in
the link right here because I already
have the link okay so here it is so
let's go over this link for checking so
Wikipedia org w / API PHP that's analyst
access the API the format is going to be
JSON so that's the first parameter the
next is the action is going to be called
query because we are querying the data
from the web the list type is going to
be search what does that mean that means
that whenever we type in a word like
that man it's going to search for all
the Wikipedia articles related to that
man and it's going to list it
and then the last parameter is going to
be s our search which is what we're
going to add we're going to that's going
to be the name of our article which
we're going to add to this string later
okay so that's the string okay so it's
going to be a little long so it's going
to go over the page if you want to see
it again just let me know okay so that's
the string let's make one more link
Wikipedia link so this is just a link to
the Wikipedia page why do we need two
things well I'm going to explain that in
a second but right now let's just type
this in in Wikipedia org
all right so those are our links and now
uh yeah I'll be put that you are on the
chat that's a great idea
let me just you're watching this later
if it's reported don't you more about it
just to make through second room there
we go okay so okay so that's the data
from we compete oh so those are our URLs
so now let's get the user inputs so
let's say at the length of the user
input is going to be small and go ahead
and print enter a valid string because
you're not you're you haven't you
haven't typed in a valid string and then
we're going to exit the program so this
is an error so if the search board is
too small throw an error okay the next
thing we're going to do is get to search
for it alright so what is this Kirchberg
to the user going to type in
inter-terminal what type of what type of
article they want to search for so we're
going to store that into the string
query variable and we're going to
retrieve that using the sis fortune and
argue the Syst modules Rd function it's
the first parameter okay and now we the
youth we also want to say so by the way
this is what this is going to look like
all right so whenever we type in you
know whenever we run the similar like
this Python may not apply but mainly
article and then yes or no okay what
does that mean I mean this is going to
pull all the top 20 words from a Batman
article and yet turn oh just means do we
want to remove the stop words or not
okay that's what it's going to look like
and we want to say yes so we want to say
get the length of the second argument is
greater than 2 then yes we want to set a
certain mode katroo which means remove
stop words oh and this needs to be a
capital right okay so next thing this
helps
why don't I apply for a job at Google I
mean like I'll think about it but like
I'm not leaving you guys I've built
something too awesome to leave you guys
okay so um so this is going to remove
stop words if we if we want to alright
so let's go ahead and create our URL
let's create our URL right so the URL is
going to URL
out of the way move out of the way we're
gonna win okay so why are there so many
Indians here
well because Indians are really into
technology and India's an up-and-coming
country okay so here we go
Wikipedia API link plus spring query
what I asked you
well we took our spring query when we
added it to the end of that link that I
just sent you right at the end of search
so which basically the computer science
terminology is concatenated we
concatenated a string okay so we create
Europe all right we're ready to search
for Batman okay we have our URL and how
do we want to make this end for you know
brunch is awesome - New York City is
awesome let's fold it okay so how do we
want to make our request well when a
crate would call a try block a try
except block why because in a try except
block you try something and if it
doesn't work you make an exception and
guess what happens whenever you deal
with the web exceptions you want to
handle exceptions right did that you are
did you type in the wrong URL this is a
server down is your key next fiber
provider effed did you not pay your
monthly bill all this stuff it doesn't
work so anyway if anybody's late don't
even worry about it
all the code is still here okay you can
see it off in the beginning so now let's
go ahead and write out our response
we're going to make our query now right
so we're going to use a request library
to get the URL okay so that's going to
store that data in there it's going to
store our article in the response
variable and now we're going to use the
JSON module to load the data from that
response and we're going to decode it
because guess what it's not in the right
format and how do we do that we say
utf-8 utf-16 in a second so now we want
to format this data right we want to
perform at the data or just remove this
like get out of the way all right here
we go oh all right so now let's with
fermented data and by the way guys the
YouTube space in La works awesome that
was an incredible experience I feel so
inspired to to teach you guys a lot of
stuff into Corporal videos ok so we're
going to format this data using the JSON
module and we want to get that wait wait
hold on a second
JSON downloads respond to content
actually I just think that what am i
doing I don't anyway anyway anyway uh so
now we're going to say Wikipedia page
tag and we want to say let me let me let
me just write this and then I'm going to
explain query this is a little search
that's going to be here and I'm actually
going to show you guys what this looks
like in the browser okay in the browser
what are we doing here well we want to
get that Wikipedia page tagged why and
then we're going to we're going to
create our new URL with that okay so
it's going to be URL equals wikipedia
like the one that we just made
plus the Wikipedia page tag okay so let
me show you guys exactly what I mean but
let's take this link that I showed you
okay and let's run this in our our
browser okay so let me just move this
down here boom can someone tell me how
many people are viewing because I can't
even see because it's like froze or
something so what happens here I'm going
to take that I'm going to add let's say
Batman to the end what does it look like
okay this is just it's going to show all
the articles that are related to Batman
180 okay pull this is other show all the
articles related to Batman it doesn't
actually show the Batman article it just
shows all the articles related to that
we're going to pick the first one from
this like see like list of Batman comics
Adventures of DC come you know all of
these are possible articles but we're
going to take the first one which is
going to be Batman himself and that's
the article that we're going to retreat
so this first link doesn't actually
retrieve the the stuff that we need
right it just retrieves the list of
possible articles I should use the JSON
viewer plug-in I have that intro so
anyway okay so so we and so that's what
this does this is what the Wikipedia
page tag variable story it's going to
store that first link and then we're
going to create our new URL to that
Wikipedia page and we're going to pull
the data from that so this URL is going
to contain all of our stuff okay all
this all of our words all of our
paragraphs everything okay so that's our
URL um
I'm using Safari because like I mean you
know hangouts is crazy it sometimes
works on Chrome sometime mm you never
know okay so here we go so in Korea our
new URL and now we want to get the list
of words from that page so page word
list equals get word list you already I
haven't written this so that's going to
get the list of words from the page I
haven't written this method yet and
guess what
whenever I write Python um I don't write
my helper methods helper functions first
I write them out as if they already
exist then I go back and I write those
helper functions okay and that I think
not I think that is a that is great
programming practice in general to just
assume what you want your function to
look like and then write okay so get
word list URL all right and so now we
have a word list now we want to create a
table alright a board comes of word
counts all right have I met mmm no okay
I'd love to do that okay so now create
table of word count so page word counts
equals creates frequency table page word
what's that variable we just did so
create frequency table another another
function that I haven't written yet but
I will
okay so that's going to create a
frequency table of words okay so now
we've created a table now we want to
sort these words right now we want to
sort we want to sort sort sort Express
wet sore that in the sorted word
frequency lists and we're going to use a
sorted function of
Python to default function to sort this
so say page word count
items we want to get all those items
into the page word and then we want to
get the key the keys going to be the
operator the item getter so that's what
operator comes in it's going to get the
first element has going to reverse it so
that it's sort of a border of a sorted
in order of frequency okay that's what
this does sorted frequency list so now
we want to remove our stop work your
move stop orders alright so now we're
going to remove our tacos okay so um if
if remember that variable up there
search mode exactly pull does like do we
want stop works or not
alright and no I answer all you guys
shoot arch I will not I can don't take
it personally all right um I'm you know
I'm in the zone so okay so I know my
phone is vibrate
thank you did yeah I need to who's there
oh it's my sister she's just like what's
up anyway she's kind of you know she's
kind of a princess but like with you
know anyway here we go so removes stop
words uh where was I oh man this is fun
okay here we go I say here we go a lot
do I get in the zone auto zone that was
hilarious isn't this isn't this painting
crazy like this guy is on it I mean I
like it anyway that's why it's there so
remove our stop words so we're gonna say
sorted word frequency list so we're
going to store this in a sorted word
frequency list frequency list and we're
going to remove stock words and that is
where the regex comes into play in a
second and I'm going to remove stock
words okay so check that out there is
actually um sorry so someone asked if
stop words works for Spanish yes it does
it works for a bunch of languages and
I'm I'm going to show you
ah it does work for a bunch of languages
okay so if search mode sorted frequency
list equals remove stop words okay so
I'm just making sure I had that all
right so we removed our stop words and
now we want to sum the total words to
calculate for the frequencies okay let's
sum the total words to get the
frequencies so total words sum equals
zero all right
dan o ox is my friends from high school
who ended up blowing up on YouTube so
that's awesome for keep so so we're
going to calculate the frequencies of e
forward so in the sorted worth I got
time for that all right for key value in
sorted for frequency list well let's get
a total word sum and then we're going to
say the total works sum plus the value
all right what is that doing it's saying
for all of those words in our list let's
get this top the sum of all those words
because the value is going to be the
frequency count okay
so then so now we just want to get the
20 just get the top 20 words that's all
we want to display in our table we want
to get the top 20 words all right what
is the key on line what is value key on
the line 43 item getter it's going to be
that first element in the list so just
get the top 20 words if the length of
the sorted word frequency list is
greater than 20 is greater than 20 and
we don't want it we just want the we
just want the 20 the first 20 right so
would say sorting word frequency list
and gets 1 up till 20 that's what that
means up to till 20 um no I
I'm not jealous of Danna I'm a huge fan
I mean he gave me a shout-out in one of
his videos and I gave him a Shia - who
worked out great
uhm who like a jealous of them do I get
jealous I get jealous of like it's like
I have a girlfriend and she likes other
guys sometimes I'll get jealous of them
anyway but that's the extent I don't
really get jealous of like celebrities
anymore
I used to though I just feel like
awesome good job anyway man alright so
we're just going to get the top 20 words
and now we want to get to create our
final lips our final list which is going
to contain our words words with the food
plus frequency counts and plus
percentage like what percent of all the
words to these 40 min okay so here's our
last part okay Mista something in land
50 you're absolutely right thank you so
much
Roman we're not okay so here we go so
final list we're going to create our MP
list best resource to learn Python there
learn Python the hard way and my channel
for key value for every key value pair
in the sorted word frequency list get
the percentage value and um will say
value times 100 divided by total word
sum and - what we're doing is we're
calculating that the percentage
frequency that these words are showing
up by multiplying by 100 right and then
finally we will add it to our list as
the word that's the key the value the
and the value which is the number of
time two shows up the last one is the
percentage like what percent of words
total is that okay and then finally we
can print out the headers alright so
here we go so we're going to print
headers and what are the head is going
to be it's going to be in order it's
going to be us
once you see one final list oh thank you
thank you thank you good call right
headers word we are creating Skynet
absolutely
so get ready guys because the world is
gonna not come to an end
we're not greeting sky don't worry about
well everything is going to be fine it's
all good it's all good
as long as I'm alive it's all good right
okay so frequency if you want to take me
out
come try just like I'm not afraid I'm
not afraid a little that a dope-ass feet
it was all right here we go
frequency percent frequency presented
okay so those are our three things
frequency percentage okay all right so
that's it so that's it okay that is it
so that's going to print out and here's
what it's going to look like by the way
right so if we will say let's say Python
main Pi and we want to say Google Google
uber boom
and we're gonna go all the way down low
okay just like that and then yes the
code is going to be available to
download let's see what this looks like
we'll say Python main dot pi and what is
someone shout out an article that you
want me to look up okay and then I'm
gonna look it up we're gonna get to 20
words for that article whoever says the
first word okay alright here we go and
it's gonna be it's gonna be me
what did install Jen - okay let's say
Jen - all right great supersnap a trauma
oh no um not oppressors no no okay God
Trump
all right Trump let's see Trump and do
we want to remove stop words let's do it
hold on hold on a second what's going on
here what's going on here
um hold on hold on let me see what's
going on
there we go ah that wasn't a lot of
words let's try it Batman that's better
okay so here we go let's try Jenga
actually yeah let's write known pokemons
okay mines good okay so what's happening
here okay so let's take a look at this
we have the top words right pokemon
games release generation um and then we
have the frequency of all those words it
showed up two hundred fifty three times
and it's 7.4 percent of all words okay
once we do this we can apply this to a
lot of other things like NLP with them
we can apply this to salmon analysis and
we can recommend things for people we
can do market research we can build chat
BOTS with this
I know Pokemon is the most frequent word
at this you Wikipedia article I know
that's kind of weird isn't it but that
is the case games the second one um and
I'll do one more because you guys are
really into this our Rangers I don't
know guys maybe it's like actually I
think I need to do like hundreds for
power underscore Rangers yes there we go
so Rangers is the most frequent word
right isn't that cool
so anyway okay so there so that's that
I'm going to upload this code to github
and it's going to be available for you
guys to look at and I'm going to close
the session out with a final 5 min take
you a and then we're good to go and I'm
going to do a live session next week too
and definitely comment what kind of live
sessions you want to see and I'm
definitely going to keep that in mind
okay so here we go uh five minutes you
and I go is there a way to remove
duplicates singular and plural um yeah
yeah there is you would just use regular
expressions so you'd want to remove the
S at the end of a word which would mean
it's plural right
that's that's basic I mean some words
anyway
thank you I'm glad Jesus loves me I love
Jesus too and where I'm where am i right
now I'm in San Francisco California
hopefully Jesus doesn't love trunk but
everybody deserves love in some way how
am i doing I'm doing pretty good I'm I
just got back from the YouTube space la
Wright was there for week YouTube flew
me out I want this contest next up and
that was crazy because it was like 20
creators and they were amazing people
they were just they were so um they were
just there were leaders and like it was
it was cool but I was like the weird
ones like no one understands code like
because like I'm in my bubble here in
San Francisco right I'm just like doing
machine learning all day and I'm not
even thinking about making you know
videos about like formatting data or
like how to use github because to me
that stuff is so simple but guess what
I'm in a bubble so like that's the
biggest realization I got when I was
there was like oh my god I need to make
much more accessible videos because like
those people like did not they were
smart but they just didn't get what I
was doing there so specialized so so it
was awesome I'm doing pretty good
I am newly single and I'm focused on my
work and I'm trying to just become you
know awesome and like do physical
activities and have interest and have a
lead a busy off some dope life so anyway
I'll take three more questions can I
make a video to guide beginners I mean I
think I think that's like all my videos
but I'm gonna get better at that trust
me uh what is your source of income I
mean there's like YouTube ads which
isn't really much patreon is really the
biggest one I can get clients who come
in and like ask you to make videos for
them but like I I just that takes away
from the videos I make for you guys you
know I'm saying I don't want to just
make videos for other people so I'm
trying to just focus on this channel and
that's it and the and the way I'm
supporting myself is YouTube ads and
patreon and it's not enough yet but like
I feel like it will be eventually I'm
just going to keep doing one more
question and then we're good to go I am
single with this hair but it's all good
like it's whatever
do you know anything about
bioinformatics uh bioinformatics I mean
like some like a fingerprint reading and
an eye scanning so actually I try to
write a paper called proof of identity
the way to prove your identity online in
a decentralized way without a central
server I tried writing that paper but
it's just I just couldn't think of a way
to do it I thought about it for six
months and one minute look up that guy
that guy is a genius he invented the
interplanetary file system
he was like advising me but like I
couldn't do it but yeah that was my that
was my for a into bioinformatics with
like using eye scanning too and to prove
that you are a unique individual online
without a being stored and server we
still can't do it but if someone if
someone were to able to solve that
problem proof of identity then we could
have online identity that no central
government control like your online
passport which would be awesome and I'm
sure the blockchain or there's there's
still ways of doing that you know my
scanning and things like that so okay so
that's it um thank you guys so much for
watching I want to do more of these live
videos um and I'm going to upload this
code and I love you guys and uh thanks
for watching and you guys are the reason
I do this so for now I've got to get
hair like this guy so thanks for
watching none love you guys and now I'll
quickly try to close the tab while you
guys watch here we go where is that
anyway one where is it wait where is it
uh oh I may have minimized it oh uh okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
