the blockchain I know I've been talking
about blockchain a lot these past few
weeks and there's a reason for that
because this space is heating up really
fast and as people who are interested in
AI the blockchain is going to provide a
lot of opportunities for AI that's what
this video is about what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to first talk about the
motivations behind combining these two
different technologies blockchain and AI
then I'm going to talk about some
example apps that use the blockchain and
AI currently so you get a you know some
some ideas on on how you could make your
own startup or your own open source
project then I'm going to
programmatically write out the
proof-of-work algorithm this is the this
is the key programming bit for this
video
and after we talk about blockchain and
AI we're gonna program this thing
because it is the workhorse of Bitcoin
without the proof of work algorithm the
blockchain is nothing okay so that's
what we're gonna code out and the proof
of work algorithm is a distributed
consensus algorithm and that's really
really important for AI and by the end
of this video you will understand why at
the at the end of the video I'm gonna
talk about a few other distributed
consensus algorithms like proof of stake
proof of burn and proof of activity but
the main algorithm is going to be proof
of work that's that's really what I want
to get through okay so let's talk about
blockchain and AI so a blockchain a
blockchain is oh my god it is such a
buzzword but it should be but a
blockchain is just a data structure that
distributes trust across many nodes
instead of one it's like a glorified
singly linked list remember you remember
a linked list from data structures and
algorithms right it's a glorified singly
linked list that lives on everybody's
computers all the miners computers all
the nodes and all the nodes in the
network on their computers so we can
think about the blockchain as a huge
chain of transactions let's say we're
all part of the Bitcoin network right
Bitcoin is a set of rules for how a
network should run let's say you and I
are a part of the Bitcoin network I've
got some Bitcoin and I want to send you
some Bitcoin when I send you some
Bitcoin let's say to Bitcoin hold
Hottel to the moon right once I send you
some Bitcoin you're gonna hold that
Bitcoin and the network is going to
represent that transaction as a 25
character hash okay this is a hash a
string of letters and numbers and then
what's going to happen is all the miners
in the network are gonna have to
validate that transaction the majority
of the miners have to validate that
transaction for it to be added to the
chain of blocks this immutable this
unchangeable list of all the
transactions that have ever occurred in
the network that all the nodes have to
store a copy of and we can look at this
chain of blocks and it looks kind of
like this this is a very simplified view
of what the blockchain looks like each
block contains a list of transactions
and these transactions are stored in a
Merkle tree we'll talk about that in a
second and then it also has a pointer to
the next block in the chain that's what
I meant by a singly linked list it's all
pointing in one direction so it's a
chain of blocks a blockchain right so in
a murkily by the way is a way to
organize these transactions multiple
transactions right we can hash a set of
hashes so it creates another hash and
then hash those abstractions of hashes
again and it makes a tree like structure
and this is just a way of organizing all
of these different hashes and each miner
is going to before they can vote right
all the miners have to vote on the
validity of any transaction before they
can vote they have to provide this proof
that they that they've computed this
random mathematical problem this proof
of their work this proof of their
computational work since every single
miner has to provide this proof of work
when they give out their vote yes or no
this transaction is valid you would have
to have more computing power than the
500 fastest supercomputers in the world
combined to create a fake transaction
and that's why Bitcoin has an 80 billion
dollar market cap has been running for
seven or eight years now and no one has
broken it
so that's blockchain and now we'll talk
a little bit about deep learning right
so machine learning in the in the sense
of we're just gonna classify something
to keep it simple instead of generating
right we have some input data some
images of cars we want to select the
feature
that we think are going to be most
relevant to identify those pictures as
car or not car now remember this is in
the labeled data scenario the supervised
scenario we have some cars then we have
a set of features for those cars like
the color blue red green and we have the
the size that make the model and we want
to choose what those ideal features are
for our classifier to learn from and
once we do that then we can classify it
that's that's the that's the original
way that machine learning worked but
with the but with deep learning instead
of having to choose those features by
hand the deep learning algorithm will
learn what the best features are and
this is extremely useful because hand
picking features is a pain and we don't
want to have to do that deep learning is
a smarter way of learning from our data
to classify it so one question is wait
so how is this all related well deep
learning is a set of algorithms in it's
a subset of machine learning so machine
learning includes a set of algorithms
that learn from data that means random
forests that means support vector
machines that means neural networks and
when we take that specific algorithm the
neural network and apply it to lots of
data give it lots of computing power and
so it has lots of layers we call that
deep learning and it outperforms almost
every other machine learning model
almost every time on almost every task
and that's why it's the hottest space in
machine learning right now an AI is a is
a superset of all of that so AI doesn't
just have to include traditional
algorithms that learn from data
statistically we can all we can also use
heuristics kind of like these estimate
these these guesstimates right or we
could use genetic algorithms or
evolutionary algorithms there are all
sorts of algorithms that encompass AI
but machine learning and deep learning
are the most popular and offer the most
promise right so it's kind of like this
whole yin and yang thing if we think
about the eight if we think about AI and
blockchain there's a lot of synergy I'm
gonna use the word synergy here
synergistic between these two
technologies and they are very different
technologies but they're very
complementary to each other
so AI is probabilistic we don't know
what the outcome is going to be it's
changing right these AI algorithms are
constantly updating their weights their
learnings based on the training data
that they're fed and their algorithms
that guess what reality is going to be
blockchains on the other hand are
deterministic that means we know what
the outcome is going to be they are
permanent they are immutable they do not
change at all and these are algorithms
and cryptography to record reality
so while AI is about machines making
educating educated guesses for us block
chains are more about validation and
permanence and greater degrees of
certainty and and control right
deterministic versus stochastic aka
unpredictable right so AI can be our
intelligence right it can it can learn
from data it can it can find these
insights that we could not and the
blockchain will play the rule will play
the role of the truth teller the
mediator that's going to bring two
parties together and to two complete
strangers and let them trust each other
without needing a third party in the mix
it distributes trust across many nodes
so let's talk about some use cases right
so I made a video on this on this
decentralized marketplace for data
called open mind but let me go over it
really quickly again so in in in terms
of AI and blockchain this is one of the
most perfect examples right because we
have we have a model right I found my
data scientist I have a model that I
want to Train let's say it's a deep
neural network I want to train it on
your data right so if I want to train it
on your data if there was a third party
involved like some central app right
some central server then three different
people could steal from each other right
if I'm an AI scientist and I'm trying to
trick train on your data I could steal
your data or if I give you my model you
could steal my model or if we use the
third party they could steal your data
and my model right so what is a way that
we can have this transaction right your
data my model I pay you for your data
you train my model on your data return
it back to me without anyone having to
trust each other and that's the problem
that open mind solves by using the by
using AI and blockchain specifically
when I say blockchain I'm talking about
a smart contract so the TLDR of a smart
contract is some code that lives on a
blockchain specifically if theorem is
probably the most popular of those block
chains where you can you can push code
onto the blockchain itself right so
normally you would push code onto Heroku
and then Heroku would say hey I've got
your code I've computed it the answer is
five trust me but with a blockchain you
don't have to trust Heroku to say to
have computed your algorithm you instead
because of this distributed consensus
algorithm that's at work proof of work
you don't have to trust anybody you know
that this code is gonna be valid even
though it's living on all of these
different nodes right so you would push
some code a smart contract to this
etherium blockchain all the nodes would
have to verify that that or the majority
of the nodes would have to verify that
this code is indeed valid and then they
would also use this consensus algorithm
like proof of work or proof of stake to
maintain validity so in in the case of
open mind a startup sends a model spec
to a smart contract right and because
the model will initialize inside of the
smart contract itself no one can
we know that I'm not trying to steal
anybody's data I haven't hidden anything
in the model because the model is
initialized on a smart contract so no
human is in charge of that and then the
smart contract is gonna send that model
SPECT
that is some money and some instructions
on how to train that model to an Oracle
and the Oracle is going to which is a
third party is gonna generate a
public/private key pair it's gonna
encrypt the model and then send it back
to the smart contract and then after
training on all the users the model is
sent back to the Oracle its decrypted
encrypted with the Oracles keys then
sent back and since the Oracle acts as a
trusted third party no one can decrypt
the model or gradients we'll have a
second smart contract that
as an insurance policy against the
Oracle sharing secrets so it's a
two-step process the Oracle will pay a
bounty let's say the Oracle is AWS the
Oracle will pay a bounty and if anyone
discovers the keys the public/private
keys for the model then they get that
bounty so the Oracle is incentivized to
not give out those public keys right so
it's a it's a trust less system because
it uses AI and blockchain let's keep
going
another example is called New Marais I
new Mirai numeral which is a
decentralized AI hedge fund okay so it
also uses the blockchain AI together so
what this is is it's a hedge fund that
lets data scientists make predictions
based on their models so New Marais I
offers data for free okay so it's
offering all of this stock market data
and I or you as a data scientist can say
I'm gonna take this data I'm gonna
create some model algorithm and I'm
going to submit my I'm gonna training on
this data and I'm going to submit my
predictions back to New Marais I with
some tokens to support that prediction
now this token is it's it's it's
internal currency numerous numerous
internal corns currency called NMR okay
and it's built on top of the etherium
blockchain and so New Marais I will take
all the models that all the data
scientists give it and it will combine
it into a meta model this this meta
model so use all the learnings all the
gradients from all the models and it
will combine it to produce this meta
model and then it's going to make and
then time will show whose predictions
were the most accurate and those data
scientists who had the most accurate
predictions will not only get their
money back but they will get a reward on
top of that so everybody is incentivized
to make good predictions but if you
don't make a good prediction then you
lose your money and the fact that they
are using an internal token is a great
use case for the blockchain because it
acts as a hybrid asset right you can use
this internal token as both a currency
but you could also save a part of it and
use it as a security or a stock a share
in the network that will grow in value
over time as a network becomes more
profitable
right so that's a way to kind of share
the profits with your users and if I had
a version of New Marais I that did not
have an internal token that the data
scientists did not get to share in the
profit from of course New Marais is
gonna win and the way to do that is to
use a blockchain where the users can
share in the profit from the from the
network another example is a
self-driving car Network pretty soon
we're gonna see a lot of these
self-driving cars tens of thousands of
these giant machines that are autonomous
they're on the road and they're moving
at you know very fast right so we have
to be very careful about how we
architect this self-driving car Network
now one way to do it is using a
centralized node right we have one
server and it's controlling every other
car just think about the security
implications of that right if someone
hacks this server then every single car
is now vulnerable to attack we need a
better system right cars are on the road
they might be communicating with each
other oh you're on this lane you're on
that lane let me share some resources
with you let me park myself let me pay
for my own gas let me maintain myself
through some kind of automated car
maintenance shop you can see how their
cryptocurrency works well here and you
can also see how smart contracts work
well here let the machines talk to each
other without the need for a trusted
third party and there's a third point as
well ideally we would want an audit
trail right so if in case some kind of
car crash happens or some kind of
accident
anyone can can verify what the AI model
was thinking what its list of decisions
were immediately because it's publicly
verifiable and it's immutable and aka a
blockchain right so self-driving car
networks that are a fully autonomous
involved no trusted third party they are
networks that run and maintain
themselves so after a self-driving car
network it's another great example of
how to use AI and blockchain together
and right so like I said it's it
encourages data sharing whenever we use
a blockchain it encourages data sharing
which leads to more data which leads to
more
which leads to better models it's
immutable and it provides an audit trail
right so any kind of decision that an AI
makes as long as it's as long as says
it's on a blockchain we can all verify
all the decisions that it's been making
to to kind of come to a conclusion about
its result and native assets are just a
great example of giving more power to
our applications right that have these
internal tokens where the users share in
the profits from the app and the AI as
well which leads me to the wildest but
also most awesome slash also most scary
idea which is artificially intelligent
distributed autonomous organizations or
a Dao you could we call it a doubt a
doubt and in a way the self-driving car
network is a Dao
but a Dao is a computational process
that runs autonomously on decentralized
infrastructure that means there is no
central point of control with resource
manipulation that means it has some kind
of value some crypto token that it can
use to spend on things which means it's
code that can own stuff so what do I
mean by that well I think it's best
served by looking at this example so
check out this trippy image this was
generated by an AI ok but that used
genetic programming now imagine the art
Dow okay this isn't this is a this is a
set of instructions that are all smart
contracts that live on the blockchain
this is an unstoppable AI so let's look
at this process so what what the arc
doubt does is it runs an AI R engine to
generate a new image like this using
some kind of a I machine learning deep
deep learning technology and then it
claimed claims attribution over that
generated image on the blockchain okay
so so we all know that it was the AI
that that created that it creates
multiple editions of that art it submits
it to some kind of marketplace and then
it's it sells it right so then it earns
money for its its art and then it uses
that wealth to then pay for its own
resources like computing power and
generate more art and it just keeps
getting better and better right so you
have this AI that is doing this task
that the Creator that the Creator
asked it to do and it's using money to
maintain itself and grow itself so it
will get more and more wealthy right so
this could do a lot of great things for
us right but you could also see how this
could be a bad thing right it depends on
the person who is creating this
technology this is so powerful is this
insanely powerful technology and it's up
to us you watching this video to use
this technology for good for the good of
humanity it's seriously it's up to us
very few people understand any of this
like forget blockchain or a I even
Python or code right the fact that
you're here at this level of the video
is really impressive so I am very proud
of you okay so anyway let's get to the
good stuff the code so there are two
consensus distributed consensus
algorithms that are the most popular
proof of work and proof of stake let's
talk about proof of work so the proof of
work algorithm is the reason that
Bitcoin works right we have this
distributed ledger of all the
transactions on the network that every
miner stores a copy of on their computer
and when they vote on the validity of a
transaction they have to offer this
proof of work right this proof of work
that they've computed this random math
problem and only if they have done that
can they vote on a transaction so it's a
four step algorithm it's a four step
algorithm so a miner will retrieve a
group of transactions from pending
transactions to be valid to be validated
a block and it's gonna process some work
to generate a proof it's gonna it's
gonna broadcast that proof of work to
every other node in the network and then
it's going to and if the majority of the
network agrees on the validity of the
transaction that transaction is then
added to the blockchain right so let's
let's let's code this out all right so
I'm gonna code in Python what the proof
of work looks like let's start off by
importing our dependencies right so sis
is gonna help us print out some
statements time is gonna help us clock
how fast this is going hash live is
gonna help us hash a transaction and
then lastly we're going to import unpack
and pact which is going to let us
compress and decompress some data okay
so those are our dependencies
and now let's let's write out our
variables so the first variable we're
gonna write out is the time stamp right
so a time stamp and this is where we're
using our time library we're gonna say
okay time dot time that's our time stamp
we're gonna convert it into a string and
that's our time stamp the next variable
so this the next variable is going to be
the message so the message it just is
just gonna be is this is just an example
but but hashing a string is suitable
work for this project so this is a
random message right we can think of
this as a part of a transaction and then
lastly we have some payload so the
payload is a combination of the times of
the things that we're going to encrypt
which is gonna be the time stamp and
then the message right so these are the
things that we want to send to the
network it could be blocked data as it
is with Bitcoin mining in this case it
is a message with a payload a message
with the timestamp and that is the
payload okay so those are the first
three variables and now let me make this
readable so now we're going to write out
a nonce so a nonce is gonna increment
from 0 to n until the target is met by
the way a nonce is a number only used
once in cryptography anons is highly
popular whenever you're creating any
kind of encryption scheme you'll use a
nonce as a way to I mean there's so many
different use cases
but in this case is gonna verify that a
miner has indeed tried out many
different solutions before offering the
proof of computational work so we have a
nonce and then we have a guess and the
guess is this is gonna store our guests
which effectively it begins at if
infinity M throttle is gonna be
equivalent to the Bitcoin difficulty
we'll just have some measure of how
difficult we want our proof of work
algorithm to be let's just say you know
a million and the target is going to be
the maximum value that of eight bytes
divided by the difficulty right so it's
gonna be the maximum value by the
difficulty
so the nonce is going to increment by
one each time and it's gonna count how
many guesses the computer makes so
whenever the system does work it doesn't
have to trace back over each guess it
only checks the non submitted with the
data so now what we can do is we can
create this payload hash alright by
using hash live so we're gonna hash the
payload right so that is the message and
that is the timestamp payload hash by
using hash live sha-512 take the payload
and then digest it right and now we're
gonna start clocking this proof-of-work
algorithm by saying start time we've got
our payload we've hashed it now let's
run the proof of work algorithm so this
is a simple loop that I'm gonna write
and this is the proof of work algorithm
so I'm gonna say while the guess is
greater than the target let's increment
the nonce by one every time and then
we're gonna hash our data with two
rounds of sha-256 okay so we're gonna
say guess unpack let me just write this
out because it's quite a quite a lot to
write out so we've got hash like sha-512
and now we're gonna hash it again oh man
right hash libed sha-512 and then again
we're gonna hash a hash leidos sha-512
and then we're gonna pack this greater
than Q which is a nonce plus the payload
hash dot digest dot digest because it
was two hashes and then between zero and
eight right so we want the first bytes
and the first eight bytes so that's why
we said zero to eight and they're gonna
be turned into a number effectively this
is how a computer makes a guess so the
nonce is going to prove that it that
work was done and let me at the end of
this let me write out and we could end
because we've we've ended the the timer
right so the nonce is going
prove that work was done and in this
value in this example its value
represents the number of attempts our
CPU made before it founded valid gas
below the target and because each guess
has the same probability of being under
the target method of generating our nons
it doesn't matter however simply
incrementing the nonce is cheaper than
generating a random number so that's why
we're using a nots right so the nonce is
going to count how many times we've
we've we've made this guess right so we
have some red so remember our guess is
this number right here and as long as
that number is greater than our target
this is just going to keep going right
and the nonce is our way of of saying
that yes this this miner has indeed
computed all of these different
solutions before arriving at this at
this at this end solution and so at the
end we can print out all of all of our
variables to see what has happened here
so that's it for the proof of work and
so yeah so that's proof of work now
let's talk about proof of stake a little
bit so in proof of work the probability
of mining a block is dependent on how
much am i how much work is done by the
mine so payouts become smaller and
smaller for Bitcoin miners so the idea
is that there will be less of an
incentive to avoid a 51% attack because
miners are gonna get paid less overtime
because there is a limited supply of
bitcoins out there and so and the other
argument behind not having proof of work
systems is that mining communities have
become centralized right people have
bought these giant computer farms just
to mine and it's getting centralized so
one potential solution to proof of work
is to use proof of stake so in proof of
stake a person can mine depending on how
many coins they already hold and the
proof of state system makes any 51%
attack more expensive so but when you
when when a miner is going to vote on
the validity of a transaction it's not
about how much computing power it's they
have it's about how much stake they have
in the network which means literally how
much money do they have and it's a more
decentralized system
so in general the proof of steak
algorithm looks as follows and it's
actually it's actually really hard to
find code for the proof of steak
algorithm or really any kind of diagram
or I mean you can find code but it's
gonna be it's gonna be huge I mean like
c++ just like 300 lines of code so I'm
just gonna I just code the I just coded
out the proof of work this time but next
time I'll write out the proof of steak
and the others but it's it's a very
simple algorithm it's a very simple
algorithm the blockchain keeps a keeps
track of a set of validators also called
miners in the proof of steak sense and
anyone can become a validator by sending
a special type of transaction that locks
up their coin into a deposit and the
process of creating and agreeing on new
blocks is then done through a consensus
algorithm that all the current
validators can participate in so there
are a lot of different ways to assign
rewards to these validators who
participate in the consensus algorithm
right there's chain based proof of stake
and there's Byzantine fault tolerant
proof of stake which is a little too
much to go into for one video but that
is kind of the next up incoming
mainstream distributed consensus
algorithm after proof of work because
the argument is that proof of work is
way too computationally expensive it
wastes way too much electricity and
proof of state can be made better
aetherium for example the second highest
market cap cryptocurrency plans on
moving from proof of work to proof of
stake next year but we'll see how that
works because proof of work as expensive
as it is as unnecessarily wasteful as it
is it is still the only known
distributed consensus algorithm that can
work at the scale that Bitcoin has
become at so we'll see how it goes
there's also a proof of activity which
is kind of a hybrid of proof of work and
proof of stake the idea is that it
starts off as a proof of work algorithm
with all the miners trying to solve this
mathematical problem and then once there
is a winning transaction it then
switches to proof of stake so then that
set up validators are going to be chosen
to sign this new block
there's also proof of burn which is all
about you burning coins by sending them
to an address where they are
irretrievable right so once you commit
your coins to never-never-land right
this place where you can never get this
get them back you earn a lifetime
privilege of being able to mine on a
system based on a random selection
process and over time your stake in the
system decays so you'll want to
continually burn more coins to increase
your odds of being selected in this
lottery and they're there even more this
proof of replication which is what foul
coin uses there's proof of there's proof
of storage there's proof of intelligence
which is way out there which I'll get to
at some point there's a lot of different
proofs and these proofs can be
distributed but it's also useful to
think about proofs just in a general
sense right so on a distributed
consensus proof of algorithm that I
would most want to see it's called proof
of unique identity what that means is
can you prove that you are a unique
person in a decentralized way we already
know how to do this in a centralized way
right like a government or any kind of
central entity can store your ID right
like a government ID a social security
number or whatever passport and they can
say well mmm I've got this unique number
for you if you say you're him nope he's
the only one right we know how to do
that in a central centralized way but
how do we do it in a decentralized way
and that hasn't been solved if we are
able to solve proof of unique identity
it removes the need to have a
proof-of-work algorithm right because
miners are already proven to be unique
so a civil attack is impossible gaining
51 percent of the network we can just
say here are all the nodes that are
unique 51 percent of them have to agree
right so it can also help us create a
basic income right a basic income coin
where you could just give out money to a
set of unique nodes in a network there's
so much we could create online
governments we could create so many
different things but we would just have
to solve this proof of unique identity
problem and but anyway blockchains in a
I go blockchain and AI go really well
together and if you were to ask me Suraj
what what would you do as a startup or
what would you do
if you were you know trying to build
something really cool outside of making
videos I would say I would combine
blockchain and AI to make an app that no
one has ever made before and that's what
it lets you do it lets you create
software that has never before been
possible so if you're studying AI if
you're studying machine learning if
you're studying deep learning know at
least a little bit about the blockchain
because I promise you it's going to come
into your periphery it's gonna come into
your line of sight very soon if not now
okay so I hope this video was helpful I
hope it gave you some ideas and yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
