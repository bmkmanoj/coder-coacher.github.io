equations how in the name of Pythagoras
are you supposed to read these things
I'm gonna cover some crucial tips that
you can use to be able to read and
understand any math equation a lot of
people think math is difficult and
they're right that is inherently
difficult it's not as easy to relate it
to your life like another topic like
economics or sociology or dougie dancing
think of it like a foreign language if
you're a native English speaker and you
come across a Japanese children's book
for the first time no matter how basic
it is all the squiggles will look very
strange and you won't understand a
single thing but if you want to learn to
read Japanese
you need to have committed to memory a
few hundred symbols and several hundred
words from those your mind will build a
more general understanding when it comes
to math you also need to learn new
symbols like Greek letters there are
quite a lot of them it's important to
recognize the names of them when you see
them else when you see any of them your
mind will just label them squiggly thing
much too ambiguous you also need to
learn new words like function and
derivative and new grammar a way to
write equations in a logical and
consistent way so before you can
understand math formulas you need to
learn what each of the symbols are and
what they mean focus on the math
terminology and learn how equations are
structured Sigma notation for example
represents a longer sum but this isn't
obvious when you look at it you have to
add another dimension of thought to what
you see it's an abstract concept but
once you can understand this way of
thinking you can apply it to other
equations as well a little bit of effort
on learning the basics goes a long way
when it comes to math a great course
that will help you a lot with this is
called introduction to mathematical
thinking by Stanford University you can
find it on Coursera it's totally free
and I highly recommend it when I say
math is like a separate language I
really mean it cymbals put together are
able to conjure up concepts in the mind
of a well-versed reader in fact a lot of
times it's best to understand math at a
conceptual level than trying to
translate it to English a lot can be
lost if you do that one great analogy is
the Last Supper if you examine it very
closely in three different parts you'll
be able to describe each part but the
whole painting has an entirely different
meaning you'll see the detail texture
and color but missed a portrait
completely a math equation is similar in
that it tells a story try to see what
the story is before you delve into the
details you can go in for a closer look
once you have built a framework for
understanding programmers can be
particularly bad at math we're trained
to think linearly it's a process where
as a math expression is an entire
concept and cannot necessarily be
written in a single line of code math is
more like natural language than a
programming language programming
languages have a single well-defined
fixed syntax where particular
grammatical constructs always have the
same meanings but math is a collection
of rules and conventions
sometimes in violates others less so
with lots of idioms some of which are
mutually incompatible and lots of
variation between dialects meaning
conventions within various fields so
there's not really a formal
specification you just have to keep
reading and writing the language and
allow yourself to absorb it through
practice learning math isn't something
you just do and then finish it's a
discipline it's a way of thinking an
expression for the universe itself no
matter what you think of it it doesn't
change it just is and you never
completely learn it just a small subset
of what is essentially infinity the
deeper you dive into it the more you
realize just how little you know
computer science is full of math
discrete math probability theory number
theory these are used in general program
when it comes to the math of computer
science specifically MIT OpenCourseWare
has a great course on this videos
assignments and solutions all in one
check it out and when we start getting
to the really cool parts of computer
science like machine learning
cryptography robotics quantum computing
and animation math starts being used
even more heavily so if you're
interested in say machine learning and
want to get up to speed on the math of
it the first step is to learn the
formulas you already understand all math
requires earlier math it just build on
top of itself that is all the new things
you are learning now depend on what you
learned last week last semester last
year and all the way back to the numbers
you learned as a little kid maybe you
understand how a 2d graph works where
it's possible to plot the relationship
between two variables and draw the line
of best fit the equation of any straight
line is called a linear equation and can
be written as y equals MX plus B where m
is a slope of the line and B is the
y-intercept this is useful for linear
regression problems where we try to
predict the next data point in the
sequence once you've learned some of the
formulas for some of the concepts you
already know it's useful to find a cheat
sheet of the charts that you'll need to
know I've got a link to a really good
one for you in the video description
repetition is key to learning if the
only time you see your math formulas is
when you open a textbook there is a good
chance that they're gonna be unfamiliar
when you need to start from scratch each
time a lot of the times you'll see the
same concept over and over and over
again when it comes to machine learning
sometimes it's written in different ways
it often happens that you think you know
and understand a formula and then you'll
see it written in another way and panic
one major example of that would be
gradient descent the most popular
optimization strategy for deep neural
networks same concept but it's written
in different ways a lot of the time so
it's good to
come to an intuition around a few key
mathematical concepts that apply to your
specific field like ml I recommend my
own course right here on YouTube
called the math of intelligence to help
you with this you'll find it in the form
of a playlist okay you're ready let's go
over to popular equations from machine
learning and break down how to read them
to develop some more intuition the first
is the formula for the Euclidean
distance first of all what's the goal of
this equation let's figure that out in
the context of this paper it looks like
the author's are trying to produce some
sort of measurement that shows how
different two large features are in an N
dimensional feature space that way they
can tell if these concepts are somewhat
related or not related at all it looks
like there aren't any constants being
used here just variables and each of
these variables represents a coordinate
point - per feature its subtracting the
coordinates of one feature from another
then squaring the result summing them up
and then taking the square root of the
whole thing
the result is a single scalar value that
represents the distance we can use this
for sentiment analysis generating
similar words lots of different
applications cool right all right now
onto another popular equation called
logistic regression in general in
machine learning we're trying to come up
with a function that can predict for
future inputs based on the experience it
has gained through the pass inputs and
their outputs via a training set from
this paper we can glean that the authors
are attempting to perform a multi-class
classification with probabilities for
each of the classes logistic regression
is coming up with a probability function
that can give us the chance for an input
to belong to any one of the various
classes look at our training data there
are only two classes a binary
classification problem we need to come
up with a probability function that
takes in an input and returns the
probability of Class A or B this
probability function is
the sigmoid function one great way to
understand it is to just graph it a
picture is worth a thousand words right
since the probability of any event to
happen is between 0 and 1 this function
seems fit to be used as a probability
function for logistic regression we know
of the constant e but what's data well
the error function in logistic
regression looks kind of like this don't
be afraid where m is the number of
elements in the training set Y is either
1 or 0 and H of X is nothing but the
sigmoid function since sigmoid is a
function of theta then J is a function
of theta so our error is a function of
theta we minimize J over theta and find
out the values of theta for which our
error is minimized this is done using
gradient descent another very useful
formula once we have theta and our
probability function s ready we can feed
it any input data and it will give us a
probability value this equation can be
applied to so many different industry
problems spam classification probability
of someone voting classifying words
speech recognition and a lot of times
it's written a little differently but
the concept is always the same remember
math is its own language memorize some
of the symbols keep a formula sheet
handy and build an intuition by
repetitively learning and applying new
concepts across a wide range of
applications soon you'll be able to see
a new problem know exactly how to
categorize it into its proper type like
optimization or boolean logic and
understand why the equation you read
works for it so get on that math grind
wizard I'm rooting for you no coding

power for now I've got to learn more so
