hello world it's Suraj in this episode
we're going to learn how to write a
Python script that uses Twitter to
understand how people are feeling about
a topic that we choose using the natural
language library text blob in just
fourteen lines of code people really
confuse me like how does Donald Trump
have so many supporters in 2016 and why
our beers manly and fruity drinks girly
oh and why do people think anything is
beautiful like what even is beauty the
soundtrack is Beauty human preferences
are practically unpredictable and we've
invented the sciences of psychology and
sociology to help us study these things
both are the scientific study of people
and all the emotion and relationships
and behaviors that they display
traditionally psychologists would
formulate a hypothesis than to test it
they would find a subset of people that
fit their category bring them into the
lab then ask them to do some tasks while
recording the results but with data
freely available we data scientists can
do the same thing with the best
psychology tool out there twitter
twitter is a treasure trove of sentiment
people around the world output thousands
of reactions and opinions on every topic
under the sun every second of every day
it's like one big psychological database
that's constantly being updated and we
can use it to analyze millions of tech
snippets in seconds with the power of
machine learning so how does sentiment
analysis work well when we receive some
input text like a tweet well first want
to split it up into several words or
sentences this process is called
tokenization because we're creating
small tokens from big texts we can just
count the number of times each word
shows up once a text is tokenized this
is called the bag of words model then we
could look up the sentiment value for
each word from a sentiment lexicon that
has it all pre-recorded to classify the
total sentiment value of our tweet okay
so our process will be to register to
access Twitter's API install our
dependencies then write our sentiment
analyzer script let's start by signing
up to use Twitter's API an API or
application programming interface is a
gateway that lets you access some
servers internal functionality in our
case Twitter so we'll be able to read
and write tweets right
our app using Twitter's API let's sign
up for it in the browser first we want
to make sure that we have our own
Twitter account set up with a verified
phone number attached to it once we have
that we can create our first Twitter app
we'll select the create new app icon and
type in a name and description of our
app as well as a website the website
field is kind of like a liberal arts
degree it doesn't really matter then we
can click the Create button at the
bottom and our app is created we can
click on our app and go to the keys and
access tokens tab we're going to need to
use these keys in our script to let us
authenticate or verify our identity with
Twitter okay let's move on to installing
our dependencies our first dependency is
called tweet pi which is our library for
accessing the Twitter API or other
dependency is called text blob which
will help us perform the actual
sentiment analysis before we get to the
code let's do a little text blob demo
right from the Python interpreter in
terminal we can access the interpreter
by typing in Python that's it now we can
write Python directly into terminal
we'll start off by importing text blob
now let's create our first text blob
this is just a piece of text we'll call
our variable blob and assign it this
value will wrap a string using the text
blob method and our string will be Suraj
is angry he never gets good matches on
tinder now that we have our blob
variable if we want to see parts of
speech we can just access the tags
attribute if we want to tokenize this
text we can just type in the words
attribute and we can see the sentiment
of this blob easily by accessing the
sentiment dot polarity attribute that's
on a scale between negative 1 and 1
all right first things first we want to
create 4 variables that authenticating
with Twitter will require will find
these in the dashboard and we can copy
and paste each of them as strings
let's often decay twith Twitter which
basically means login via code to do
that we'll create a variable called off
for authentication and use the OAuth
handler method of tweet pi this method
takes two arguments the consumer key and
the consumer secret this method was
written inside of the tweet PI library
with a bunch of code that is hidden to
us we don't need to know the details for
our use case we can just name the method
and all of its functionality is in our
hands the arguments are what the method
uses to perform its internal calculation
whatever it is we're halfway through
authentication the other half is to call
the set access
touken method on the auth variable which
takes two arguments the access token and
the access token secret that's it we've
created our authentication variable now
we want to create our main variable from
which we'll do all of our Twitter magic
we'll call it API and assign it a value
from the tweet eye API method which
takes a single authentication argument
which we'll fill in right here now that
we have our API variable we can perform
a whole bunch of different possible
methods but what we're going to do is
search for tweets for our use case we
want to collect tweets that contain a
certain keyword so to do that let's
create a public tweets variable that is
going to store a list of tweets to fill
it we'll call the search method of the
API variable the search method takes a
single argument let's make it Trump this
method is going to retrieve a bunch of
tweets that contain the word Trump from
here we can print them all out to
terminal to do that we'll create a for
loop for tweet in public tweets : a for
loop increments through every value in a
list so the question now is what do we
want to do with each tweet ok let's
print them out each tweet has a text
attribute which is the string version of
it so we'll print tweet dot text it's
time to perform our sentiment analysis
we'll create an analysis variable that
will store our analysis and call text
blob with our tweet string as the only
argument then we can print out the
sentiment attribute of the analysis
variable we can see each tweet related
to Trump as well as its sentiment
analysis polarity measures how positive
or negative some text is and
subjectivity measures how much of an
opinion it is versus how factual so to
break it down sentiment analysis is the
process of extracting and understanding
human feelings from data an API lets you
access the server's internal
functionality like Twitter right from
your app and the text flaw Python
library lets you perform sentiment
analysis in just a few lines of code
there's a lot more we can do with our
sentiment analyzer and the challenge for
this week's video is to extend this code
to make it create a labeled CSV file
with the clean tweets of whatever topic
selected details are in the code readme
post your github link in the comments
and I'll announce the winner in next
week's video the winner for the gender
classification challenge from the last
episode is Naresh Naga Basha I
especially liked how he created a
dictionary at the end to store the
result from each of the three class
buyers then use the art max function to
print out the one with the best result
rather than doing a bunch of if-then
statements badass of the week also the
runner-up is Viktor mots a very clean
code for more info check out the links
in the description and please subscribe
for more programming videos for now I've
got a Suraj the president's on the line
you're our only hope
I've got to save the world so thanks for
