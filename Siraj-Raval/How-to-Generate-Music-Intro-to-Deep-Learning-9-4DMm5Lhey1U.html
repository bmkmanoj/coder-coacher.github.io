that Pythagoras proposed a concept
called the music of the spheres to
describe the proportional movement of
celestial bodies like the Sun Moon and
planets this music is not thought of as
being literally audible but instead a
mathematical concept math and music are
intrinsically connected the field of
algorithmic composition dates back to
the early days of computer science
translation models take an existing
non-musical medium like a picture and
translate it into a sound
these are usually rule-based so a rule
may be that if it sees a horizontal line
in an image it will interpret that as a
constant pitch whereas a vertical line
represents an ascending scale
evolutionary models are based off of
genetic algorithms through mutation and
natural selection different solutions
evolve towards a suitable composition
then there's the learning model by
providing it musical data instead of
rules we can let it learn for itself how
to create music we're fast approaching
the point where we'll no longer have to
wonder how Mozart or Jimi Hendrix would
have composed the piece on a certain
topic wouldn't be able to ask their
algorithmic counterparts ourselves hello
world it's suraj and today we're going
to use deep learning to generate some
jazz music the first attempt by anyone
to use a computer to compose music was
by two American professors at the
University of Illinois urbana-champaign
Hiller and Isaacson they program the
universities iliac computer to compose
music and it generated pitches using
random numbers before testing them
according to the rules of classical
counterpoint so if a pitch didn't fit a
piece another note was generated it also
relied on probabilities via a Markov
chain it used the past to determine the
probabilities of the future the first
piece was completed in 1957 and was
called the iliac suite for string
quartet
although it made headlines in Scientific
American the musical establishment was
pretty hostile to them they thought it
undermines human creativity and didn't
include them in their journals until
after Hiller's death nowadays there are
a ton of amazing generative programs for
composers to aid them when they compose
music like iTunes let's understand this
process by building a model to generate
jazz pieces using care of will first
examine the music we're going to train
our model on our input data is going to
be a collection of piano pieces by
American jazz musician Pat Metheny in
mid I format mid I or musical instrument
digital interface is like the digital
alphabet for music it contains a list of
messages that tell an electronic device
like a sound card how to generate a
certain sound so it doesn't store actual
sound itself which lends to a much
smaller file since these messages are a
sequence will use a recurrent network as
our sequence learning model for each
MIDI file will extract the stream of
notes for both the melody and the
harmony the harmonies chords accompany
the melodies single notes then will
group them all together by measure
number so each measure has its own
grouping of chords and this measure
chord pair is what we'll call our
abstract grammars we'll vectorize these
inputs by converting them into binary
matrices so we can feed them into our
model now we can build our model this is
going to be a double stacked LS TM
network so our computation graph will
look like this the vectorized sequence
of notes will be input into the first LF
TM cell then we'll apply dropout to help
ensure that the model generalized well
and we'll do that process one more time
then we'll feed the data to our last
fully connected layer labeled dense
since every neuron in the previous layer
is connecting to every neuron in this
layer it will mix all the learned
signals together so our prediction is
truly based on the whole input sequence
lastly transform the result with a
softmax activation function into an
output probability but what is likely
the next note in the sequence when we
build our first LS TM layer by default
it will only return the last vector
rather than the entire sequence so we
set return sequences to true so that it
returns the entire
sequence which is necessary to be able
to stack another lsdm later on using 2l
STM layers instead of one allows for a
more complex feature representation of
the input which means more
generalization ability and thus a better
prediction recall that recurrent
networks are essentially like a series
of feed-forward networks that are
connected to each other the output of
each and its hidden layer is fed into
the next one and when we back propagate
with each layer the magnitude of the
gradient gets exponentially smaller
which makes the steps also very small
which results in a very slow learning
rate of the weights in the lower layers
of a deep network this is the vanishing
gradient problem and LSP M recurring out
helps solve that by preserving the error
that can be back propagated through time
and layers let's look a little closer at
this process but first I gotta say say
it again L can't say it again when it
goes in against the beat s remembers the
good stuff and help us arrest now and I
say it again an L FTM cell consists of
three gates the input forget and output
as well as a cell state the cell state
is like a conveyor belt it just lets
memory flow across unchanged except for
a few minor linear interactions these
interactions are the gates we can add or
remove memory from the cell state
regulated by them they optionally let
memory through each is a sigmoid neural
net layer in a multiplication operation
the sigmoid outputs a value between 0
and 1 which describes how much of each
component should be led through will
represent each of the gates with the
following equations where W is the set
of weights at each gate the way its
internal memory changes is similar to
piping water through a pipe so think of
memory as water it flows into a pipe if
we want to change the memory flow this
change is controlled by two valves the
forget valves first if we shut it no old
memory will be kept if we keep it open
all old memory will pass through the
other is the new memory valve new memory
comes in through a t-shaped joint and
merges with the old memory and the
amount of new memory that comes in is
controlled by this valve the input is an
old memory and it passes through the
forget valve which is actually a
multiplication operation the O
memory hits the t-shaped joint pipe
which represents a summation operation
new and old memory merged through this
operation in total this updates the old
memory to the new memories well define
our log function as categorical cross
entropy the cross entropy between two
probability distributions measure the
average number of this needed to
identify an event from a set of
possibilities since our data is fed in
sequences this measures the difference
between the real next notes and our
predicted next note we'll minimize this
loss function using rmsprop which is an
implementation of potassium descent so
we'll predict the next note in the
sequence over and over again until we
have a sequence of generated notes we'll
translate this into mid I format and
write it to a file so we can listen to
it let's hear what this sounds like at
least it's better than Kenny G so we're
all good so to break it down we can
generate music using LS TM networks to
predict sequences of notes LS TM
consists of three days the input forgets
and output gate and we can think of
these gates as valves controlling how
memory is stored in our network to
eliminate vanishing gradients the winner
of the coding challenge from the last
video is vishal blocks you not only did
he perform multiple style transfer but
he took it a step further by applying it
to video as well wizard of the week and
the runner-up is michael toka he
successfully performed multi style
transfer through a clever matrix
operation the coding challenge for this
video is to generate a music clip for a
genre that you choose remember it's just
a sequence of MIDI messages posts are
available in the comments and I'll
announce the winner next video please

I've got to memorize memory cells so
