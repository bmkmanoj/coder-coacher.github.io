upgrade the entire Internet I'm going to
explain how the interplanetary file
system or IP FS works we'll also use it
to build a simple video streaming web
app onwards towards the permanent web
the web is the backbone of our
civilization so much of our economy our
mission critical systems our most basic
communication channels depend on it to
function the orchestra of apps that give
us such amazing capabilities today are
only possible because we built the
necessary infrastructure to support them
what we call the web is just a
collection of protocols these are sets
of rules ideas on how to best transmit
data that have won over the hearts of
developers and then made standard by
browser adoption and tool dependency
anyone can write a protocol and the
existing ones were written by people
aiming to solve small problems for
themselves and in the process ended up
being adopted by everybody else because
they worked really well there's one
protocol in particular however that is
in need of a serious upgrade HTTP
developed by Tim berners-lee
we use HTTP to access most of the web it
delivers virtually all file types and is
considered a client-server protocol a
client you on your laptop with the
browser for example can send a request
message to a server say amazon.com and
the server will then return a response
message like a home page it worked well
enough but we're starting to see some
real problems with HTTP the first
problem is bandwidth more and more of
the world is coming online fast and that
means more people are demanding more
data web sites crash all the time
because too many people are trying to
access them at the same time imagine
this scenario let's say I'm sitting in a
classroom with some other students we're
studying sex robots I want to share a
useful picture with them so I upload it
to Facebook then give them all the link
so they can fetch the image assuming
there are say eight links and the total
bandwidth required for my upload is 8
megabytes then when 30 students request
that image now that's 240 megabytes of
bandwidth usage if I uploaded a video
and that took 200 Meg's of bandwidth
when all the other people watch it it'll
take 48 gigs of bandwidth this is a
horribly inefficient routing scheme
since they are so physically close to me
and it's getting to the point where
providing this amount of bandwidth is no
longer profitable for companies if we
look at how much bandwidth has improved
over the past few years it's not very
significant compare that to how fast our
storage space is decreasing in cost and
it's clear that we are fast saturating
these pipes so the web will start to
feel slower which leads to the second
problem latency unfortunately we can't
get around the speed of light it's a
constant could we just do an IC o----
know what so the only way to make data
transfer faster is to move the data
closer to you which is why some cloud
services offer storage locations by
region still if I need a file and it
just so happens to be on a device one
meter away from me having my device make
a request through the backbone of the
web to some nearby city isn't nearly as
fast as just pulling it from that device
directly the third problem is resiliency
of connectivity if your ISP has an
outage and your towns connection to the
global internet goes down you're out of
luck
there's nothing you can do about that in
terms of data permanence
if Wikipedia was hacked and all its data
deleted we'd lose that knowledge forever
it'd be akin to book burnings when only
a few copies of certain books were
available but it doesn't even have to be
that drastic an event does this error
look familiar to you you've likely seen
a 404 before which signifies that some
content has been deleted or moved HTTP
links get broken all the time
it's like mini book burning all the time
if data is it manually copied by someone
that data is gone forever the last
problem is centralization because data
has become so centralized a few services
own most of our data and we have no say
in how that data is used this is
unimaginable power these services can
manipulate large swaths of the populace
with a few clicks and access to them can
be easily blocked by governments and
other oppressive forces like what
happened during the Arab Spring or
during the pro-democracy protests in
Hong Kong in 2014 we have got to upgrade
the internet it's too important not to
ipfs was designed to help fix these
problems and help us move towards the
permanent web a web where links never
die and no entity controls your data
while the HTTP web is IP addressed the
ipfs web is content addressed when
requesting data from a Content address
you'll receive it faster since it'll
route from whoever owns a copy of that
content address closest to you
this helps make bandwidth usage much
more efficient when you upload a file to
ipfs you get back it's immutable hash
each file in the network is identified
by its content using this hash the hash
is cryptographically guaranteed to
represent only that file anyone can
provide storage for ipfs data these
storage providers are incentivized with
a crypto token and data is replicated
and chunked across all of them by the
network to maintain data permanence to
achieve this IP
combines several great ideas from
computer science in the past few years
first to store data it uses a
distributed hash table similar to one
proposed at MIT called cord a DHT is a
dictionary like interface to data that
is stored on nodes that are distributed
across the network the node that gets to
store a particular key is found by
hashing that key so in effect the hash
table buckets are now independent nodes
in a network data is exchanged between
these nodes using a mechanism called bit
swamp inspired by the popular BitTorrent
protocol that de facto a way to transfer
large data sets across the web a user
can discover nearby peers to share data
with then when requesting a file they
can download many small bits of it for
many different peers all at once
this format compensates for bottleneck
points which makes it much faster than
downloading a large file from a single
source to give structure to the DHT and
let users find the data they need when
they need it
i PFS uses a data structure called a
merkel dag inspired by the git protocol
dydt uses a merkel DAC to enable
distributed version control for source
code and ipfs uses it to give structure
to the entire network it's simple and
flexible we can conceptualize it as a
series of nodes connect it together in
the form of a directed acyclic graph it
can look like a singly linked list or a
tree so whenever data is added to the
DHT the system generates a
public/private key pair and the user
gets both alright let's get our hands
dirty with ipfs we'll first install the
IP FS client on our machines there's a
tarball available for mac and linux and
an exe for installation for Windows once
I've downloaded it I can untie it and
move the IP FS binary to somewhere in my
executables
so I can just run it directly from
terminal like so it's installed we can
now initialize ipfs from terminal and it
will create our node generate an
identity for us and allow us to read
files on the network if I read an
address I can see the text I just
retrieved in terminal to go online we'll
run the daemon in another
we can now discover our peers in the
network by their pure identities we can
read files directly from these peers and
there's even a fancy web console for us
to be able to see where all the peers
are in the world
we can use this UI to manage our
instance let's say we want to upload a
video that we have locally we can use
the IP FS add command to add that video
to the network and use the resulting
hash we get as its identity then in
terminal we can view it directly or we
can watch it via a local gateway in the
browser let's say we have a simple
static web app that lets users upload
video and view it it's just a simple
HTML web page with some assets we can
add the whole directory containing our
web app to ipfs directly the very last
hash next to the folder name is the one
we want it's the highest level hash of
the merkel dag we've just created we
could create a simple DNS text record
and then view our site locally or at the
online HTTP to ipfs gateway at IPF SEO
it's called interplanetary because if
and when we do become an interplanetary
species it's much more efficient to use
a web that finds the data you need
that's closest to you not light-years
away the three closing points are the
HTTP web is a few decades old now and
has become slow impermanent and
centralized ipfs is a newer protocol
that aims to create a permanent web
where links are content not IP addressed
and it uses a distributed hash table to
store data a merkel deck to give it
structure and a BitTorrent like data
exchange mechanism to maximize bandwidth
last week's coding challenge winner is
two chars Tony open my needed to be able
to compute operations on a tensor of
arbitrary type so Tashard demonstrated
how to do this programmatically such an
epic PR great job and the runner-up is
Rohan Sawat who implemented some
much-needed and awesome styling updates
to open lines documentation this week's
coding challenge is to create your own
simple web app using IP FS poster github
link in the comments because I'm
announcing the top two entries next
