it works so well why does it work so
well the answer is because it uses a
technique called back propagation and in
this video I'm going to demo a newer
strategy that optimizes neural networks
that is better than that propagation and
it's called synthetic gradients this
technique was released by deep mind a
few months ago and it just hasn't had
enough attention paid to it this is what
happens in research a lot right some
great ideas don't get enough attention
to pay pay to them so then some youtuber
like me has to make a video about them
so what we're gonna do is we're going to
take the simple feed-forward neural
network it's a simple neural network
that learns to predict the output of
adding two binary numbers together and
first we're gonna train it using back
propagation and so I'm gonna go over
back propagation and then I'm going to
change the code so instead it uses
synthetic gradients so this gif that
you're looking at right here is an
example of the synthetic gradient
strategy the idea behind synthetic
gradients is rather than waiting for
your neural network to go through a full
forward and backward pass you can just
update each layer without having to wait
for that using what's called a synthetic
gradient these are gradients that are
not the real gradient the true gradient
but instead an approximation of what
that gradient would be so it's a
synthetic gradient and by doing this we
can update each layer without having to
wait for all the other layers to update
it's a faster way to optimize neural
networks and it allows us to decouple
each layer from having to wait for all
the other layers so let's start off by
talking about how neural networks learn
in a black box approach the neural
network gets an input that's the input
data and some desired output right so
it's got an input in a desired output
and it uses that to update its internal
state accordingly right we have some
desired output those are our labels
right all of all of that propagation
centers around having some labels for
our data we've got to have the labels if
you don't
the labels you got to get the labels
right and so if we have our labels we
can train our model and so once we've
trained it then we can perform
prediction and the prediction process is
using just the input and the internal
state to generate the most likely output
according to its past training
experiences so we have some input
training data we feed it to this
learning system which is a neural
network and it Purdue and it predicts an
output we then compare that predicted
output to the actual output and we
compute some error value we use that
error to then update the learning system
so then every time it gets better and
better that's just a training process
and that updating process is that
propagation so in a more detailed sense
we have some neural network right we've
got an input layer we've got a hidden
layer and we have an output layer and
Egypt so each of these are layers right
these three circles are a layer these
three circles are a layer these last two
circles are a layer and each of these
circles represents a number because we
are inputting let's just say three
integers right a 1 1 and a 0 that's the
input and the reason that there are
these black lines is because we are
multiplying the input we are multiplying
the layer by the next layer so we are
multiplying this one value by all of
these other values in the next layer
because a neural network is input times
weight add a bias and then apply a
non-linearity to it so that's what we
just keep doing for a neural network we
take our input data we multiply it by a
weight matrix which is the next layer we
add some bias value and then we apply a
non-linearity to it which is a sigmoid
function or there are there are plenty
of nonlinearities that we can apply and
this is the this is the this is called
forward propagation this is how we take
some input data and we just apply a
series of operations to that input data
until we get an output prediction that
we denote here as Y hat and so that is
the whole forward propagation process a
neural network is just a series of
operations that are applied to some
input data right that's it input times
weight add a bias activate repeat that
process
over and over and over again until we
get that output prediction and once we
have that output prediction we could
compare it to the actual output right
and so in a very very basic case we can
just subtract the actual output from the
predicted output and that difference is
the error right we what we want is that
error to be zero we don't want there to
be any difference we want our predicted
output to be the exact same as our
actual output but as long as there is an
error we want to minimize it so it gets
smaller and smaller over time that is
the training process and so how do we
minimize that error
well once we compute the error we can
compute what's called the partial
derivative with respect to each layer
going backwards right so we compute the
partial derivative of the error with
respect to the weights for the previous
layer and what that's gonna do is that's
going to give us a gradient value then
we take that gradient and we compute the
partial derivative of that gradient with
respect to the weights of the next layer
or the layer before that and we get
another gradient and then we take that
gradient and we compute the partial
derivative of the gradient with respect
to the layer before that and so we just
keep doing that and so if we keep doing
that we get great values for every
single layer and then once we've done
that for every single layer then we
could use those gradients to update the
weights of each layer so you might be
asking what is a gradient a gradient is
a direction it's a direction on how to
update our weights and it comes from
calculus calculus is a study of how
things change that's why it's used in
physics right
how do planetary bodies move over time
how do the weight matrices of a neural
network change as we are trying to
minimize an error the gradient the
gradient is a value it's a value with a
direction and what I mean by Direction
is if we were to if we were to graph all
the possible weight values that we could
have for a single layer
versus all the possible error values
that we could have for that same layer
it would look like a parabola and what
the gradient is is it is this it is it
is it is synonymous with the partial
derivative and the partial derivative or
the derivative is the slope of the
tangent line to a curve at a specific
right so that's what the gradient gives
us it gives us that slope of a tangent
line it's anonymous and the direction
that that slope is is pointing tells us
what direction we need to move such that
we can get to this point where the error
is the smallest that is the minimum of
the parabola and once we get to that
point then we know immediately what the
ideal weight value should be so the
error is smallest and we do this for
every single layer right we compute this
gradient value for every single layer
and the training process process is us
generally it is us gradually decreasing
the point that we are at for each weight
matrix until we are at this point where
the error is smallest and all the weight
values of that weight matrix are equal
to when the error is smallest and that
is when we are finished training that is
the optimization process and because we
are descending the parabola
it's called gradient descent so great
descent is a very popular optimization
strategy it's used in neural networks
it's used all over the place but in the
context of neural networks we call it
back propagation because we are back
propagating an error gradient across
each layer recursively so every layer
depends on us having computed the
gradient for every single layer before
that right so every layer is coupled
it's dependent on us having computed the
gradients for every single layer that
happened for every single layer after
that so what this looks like in code is
if we were to look at this in numpy is
if we were to look at this in Python
what I've got here is a function called
generate data set what this function is
gonna do is it generates a bunch of
binary numbers right like 1 0 0 1 and
then 1 1 1 0 it's also going to return
the outputs and those outputs are the
sums of those binary numbers so if we
take two binary numbers like 1 0 0 1 0
and then we add another binary number
like 1 0 0 1 it's gonna have some some
value that is also a binary number like
1 0 0 1 the input for our neural network
are going to be these two binary numbers
concatenated together so there are one
big
number and the predict and the actual
output will be the sum of those two
binary numbers so we already know what
the sum is going to be right we've we've
already computed it in this function but
what our neural networks job is is to
learn what that output would be so that
even if we don't have that output we can
predict what the output would be so it's
making a prediction by updating its
weights and going through this back
propagation process without even having
to add the numbers together
it's just able to predict what the
output would be so what we have here are
this the sigmoid is the non-linearity
and the reason we apply a non-linearity
to neural networks is because neural
networks are universal function
approximate errs they can compute any
function whether it's linear like a like
a straight line or nonlinear like a very
curvy line like a parabola they can they
can they can approximate any function
and that's why we use a non-linearity so
they can approximate both linear and
nonlinear functions this is the this
function helps us compute the partial
derivative with respect to each weight
going backwards right so it's the it's
the derivative of the sigmoid function
and that's what's going to help us
compute back propagation so this class
is a is a layer class each layer is
initialized by its input dimensions and
its output dimensions which are the the
dimensions of the numbers going into it
and out of it it's got a non-linearity
which is our sigmoid and it's got a
non-linearity derivative which helps us
compute the gradient value so each layer
is initialized as a weight matrix of
some size that we define here it's also
got a non-linearity and a non-linearity
derivative right that's how we
initialize a layer it's a glorified
weight matrix then we've got a forward
and backward a forward and backward
function the forward function takes the
input it's given and it takes it takes
the input multiplies it by the weight
multiply meaning the dot product right
when we multiply two matrices together
it's considered the dot product that's
why we use that's why it's considered
linear algebra and not regular algebra
the dot products comes from linear
algebra linear algebra tells us how to
multiply
groups of numbers together rather than
just single integers which is what
algebra helps us do that's what we use
linear algebra in deep learning so we do
the input times the weight and we apply
an activation or a non-linearity to it
input times weight add a bias we're not
having a bias right now for this simple
example and then activate right and
that's going to give us our output so we
repeatedly apply this forward this
forward function and that's going to
compute our forward propagation and then
for the backward step the Delta is the
gradient value for the backward step we
take the partial derivative of the
output value which is the predicted
output and we multiply it by the
gradient right and that's going to give
us the the the gradient value for that
weight and then we return that and then
one more function which is the update
function which says okay you've got your
Delta or your gradient value multiply it
by the input and that's gonna and then
and subtract it from our weight values
and multiply that by an alpha value
which is the learning rate and that's
going to give us the updated weight
after we computed our backward
propagation process okay so we start off
by saying we don't want this we want
this to be a deterministic algorithm so
it's gonna compute the same results
every time which is useful for debugging
we've got our number of examples or
output dimensions how many times do we
want to train a thousand and then we
generate our data set right using the
function we define earlier for x and y
then we say okay we've got our three
layers and we define them as such right
we have our dimensions for the size of
each we have our non-linearity and we
have our non-linearity derivative those
are our three layers then for our
training process we're gonna say okay
here are our batches of our x and y our
training data and our our training input
data and our output data as well right
the two binary numbers concatenated
together would be a batch or a set of
our training data and the Y would be the
expected output right so what we do is
we forward propagate taking that first
input data as the input to get the
output value and then we forward it
forward propagate that output as the
input
the next layer and that's gonna give us
the output for that layer and then we
take the puppet for that layer and we
feed it as the input for the next layer
that's forward propagation and so now we
have this output prediction we subtract
it from the expect expected outputs and
that's going to give us the error value
and we use that error value to then as
an input to the backward propagation for
the layer before that to give us the
gradients values right the Delta the
change and it's using the partial
derivative with respect to the weights
for the previous layer to compute the
gradient and we do that recursively
every time and once we have all of those
gradients then we can update every
single layer and then we are done with
that and so if I compile this notice how
the loss decreases every time and as the
number of iterations increased the loss
is slowly and slowly and slowly getting
smaller and smaller okay so that is the
back propagation process so okay so now
let's talk about the problem with back
propagation so back propagation is how
all of supervised deep-learning works
the majority of deep learning when we
have labels for our data but there is a
problem here so check this out this is
an example of that propagation right
here a very simple example of a three
layer neural network so a layer can only
be updated after a full forward and a
backward pass has been made so after
layer the first layer has processed an
input it updates after the output
activations these black lines right here
have been propagated through the rest of
the network generate a loss and the
error gradients these green lines have
back propagated through every single
layer and what this means is that layer
1 must wait for a full forward and
backward pass of every single layer that
comes after that so layer 1 is locked
it's coupled to the rest of the network
so for this simple example right here or
the one that I just demoed
programmatically it's not a big deal but
when we get to more complex neural
networks that's where things start to
get hairy right
for example the inception network it's a
huge convolutional network with 19
layers or the differentiable neural
computer with its separate memory unit
or you have the neural
machine or you've got bi-directional
recurrent networks just insanely
complicated neural networks with all
sorts of moving parts when we get to
more complex systems the time it takes
to have to wait for the gradient to be
back propagated through every layer is
inefficient ideally we don't have to
wait right so over a big distributed
network over multiple machines this
could take a very long time having to
wait for every layer so if we decouple
every layer the connections between them
so they can update independently without
having to wait for the other layers to
update that would be more efficient
right and so that's the idea behind
synthetic gradients right so normally a
neural network compares its predictions
with data set to decide how to update
its weights right it uses back
propagation to figure out how each
weight should move in order to make a
prediction but with synthetic gradients
individual layers make a best guess an
approximation of what the gradient would
be it's not the actual gradient it's a
synthetic gradient a fake gradient a
predicted gradient and so this best
guess that each layer will make in this
synthetic radiant model is called the
synthetic gradient and the data is only
used to help update each layers
Gesser so how are these synthetic
gradients generated I'm gonna talk about
that in a second but what this does the
system of approximating gradients at
every layer it allows individual layers
to learn in isolation without having to
wait for the other layers which
increases the speed of training so this
is kind of what it looks like right here
so we have some input right we have some
input data we apply it to the first
layer so input times weight add a bias
activate and then we send the output to
the next layer then rather than waiting
for that for that data to forward
propagate through every single layer
compute the error and then backward
propagate the gradients again again and
again until we get that gradient and
having to wait for that full forward and
backward pass before we can update it we
just take the input apply we just take
the input
time's wait a Tobias activate send it
out and then we use what's called this
synthetic gradient generator to
immediately update the weights for that
network so we take an input compute an
output and then update it without having
to wait for full forward and backward
pass and we do that for every single
layer so you might be wondering okay how
is this possible right this give how how
are you able to generate a synthetic
gradient without having how are you able
to do that well the answer the answer is
the synthetic gradient generator is in
fact another neural network
it's another neural network it's a very
very simple single layer network right
they deepmind found that even when they
use a single layer linear layer as a
neural network for the generator it
still works really well right so it
doesn't have to be some complex neural
network but basically the synthetic
gradient generator is a very simple
neural network that's trained to take
the output of a layer and predict what
the gradient would be the likely
gradient at that layer it's simply a
neural network that predicts what the
gradient would be when we perform a full
forward and backward pass then we get
the correct gradient we can compare this
to our synthetic gradient so we can
train our synthetic gradient networks by
pretending that our true gradients are
coming from this mythical data set so if
we look at this image right here notice
how the gradient for M I plus two back
propagates through F 1 plus F I plus 1
and into m i+ my plus 1 so each
synthetic gradient generator is actually
only trained using the synthetic
gradients generated from the next layer
so for every layer it doesn't depend on
every single layer before that right
because that propagation is a recursive
process rather than having to wait for
the gradient to be computed for every
single layer it's only taking the it's
only taking the computed gradient from
the next layer every layer only depends
on the next layer that's it
so the the synthetic gradient generator
is a neural network and it it generate
a synthetic gradient and it compares
that synthetic gradient to the actual
gradient and actual gradient is a
gradient that's computed from the next
layer and it computes an error value
using that and then it updates its
weights using that and it's and it sends
the synthetically generated gradient to
that layer and that's what updates the
layer so every single layer is using the
synthetic gradient generator to update
its weights only the last layer Jen
updates its weights using the true
gradient value because there is no next
gradient it's using the true output
label to compute its gradient and so
what's happening is because every layer
is dependent on the next layer
just-just-just on the next layer to
compute its synthetic gradient the what
happens is it doesn't magically allow
for a neural network to Train without
having that the true grain back
propagated the true gradient is indeed
still percolating backwards
it's just slower do you see what I'm
saying so the the true gradient is
slowly percolating backwards not like
the real gradient every time right
because only the last layer is computing
the output using the true label of the
data but every other layer only uses the
only updates its weights using the its
own its own respective synthetic
gradient generator which uses the
gradient from the next layer as its as
its true gradient versus its synthetic
radians right so the true gradient is
slowly propagated backwards
however because we're using the
synthetic gradient model to approximate
and smooth over the absence of true
gradients it's faster and so they they
found that this could be applied to any
type of neural network architecture not
just feed-forward networks recurrent
networks it's an awesome strategy I
would like to see more of it integrated
into major deep learning libraries and
it allows for the training of
distributed networks to be faster and
cleaner so what I want to do is I want
to update our code so that it's now
using the synthetic grade model rather
than the back propagation model I'll
name this class the decoupled neural
interface instead of a lay
okay and so I'm gonna say so this stuff
stays the same as before this doesn't
change at all these weights the
non-linearity and the non-linearity
derivative they don't change but what
changes is this we have some new stuff
here we have some new stuff and that's
gonna be the weights of the synthetic
gradient generator which we can
initialize randomly just like we would
for any weight matrix for a regular
neural network and it's gonna be
generated using this output dimension
size just like that just like that and
we have it's it's gonna have its own
learning rate right so this is the
synthetic gradient generator which is
its own neural network so now we want to
update this forward propagation step
right so to update this forward
propagation step here's what its gonna
look like when I update it for synthetic
gradients okay
so this used to be just the forward set
but now we can update during the forward
pass using synthetic gradients so we
have some cash input we forward
propagate that input and then we
generate a synthetic gradient via simple
linear transformation right so we use
that weight matrix to compute the dot
product with the output and then we get
our synthetic gradient right input times
weight matrix no bias then we can update
our regular weights using the synthetic
gradient so we take the partial
derivative of the output times a
synthetic gradient and that's going to
give us the weight update that we can
apply to our real weights for that layer
it's called weight synthetic gradient
and the way we apply it is by
multiplying the input times the
transpose of the transpose of the dot
product of that synthetic gradient
synthetic gradient multiplied by a
learning rate and that's how we update
the weights for that layer and finally
we can return the back propagated
synthetic gradient and the forward
propagated output so we're returning the
back propagated synthetic gradient and
we are returning the forward propagated
output at the same time right so each
layer gets an input it for propagates
that input and at the same time it's up
with a synthetic gradient value which is
very cool and so in this case we don't
even need this backwards step so we're
gonna replace the both of backward in
the update step with this new update
synthetic weights method where we this
is just like the update method from
before except it operates on the
synthetic weights right so we are
updating the synthetic gradient
generators weights that separate neural
network
we've already updated our real layers
weights now we want to update the
synthetic gradient ways right so what we
do is we say we take the synthetic
gradient minus the true gradient which
is the gradient from the next layer and
we use that to compute the Delta the
change and then we use that Delta to
update the weights of our synthetic
gradient generator so then what is the
difference here well the difference now
is instead of using each the layer class
to define these layers will use the
decoupled neural interface class well we
have our input dimensions as for the
size of the input the sigmoid and this
the the activation function and then the
derivative and then the learning rate
and that's how we define every single
layer generating our batches say this
stays the same but the forward and the
backward pass are changed entirely
rather than it being a separate forward
and a backward pass we have instead a
forward and synthetic update pass and
then we can update the synthetic
gradient generators after that so let me
just move this out of the way right so
we have for every layer we're doing our
where for propagating the input data
from that layer and at the same time we
are updating its weights using the
synthetic radians when we do that for
every single layer okay and so then once
we have that we want to update the
synthetic gradient generators weights so
we we say okay we know what the real
output is going to be so this layer 3
Delta is the true gray and we only
compute that for the last layer every
other layer is updated using its
synthetic gradient generator its
respective synthetic gradient generator
and then and only then do we
update so that's the only the last layer
is is normally updated it doesn't have
its own synthetic gradient generator but
every other layer does and so we use
that gradient to then update the
synthetic weights for each of the
generators backwards right and so that's
going to and so right and so that's how
synthetic gradients work in a nutshell
and I think it's a really cool idea I'd
like to see more people looking at it
I'd like to see more of it applied in
deep learning tensor flow all the major
libraries should should have synthetic
gradients as a valid optimization scheme
and I think we're gonna see more of that
