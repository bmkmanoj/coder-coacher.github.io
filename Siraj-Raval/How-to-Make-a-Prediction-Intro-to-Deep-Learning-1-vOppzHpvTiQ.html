intro to deep learning and this first
episode will predict an animal body
weight even only the weight of its brain
this course will be four months long and
it'll all be released on my channel I'll
have a live session every Wednesday at
10 a.m. PST that explains every week's
topic in depth and I'm collaborating
with Udacity to offer a nano degree to
those that successfully complete this
course this course is for anyone who
wants to learn how to harness the
incredible power of neural networks and
become a deep learning engineer you
don't have to be an experienced
developer or a mathematician the only
prerequisite for this course is knowing
quantum mechanics just kidding only
basic Python syntax we'll learn what we
need to along the way by building an AI
that can do everything from predicting
the price of Tesla stocks the painting
surrealist masterpieces traditionally
programming has been about defining
every single step for a program to reach
an outcome a machine wani flips that
approach with machine learning we define
the outcome and the program learns the
steps to get there so if I wanted to
build an app that can recognize
California license plates instead of
writing out Coast you recognize the
hundreds of different features of a
license plate like the shape of certain
letters and the colors we just say here
are some examples of a California
license plate learn the steps you need
so that you can recognize it or if I
wanted to make a bot that could beat
Super Mario instead of writing code for
every possible scenario like jump if you
see a Koopa and it's running towards you
we say the goal is to get to the end
point without dying learn the steps to
get there and sometimes we don't even
have an idea what steps could possibly
be like if we're a bank and we suspect
there's some kind of fraudulent activity
happening but we're not sure exactly how
to detect that or even know what to look
for we can say here is a log of all user
activity find the users that are unlike
the rest and it'll learn the steps to
detect the anomalies by itself machine
learning is already everywhere on the
Internet every major service uses it in
some way in fact YouTube using it right
now to decide which other videos you
might like as you watch this and its
uses will only grow over time it will be
embedded in all of our internet
connected devices everything bridges to
cars through personal assistance will be
learning and adapting to our needs and
you know that rule that says you need
10,000 hours to
master any skill well we'll just be able
to offload that training time to our
machine and it will give us superpowers
instantly anyone will be able to compose
a symphony Alexa I feel melancholy make
me a piano piece for this and add a beat
to it yeah anyone will be able to direct
a movie ok google' we create star wars
but put me in it hi doctor eyes most of
my code now my heart damn right with
machine money if you can clean it it can
exist and the field is currently
advancing very fast as researchers build
on each other's work my neural net sucks
go deeper wow I just achieved state of
the art there are a lot of machine
running models out there and one of them
is called a neural network when we use a
neural network that's not just one or
two but many layers deep to make a
prediction we call that deep learning
it's a subset of machine learning that
has outperformed almost every other type
of model almost every time on a huge
range of tasks will dive into deep
learning more in next episode but this
video will just focus on machine
learning in general we usually class
learning into three different styles the
first style is called supervised
learning it's where we give and model a
label dataset like car pictures so get
feedback on what's correct and what's
not it just has to learn the mapping
between the label and the data and then
it can solve some given tasks like
classifying the type of car in an image
it's all relatively straightforward and
we've gotten incredible results from it
the second learning style is called
unsupervised learning this is when we
give a model a data set without labels
it gets no feedback on what's correct or
not it has to learn by itself what the
structure of the data is to solve some
give intact this is harder to do but
more convenient since not everyone have
a perfectly labeled data set sitting
around most data is unlabeled it's messy
and complex and the third type is
reinforcement learning this is where a
model isn't giving feedback right off
the bat it only gets if it achieves its
goal so it will try to create a
reinforcement learning bot that can
learn to be humans at chess
it would only repeat feedback if it won
the game whereas in the supervisor
approach we get feedback every move and
in the unsupervised approach we never
get feedback even if it won unlike the
other two learning styles reinforcement
learning is linked to the idea of
interacting with an environment through
trial and error
I've got a data set of measurements of
different animals and we want to predict
an animal body weight given its brain
weight since our data is labeled this
will be a supervised approach and the
type of machine learning task we'll
perform is called regression we'll write
out a ten line Python script to do this
and I'll explain things as we go we'll
start off by importing our three
dependencies
the first one is pandas which will let
us read our data set the second one is
scikit-learn which is the machine
learning library we're using for this
example and the third is map pot live
which will let us visualize our model
and data now that we've imported our
dependencies we can read our data set
using pandas we'll use the read FWS
function to read our animal data set a
table of fix with formatted lines into a
panda's data frame object which is a 2d
data structure of rows and columns our
data set contains the average brain and
body weight for a number of animal
species once our data is in our data
frame variable we can easily part and
read both measurements into two separate
variable we'll sort our brain
measurements in the X values variable
and the body measurements in the Y
values variable so if we were to plot
this data right now on a standard 2d
graph it would look like this and our
goal is that given a new animal's body
weight we'll be able to predict what its
brain sizes so how are we going to do
that yeah uh huh you know what it is
independent and dependent independent
and dependent got some values for the
brain and the body weight and I'm
wondering what say you - fine - play
relay linear regress helps find the
relationship we're going to measure it
and find the only line of best fit the
equation y equals MX plus B is all we
need the the y-intercept and M measures
how steep plotted on the graph let's
predict the body with the brain's low
air pop champagne when you touch it
learns linear model object to initialize
our linear regression and store it in
the body regression variable then we can
fit our model on our XY value pairs now
that we have the line of best fit we can
plot our XY value pairs on a map hot
line scatter plot then plot our
regression line by saying for every x
value we have predict the Associated Y
value and draw a line that intersects
all those points we can then display it
using the shell function let's go ahead
and compile this code in terminal our
scatter plot will appear with all our
data points mapped out the x axis
represents brain weights and the y axis
represents body weights our
gresham line seems to fit most of the
data pretty well and there seems to be a
very strong correlation here between
brain weight and body weight and as we
move along the line given any brain
weight we can also predict The
Associated body weight so to break it
down while traditional programming is
about defining the steps to reach an
outcome machine learning is about
defining the outcome and our program
will learn the steps to get there there
are three different learning styles
supervised unsupervised and
reinforcement learning and linear
regression models the relationship
between an independent and dependent
variable to create the line of best fit
which we can then use to make
predictions the winner of last week's
coding challenge is mixed and hope he
modified the game world to be more
complex and his Q learning bot was much
more efficient at reaching the goal than
my demo box Wizard of the week and the
runner-up is Vishal Bhatt you can
generated maps using cellular automata
the challenge for this video is to use I
can't learn to create a regression line
for a different data set that I'll
provide and print out the error between
your prediction and the actual value
details are in the readme poster get
help link in the comment and I'll
announce the winner in one week please

I've got to fail to learn so thanks for
