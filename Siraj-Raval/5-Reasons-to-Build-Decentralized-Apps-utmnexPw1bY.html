five reasons to build decentralized apps
decentralized apps are apps that are
peer-to-peer no central server
whatsoever the users connect to each
other directly the first reason is that
you would own your data the web has
become totally centralized that means a
handful of apps home all of our data all
of our texts and images and videos take
one set for example once app was
acquired by Facebook for twenty two
billion dollars when it only had 35
engineers 35 days own 500 million users
data Facebook didn't buy the 35 in years
if not the 500 million users data that
they no you profited from profit at
those 500 million users should have got
a little share of but didn't in a
decentralized that you would maintain
ownership of your data people would pay
Jenner for data instead of one group
profiting off of all of it your data is
your most valuable asset in the new data
economy when robots begin to replace all
labor based jobs which are half of all
current jobs the value that you provide
to people that no robot can ever take
from you is your data your five senses
your unique perception of the world that
you output with tweets and pictures and
videos you should be paid for it with
decentralized apps you could be because
you would own it we can use
cryptocurrency to pay people for their
data or pity over hosting our own dinner
it would create a new economy where
everyone is earning money online
everyone every day just like being on
the internet by participating you are
contributing to the data economy the
second reason is increased data
reliability in a centralized map all
data is stored on a central server if
that central server gets shut down for
any reason that data is lost forever so
if you uploaded a really precious photo
there Dropbox and Dropbox got hacked
which is happened before I thought it
was gone the link to it is broken
forever it's just not sustainable
centralized absence there's no central
point of failure you can choose to
either Sawyer Davis truly yourself or
have your data replicated across many
different clients it moves us towards a
permanent web of web where links never
die stupid for our boards the third
reason is faster data transfer or moving
into a new era of data transfer soon
we're going to be sending huge files
across soil I'm talking petabytes
tenuous absolutely allow you to retrieve
data from one central server which can
take forever to download or stream
especially if it's across the world you
know to centralize that if you want a
little website is that for your computer
requesting it from a server across the
world you don't find the nearest copy
may be that random dudes sitting next to
you in chemistry has it on his laptop
and your computer would trade it from
there directly and if mobile people have
copies of it your computer would request
it from all of them at the same time the
more peers
the faster the download videos would
load so much faster you can download
games ten times faster
it's just better in every way the fourth
reason is that it couldn't be shut down
centralization means governance can
block a website for reaching users in
its country for whatever reason the
Chinese government has easily blocked
Facebook from its citizens that's 20% of
the global population and recently the
Egyptian government easily shut off the
internet to stop people from protesting
isn't that crazy
and if data center goes down or an ISP
has an outage you're out of luck a
decentralized that could never be shut
down by anyone even if a government
shuts down internet access during
protests people can still communicate
with each other offline in their local
area networks by connecting to each
other directly the fifth reason is it's
the Wild West of software we've barely
begun to unlock the potential of
decentralized technologies like
BitTorrent
the first people to make successful
decentralized apps will be remembered
for many years and you provide a huge
amount of value to the world if you like
