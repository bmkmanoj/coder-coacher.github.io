visualize some data shall we
there was a recent lab study where a
group of scientists strapped some
participants with a fitness tracking
device then ask them to do a bunch of
exercises while recording some physical
measurements and I've got that data set
will visualize it in a 2d graph so we
can make some discoveries from it we
live in a three-dimensional world so we
can understand things in one dimension
two dimensions and three dimensions
pretty easily but data can be complex AF
sometimes data demands that we try to
reason in hundreds or even thousands of
dimensions at some fundamental level our
puny biological brains just can't do
that
so we've invented machine learning to
help us learn patterns in our data that
we can't recognize ourselves take
alphago for example because he could
reason about so many possibilities at
once it made moves that seemed strange
at first to the world champion it played
against but then it ended up beating him
by doing that or IBM's Watson it
consistently diagnosed cancer better
than the best doctors because it was
able to analyze millions of cancer
research papers at once and match a
patient's genetic profile to what it had
learned and there are so many things
that ml hasn't yet been applied to so
opportunity is right and if chump turns
off the satellites California will
launch his own damn satellite we're
going to collect that data our exercise
data is kind of complex as well but
we're going to figure out how to
visualize it so that we can understand
it so let's take a look at this data
each row represents a different person
and each column is one of many physical
measurements like the position of their
arm or forearm and each person gets one
of five class labels like sitting or
standing that represents the activity
they've done so there's a lot going on
here but you'll notice that some of
these cells have empty values so the
first thing we'll want to do is clean
our data by removing them
let's first import pandas which is our
data analysis library that will help us
read our CSV file then we'll import
numpy to help us transform our data into
a format our model can understand
scikit-learn will help us create our
machine learning model and map plot live
will eventually help us visualize our
data now that we've imported our
dependencies we can use pandas read CSV
function
download that exercise data set directly
from the web and store it in the data
frame all variable and we'll also create
a variable to store the number of rows
in the data by calling the shape
function on the 0th column to get the
count of rows well call D is null
function then the sum function to get
the total sum of the null or empty
columns in our data set then we'll
create another variable to count the
number of non empty columns in our data
set using the previous variable as a
parameter now we can remove the columns
with missing elements by only using the
non empty columns also if we look at our
data the first 7 columns don't have
information we can use to differentiate
between our classes so let's remove them
as well using the i-x function which
asks for the index of columns we want to
delete well specify from the start up to
column 7 we're going to take this clean
data and transform it into a set of
vectors which we can then feed to our
learning algorithm vector is a set of
numbers and it's how we represent data
in machine learning we'll create vectors
to represent the features for each
person in our data let's grab all of our
features from our data and store them in
a variable we call X then we want to
standardize those features using the
standard scaler object of psyche alert
in math terms this means shifting the
distribution of each feature to have a
mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1
which is a way of saying make all the
features operate on the same scale so
they are all in proportion to one
another this will improve the quality of
our results will store the resulting 70
dimensional feature vectors in the xtd
variable since 70 is the number of
features we have having sitting here
trying to understand this data set each
features that dimension and I know that
correct
if each feature equals one dimension
that ain't no sweat check in heartbeat
that's easy if it goes up then there's a
threat but behold once I had time and it
goes up and down when I add temperature
we can move it all around but weight and
height and strength and a hundred more
features I can't visualize that I'll get
me a seizure let's reduce dimensionality
the two or three so we can see and
understand this data set easily data
city
there's an entire subfield of machine
learning called dimensionality reduction
the aemsa let us represent
high dimensional data in a 2d or 3d
space even a picture can be considered
to have 32 million dimensions if we
consider every single pixel to be a
dimension but it can also be considered
to have just two dimensions length and
width of a photo we just need to find
the intrinsic low dimensionality hidden
in our data so we can visualize it one
of the most popular ways to do this is
called t-sne which stands for
distributed stochastic neighbor
embedding say that three times fast
go T Anthony will allow us to reduce our
vectors dimensionality to just two it
does this by taking each one of our 70
dimensional feature vectors and finding
the similarity between its and every
other vector these similarities are
represented as values and stored in a
similarity matrix it then creates a
similarity matrix for the projected map
points which will contain our final
representation of the data set our first
similarity matrix represents where we
are and our second represents where we
ideally want to be we can minimize the
distance between these two matrices
using a process known as gradient
descent this will slowly bring down the
dimensionality of our first similarity
matrix by updating its values over time
when it's over we can use the trained
matrix to map the points in 2d space
well initialize our t-sne model via
scikit-learn and set the number of
components to 2 this parameter is asking
how many dimensions do we want our end
result to be in will fit it on our
feature vectors and store the resulting
two dimensional feature vectors in the X
test 2d variable now that we have that
we can plot our points on a 2d graph by
first creating a legend for our class
labels and plotting each point using map
plot live well define the location of
our legend and show our graph we can see
here that points of the same class tend
to cluster together and our t-sne helped
make that happen without knowing the
classes of the feature vectors we fed it
it learned how to represent the
similarity between these classes in a
two dimensional space we could further
analyze this plot to study why certain
classes are clustering together and what
conclusions this gives us like these two
classes are near each other since the
actions are similar so perhaps the more
movement and exercise requires the
farther away it will cluster from the
rest there are a couple of live demos of
t-sne on the web as well like this one
that visual lives
bunch of tweets you can see that similar
sounding tweets tend to cluster together
so to break it down high dimensional
data is everywhere and machine learning
can help us understand it if we reduce
the dimensionality of our data to 2d or
3d space we can visualize it ourselves
and t-sne is a popular dimensionality
reduction technique that you can use be
a psych you learn the challenge winner
for last week's video is Keegan Taylor
he can use tensor flow to train a neural
net to classify pokemons by their type
and the classifier had a 75% accuracy
after training which is pretty
incredible
more than anyone else had badass of the
week and the runner-up is Vishal Bachchu
very well documented and clean code this
week's coding challenge is to use t-sne
to visualize a game of thrones data set
that I'll provide and write down
something you discovered once you
visualized it your github submissions
should go in the comments and I'll
announce the winner next time please
subscribe and for now I'm going to make
my New Year's prediction
I mean resolution so thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
