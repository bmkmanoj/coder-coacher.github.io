doing pretty well in yourself pretty
good do you mind if I ask you some
questions go for it thrush cool how'd
you get into work today woke up spent
spent about a half an hour you're
enjoying company with the people I live
with and then grow
favorite part of the tensor book death
well I would have to say tensor boards
that's the case that I work on favorite
thing about working at Google there are
a lot of different things I like about
working at Google I think the thing
that's most important to me is that I
feel that Google as an organization
really cares about the impact it has on
the world and so I've been in a lot of
meetings where we've kind of been able
to think about how to deploy some
technology that can help people and the
conversation is always first like how
can we do something that's useful and
then the question of how we make money
is like I you know let's do something
important first and we can always figure
that out later how would you describe
your experience at Palantir I would say
I learned a lot and grew a lot as a
developer if you could spend an evening
with one famous person who would it be
if I could spend an evening maybe Barack
Obama you play any sport no you miss
being a student I miss having such an
abundance of people like living close by
to me who I knew and could socially
interact with but on the whole I really
liked being employed as a software
engineer what's your favorite band
difficult to choose a single favorite
fan I would say my favorite music is
like very danceable fusion tunes and as
I sort of like organized by genre
radical bread is there a programming
language you really don't like
you know what everyone's you fond of
Java it seems like it really has a lot
of boilerplate and I often I often have
a love/hate relationship with JavaScript
and that I wish had had like static
typing and a couple other nice may be
more consistent semantics programming
language of choice for machine learning
it would have to be Python since that's
the the lingua franca of machine
learning and of course the tensorflow
front end is written in Python favorite
professor
professor named Larry McKenna me at the
Chicago and he was a head of the writing
department and my conversations with him
really shaped the way that I think how
are you liking the bear I love living in
the back beautiful it has a lot of like
fun weird people it's got a lot of great
dancing it's got a lot of great hiking
why do you choose to work on a off I
think that it's going to be really it
has the potential to really impact a lot
of people and it offers the opportunity
to like help create societies in which
people are freer and which is more
abundant and I've acted part of that
what's the most beautiful thing in the
world I difficult to choose single most
beautiful things but as a pattern I find
it really fascinating how the world
seems to self organized into like these
complex ecosystems and fractals and so
forth so maybe the the tendency of the
world towards emergent self-organization
will thing I find most beautiful last
thing you made with your hands I have
this floating light bulb sort of a piece
of art it has an electromagnet in the
base to suspend the light bulb above it
and my friend Chaz and I took it apart
and so I redid the design so he switched
it from having a really like polished
modern look into a sort of a grungy
industrial look
and that was a fun project with my
favorite booth Robin do you miss your
hometown no I prefer the Bay Area well
website you waste time on Facebook you
get an all-expenses-paid trip to one
city where you go
probably Istanbul but if I could time
travel I would want to go back to Rome
at the peak of Roman Empire would you
visit mark it depends on the terminal
conditions and transit time and who else
and was there and what's going on what
is one thing you can't live without
other humans what was it like presenting
at the tensorflow death summit it was
pretty fun I really liked the the
content and I was really happy to get to
share knowledge about tensor board with
the Center for community what text
editor do you I've been switching
between sublime text and atom I was kind
of excited about the fact that atom is
open source by fine sublime has done a
performance so I kind of haven't quite
stabilized on one or the other what open
source library you really like
tensorflow what's one of your favorite
movies I really like V for Vendetta I
really like the network I really like
Kenneth Branagh as renditions of Hamlet
Vicky Cristina Barcelona recently I
thought it was great what inspires you
to focus on deep learning specifically
the whims of fate what was the first
program you ever made in eighth grade I
made a little program for calculating
time numbers what is one book you really
like there's so many books if I have to
choose one then it's like I really like
I want to choose something quite good I
really like there's a book called poor
Charlie's Almanac and it's written by
Charlie Munger who's Warren Buffett's
investment partner and it's sort of a
collection of aphorisms describing how
he approaches living life I know kind
that that could be really interesting oh
and I love girdle Escher Bach it's one
of my favorite one of my favorite books
that I've only read half of and if I
were to say books that have only read
the introduction I would say Bertrand
Russell the history of Western
philosophy
what's the bravest bravest thing you've
ever done I don't know if you were a
Greek god who would it be
Athena what is one piece of advice you'd
give yourself 10 years ago oh wait maybe
I would choose like mercury or Hermes
one piece of advice that I would give
myself 10 years ago focus less on the
intellect and remember that not all
truth is arrived at through thinking
what is the topic in machine learning
you'd like to explore more I think it is
a huge potential for using machine
learning for creating tools for
augmenting human creativity so for
example I'd like to get to a point where
you can like do Tula cartoon and
storyboard it and then have machine
learning transform it into a finished
cartoon with like voice acting and
animation and consistent design and I
think that's the point we might reach in
the next two years you think we'll solve
intelligence in your lifetime I have no
idea if you were in the world what if
one log you do that I think if I ran the
world I would try to set up better
systems and government like maybe having
better voting systems so that we don't
get
raishin where people are all voting to
attended they lease this light because I
think the bad candidate has like the
best shot of winning the election who is
one person you look up to when you were
in college Warren Buffett what would you
like as a kid in grade school I like to
read books and I would kind of hang out
by myself and also play video games
what's something that excites you about
the future I'm excited by the idea that
we can learn to have a society that's
kind of more nurturing to people and
focused less on competition and winning
and more on life like expressing oneself
and reporting and connecting with other
humans if you were to start from scratch
today what is one-week resource you
would use to learn machine work I really
like Chris schola's blog which is Ceola
github that IO and that would be that
would be a starting point for me what is
one major unsolved research problem
you'd love to tackle there's a lot of
different things here like transfer
learning unsupervised learning I'm not
sure I'm not really a researcher but
probably learning to develop model
architectures or learning to come up
with the right machine learning model
what's more interesting generative
models or discriminative model
generative if you could be a superhero
who would it be
maybe Ironman although I would I think
that the best the super here with the
best power is dr. Manhattan what's your
spirit animal Alliance favorite computer
scientist Jeff Dean if you had a time
machine
when would you visit
I'm sort of visiting to check it out or
visiting to say if I were visiting to
check it out like Rome at the height of
empire assuming that I were fluent in
Latin visiting to stay I think maybe
like living in a hunter-gatherer society
could be quite nice you actually use
Google Plus no Android or iPhone I have
an iPhone what would surprise people
about life at Google I was really
surprised by the scope and raw power of
Google infrastructure
I know it's pleasantly surprised only
satisfied by how polite and friendly
people are favorite Linux distro I don't
have one
have you ever been in love yes have you
built an app with machine learning that
you use in your day to day life nope all
right then that's it for my secret 7
question cool all right have a good one
see you throw out answering</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
