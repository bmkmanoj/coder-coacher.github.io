talk about a topic I very rarely talk
about
it's called eSports so eSports refers to
any kind of online gaming related to
tournaments and players earning rewards
it could also be related to fantasy
football fantasy basketball or even
real-life sports but the idea is that it
you consider a game work with other
players that's a kind of sport and there
are some reward involved and
specifically I'm talking about this
because there is this great intersection
between cryptocurrency and eSports so
I'm going to talk about four different
tokens in this space that are
intersecting these two spaces very well
and in along the way I'm gonna explain
how proof of stake works so it's really
hard to find any kind of readable proof
of state code but this is a great way to
do it because one of these coins
actually uses proof of stake and I'm
gonna use that as a segue to talk about
proof of stake also I'm going to talk
about how token sales work because two
of these coins do that really well and
very easily so if you want to make your
own coin related to eSports or gaming or
any of the above then you're it's it's
easier for you to do so so this market
is growing very very fast if we look at
the data the revenue from eSports by the
way is it's really a newer thing eSports
and the revenue from eSports is growing
like at a staggering rate every single
year if we if we look at this graph
right here right in the past five years
even it's gone from 0.5 to 1.5 on this
cagr scale and the audience is growing
as well so Millennials my generation and
even the generation that's younger loves
eSports so it's just gonna grow over
time the core audience the data shows
globally is 85% male ok so it's between
16 and 36 year old males that and they
have an average household income of
about 75,000 US dollars so there was a
survey of over a thousand video gamers
in the US and they were asked a bunch of
questions about cryptocurrency these
were gamers by the way so 75% of them
said they wish they could exchange their
virtual goods for currencies that they
could buy and sell on other platforms so
generally when gamers are earning tokens
inside of a game they can only spend it
within the game
what if they could spent it outside of
the game and that is really the key for
where cryptocurrency can play into video
game based assets two-thirds of them
want more opportunities to use
cryptocurrency within their video game
network and fifty-five percent of
Millennials of millennial video gamers
own cryptocurrency so that's that's a
lot that's more than half of millennial
video game players own cryptocurrency so
there's a huge market for this and why
do they want this well it turns out that
it's easier to use there's low exchange
rates and there's heightened security
right because there's a blockchain
involved so there's some more stats etc
etc but the point is that this is a new
class of digital assets and it's all
powered by cryptocurrency so there was a
eSports tournament recently that was
held online in the and the prize pool
was worth a hundred thousand US dollars
this was a big deal so you can consider
the gamers who trade in game virtual
items also called skins in this case to
have a similar experience to
cryptocurrency traders they both deal in
digital property they both face risks
involved with trading online and they
both have concerns about the security of
their online wallets here's a you know
picture of a popular tournament in Korea
so the first point I want to talk about
is XP coins so we can go to its website
here XP coin dot IO so they say it's to
incentivize rewards through using this
digital currency so this I did a bit of
research on the XP coin and they've
partnered with a bunch of people they
partnered with global eSports
coolermaster Red Bull Nvidia twitch
zodac Razer so there's a lot of
companies that have partnered with this
coin and that seems to be key in the
space to partner with these leading
brands that can then promote your your
token to the gamers worldwide and
ideally these companies have gamers that
are already embedded in their
communities they now have the number one
overwatch team in India so that's top
ten in Asia they're developing an
eSports arena in Asia with a bunch of
high-end pcs so once you have this
network built once you have this
community then you can use the token to
fund these things like a physical place
you can use it to fund tournaments you
can use it to fund you know different
things and the community can even use
these tokens to fund their own things so
you can have a essentially a
decentralized
movement that the creators of the token
they just kind of set rules into the
protocol and let it flourish and then
let the community take over from there
but they're working on an ecommerce
store as well where you can purchase all
sorts of in-game assets and items and
this network that they built consists of
a bunch of roles so this is a very
important concept when creating any kind
of community when you have your token
you don't just want to have a nice EEO
and just say you know buy this coin etc
that's it and we're going to use it you
want to have some kind of role set for
your community so it's best to think of
this beforehand right so they've got
these they have this idea of a super
node and a dev node and a sales know
that in a Geo node a master node and all
these nodes have different roles in the
community for example the sales node
will receive XP coin in return for
selling some kind of experience or sales
really related product the dev node is
going to be related to development the
super node is kind of getting money from
the other nodes to maintain the network
geo nodes are location-based so as long
as you have these roles and they're
clear sets people will take them up
you've got to have a good plan in place
for your token to actually take off you
can't be in it just for the money
there's got to be some value that you're
providing or your coin will tank and the
market will decide for you so what they
did was they forked pure coin so pure
coin was a fork of Bitcoin that
implemented proof of stake and this was
a really good idea because proof of
stake is the way to go if theorem is
using it or they're going to start using
it and the whole space will start moving
towards proof of stake because it's more
energy efficient and it's just a better
system in general for security purposes
proof of work is being consolidated by a
bunch of big GPU farms right so the idea
is that proof of work prevents any kind
of 51% attack because you'd have to have
a lot of computing power but the problem
is that 2/3 of the network is owned by a
few entities so there is a
centralization when it comes to big
coins proof of work algorithm so the way
out of this is you by using proof of
stake and that's what peercoin uses
that's what XP coin you know they they
forked off of it but what I wanted to do
what I want to do is take take this
opportunity this to segue into proof of
stake and how proof of stake works right
because they're using it and it seems to
be a very good protocol it's getting
more and more popular so you might have
heard a lot about aetherium Kasper if
you're if you're into etherium the word
Kasper is showing up a lot in forums and
you know slack channels and all this
stuff but basically what Kasper is is
it's a version of proof of stake it's
the latest version and they plan on
implementing it very very soon but it's
a four step process
Kasper and it's it's the proof of stake
process so step one is the validators
stake a portion of their ethers so the
validators of the network are confirming
transactions right and they're getting
paid in aetherium so what they'll do is
they'll stake a portion of their ethers
like whatever X is so we can define that
in the protocol so let's say I've got
100 ethers I'm gonna stake 10 of them
okay so that's step one I just I've
staked 10 ethers step two is that after
that they'll start validating the blocks
that's that's confirming that these
transactions are valid when they
discover a block that they think can be
added to the chain of a proper valid
block they will validate it by placing a
bet on it okay so they'll say okay this
is very likely a valid block I'm going
to bet that it is so if the block gets
appended to the list to the blockchain
then the validators will get a reward
proportionate to their bets so the more
you bet on a block the more of validator
bets on a block the higher the reward is
right so if the validator acts in a
malicious manner and tries to do nothing
at stake they'll immediately be
reprimanded and all their stake is going
to get slashed so that's kind of the
security mechanism here right because a
validator in order to say a block is
valid or not has to stake some of their
coins and if they're trying to if
they're trying to defraud the system
then they're their stake that they had
to put into this essentially an escrow
like service will be will be wiped out
and then they won't get to get that
money back so in order to vote you have
to have stake in the network and if you
try to do something bad if you try to
say of transaction was valid and it's it
wasn't then that state goes away so this
is really the best pseudocode that I
could find it's not even pseudocode it's
just Python but it's it's the etherium
Kasper script and what we're gonna do is
we're gonna take a look at it it's about
400 lines so it's quite a lot I know
but let's just try to understand how
this works programmatically right we
know the basic idea that we have a set
of validators in the network they're
going to put some amount of ether at
stake they're going to vote on whether
or not a block is valid and if they are
correct then they earn some money if
they're not if they've tried to be
defraud the system and they're gonna
lose that stake so that's the basic idea
so at the start we're going to define
all of these variables there's quite a
lot of variables here so what in the in
here we have this concept of a dynasty
so validators are grouped into what are
called dynasties and dynasties are
groups of validators it's just a way of
segmenting up the network to improve the
speed of transactions and of voting on
whether or not a transaction is valid or
not there's a bunch of historical
checkpoint hashes so checkpoints in this
case are just meant to speed up a
transaction validation right because if
we have a checkpoint a validator doesn't
have to validate every single block that
came before right we can just have this
checkpoint and say it's starting from
here start validating onwards so it just
speeds up computation in the network if
we keep going down there's quite a lot
of variables but I think the best thing
for us to do is to look at the main code
just just get an idea of the
programmatic implementation of proof of
stake so if we go down here we're going
to see let's see the the voting process
right so this is under deaf vote so this
is the voting process right here so
because it's in Python it's going to be
downloaded by every node in the network
every validator is going to be running
this code so under the vote function we
can see what does it take for validator
to get to vote so the vote message is
going to be the vote for a validator and
so when a validator executes the vote
function that vote message is going to
be input as the parameter to the
function so it's gonna be you know
simply we can think of it as a binary
yes/no right but it's a 1024 bytes
message so it fits onto the blockchain
it's a very thin message and once they
voted then it's going to do these series
of steps here to say whether or not the
vote was valid
so the first step really is to say let's
start a dynasty so let's start a dynasty
so a dynasty consists of a set of
validators right here and so once we
have that dynasty we're gonna say well
what is the what is the overall vote of
that dynasty so another reason for
having a dynasty is to say what is the
majority vote of this dynasty to speed
up the voting process it's kind of
similar to the the Electoral College in
the in the United States it's not that
every single person votes but it's kind
of like a delegation of votes and then
what is the larger vote of this
delegation we still we send that up to
the federal level so it's kind of like
that but for a proof of stake voting who
is it okay here's the current vote of
the dynasty which work in a store in
current dynasty and once we have that we
can record that the validator voted for
this target epoch so they can't again so
what happens this record of whether or
not the validator voted the record that
this vote took place and then inside of
the current dynasty will increment all
of those variables that we initialize
earlier to say well the validator index
he voted let's add one to it and then do
for the next validator so there's some
count of the number of validators in the
network and now that this validator is
voted increment the validator index to
the next one so we could say okay this
new identity is going to be the next
validator so this is really the the
validation part right here so once the
validator is voted if enough votes with
the same source epoch and hatch are made
then the hash value is justified that
means that if enough validators that
have put stake into the system have
voted and that and those votes were
indeed valid then and only then can that
vote be added or that block be added to
the blockchain right because it is a
valid vote and that's essentially what
this last part does but yeah there's
there's quite a bit to proof of stake
but that's the general idea and I just
wanted to go into that for a second
but let's keep going here because we
have quite a bit more to cover so wax
wax is another cryptocurrency in this
space so these are essentially utility
tokens that allow for virtual goods to
easily be tokenized that in exchange for
cryptocurrency so any kind of in-game
asset whether that's you know looking at
the amount of shields that you got in
some you know medieval game or some kind
of you know map that you bought or some
ski
for some new kind of you know weapon in
some kind of Counter Strike like game
anything like that you can tokenize that
and then sell it using this
cryptocurrency and you can link all of
those in-game assets to this
cryptocurrency so they're time-stamped
on the blockchain and then you can have
the name of it as well embedded in that
25 character hash so it's provable
that's the point so it's provable so the
wax platform you know they have they
have a lot going for them but what I
find really interesting is how they
raise their token sales so if we look at
their token sale they raise quite a lot
they raise quite a lot of money but the
the really interesting bit is that if we
look at their token contract it's
essentially just a fork of the Zeppelin
solidity standard token contract so
Zeppelin basically makes making ERC 20
tokens very very easy and if you look at
this code it's only 89 lines of code and
what they did was they just forked it
and they just added their own customized
parameters to the code so if we look in
here we say okay the constant aim is a
wax token here's a symbol here's how
many decimal points so eight decimal
points and here's the initial supply and
they used you know scientific notation
to say this is there are quite a lot of
tokens so if we look in all of these
functions here it's that's just it it's
just transfer its transfer from address
approve increase approval when not
paused decrease approval there's only
seven functions in this code and they
raised at least 50 million USD that's
quite a lot of money but it's just the
power of I COS of tokens of exchanges
that's there's quite a lot and you know
a lot of it isn't even justified it's
just people don't even understand what
they're investing in they just see
something and they're like okay I need
to pour a lot of money into this because
it seems like it's good but a lot of
times it's really just smoke and mirrors
so we have to be very careful into what
we invest in and the best way to do that
is not to is not to look at landing
pages it's not to look at the hype
around something it's to look at the
code if you can do that if you can
understand the code behind some protocol
then you're set then an
only then should you really invest a lot
of money because the code is really what
matters right that's that's the real
that's the real value that some unique
token provides right if you have a bunch
of coins for some space whether that's
eSports or this or that and there's 20
different players in the field who is
gonna win right who's gonna be the token
that most people adopt it's gonna be the
token that has the most value right and
if all of them are just Forks of the
same token who's gonna win it's the one
that provides that unique code base and
that unique code base it's not just
unique but it provides real value and
the best way to do that is to look at
the code so this is just kind of a an
analysis and example of how you should
be analyzing all of these tokens in the
space let's keep going so you know coin
it's another one you know coin bet play
watch same exact idea it's for in-game
assets for betting on the etherion
blockchain interestingly Mark Cuban
invested in this so they've got a
hundred million dollar token sale quite
a lot of hype behind this one but if we
look in their token distribution
contract we'll see again same thing
Zeppelin template right what's the
difference between you know coin and wax
nothing really programmatically it's the
same exact contract they've got an e rc
20 they've got a different landing page
they've skinned it they've wrapped it
differently but under the hood it's the
same exact template they have a
different number of coins they have this
pre-sale token allocation cap we have a
post sale token allocation cap and they
have a few more variables but
essentially it's the same thing so it's
really important to be able to look at
these and say you know what how good
something is and how good it's not so
let's go to the last one so this one is
really interesting so it's called
Chamorro and they say that this is the
ultimate blockchain game development
platform but crucially they don't have
any code because they just don't have
any code is just a landing page but
they've they've they're raising quite a
lot of money from just a landing page
right that's what I look for first for
first is do they have code yes/no
answers no I'm just I'm just gonna keep
walking right so that's something you
should do as well anyway so they want so
I'm not saying that they're fraudulent
I'm just saying that this is something
that helps investors if you want people
to invest if you
more hype have your codebase available
for people to view so these are so the
idea is that you can take a video game
any kind of video game and decentralize
it on the blockchain what do I mean so
if right now games are hosted on giant
servers World of Warcraft
for example Blizzard owns the server so
you're connecting to Blizzard if
Blizzard decides to stop you know
maintaining World of Warcraft then
everybody doesn't get to play anymore
but in a decentralized space there are
multiple servers holding this game and
people can't interact with each other in
a period of your way there's no way to
shut the game down also if you're an
indie game developer then the cost the
the cost of the infrastructure to get
your game out there in front of many
many people it's a lot so you might be
thinking how are they putting an entire
game on the blockchain right games are
multiple gigabytes of data they're not
and if you have any kind of game that's
related to the blockchain you shouldn't
put it on the blockchain just try it's
not gonna work it's too big right block
chains are very very thin clients and
that and to have every node in a network
download a game it's preposterous
it's not going to work what should you
do instead well you should use what's
called the distributed hash table to
store the data what the blockchain is
for is for application level constructs
so user names tweets anything that the
network has to agree upon game States
that's what you would use a blockchain
for so application level constructs go
on the blockchain the data itself is
stored in a distributed hash table like
ipfs so that's how they should do it I
don't know how exactly they're doing it
they weren't very specific but they have
this idea of game channels so game
channels are what are called off chain
transactions so in the Bitcoin network
there's this concept of a lightning
Network and the Lightning network says
I'm a node you're a node let me transfer
you some value without going on the
Bitcoin blockchain so it's just a
peer-to-peer note what what is what's
going on the blockchain is a record of
that transaction but it's a very thin
record it's not a huge record like an
unlocked chain transaction takes a lot
of time right there's a lot of time
involved in a transaction at least ten
minutes at this point but that's too
long and so the reason they call it a
lightning network is because it's very
fast because it avoids using a
blockchain it's a direct peer-to-peer
transfer
without it being on the chain so they're
using this concept to store game States
very fast because game states need to be
fast in terms of a game right if you're
in position hey you need to go to
position B the network needs to agree
that you moved but you need to do this
in a fast way
game channels are the way to go but if
we look at this code here let's let's
look at some code so even though they
don't have any code available I did find
some game contract code so this is a
protocol called izx and it's a game
protocol that uses smart contracts to
agree on application level constructs so
they have they have four different smart
contracts which is very interesting and
I think this is a good way to do things
they have one which is called game and
that's defining the base abstract
concept of your game you have token game
which defines the game's token rev-share
game and so this is an example of how to
share that value between players and
then game controller so this is which
control so this controls which token
holder has what and to what extent they
can participate in the game and they
have contracts for all of this in
solidity but interestingly the game
contract is probably the one that we
should be looking at right now so up
here they have some rules of the game
like two rules essentially the game
issuer places the number of prizes into
the into the contract and the seed to
calculate those hashes they're unknown
and kept in secret so once players play
the game the issuer may give a secret
seed to the winner the winner claims the
prize and gets a reward so this is an
example of using an application-level
construct for something that's
essentially a massively online
multiplayer game right keep the thin
stuff in in the smart contracts the big
stuff in the distributed hash table and
we're good to go
anyway I hope you found this video
useful and please subscribe for more
programming videos for now I've got a
