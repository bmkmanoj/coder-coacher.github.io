odds are you pretty good can you fix the
Devon question yeah sure let's take a
walk
what is one thing you really like about
London the music and culture favorite
part of the software stack machine
learning stack you're getting your PhD
from Oxford describe Oxford lines in one
word antenna what was the last project
you worked on an open source project
called open mind is looking to
decentralize the control of a act if you
could spend an evening with one famous
person who would it be
Barack Obama what do you do to relax
assai music do you miss the US I do all
the time it's a it I don't think you
realize how important it is to develop
relationships in a place until until you
leave it and then you know those people
are far away so yeah I missed them all
time what got you into a oh I originally
wanted to do it mostly for fun and also
I thought the software would be really
compelling a way to be able to travel
because I like being able to work for my
laptop and at the time I was really
interested in playing music and I was
playing with a band and a few other
places and yeah I thought it would be a
cool place the cool way to travel and
work my laptop on a tour bus and then
discover day I threw a course at my
university and just totally got hooked
last thing you made with your hands
last person you emailed I cold emailed a
researcher in Tokyo who is doing
research on decentralized AI because the
community is so small and I want to get
to know everyone is in it what advice
would you give yourself 10 years ago
keep an open mind to the different
opportunities don't commit too hard to
just one and yeah be ready for the road
that life might take you on what website
do you waste time on Twitter you get an
all-expenses-paid trip to one city where
do you go
Toronto going next week to the
decentralized AI conference would you
visit Mars absolutely what is one thing
you can't live without my wife for sure
where do you envision machine learning
will take us I think that's more
question on on how governance and sort
of capitalism versus three destitution
of wealth plays out because AI is mostly
just a proxy for power and it's often
controlled by the people who control
capital so let's say it's really hard to
tell but if history is any indicator
it's gonna be really hard to keep it
from being aggregated into a few kind of
small powerful players do you think
religion has a place in science I do
which is a bit of a contrarian view I
view religion as a large body of work
that is attempting to understand and
record things that are unexplainable
whereas science is a corpus of work that
attempts to explain things that are
explainable and are repeatable and I
think both are ultimately trying to
learn
they're both trying to learn the same
thing which is where are we and who are
we and what really matters and I think
that if you're trying to figure out what
the world is about yourself you can take
a book into account what text editor do
you use I usually use sublime text but
I'm using Adam Moore lately pretty cool
what open source library do you really
like pipe torch ngo5 torch what's one of
your favorite movies
the prestige you see my favorite but I
really like interstellar I think it's
awesome yeah what's one of your hobbies
outside of machine learning playing
Khanum what was the first program you
ever made I was in the second grade and
my dad helps me make a simple calculator
in C++ and I put on a floppy disk and
show it to my teacher at school
what's the music genre you're really
into movie soundtracks because they make
me feel like whatever I'm doing is epic
is there a programming language that you
really don't like is it bad to say Lua
programming language of toys for machine
learning Python for sure favorite
professor dr. Hooper first got me an AI
and programming then I go like a foot
what's one area of deep learning that
interests you a lot I'm really
interested in figuring out how this is
more in the be putting industries in the
deep learning algorithms itself but I
think that
and I tweeted the other day like
algorithms are more commodities to the
extent that everyone gives them away for
free so research into algorithm while it
helps push forward what humanity can do
I think it has less of an impact on what
we will do and that's more controlled by
sort of the data acquisition side of the
industry so as far as the thing that I
think is the most interesting and has
the most opportunity for social impact I
don't think it's building the next great
you know layer right I think it's
probably building the next great control
structure for for the natural resource
that deep learning consumes which is
data what is the misconception that
people have about deep learning that
it's about the algorithms instead about
the data like like algorithms just
extract information from large data sets
and that's probably been the greatest
lesson that my supervisor has taught me
so far law at Oxford name one person you
really admire
I really admire the this is really
controversial but the former CEO of
Firefox because I think that
people are generally rewarded now for
not acting on their beliefs and for
being really passive and whereas there's
definitely a case for that and I'm a
very open and accepting individual I
also have tremendous respect for people
who put it all on the line for things
that that they really believe in and I
think that he did that what's the most
beautiful thing in the world a smile
what do you want to work on the most at
deepmind I'm really interested in
long-term memory so so neural nets are
really good at modeling short sequences
and short range dependencies and saying
you know given the beginning of a
sentence finish a coherently but they
have a really hard time saying I think
I've read this before you know 2,000
pages ago and even finding exactly the
same thing you know again so what I'd
really like to work on there is long
term memory and episodic memory
especially as it pertains to
reinforcement learning one of the people
you've met at deep mind so far like
generous collaborative some of them are
hilarious some of them are the kind of a
group of oddballs and they know it and
they don't take themselves too seriously
I'm one of the first guys I met he was
wearing a black kilt a pink bow tie and
had like just this crazy haircut and I
just remember thinking like wow that guy
that guy's got to figure it out in that
he's happy to be whoever he's going to
be whoever he's at and and work on cool
stuff no matter what and then I think I
grew up in a part of the country in the
US where where
sort of social signals like that would
have discounted him from sort of
academic pursuits and it's totally
ridiculous and I was really really glad
to see that some people who the group
that a lot of people would associate
with being a member of the top right
don't disqualify someone just because
they have those kinds of social signals
or or carry themselves in that way right
what is one thing that excites you
hanging out with my wife best advice
you've ever received
whenever you do something you should
always know what your goal is because
otherwise you'll never know if you got
there
what's the bravest thing you've ever
done that's a very friendly question
I guess get married who's your favorite
computer scientist favorite computer
scientist there's a lot of great ones
with card to discriminate I guess that
one turns is pretty easy Internet
do you think you need a PhD to do
machine learning no absolutely not
and actually with the advent of online
education there's a lot of the very
strong case you made that people can
learn faster just the things they need
to know by doing self-study and I think
it's a really good thing but it's also
going to upset the establishment and in
America where education is highly over
capitalized and override there's the big
correction coming so you know watch out
will the singularity happen
I think we will definitely get to a
place where we can't tell the difference
between whether it's a human or it's not
because humans are really good really
interested in mimicking ourselves so if
you believe that singularities and
absolutely now weather will actually be
able to create something that's a
all-powerful being that provides for us
and answers all our questions and you
know is kind of this all-powerful entity
I think that's a little bit ridiculous
mostly because they I that I've seen
learns from data and I don't know if
there's enough data out there at the
moment
what is one area of machine learning
that doesn't get enough laws
same as before data data set data that
kind of power structures which is the
natural resource that goes into AI
what's the most surprising result you've
ever gotten from your research figure is
better
what is consciousness
I don't know what was the last thing
that frustrated you getting Python to
package dependencies that weren't part
of the code
what's your spirit in my spirit animal
ooh lion if you had a time machine
when would you visit either either the
time either zero BT or zero ad or the
1960's because it seems like everything
was invented in 60 tell me a secret
about yourselves just one one secret
I try not to have any secrets where
would you like to see yourself in the
next five years
I am currently trying to figure out
given the set of skills that I'm trying
to acquire and I have the opportunity to
acquire what use of that actually
matters and can actually have a real
impact other than making a company a
bunch of money or automating a process
like it seems like there's a lot of near
misses in the a industry right now for
applying new skills so that's kind of
the question of the hour that I don't
have the answer to yet but I'm working
on it who is one person you would love
to collaborate with Mark Zuckerberg
favorite Linux distro the Bluetooth
what's the point of life controversial
question
love God and love people and yes have
you built an app with machine learning
that you've used in your day-to-day life
no I actually got into programming to do
app development but I've spent more time
on the backend lately which is something
I'd like to change what's something
you've learned in the past month in the
past month I've learned a lot of new
things about homework encryptions that's
kind of been a pursuit of study over the
last six months to a year and I've also
learned that there's an incredible
amount of knowledge to be
you find a lot of new uses if you can
find different fields in the scientific
study where people have done a ton of
work but they haven't done a lot of kind
of cross work and like homework
encryption deep learning and even some
extent federated learning and blockchain
are like these sort of these things or
people have worked really really hard
independent kind of silos of research
but there's so much interesting
low-hanging fruit if you if you look at
the cross between them and I think it's
easy to look at that pursued just go uh
buzzwords or something but but these are
legitimately interesting technologies
and there's not I think if we're only
now starting to try to figure out ok how
can we take kind of the power the power
dynamics that we love about blockchain
the the privacy dynamics that we love
about encryption as well as as the
intelligence of deep learning in AI and
and build the world you want to live in
what is one really cool use case for
machine learning that you haven't yet
seen done
predict what outcomes are going to
happen in my life as a result of the
decisions that I make do you think we'll
solve intelligence in your lifetime
I hope so if you're in the world
what's one law you didn't act due into
other than we have them do unto you
what's the problem that you would love
to see solved
closed-mindedness what were you like as
a kid in grade school I asked way too
many questions and totally drove my
parents and my teachers crazy
what resource do you use the most to
learn about the latest breakthroughs
Twitter yeah for sure what's something
that excites you about the future I'm
very hopeful that technology will give
us the ability decentralized interest
and and sort of what we pursue for the
first time ever okay it seems like we've
had to make this trade-off where we have
to aggregate power into these certain
structures to sort of push us forward
because when everything is all apart was
this logistical issue with innovating
but it might be possible with the
internet with blockchain and the like
for us to actually innovate in a way
where the interest and the return and
the sort of goals that we're trying to
achieve is actually built for the masses
and not just for the people who have
capital if you were to start from
scratch today what is a learning
resource that you'd use to learn machine
learning look through your questions
hopefully the things that I've written
has a fire at them but
other than that I think the Udacity nano
degree is really strong and then I would
look for 12 years 12 year olds on
YouTube who who always have some of the
best your health whoa all right sure
thanks for answering those questions
Eman all right have a good one you think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
