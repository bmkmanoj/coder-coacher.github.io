Dutch philosopher Spinoza once said that
peace is not an absence of war it is a
virtue a state of mind a disposition for
benevolence confidence justice all the
great systems we have in our lives exist
only because people who had a vision of
a more beautiful world willed them into
reality through hard work we've created
layers and layers of these systems
systems of law of transportation of
social interaction of healthcare and
they've been entirely reliant on human
intelligence for thousands of years in
the past few decades though we've begun
the process of creating machine
intelligence to improve them the first
phase involved in rule based
intelligence a series of if-then
statements whether using a traffic light
instead of a human traffic controller or
an automatic fare calculator instead of
trusting a driver for a fair price we've
collectively put our trust into machine
intelligence whereas before we had to
trust humans it was scary at first
initially we didn't understand how the
technology worked but eventually it
became the norm we found that it made
the system better if we trusted the
machine to do the job we then moved on
to using heuristics in the next phase
our machine started making educated
guesses whether that be finding the
shortest path between two points or
predicting the most likely weather for
tomorrow
we again learned to trust them to do
those jobs well now we're in the last
phase the learning phase we've begun
teaching our machines how to learn for
themselves eventually our cars will
learn to drive themselves chemists will
be able to teach their machines to
discover new drugs for themselves every
single system we built up until now will
eventually be able to learn for itself
just like we do but should we trust our
learning systems what happens when we
solve intelligence entirely and what
does a benevolent super intelligence
look like the famous Dutch painter
Rembrandt used to roam the streets of
Amsterdam finding inspiration in these
Canal walkways for some of his greatest
pieces in his studio he would ask you
students to try and nuh work work that
took him decades of training to create
we can now condense all that training
time
machine intelligence so that a novice
can emulate his style instantly and that
goes for any skill we'll all be able to
master any skill instantly by augmenting
our own intelligence with machines our
world in its current state though is
filled with suffering life is hard even
for the most well-off the ultra rich
purchased material possessions to
account for the loss of what really
matters the loss of connection the loss
of intimacy the loss of community a I
can change that it can end suffering as
we know it's entirely enabling utopia on
earth ending all war and disease using
insights that only a super intelligent
machine could give us in a matter of
seconds
van Gogh once said for my part I know
nothing with any certainty but the sight
of the stars makes me dream he
actualized his dreams using a canvas and
soon will be able to actualize our own
using AI as our canvas whether that
means generating entirely new realities
to live out our wildest fantasies in or
creating a universal problem solver who
are given any objective function it can
optimize for it by minimizing an error
value but who gets to decide what that
objective function is for all the good
that AI could bring us there's also the
possibility of it being used for evil
all in this world renowned for its
tolerant attitude and open-minded spirit
but just a few decades ago its own
police and civil service forces were
used to transport tens of thousands of
Jews to extermination camps in Germany
including Anne Frank and her family
Adolf Hitler was able to manipulate
hundreds of thousands of people into
believing his own twisted ideology if
Hitler was able to get his hands on
super intelligence we all be living in a
nightmarish reality as generative models
improve the ability to manipulate people
is becoming easier moneyed interests
have already begun conducting
surveillance of our actions and
analyzing our data to build weaponize AI
propaganda machines and these machines
are used to manipulate our opinions and
behavior in order to advance political
agendas in a way that's never before
been possible an AI could even come up
with an objective of its own and that
objective could be to annihilate our
species entirely
could happen directly because it desires
to end human life or indirectly in the
way that we build canals to make
transport more efficient for us and in
the process destroyed countless
ecosystems of insects so how do we
ensure that the AI we created beneficial
and safe super intelligence is by its
very definition smarter than us able to
reason at a level so different from us
that it's literally unimaginable we
could try and contain it to block it
from internet access but eventually it
will learn to escape and if one person
doesn't let there they is stays another
one will we shouldn't try to stop
progress in AI instead we need to ensure
that it's aligned with our own values we
need to understand exactly how these
algorithms work so they produce the
results that we want but who's to say
what good values are should we be
allowed to pay for sex or consume any
drugs we want we can't even collectively
decide on what good and evil is
philosophers have been debating what
constitutes those for thousands of years
and AI lives on both sides of that
debate viruses will use AI to learn how
to best break into security systems but
at the same time security systems will
use AI to learn how best to defend
against threats AI will increasingly be
used to create fake but realistic
looking news but at the same time a I
will also get better at detecting what's
real and what's fake we're in the midst
of a new arms race an AI is the nuclear
power of our time as soon as any
institution Viet government or
corporation learns the power of AI they
will race to use it to fulfill their own
interests we can learn a lot from our
past the European enlightenment era
writer Lord Acton had words that still
ring true today
he said that freedom consists of the
distribution of power and despotism in
its concentration we must democratize
the AI power we must make it as
accessible to as many people as we can
that way the will of the collective will
override anyone by vacuum
and only by educating ourselves on how
exactly this intelligence works but we
be able to better align it with our
intended goals whether up to us to
ensure that our AI bounces all the
things that we do that a cherishes
laughter and connection that it
preserves friendship and love in our
quest to understand intelligence we'll
learn more about who we are and what it
means to be human
and together we'll finally be able to
take that most sublime process guided by
nature into our own hands evolution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
