AI generated music hello world walkman
audiology in this episode we're going to
train a neural network that compose
music all by itself machine generated
music the technical term for this is
music language modeling and it has a
long history of research behind it
Markov models and restricted Boltzmann
machines which kind of sounds like
something out of half-life or Bioshock
hold on babe I've got to go save the
world using the restricted Boltzmann
machine music is how we communicate our
emotions and passions and it's
completely based on mathematical
relationships octaves chords scales Keys
all of it is math at the lowest level
music is a series of sound waves that
create pockets of air pressure and the
pitch will here depends on the frequency
of changes in this air pressure sheet
music is the annotation we've created to
help us map the sound into a repeatable
set of instructions so if machine
learning is all about feeding data into
models to find patterns and make
predictions could we use it to feed in
music data to predict new songs
absolutely we're going to build an app
that learns how to compose British folk
music by training on a British folk data
set I was going to go with American but
I didn't think it'd be age-appropriate
there's too much sax and violence get it
will be using tensorflow the sickest
machine learning library ever to do this
in just 10 lines of Python we're going
to follow our tried-and-true four-step
machine learning methodology to do this
collect the data set build a model train
the model and test the model to start
off we'll want to collect our data set
so let's import the URL live module
which is going to let us download the
file from the web once we import it we
can call the URL retrieve method to do
just that we'll set the parameters to a
link in the data set and the name we'll
call the downloaded file we're using the
Nottingham data set for this demo which
is a collection of a thousand British
folk songs in MIDI format MIDI format is
perfect for us and since encodes all the
note and time information exactly how it
would be written in music annotation it
comes in a zip file we want to unzip it
as well we can do this programmatically
using the zip file module we'll extract
the data from the zip and place it in
the data directory ok so we've got our
data it's time to create the model but
before we do that we need to think about
how we want to represent our input data
there are two things happening there's
the main tune or melody and then there
are the supporting notes or harmony
let's represent each as a vector and to
make things easier we'll make two
assumptions the first is that the melody
is monophonic that means only one note
is played at each time step the second
is that the harmony at each time step
can be
classified into a core class so that's
two different vectors one for melody and
one for harmony well then combine them
into one big vector and use that as our
input we can just import our ML helper
class and then call the create model
method to do this music plays out over a
period of time it's a sequence of notes
so we need to use a sequence learning
model it has to accept a sequence of
notes as an input and output a new
sequence of notes plain old neural nets
can't do this they accept fixed sized
inputs like an image or a number we'll
need a special kind of neural network a
recurrent neural network those can deal
with sequences since data doesn't just
flow one way it loops this allows the
network to have a kind of short-term
memory unlike Donald Trump but wait we
want our network to not just remember
the most recent music is heard but all
the music it's heard like a piece of
music can have multiple themes in
different parts of it hopeful sad cheery
and if Network remembers only the most
recent part which was cheery it's just
going to compose cheery stuff we need a
special type of recurrent neural network
called a long short-term memory Network
this type of network can remember things
from way back in the sequence of data
and it uses everything that remembers to
generate new sequences our model will
generate the sequences and core mapping
file to a file in the data folder this
is a serialized byte stream
representation of our music that we can
input directly into our model to train
by the way every machine learning model
has a set of what are called hyper
parameters these are the parameters that
we human set for how our bottle operates
like knobs on a control panel how many
layers do with one how many iterations
for training how many neurons you can
just use an existing model with pre
tuned hyper parameters to build
something awesome so now we're ready to
train our model we can just call the
train model method of our neural net
class and do this this will get the
network to start collecting the input
data piece by piece it took me about two
hours to train this on my 2013 MacBook
Pro but you have to wait until it's
completely done training to test it out
just wait until you see the best also
for encountered saving model message
once you see that you can type an RNN
sample into terminal but the config file
flag and point it to the newly generated
config file in your models folder that
will generate a new song using the newly
trained model you've just created to
generate music we just sample the melody
and harmony at each time step and plug
it into our trained model the model will
then predict what the next notes will be
the collection of all the predicted
notes is our newly generated song
there are some improvements that we made
for sure that time signature is kind of
sporadic and in terms of long-term
structure there seems to be a lack of
repeated themes and phrases the solution
may well be more data and more computing
power it usually is when it comes to
machine learning with deep neural nets
machine learning can help us learn the
fundamental nature of how music works in
ways that we haven't even thought about
