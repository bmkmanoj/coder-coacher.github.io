ever wonder how Netflix recommends
awesome shows you like or how Facebook
can Auto tag your face or how Google
self-driving cars work or how Bing can't
what's that you don't care what Bing
does it's ok nobody does anyways the
answer is machine learning machine
learning is a study of algorithms that
learned from examples and experience
instead of hard-coded rules so let's say
you want to build an app that can
recognize an image of a specific species
of flower called iris if you decide to
code this without machine learning you'd
have to write a bunch of different
functions to detect all the different
features of an iris flower the problem
is there are a bunch of corner cases and
there's no way you can account for all
of them ahead of time like what if one
of the leaves is partially obstructed or
a flower is a certain color that you
didn't account for or the shape is
totally different than what you expected
you can't just code all that up
beforehand unless you're Jeff Dean just
kidding Jeff Dean can't do it nobody can
you have to use machine learning to
solve this problem and here's the best
part it's actually super easy and you
don't need to be a math person to do it
there are just four sets involved in the
process collect data pick the model
train the model and test the model well
basically just add data to a model and
it will start to find patterns in the
data for us we're going to make this
iris flower recognition app which is
seven lines of Python using two dope
libraries scikit-learn and tensorflow
which will import right at the start so
let's do this the first step is to get
our data datasets come in all different
kinds of formats PDFs CSVs Holograms it
doesn't matter the format we can easily
parse it in our code to get the relevant
details we'll be using a well known data
set that contains 150 samples of iris
flowers luckily for us this data set
comes pre-loaded with scikit-learn so we
can just load it here each sample has a
label one of three types of iris toasted
virginica or reverser color and instead
of features sepal length sepal width
petal length and petal width because our
data is labeled the type of learning
we're doing is called supervised
learning if we didn't have labels for
our data just features then it would be
called unsupervised learning so yeah
these are good features they're simple
independent and informative as all
features should be by the way if you're
ever deciding on what kind of features
you should look for in a data set a good
rule of thumb is thinking about what
features you purse
we would need to figure out to determine
whatever your goal is so if you're
trying to determine Jedi or Sith given a
data set of lightsabers don't pick
something like weapons status as a
feature use blade colors and curvature
as your feature so now that we have our
data set the next step is to pick the
model to do that you just have to
calculate the multivariate equation for
discriminant analysis by squaring the
Delta of the just kidding you literally
just paste in a single line of code the
real question is how do you know which
of the bajillion machine learning models
to use well we're trying to classify an
image as either an iris flower or not an
iris flower so we know this is a
classification problem therefore we'll
need to use a classify or okay that
narrows our options but what type like
there are a lot of those too my gut
reaction is to use a deep neural network
because it just sounds dope you know
what I mean but there are countless
others the answer is it depends it
depends on the size of your data and
your application requirements currently
if you have a lot of data deep neural
networks pretty much outperform every
other machine learning model across a
wide variety of use cases but in our
case we only have a hundred and fifty
samples so we use something simple and
standard a linear classifier will set
the class parameter to three you can
also easily just switch out the model
with another one and see the difference
in accuracy it's just one line of code
like that's all it would take to use a
deep neural net to classify this if we
wanted to that way you'll know which one
works best
now we picked our model it's time to
train it training is the actual learning
step as your model iterates through the
data set it gets better and better at
prediction since we're using a
classifier we've seen a call to fit
method on our object to train our model
fit is our training algorithm this
method will input the training data set
into our model finding patterns in the
data boom done now whenever we input a
new flower for testing data set it'll
automatically be able to classify it as
one of the three types of iris flower we
can see internal that the accuracy score
for classification is pretty high how
easy was that just seven lines of code
and now you have your first model
trained and ready to recognize flowers
you just made a learning machine and you
can use the same model to classify other
things like cars and dresses and
Republican candidates machine learning
can be applied to so many different
things from fraud detection to
generating paintings like the Casas if
you like to see more machine learning

goes please subscribe I'm going to
release a lot of them and for now I got
to go fix a runtime error so thanks for
