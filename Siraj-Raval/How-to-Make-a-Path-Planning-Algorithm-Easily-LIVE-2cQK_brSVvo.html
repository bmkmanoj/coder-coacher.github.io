mute myself alright alright guys hello
world hello world Suraj is back in
business and ready to go hi guys alright
hey everybody uh hello hello Lorna is
Jean Francois Spencer sunny Jason uh
nabob dongho Locke xie tianhua everybody
okay so today we aren't going to play
with computer vision
I love computer vision computer vision
is one of my great joys in life
especially in college I used to just
like use OpenCV all the time for side
projects and we're going to use it today
we're gonna use OpenCV to take an image
it's gonna be a 10 by 10 square it's
gonna be a grid it's gonna have
obstacles in it and what we're gonna do
is we're gonna look we're gonna iterate
through all of these squares and see
which ones are obstacles and we're gonna
print those obstacles out by reading in
the image with computer vision and and
we're going to find the shortest path
from the starting image to the image
that is matching it okay and I'm gonna
show you guys at an image before we
start a little demo it's uh after the QA
and that's gonna be awesome but first
I'm gonna do a five-minute Q&amp;amp;A like
always uh and then we are going to get
started with the code all right
so 5 minute Q&amp;amp;A here we go and by the
way thanks guys for showing up during
finals week I know it's it I know it's a
busy time I'm just here to augment your
learning experience all right Daniels
challenge yes Daniel Schiffman and I
have been collaborating I'm gonna make a
game bot for one of the games that he
makes and it's gonna be awesome will you
do videos on Watson services I actually
do have a video on it's called uh it's
called uh what's it called buildin a I
know it's called tone analysis and I use
Watson API what's your target audience
I'm looking to target develop
um who are between you know eighteen to
you know sixty plus whatever ideally I
want to get kids involved as well that
would be awesome that makes me really
happy when I have like 12 13 year-olds
watching so I want to so I want to
expand to kids but right now it's kind
of like college-age kids and higher in
high school uh any experience in FIRST
Robotics yeah I did I helped out what I
volunteered with a FIRST Robotics
Competition in New York when I went to
school at Columbia was awesome
how did you learn all this AI I studied
subreddit the machine learning subreddit
Twitter feeds
articles just the Internet the internet
and then just a collection of sources
over time you get better and better at
it hey Suraj will you cover transfer
learning later
that's a great question that he'll I
absolutely will and I think the future
of machine learning is in transfer
learning we can't just create a bot that
just has to learn everything from
scratch every time and with opening eyes
universe that's gonna be that's gonna
that's gonna happen faster we're
learning ml with our in University what
do you think about that I think you guys
should switch to Python because R is not
as compatible with a bunch of other non
machine learning libraries that you
might want to integrate into the apps
that you're writing where you posted
that you're doing live broadcasts I'm
trying to find a spot where I can post
that um I haven't really found one so
it's just Wednesdays at 10:00 a.m. I I'm
kind of not like wanted to like
officially say that because I don't want
to commit to doing live every week but
you know what I just keep doing it and I
love you guys and I do it for you so
just I'm committing right now every
Wednesday and 10 a.m. is a live session
I might not be on for like New Year's or
Christmas or whatever um not that I
celebrate that's you know I do celebrate
New Year this is my favorite holiday of
the year because this celebration of the
future but yeah Wednesdays at 10:00 a.m.
are my live sessions hey Suraj which
laptop config for deep learning is gtx
1070 good enough yeah any of the GTX
series by Nvidia is a good it's a good
bet would Python and Java be the future
of programming Python is definitely
growing very fast and in popularity Java
kind of had its heyday and I feel like
it's getting less cool over time and I
also think go is a language that is
up-and-coming
what are your new year plans I am going
to throw the sickest New Year's Eve
party at my place I've invited some
YouTube celebs that I met in LA I
invited some oh my god it's gonna be
awesome
I love New Year's it is a celebration of
the future future of Python a future of
Python as a language I mean I think I
think we're going to have more and more
abstractions so things will be easier to
do in the future
hey Suraj do you read the wait Y blog
yes I love that guy he is a great writer
as someone who writes an essay basically
for my videos my scripts every week that
guy is a great writer how do you use PHP
in Python and machine learning watch my
videos now PHP though Python is not
really a programming language it's a
scripting language guys don't confuse
semantics ok ok so I'm gonna answer two
more questions and then we're gonna get
right into decode all right which book
do you recommend for machine learning so
uh machine learning a probabilistic
approach is a great one which you need
it'd you go to Columbia University a
Suraj please say hi Karthik there you go
ok alright one more how to build an AI
girlfriend ok so oh my god ok I've
thought about this quite a bit actually
so so so this that would be a generative
model right that would be a generative
model which that a lot of a lot of work
is going into generative models right
now and um it's one of those new
exciting fields in machine learning of
like not having to discriminate between
two classes but to generate something
from scratch after having been trained
on some data so a building and AI
girlfriend would be a generative model
and you want to train it on a corpus of
text that a real girlfriend would say
and then it would be a chatbot a
girlfriend like chat bot ok do I work
for Google no I don't work for Google
I'm meeting them like I think next week
or the week after that we're gonna see
what we can do but I'm not gonna just
straight up ok I'm not committing to
anything but I'm keeping the door open
right now I don't work for anybody
my goal is this guy's my goal is to
continue this channel make it awesome
for you guys ok that's the goal ok so
that's it for questions
what are
okay one more what are your thoughts on
VR in ER BR the daydream is awesome I
just got the daydream I got the new
Google pixel phone it and it is awesome
the daydream is VR is the future I can't
wait and also AR I'm gonna make a movie
sometime in the future like an action
movie starring myself so it's like
starring Suraj
I'm gonna have like AR it's gonna be
awesome oh my god no just anyway okay so
okay here we go we're gonna get started
um what I'm gonna do is screen share and
then we're going to get started all
right let's get started screen sharing
time boom okay so I'm going to um I'm
going to demo what we're gonna do first
this time all right so I'm gonna demo
what we're gonna do first
the first thing I'm gonna do is say this
is what its gonna look like okay it's
better than explaining its benefit just
demo what's happening here so I'm gonna
say run this run the code of what its
gonna do so take a look at this you see
the image it is we are in this is the
image we have it is a it is a grid of
squares and what it is doing it is it is
iterating through every square in that
grid and once it's iterated through
every square in that grid it's going to
print out the coordinates of where the
ops the obstacles are okay that's what
it's gonna do uh and it's gonna print
out its gonna look like this right here
okay it's gonna print the occupy bridge
and then the planned path and the
planned path is going to be from this
initial image this Blue Square and it's
going to find the closest image in
similarity okay uh and which is going to
be like this square right here and then
it's going to show the path between both
of them okay in terms of x and
y-coordinates so that's what we're gonna
do okay and we're gonna use computer
vision to do that alright so here we go
um by the way tutorials on opening a
universe I'm gonna talk with them about
creating a video series so we'll see how
that works okay and by the way guys I
want to I want to interview Elon so like
keep that on the DL but like
that's the goal for that interview
series like I want to work my way up to
Ilan so I'll get that okay so I'm gonna
make this bigger so we can all read it
okay so here we go here we go okay
so we're gonna we're gonna build this
alright and it's gonna use computer
vision to read this this grid of squares
and it's gonna be awesome okay so here
we go you can see my cursor that's fine
so the first thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna import open CV open CV is
the library EPS a long list open CV is
the library for computer vision okay
even image segmentation finding objects
in images it is the go-to library for
computer vision okay the only problem
with open CV is that it is hard as f to
install okay I would recommend using
anaconda to install CV so it'd be like
Conda install CV okay that's how I do it
but yeah open CV is the computer vision
library okay so that's what we're gonna
use to read our images the next thing
we're gonna import is numpy compliance
are signed for the computing library
okay and we're gonna use it to perform
some some matrix math okay because
images are just matrices right there are
a collection of ones and zeros an image
can be broken down to two bytes right
bits okay so the next one is import is
importing time which is going to make
it's gonna help us measure how how long
we are going to run this program for
okay so the next import we're gonna
import the next library were gonna
import is called sidekick image okay and
let me explain why we are importing this
so I'm going to import a specific sub
module from psychic image okay it is
called ssim now what is SS I am in SS I
am is the main structural similarity
index okay between two images so if we
have two images we need a way of
measuring how similar they are okay and
this meet the meet the structural
similarity index is a way of measuring
how similar two images are so we take
two images and we break them down into
matrices we can then see how similar
they are by counting the ones and zeros
and the positions of each of them and
then having some kind of rough score
of how similar these two matrices are
but we're okay
so that's what we're gonna do with that
um the next thing we're going to import
is a is a helper class called a star
search now a star search is probably the
most popular path finding algorithm out
there okay a star search is a heuristic
it is it is an algorithm that works to
find the shortest path between two
possible points that's what a star
search does okay it's used in games like
World of Warcraft 3 to find the shortest
possible path so what we do is we search
among all the possible paths to a
solutions ok and then we look for the
one that incurs the smallest cost that
is the least distance travel the
shortest time and among these paths it
first considers the ones that appear to
leave the most quickly to the solution
so it's a heuristic it kind of tries to
it tries to have an educated guess on of
all the possible paths which is the one
that is most likely to read to the exact
solution vein hop vine - is exactly
right it's Dijkstra's with a direction
that is a great description if you know
about Dijkstra's algorithm it is like
Dijkstra's what but with direction ok so
that's what a star is I'm gonna explain
more about a star later on when we
implement it but let's get to our next
and last import which is a helper class
called traversal and that's just like a
fried line of code helper class it's
gonna help us traverse the image from
left to right for image processing ok
those are our helper libraries now we
can get started and start writing our
code I'm gonna get started by writing
out the main code ok and it's going to
take one parameter what is that
parameter going to be well it's going to
be the image now let me show you guys
the image ok let me show you guys the
image I'm going to go into test images
and I'm going to open one of those test
images alright so we already have an
image we're not going to construct this
image from scratch what our program is
going to do is it's going to read this
image using computer vision it's going
to read that image and it's going to
detect where those obstacles are it's
what you find it's going to find the
shortest
between two of those objects and it's
going to list what all of those grits
what are all all the squares that have
objects in them okay so that's what that
looks like okay so so um so anyway okay
so the next thing we want to do is start
writing our code so to start writing our
code we're gonna start off by creating
two arrays to a rig the first array is
going to be the octave the occupied
Grizz so we want to create an array so
we can store which grids are being
occupied in memory um all right and I'm
gonna share the image and then share the
code at the end of this video okay so so
the plan path is going to be and the
occupied grades occupied grits nitrides
grids language is important guys okay
all right so so those are our two arrays
and we're gonna store data in them later
the next step is to load the image okay
now we're gonna load the image so we're
gonna say image equals and we're gonna
use now we're gonna use OpenCV and what
OpenCV is going to do is just going to
read an image what's the what's the
image it well we just pass it in as a
parameter
it's that file name okay uh well so and
in terms of machine learning is this
using machine learning uh the answer is
yes technically we are not ourselves
implementing a learning algorithm but
OpenCV has used machine learning to
train the the classes that it's had
so it's indirectly using machine
learning from a more abstract layer okay
so and I think it's important to do that
sometimes okay so so we've loaded our
image into memory now we've taken that
image that I just showed you guys and
we've loaded it into memory it is in RAM
it is in memory okay it is just sitting
there temporarily and now we're gonna
modify it
okay so we've loaded our image and we oh
we also want to define what the size of
that image is going to be okay it's
gonna be 60 by 60 pixels that's the size
of each of those squares alright now we
want to create an array of obstacles so
we're going to list those obstacles and
we want a starting point okay so the
starting point is going to be the index
which is one by one that's that's that's
where our first that's where our first
we're gonna hard code that and that is
where our first object it is going to be
it's gonna be at the one one position
and by the way XY coordinates are how
we're going to view this entire grade
and okay so yeah alright so there's that
so now we're going to create a blank
image I'm gonna create a blank image and
it's when we can be initialized as a
matrix of zeros okay
so when I say blank image is going to
get and we're gonna use now we're going
to use numpy it's like to create a
matrix of zero that is of length 60 by
60 okay and it's going to be the type is
going to be an integer okay so we have
we have to default find that ah and
let's see I need one more thingy here
there we go boom so that's that blank
image and we're going to now we're going
to we've got our blank image and now we
want to create an array we're gonna
create an array of we're gonna create an
array of hundred blank images okay why
because we have a 10 by 10 square and we
want to initialize blank images that we
can then fill in right so this is this
is gonna serve as a starting point for
us okay so we're gonna say Liz images
which is going to be an array and we're
gonna say blank image for I in X range
10 so so what are we doing here what
we're doing here let me clean this in a
second what we're doing here is we are
create a list of images okay we're
putting a list of images and it's a it's
a it's a list of blank images okay and
so now we went up we want an array to
represent a range uh let's see
okay so in range 10 so now we're going
to create a make the maze itself okay so
so now we are going to or I in x-ray
okay so now we have our maze so the maze
is it's an empty matrix to represent the
grids of individually cropped images
okay so we have that now we're gonna be
our traversal traversal time traversal
time okay so let's go okay let's go down
here so now we're gonna now we're gonna
actually start to traverse through our
images okay so for for every so for each
coordinate the XY coordinate inside of
the window for I in right thank you for
then um for XY window in the traversal
okay that sliding window and let me let
me explain this after I type it this is
this lines gonna be a little long so
we're gonna say image step size is going
to be sixty and then the window size is
going to be window size is going to be
with and we Heights okay the width and
the height and we've defined that and
they're not gonna be back it's going to
be not curly bracket it's gonna be
parentheses of course it's gonna be
parentheses we love our parentheses um
okay so what is this doing here so what
we're doing is we are traversing through
each square and we are using our
traversal helper class to the sliding
window is the one method that it has
that it just literally its slide it's it
starts from the the left and it slide
through a single grid and it reads it
okay and it reads it and it takes that
data in it and it puts it into memory
okay so what we do what we need though
is what we're trying to do is we're
trying to first this is what we're
trying to do we're trying to detect the
squares that are that are that have
something in them that have a detect
non-empty squares because we're gonna
print those in a second that's what
we're doing right now so but so we need
to start off by saying wait a second if
the winter doesn't
meet our desired window size then ignore
it ignore it because we're looking for a
specific type of up image okay so we're
gonna say if window dot shape mean
window size or window shape oh sorry
is not equal to windows height or window
dot shape is not equal to the windows
with then we're going to continue but
that means we're not gonna run this code
window that shit that means it's not the
size that we're looking for so that's
just a check okay that's just a check
we're just making sure like this is the
size we're looking for but if we have
that oh let me oh right so we need to
line two we gotta gotta remember our
indentations everybody this is Python
ain't no joke ain't no joke okay so now
we're going to print the index images
our iterator and okay so now we're going
to say take that image and copy it what
does that mean so now so we performed
our check we performed our check and
we're going to say that we perform our
check we're gonna say okay we've got a
square and it's not it's it's it's it's
it's it's an actual image with a with
something in it which so we want to we
want to create a clone of it and so
that's where the copy function comes in
the copy function will take that image
it's gonna put it into this variable
called clone and so now we can format
the square for OpenCV so now that we
have that image we want to format it
properly so OpenCV can read it okay so
we're gonna say we're gonna we're gonna
use a rectangle function to define an
OpenCV rectangle and what is it square
it is a it is a type of rectangle okay
so line 24 someone said that there is
something happening here
they said that boom I think that's what
it was and then I remove that and right
okay cool okay so so so now we have our
CB rectangle and we're gonna take that
clone image that we just created we're
using the copy function
we're going to say fourth for the X Y
values and so we've created our
rectangle and we want it to be at max
it's gonna be whatever the length is of
the window and then we're gonna say Y
Plus windows height and then lastly we
want to define the entire size of this
by 255 0 and then shoot okay so now
we've got a rectangle and so now we can
so we can crop that image and crop that
image we could say well we in order to
prop that image and this is this is kind
of where like a little bit I'm hoping to
be magical to the place we want to say
okay so for that windows with and for
that height we want to we want to create
a crop so it's just so it's just a let
me see so someone said that change the
last X range on line 24 to square
brackets to parentheses the last X range
and the Oh gotcha gotcha gotcha gotcha
yes good call thank you good call boom
there we go so where was I so cropping
images right that's so very important
stuff cropping images so now we want to
say let's win height so the crop is not
right so I'm going to define how we're
gonna I'm gonna talk about how we're
gonna you know get that image so once we
cropped it we we we now want to add it
to the array of images okay so because
this is an image that has something in
it then all we're trying to that's all
we're trying to do is we're trying to
create an image that has something in it
okay so we're saying the index of one so
we're going to so the list of images but
so is an array and we've we've created
that and we want to what do we want to
give it we want to give it the crop
image that we've just created and how do
we give it back using open CDs copy
function
okay so we've added it to that list of
images and now we want to print the
occupy grids so we can print the occupy
grids now okay so how do we do that um
should there be a comma between X Y yes
good call
thank you Nick it should be a comma
death okay so now we're gonna print the
occupied Brits so in order to do that we
want to get the average color so we need
to we need to get that average color so
the color is something we're going to
use we're going to create using open CV
so we're gonna say the color per row
that's how we're gonna start off we want
the average color per row how do we get
that well numpy has a great function
called average okay and how do we get
the average well the average is
basically taking that image or crop
image that we just that we just got and
belong to zero access to get that thank
you to get that average color okay and
so that's the average color per row now
we want to get the average color for our
specific square okay um so n peanut
average so I'm gonna take the average
color per row and up from that row from
that row we we just want the average of
what we've already taken which is going
to give us the average color of the
square we not okay um and so once we
have that finally we're if we want to
well we're going to convert that to an
integer and hitted your value week I
took work why are we doing that because
we need to format it properly for opt to
read it and the best way to do that is
to have it be um if you Mick I think
someone I think it was Meg who said that
or somebody no Gio Gio thank you so now
we are going to convert it to an int you
and eight and then and we average color
okay so we have our average color of
whatever square we're on right now and
so now what we can do is we can what's
the next step what is the next step our
next step is to
iterate through the color matrix okay
we're gonna iterate through the color
matrix so we have so packs or iterate
through the color or matrix you got it
right through the color matrix and so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
iterate through the color matrix so that
we can we can we can add it to our tour
to our array okay
NP average so someone said something
about rights so that is actually a
parentheses thank you okay so if any so
okay so what are we doing here um we are
going to say so if any but the color is
less than 244 I so let me explain why
I'm using 240 as an index here in
average an average color Bob but what
we're saying here is check if it's not
majority white if it's not majority
white then we want to add it to our home
okay something is here array okay so
that's that's so to answer some of these
questions from up there
how do we know like if images are like
all different types of shapes and colors
and sizes how do we know like which
what's-what's had to use well this is
how we just say if is the image majority
white or not and 240 kind of defines
that threshold okay
hazy upper case first later 38 thank you
okay okay so that's how we're gonna do
that
that's what I say okay so maze this is
not the Bob for the asteroid game that
is coming up soon right now this is to
use computer vision to detect images
yeah hold on
so what we're gonna do here is going to
say for maze index 1 1 minus 1 and then
index 0 minus 1 okay
so I don't need that equals one so if
it's not if not majority white okay so
if it's not majority white we're gonna
we're going to add it to our maze and
then we're going to say let's add it to
our occupied for a so awkward great shot
append the append function we'll add it
to our array but in Shh
that is true Jordan occupied grid stop
append and so what how are we gonna add
it well we're gonna add it as a tuple
what is it pupal but pupil is a it's a
it's not a double but tuple has as three
values in it okay
it takes like a triplet and use it wow I
just related music to programming that's
awesome
okay so to pull down index so these are
the terms that are occupied um or
iterating through the color matrix okay
so now we want to so now we've had it
like objects okay it's like the blue
squares and the red triangles and
whatever now we want to add the let me
show that image one more time let me
show the image
okay so we've added all of these we've
added all of these we'll see that we've
added all those that are not black and
they're not white they're just like red
and blue and green that's what we added
to our array but now what we want to add
are the images that are all black okay
and so in that image it doesn't show it
but there are images that are black and
we want to add those to our we want to
add those to our array so case we're
gonna do the same thing and this time
the threshold is going to be 20 because
that defines black okay in hexadecimal
context code four colors okay so we're
gonna take our obstacles array and we're
going to we're gonna append a tuple
index okay and we've done that and so
now what do we want to do now what we
want to do is say we're gonna we've
appended that off so the next step is to
what is the
next step here it's like so we've we've
added that we want to make sure that our
image is a tuple we've added that today
a list now what what can we do
okay I've got it okay now we can
actually show this iteration we can
actually print it we've done what we
needed to do and in order to do that
we're going to say image show and the
window right so that's it so this is
open TVs way of showing whatever we have
in our window but guess what it's not a
continuous thing it's not a continuous
thing it's just like if we just did this
if we didn't do anything else it would
just pop the image up for a second but
guess what we need to sequentially show
what is happening and how do we sweep
line 48 needs a parenthesis at the end
let's see line 48 needs a parenthesis at
the end buh-buh-buh-buh-buh yes good
call and then and there and there and
there and there and there and then this
doesn't need it great okay
okay so that's we're going to show the
image and we're going to say what else
we're gonna do we're gonna wait to blue
um is I will marry you before it split
second a little more married okay
divorce okay there you go it dreams come
true okay so wait key is one and now
okay so what are we doing so now we're
gonna use that time function that we
that we called and why are we go using
that time function uh we're using that
time function to show that hey we want
to keep continuously showing this image
and we are waiting a little bit we're
gonna sleep and then we gonna keep
showing it okay uh so so that's what we
use a time function for so now okay so
that that's what so what that's gonna do
is just going to do this it's going to
let me let me show what that's that all
that coded I just do it's going to print
out the occupied grits right up here we
haven't done the planned path yet we
just print out the occupied grits and
it's gonna print it out as a as a an
array of tuple values okay XY
coordinates okay um so that
what it is YouTube chat is indeed a good
debugger it's not the best debugger but
it is up there for sure the best
debugger is probably like goes debugger
go the go programming language man that
awesome
okay lore Dias is right I need to slow
down and fix some stuff okay so that's
what that's gonna do let me see what
these people whatever what everyone's
saying here so having a 48:42 3769 said
it's definitely not line 69 because I'm
not there haha but let's see 37:42 um 47
so what's happening on 47 so in online
47 ah let's see I in average color
exactly okay okay so I need to keep
going now make the variables lowercase
first letter line 38 right right 27 hi
in average color for ID and an average
color okay cool okay so so now now it's
climb to perform the shortest path
search okay so okay so we did half of it
now we're gonna do the other half line
51 4 I'm in average color and any okay
but we've done that so Nikhil has why
don't we have all the grids that are not
white to the array that's that's exactly
what we did right here this line line 49
okay so now it's time to perform
shortest path
okay so let's perform shortest path so
the first thing we want to do is we want
to get the list of objects okay so that
we that we just created we want to get
the list of objects why because we're
gonna find the shortest path between one
of them and then the one that is closest
matching to it we want to find the
shortest path so when it's a list of
colored grits now this has not been
great that of black these are the grades
that are objects okay um
right Thank You Gio deal and multi shit
okay so okay so now we want to say for n
for 10 and occupied rigs if n not in
obstacles okay so now we're going to so
if they're not obstacles so that means
we just want to get the objects okay so
we've got the objects and now it's time
to now it's time to actually do our
algorithm okay so for the start Monteux
but now it's time okay so so for that
starting image so that so what is our
star image our target is going to be
this one right up here you see hold on
Vince's arts hold on this is our
starting image see this blue one right
here that is our starting image and what
its gonna do is going to find the
closest image to that which is going to
because it's gonna iterate from left to
right and do that for every row and so
if it's doing that from left right
what's gonna be the closed please
what's gonna be the the matching image
it's going to be this ah other blue
square CVM show correct okay so for
start image in the list of color grids
color grids so okay so we're gonna go
through that and we're gonna say well we
want to we want to define our start
image and we're gonna create a temporary
array to show that okay start manage
start you know now we're gonna say okay
um well create another copy of it
because we're about to perform some
we're gonna compare that image to the
next image and so image one is going to
be the one that changes okay that's
gonna be the one that that changes wrist
colored grids to let's go alright so
list um
images in the start image 0-1 and then
start image 1 this one why are we using
two copies that's a great question we're
using two copies because we are
to one of those copies is going to
change right because we're gonna be
iterating through the grid and we're
gonna change the value of that copy
every time so that we can compute these
the similarity between the two images
and we're gonna perform a star search
once we found the image that is most
similar okay okay so now so now now our
actual so now it's time to hold on I
want to answer a single question because
I think it's a really important question
is it realistic to believe that a new
startup can contribute more influential
research than deepmind or just work at a
top company like Google yes absolutely
why because the tools to make machine
learning like breakthroughs are the
barrier to entry is root being reduced
both in terms of processing power to
make valuable contributions open a eyes
universe is going to make it much easier
for the amateur research community to
make valuable contributions and it's
really not as hard as you think like
it's really not as hard as you think and
I would definitely not be discouraged
from working on your own to make
valuable contributions okay so so I just
want to answer that - now before now
we're going to do the actual iteration
for the grid in n for n in Wisc colored
grids if n is not equal to the start
image so if it's not people to the start
image then it's a different image so
we're going to say get that next image
get that next image there's going to be
image and we're gonna take that list of
images that we already had and this one
and then the grid alone read your one
red one minus one okay and there's
definitely gonna be something make sure
I have all of this here okay so now okay
so here's the fun part here's the fun
part
okay now we're gonna convert so now we
have two images right they were original
image and we have the image that we are
now iterating through and guess what we
want to convert that image
to greyscale why do we want to do that
let me talk about why we want to convert
both of those images to greyscale okay
so let me first
let me first first actually convert them
to greyscale using the CVT color
function we're going to take that image
and we're going to convert it BR to gray
color BGR to gray now we're gonna take a
second image and we're gonna convert
that to greyscale okay and uh right so
both of our images we're gonna convert
to grayscale why do we want to do that
let me finish
typing this out boom okay so we have
done that make sure that there's no like
all right great um so now we have so why
are we converting it to grayscale well
because greyscale is is how all right
double underscore basically is so when
we when we're doing computer vision we
we first have to convert those images to
grayscale because it lowers a
dimensionality of what we are trying to
compare and why is that important
because colors are just colors make an
image more complex they make the images
more complex than necessary when we
convert an image to grayscale and we
compare them by some by computing some
index function it just makes it it makes
it faster if it's both it's both
computationally more efficient to
compare them because it's not about the
color it's about the difference in the
positions of the pixels in the matrix
okay because that's the similarity we're
not really can we're not comparing
similarity of color or comparing
similarity of shape that's when we
convert to grayscale that makes it
faster to compare it okay so that's what
we're converting to grayscale okay so
now we're gonna actually compute that
similarity and how do we do that compare
structural similar
well guess what we imported a function
the SSS I am function between both of
those grayscale images okay now once we
have that so if they aren't similar so
now we've now that we've compared them
and so guess what they are similar then
we're going to perform a start search if
they are similar we'll search will
perform a star okay
and guys if anybody has any questions
definitely like answer like help me out
and answer them in the comments okay so
so how do we say what's the threshold
here well we're gonna define ninety
percent ninety percent similarity and
we're gonna define 90% as point naught
okay
um I guess what that does not have
parenthesis okay
now perform a start I guess what we
imported that a start search up there
and if we have time at the end I'm gonna
go into this code and we're going to
talk about like the details at the
implementation and I'm gonna explain it
as well right now okay so how are you
worried performing a star on on the maze
oh right thank you on the maze okay that
we had the start image starting at zero
and what is that that next image that we
have the start image letting out one
minus one this is lowercase and then
lastly we want to let's say what are we
computing this on while we're computing
it on the grid that we created minus one
because we and so it's gonna take or for
ammidon I'm gonna explain this in a
second um minus one okay but what's
happening here we're performing a star
search what is a star search well a star
search is basically us looking at all
the possible paths okay and then so
we're so we are look we are searching
through all possible paths but we are
using a heuristic that says what is the
one that is most likely to reach the end
goal in the shortest
possible time so what is it what is
likely to be the shortest possible path
and this is the heuristic we use at
every step as we traverse through what
we essentially it's a graph it is a
graph problem there's not a graph there
but it is a graph problem and grid is
misspelled thank you okay so now we've
done that we want to print the result so
we're gonna say we're gonna print the
result a star equals Baxters with
heuristics exactly a start is die trips
with Karissa's so now we can print the
result and we're gonna print it as a
list as a list but you to a video and a
star research and hold someone explain
curious it's my manicurist six I think
that's a great idea and I will do that
in the future yes okay um but now we
want to print our results because we
performed a start and guess what we're
performing a star in a week right it's
not just so we're performing it for
every object it's not just one on so
we're performing it for every object
that we see so and we're gonna print the
result if it's gonna come out in the
results right so it's so we're gonna say
what is the result look like well it's a
collection of XY coordinates all right
then we're gonna get from that first um
first oh okay so now we're gonna append
the list and we're gonna add that tuple
that we just that we just are defined
through the list boom
and so now the result becomes for list
let's - one
okay but that's what we have there all
right um cool so now what we can do is
we can define the we wonder okay I think
oh so there's one more thing we have to
do and then we're done but one more
little loop we're gonna say we want to
if no match object is down then we want
to return no match okay so it's gonna
show no match so in the list of color
grids and a list of colored grids hmm we
want to say it's in the plan path it's
in the plan path there is if it has the
key of the object that we created before
um um a planned path object list we want
to print no match okay that means that
there was nothing there there was never
anything there in the first place
I mean thought a start search was
unsuccessful and we want to print for
that okay so that's it okay um
boom Hey so now it's time for me method
my dad is calling he's probably like
yeah you're doing good and how are you I
love you you know I love my dad he's a
great guy um well I think in retrospect
he's a great guy you know just like it's
hard to be a parent okay so we've done
we've done our code we can now print
this out your main method okay if name
is main what is our image file name well
we're gonna define it right here image
file name image file name is going to be
in that test images folder that's image
one alright dot jpg so now we feed that
image into it right this is double
equals yes exactly and now ah we're on
our main function on that that's it
that's it and now we can run this thing
okay boom main image okay line 90 use
double yep did that all right okay so
what do we do what do we just do we've
created two arrays we iterated through
this to
grid okay we said we said show show us
the occupied grids print them all out as
a list of tuples and then use a star
search to find a shortest path between
this initial blue and then this one
right here okay dude you almost feel
like there's there's too many lines here
there's 48 17 is a lot okay so let's
print this let's let's let's hold on
hold on so I need to delete this this
don't those hold on let me force quit
that I'll try again
think about you can see the animation
right it's interning through every one
of those it's using OpenCV it's copying
each image into memory it's comparing
them by a structural similarity index
and it's going to print out the list and
the list is going to look like this the
plan path and the Occupy crits okay
great cool all right I'm gonna post this
code to github and okay stop screen
sharing okay so I'm gonna post this code
to github I'm going to explain it in the
readme and I'm going to make a video on
heuristics and a-star searches in the
future and uh it's gonna be awesome and
I'm gonna end this with another five
minutes you a and then we are we are
done okay why not draw the path says Pro
survivor that could have been a great
idea and that is definitely something
that can be added as a functionality to
this code as well um actually I'm gonna
enter for questions okay so any
undergraduate project ideas using
machine learning preferably sentiment
analysis based yes okay here's what you
do
use a Twitter API to find some talk
first of all thing about topic that you
really want to perform sentiment
analysis on so you want to see what
people are thinking about a specific
topic okay and then use a Twitter API to
retrieve a list of tweets about that
topic
and then perform sentiment analysis
using to start off try scikit-learn okay
try scikit-learn
and then you I have a video on this look
at my video called Twitter sentiment
analysis and then do that that whole
idea but apply it to your own topic okay
that would be a great undergraduate
research project well that's question
one of four we have three more are those
Bose headphones yes QC 35
have you written any cool ml AI things
to help you in your day-to-day life uh
in my day to day life no actually I I
would love to do that um no I haven't
okay and the last one is do you have any
key word about 3d path planning uh key
word about 3d path planning I don't know
what you mean by that
a key word well you volunteered to be
one of the first people to go to Mars
when you interview Elon Musk I'm
definitely going to Mars guys I'm
definitely going to Mars it's inevitable
it's something that I hits in my ten
year plan I want to start a new nation
on Mars someday ah but that's in the
future anyway
do you believe oh no here's a good one
do you believe an AMD will be a big
player like Nvidia nml they just showed
some benchmarks yesterday you know AMD
is late to the game NVIDIA has made so
much progress and it's already not just
progress not just in terms of its it's
computing project progress uh in the
chip technology but also in its
partnerships right with Google right um
so I don't think AMD is gonna be able to
catch up to the momentum that Nvidia has
built and NVIDIA is just a great brand
as well okay so anyway that's it for
this live stream thanks guys so much for
showing up I love you guys um for now
I've got to go focus on this video and
I've got to interview this opening I
researcher for my next interview on
Friday so thanks for watching bye guys
