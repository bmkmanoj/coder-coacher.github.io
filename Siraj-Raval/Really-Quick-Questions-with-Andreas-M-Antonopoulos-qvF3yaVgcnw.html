what's the most beautiful thing in the
world well that's a hard one
I don't pass what do you want to work on
the most machine learning applications
in blockchain what are the people you've
met at blockchain conferences like well
it depends if it's a blockchain banking
conference it's mostly full of
douchebags and if it's a Bitcoin
conference it's full of cypher punks and

thing that excites you meeting people

learning publishing algorithms what is
one really cool use case for blockchain
that you haven't seen done yet
large-scale remittances to third-world
countries do you think will create
mainstream decentralized apps in your
lifetime yes absolutely if you ran the
world what is one law you'd enact
disbanding the authority that allowed me
to run the world what's a problem that
you would love to see solved
concentration of power in fewer and

from blockchain that it's co-opted by
centralized powers and has to be
disrupted yet again by something else
