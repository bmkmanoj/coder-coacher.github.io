computers how do they work and how do
they benefit AI let's talk a little bit
about the theory and then we'll build a
very simple quantum algorithm by the way
the machine that you're using to watch
this video whether it's a laptop or a
phone is an example of a classical
computer
it's a general-purpose machine we can
code up an algorithm give it some
quality data and theoretically it can
accomplish pretty much any task
we'd like streaming live video creating
immersive three-dimensional environments
eliminating existential dread actually
it doesn't do that yet but at their core
all classical computers do something
really basic under the hood behind every
software application is a series of
simple math operations any task we want
to perform on a computer like booking
applies or playing a game is translate
it into a string of ones and zeros which
act as input that is processed by an
algorithm which then outputs a new
string of 1 to 0
algorithms in all their complexity in
the end just manipulate strings of bits
where each bit is either a 1 or a 0 we
use ones and zeroes because they're a
way of representing information such
that it can only be in one of two
different states Computers run on
electricity duh when a computer wants to
send information from one place to
another it sends pulses of electricity
over a wire computers use transistors
that can either be closed so that a
current flows or open which means there
isn't a current both states are
represented using either a 1 or 0
they're like light switches either on or
off so when these ones and zeros are
strength together they can represent any
number or letter using binary code
computer
Youth circuits called logic gates that
are composed of transistors connected
together and they compare patterns of
bits to turn them into new patterns of
bits using simple arithmetic hard drives
store one zeros by changing the magnetic
poles of small parts of a metal disk
positive and negative charges are
represented by ones and zeros
respectively so computers do these two
things really well they store numbers in
memory and can process these numbers
with simple math operations I'm just
like you those four terrhagen
let's make binary grade again in 1965
the founder of Intel Gordon Moore
predicted that the number of transistors
per square inch on integrated circuits
would continue to double every 18 months
so far it's proven to be true but there
is a calming plateau in transistor
density we can only make them so small
before the laws of physics stop us the
idea of quantum computing is a potential
solution and that's why interest in it
has increased in recent years the word
quantum in physics means the minimum
amount of any physical entity involved
in interaction so a photon is a single
quantum of light for example that's it's
real scientific definition but it's also
used colloquially sometimes to mean the
opposite like quantum leap or by
anything Deepak Chopra says the
aficionados in the world of quantum
physics have somehow hijacked the word
for their own use quantum physics deals
with the world of atoms and the
subatomic particles inside of them it's
really badass because on the atomic
scale the laws of classical physics no
longer apply richard fineman put it best
when he said things on a very small
scale behave like nothing you have any
direct experience about or like anything
that you have ever seen
tiny particles like electrons and
photons can take on several states at
the same time that a larger scale would
be mutually exclusive they can be in
several places at once or exhibit two
kinds of polarization at the same time
we're not able to see this superposition
of different states because it
disappears once someone tries to measure
it nobody really knows how that happens
but it does we can use this concept of
superposition to free computers from
having binary constraints quantum
computers use particles magnetically
suspended in near absolute zero
temperatures to represent not bits but Q
bits instead of representing either 1 or
0 they can also represent both
simultaneously ok so you might be
thinking big deal could you just achieve
superposition on a classical computer by
just using two ordinary bits at the same
time no need for a qubit and because
there's more to quantum physics than
just superposition there's also the idea
of entanglement if we have a system of
more than one qubit these particles are
not independent of each other they're
entangled so in a system of two qubits
the outcome of one qubit tells you what
you will see when you measure the other
qubit particles can be entangled even if
they are separated in space by huge
distances Einstein called entanglement
spooky action at a distance
that's my Einstein voice what that means
is that you can't just describe a system
of several qubits using descriptions of
individual qubits you have to describe
the correlations between qubits and as
you increase the number of them the
number of correlations grows
exponentially so for a system of just
three hundred qubits you need more
numbers than there are atoms in
visible universe to describe think about
that for a second
so because we can't just write down the
info contained in a system of a few
hundred qubits using classical bits
maybe a computer running on these qubits
can perform tasks that classical
computers couldn't achieve that's why
people think quantum computing holds a
lot of promise so let's build a simple
quantum algorithm in Python using IBM's
quantum API to learn more you can sign
up for access to their API easily on
their website then download the SDK to
use it in Python
after we import it we're going to build
a voyage yoga algorithm one of the first
quantum Hall goes to be proposed we are
given a quantum computer known as an
Oracle that implements some function s
it takes n digit binary values as input
and produces either a 0 or 1 as output
for each value the function is constant
0 on all inputs or 1 on all inputs it
could also be balanced so it returns 1
for half of the input domain and 0 for
the other half the task is to decide if
F is constant or balanced by using the
Oracle first we'll initialize a quantum
program object with a quantum and
classical register holding three bits
the program lets us manipulate quantum
circuits and each circuit has a set of
data registers well apply was called a
Hadamard gate to every two-bit so now
all the possible states are including
likely to be observed for every possible
state will apply the Oracle in our case
the Oracle is a balanced function then
we'll apply the H gate to all the qubits
once more and that's it for our
algorithm for a constant function we can
expect a 100% chance of observing all
zeros and for a balanced function we can
expect anything else this shows that a
blackbox problem can be solved
efficiently by a quantum computer with
no error whereas a classical computer
would need way more queries to the black
box to solve the problem
I've sacrificed relationships for
greatness the ten have yet to create
their masterpiece intelligence in
England right so there are three
takeaways here quantum physics is a
study of physical phenomena that happen
at the atomic or subatomic level
quantum computing takes advantage of
quantum physics to allow for more
efficient algorithms and cubed not this
are the fundamental unit of quantum
computing capable of simultaneously
representing both a 1 and a 0 The Wizard
of the week is no one look down the
challenge was to build a q-learning bot
and knowing you care offs that train a
DQ learner in the carpool environment
until it was able to successfully
balance itself love the animation at the
end great work and run around is a Jawa
you tensorflow to build with DQ end of
the game break out with no high-level
rappers nicely done the coding challenge
for this week is to try your hand at
building a simple quantum algorithm
using IBM's API details are in the
readme poster github link in the
comments and I'll announce the winner
next week I hope you like this video
please subscribe for more like it if you
did and for now I've got a quantum
teleport so thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
