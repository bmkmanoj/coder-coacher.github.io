today we're going to be building a
neural net in four minutes let's get
started they're like a million-in-one
machine learning models out there but
neural nets in particular have gotten
really popular recently because of two
things
that's our computers and more data
they've helped produce some amazing
breakthroughs in everything from image
recognition to generating rap songs
they're really just three steps involved
in machine learning build it train it
and test it once we build our model we
can train it against our input and
output data to make it better and better
at pattern recognition so let's build
our model a three layer neural network
in Python we'll want to start off by
importing numpy which is my gotu library
for scientific computing in python then
we'll want to create a function that
will map any value to a value between
zero and one this is called a sigmoid
this function will be run in every
neuron of our network when data hits it
it's useful for creating probabilities
out of numbers once we've created that
let's initialize our input data set as a
matrix each row is a different training
example each column represents a
different neuron so we have four
training examples with three input
neurons each then we'll create our
output data set for examples one output
neuron each since we'll be generating
random numbers in a second let's seed
them to make them deterministic this
just means give random numbers that are
generated the same starting point or
seed so that we'll get the same sequence
of generated numbers every time we run
our program this is useful for debugging
next we'll create our synapse matrices
synapses are the connections between
each neuron in one layer to every neuron
in the next layer since we'll have three
layers in our network we need to synapse
matrices each synapse has a random
weight assigned to it after that we'll
begin the training code we'll create a
for loop that iterates over the training
code to optimize a network for the given
data set we'll start off by creating our
first layer it's just our input data
now comes the prediction step we'll
perform matrix multiplication between
each layer and it's synapse then we'll
run our sigmoid function on all the
values in the matrix to create the next
layer the next layer contains a
prediction of the output data then we do
the same thing on that layer to get our
next layer which is a more refined
prediction so now that we have a
prediction of the output value and layer
two let's compare it to the expected
data using subtraction to get the error
rate will also want to print out the
average error rate at a set interval to
make sure it goes down every time
next we'll multiply our error rate by
the result of our sigmoid function the
function is used to get the derivative
of our output prediction from layer two
this will give us a delta which we'll
use to reduce the error rate of our
predictions when we update our synapses
every iteration then we'll want to see
how much layer one contributed to the
error in layer two this is called back
propagation
we'll get this error by multiplying
layer twos Delta by synapse Ones
transpose then we'll get layer ones
Delta by multiplying its error by the
result of our sigmoid function the
function is used to get the derivative
of layer one now that we have Delta's
for each of our layers we can use them
to update our synapse weights to reduce
the error rate more and more every
iteration this is an algorithm called
gradient descent to do this we'll just
multiply each layer by a delta finally
let's print the predicted output and
there you have it let's run this in
terminal and see what we get awesome we
can see that our error rate decreases
every iteration and the predicted output
is very very close to the actual output
there is so much we can do to improve
our neural network for more information
