gun pretty good how are you great to see
you do you mind if I ask you 67 question
oh yeah let's do it
cool pepper walk yeah how did you get
into work today believe it or not like
took a lips favorite part of the
software stack hmm I really enjoy
building front-end data visualizations
favorite thing about working at lifts I
love our secret hiding holes all across
the office what was the last project you
worked on and lift I've been managing
our data warehouse migration over the
hives grandmother haha my favorite
professor that I never actually had as
professor would be Peter Singer if you
could spend an evening with one famous
person who would it be someone I've
always wanted to have dinner with would
be Nick Bostrom and I'd love to chat
about AI do you play any sports
I haven't played any sports since I used
to like bill coffee back in Australia do
you miss being a student at the
University of Melbourne ah you know I
thought it was fine but I really prefer
working in industry what music genre are
you currently into I look into a lot of
chill flash ambient is there a
programming language that you really
like really like you know I work mostly
in sequel and Python but uh as a Python
is pretty flexible what about a language
you really don't like you've got to be
MATLAB you just waited after that at uni
how are you liking San Francisco San
Francisco is the best city that I've
ever lived in
what's something you've built with
machine learning good high five what's
something I filled with machine learning
well I can't tell you the confidential
projects but uh but I've built a an
operation models what's the most
beautiful thing in the world the most
beautiful thing in the world would have
to be would after you watching sunrise
with friends do you miss your hometown
ah yeah I really miss my family but my
friends will move at SF so I'm pretty
lucky that programming language of
choice for machine learning definitely
Python what website do you waste time on
Big Time wipes is happy news last person
you emailed I am NOT a candidate who is
looking for data engineering jobs you
get an all-expenses-paid trip to one
city where do you go I wish that they
would just take me to stay in San
Francisco honestly it's a pretty good
spot would you visit Mars that depends
on the price and how much of the Earth
technology is available on Mars there's
one thing that excites you what is one
thing that excites me so I'm really
interested in how you can use data to
like improve policy decisions in the
world what is one thing you're afraid of
gosh irrelevance best advice you've ever
received choose the people you surround
yourself by very intentionally what's
the big misconception about you
I think that it's very easy to people to
look like they've got it all worked out
when really they've got no idea what's
going on what's the bravest thing you've
ever done probably moving out to San
Francisco without a job and trying to
trying to get established here top what
is one piece of advice give yourself 10
years ago ah I think just keep doing
what you're doing if you were a Pokemon
it would it be I would be mu because
then you could learn all of the move you
have any pets not what's something
you've learned the past month oh I
really enjoyed the neuro-link article on
brain computer interfaces what's the
topic in machine learning you'd like to
explore more ah let's see topic in
machine learning I would really love to
learn more about self-driving car
autonomy do you think we'll solve
intelligence in your lifetime I hope I
live long enough to see that happen if
you ran the world what is one thing that
you would enact one law one law that I
would enact would be listen to your
economist so it's one person to go step
two when you were in college in college
I guess it was Bill Gates seems to be
doing some pretty impactful stuff what
were you like as a kid in grade school
probably pretty weird and annoying what
see floating library besides enter float
you what besides that it's estimated
there what's something that excites you
about the future gosh just at we live in
like the most exciting time so
everything about the future is is an
open book what is one major unsolved
research problem you'd love to be
tackled so though it's a really
interesting research in the how to get
alignment correct with a I would love to
see more research there what's more
interesting generative models or
discriminative model I think there's a
lot of business problems right now that
you can solve with discriminative models
if you could be a superhero who would it
be superhero is Ozymandias the bad
answer
what's your spirit animal fruit animal
would have to be a Bosch favorite
Computer Sciences I don't know if this
capitalist computer scientist but
Richard Feynman was pretty cool if you
had a time machine
when would you visit well I would love
to fast forward in time and try to get
to the other side of the great filter
you still used uber the last time I do
but was now traveling internationally
Android or iPhone Android what would
surprise people about life that live I
think you're just you you've given a lot
of responsibility favorite Linux distro
the butch is pretty user friendly have
you ever been in love yeah luckily
enough what's the point of life oh my
god
sure to to like to make the world a
better place and to be happy have you
ever built an app with machine learning
that you use in your day to day life you
know I haven't that I would really love
to build a it helps you manage your
friendships and let you know who you
should be messaging when if you were to
start from scratch today what if they
Learning Resource you would use to learn
machine word I would use the open
science data masses open data science
masters what is something you do to
relax I drink tea with my housemates
awesome well thanks brain for answering
those questions yeah there are a Suraj
all right have a good one have a good
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
