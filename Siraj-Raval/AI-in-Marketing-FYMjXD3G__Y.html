that's the topic for today's video
I want to start off this video with a
demo and what this is is an AI writer
what it does is it takes in as input a
keyword in my case I'll say it's gonna
be wine okay so I want to write an
article about red wine I'm gonna send it
to my email address it's gonna use an AI
to then generate an article based on
that it might take a few minutes it
might take a few hours but luckily I
already have the output right here for
us what it does is it because it's gonna
generate text based on that keyword and
it's gonna use its sources are going to
be the internet so it's going to search
the internet for other related articles
on the topic it's gonna take all that
text and compile it into one giant text
data set it's gonna feed that into its
AI model which is likely an LS TM neural
network don't worry if you don't
understand that I'll talk about that
later in the video and then it's going
to output an article that we see here
this could be a very compressed article
low compression it could be a very
medium or a high compression article and
they can get pretty good okay pretty
damn good so good in fact that it's very
likely that you've already read an
article or seen some kind of data that
was created entirely by an AI and you
didn't even know it very famous brands
from Fox to Yahoo to The Associated
Press all use AI to generate content and
that's just one of the ways that AI can
be used in both marketing advertising
and the entire marketing funnel the
pipeline so in this video I'm going to
talk about ways we can do that and at
the very end we're going to look at some
code for different architectures that we
can use to do this ok so let's start off
with the ways that AI can be used in
marketing right so one way is through
audience targeting right so if you have
some startup a company a brand you have
an audience of customers right and if
you have some new product you want to
target the specific subset of your
customers they're going to be most
willing to convert into sales you don't
want to waste your time your energy your
money your resources on customers who
won't convert right and so
do you target those exact customers that
would be most likely to convert this is
a perfect use case for AI and we'll talk
about that in a bit
the second part is content creation
right if you've already targeted those
users that are most likely to convert to
sales for your product how are then you
how are you supposed to generate content
that would be best suited for them the
ideal the easy way is to get a human to
do it but could you get an AI to do it
is the question and the answer of course
is yes and we'll talk about that as well
now real time optimization is another
strategy using AI let's say you have
some marketing campaign let's say it's
an email campaign right and you're
constantly setting ads out to your users
to see how they feel about the product
and you're getting feedback from them
whether they like it or not how do you
optimize that content or route in
real-time so that you're learning from
what your users like and what they don't
like and this has been happening like I
said for a very very long time and we're
gonna learn how in this video so some
b2b marketers were asked what are these
metrics that indicate successful return
on AI investments and across the board
that the number one way with 59% of
respondents saying this was that it
gives them better close rates for sales
so sales equates to revenue and revenue
is the lifeblood of any company right
you can't have a company if you don't
have revenue okay so if I didn't have
revenue I couldn't hire people
I couldn't make videos for you I
couldn't live I've got revenue okay so
and I am using AI to help target my
content so I myself in and mitting that
I'm using AI to help target and you know
make sure my content is as as targeted
as possible and they say in the end if
you have some product that you're
selling it's going to then help close
the rates for sales right for me for me
that was my decentralized applications
course that was my only paid offering up
to this point and I targeted it very
well and it resulted in some good sales
we're just gonna help me grow the
business later on so AI can be used for
that as well so let's talk about some
startups in the space that are helping
to move this field forward right so
appier is one example this is a Taiwan
based company and
they do is they predict what audience
members are likely to do next right so
if you have some products right you're
some ecommerce website and you're
selling shoes and you're selling all
sorts of clothing let's say if a
customer buys shoes then it is likely
that the customer won't buy another pair
of shoes
but it is likely that they'll buy a pair
of socks to complement those shoes how
can you predict what the customer is
going to do next and what they do is
they provide AI as a service to
companies to allow them to predict what
customers are going to do next
another example is drawbridge right so
users switch devices all the time right
so they can be on mobile they can be on
a desktop they can be on a ps4 and
ideally we can talk we can target the
type of content to the specific device
that they're on at the time and so
that's what drawbridge does it predicts
what times that a user is going to be on
a specific platform and then it allows a
brand to create content base on that
platform
another example is insidesales.com right
so if you have a lot of prospective
sales
you can't just target all of them
because you're gonna be wasting time and
energy and money on targeting this giant
segment of users when it turns out that
the the customers that are most likely
to convert are probably only 20% and
that's what Inside Sales does is it
helps you find that 20% of your customer
base that are gonna be the most likely
to convert to the sales for your product
that you're pushing and there's one more
I want to talk about
it's called per Sato and what they do is
they will help you create content it
will help you find the phrases and the
words that's going to drive the greatest
action for your audience that convert
into sales so you could say you know a
text message in this way but if you say
it in this way you reword it a little
bit it's going to increase sales by this
much and this is something that we
humans try to do we use our intuition
right so you know Don Draper from Mad
Men he comes into the boardroom he's
like this is gonna work and then it
works and it's beautiful that's not how
it works anymore if you don't have a
database decision what are you doing
right so really good marketers and
really good you know sales people an
advertiser not sales
advertiser's tells people as well but
not in this case use AI to make
decisions okay it's not just about
intuition alone you've got to use it
you've got a base your decision on the
data if you don't got the data you don't
got anything right so
so anyway so let's start with audience
targeting right so how do we target some
segment of the audience that is gonna be
most likely to convert for a given ad
and then focus all of our time and
energy on that segment so we could think
about this as a recommender system
problem right so a bunch of sites use
recommender systems Amazon Netflix you
know everybody uses it these days and
one very common way to build recommender
systems is to use matrix factorization
okay so here's how it works if you have
some product and in this case we're
talking about marketing so our product
is going to be a an ad right so you have
a bunch of ads you've tried out and the
users rated all of those ads on a scale
of one to ten and what this turns out is
you have a giant matrix of users and ads
and their ratings for all of those ads
so it turns out that those users aren't
going to rate all of those ads they're
only going to rate some of them so what
we do for matrix mean factorization is
we decompose this giant matrix into two
different matrices one is going to be
how a user's rates certain features of
an ad the other is going to be how
certain features are rated by users for
a specific ad so two different matrices
the process of decomposing this matrix
into a two different feature matrices is
a type of machine learning using neural
networks or SVD is but I've talked about
that before
if you search Siraj recommender system
on youtube you'll find a bunch of videos
there but I want to give you a
high-level explanation here once we've
decomposed that giant matrix into these
two smaller matrices we then use the dot
product to combine them again in such a
way that all of those blank spaces are
filled right so what we're trying to do
is we're trying to find those blank
spaces if a user has rated a certain ad
this way and another ad this way how
would they rate this ad and so this is a
prediction this is what the AI is doing
using me
factorization and so a popular library
to do this has been light FM I've made a
video on that before where it takes it
generates user and item representations
by functioning as a factorization
machines and learning the linear
embeddings for each feature it then
takes a dot products of each of these
two representation vector and gets a
score but with deep neural networks we
can improve on this by creating more
meaningful representations right deep
neural networks outperform all other
machine learning models when it comes to
learning features ok so when it comes to
learning features deep neural nets blow
everything else out of the water if we
have enough data and computing power and
so tensor rec is a library that has a
lot of developer activity and I highly
recommend it built on top of tensor flow
that does this it allows us to use
tensor flow to build deep neural
networks for recommendation engines this
could be to recommend the optimal ads
for your users to recommend products to
recommend whatever it is now ideally if
you're a brand if you're a company
you've got some data set that shows how
users feel about certain ads you've done
in the past and based on that you can
create new ads that a certain user would
be likely to convert on so you have to
make sure you have that data if you
don't have that data
your startup you want to build a service
for brands than just Google data set for
data set ad campaign and then test it
out from there but the idea is that
going beyond matrix factorization we can
build neural networks to do this right
and so the process is very similar in
that we are learning to matrices and
then we're performing a dot product
between those two matrices to create
predicted scores for a given user and
then we just read off of that matrix to
predict what a certain user would score
a particular ad and then if we have some
threshold like if a user scores would
score above an eight out of ten for this
ad then deploy this ad to them if it's
under that then deployed this ad to them
okay so it's kind of like that so there
are four steps in this process the first
one is to transform our input data into
feature tensors for easy embedding right
we have some input data that's a giant
matrix and then we use
does say to then convert that into a
data frame object and once we do that we
convert them to feature tensors using an
algorithm like word to Veck which we
could use in one line of code or several
other ones and then once we have that we
transform the user item feature tensors
into user item
representations we transform that pair
into a prediction and then transform
that prediction and truth value into a
loss value for a loss function minimize
that using gradient descent until we
have reached a minimum minimal loss
function value and then we can use that
model to predict what a certain user
would like so here is a very simple
programmatic example of us using tensor
rec to recommend users a specific type
of data this could be ads it could be
anything right so we build the model in
a single line that's all we imported we
generate some dummy data we fit them up
model on that data we predict what the
scores would be would be based on the
given data and then we use a percentage
recall as a evaluation metric to see how
good it's doing on testing data set
that's it that's a rec check it out now
once we have targeted a specific subset
of our users that we know exactly we've
automated that part of the pipeline now
we can use humans to create content that
is perfectly well suited for them or we
could automate the entire pipeline where
it's not just us targeting the users
using a I will generate content for
those users using AI so the entire
process is automated right so this video
is content this video could be automated
who knows if I'm real or not right you
have no idea unless you met me in real
life but even then who knows maybe I was
a hologram anyway content creation right
so LST M networks are the way to do this
for text okay so if you search LST M
Network Siraj you'll find a great video
on me explaining how they work in depth
but I'll give you a high-level overview
right now so recurrent networks are
really good at predicting sequences of
of text right so normal feed-forward
networks right normal feed-forward
networks are not about predicting
sequences they're about predicting what
an output would be for a given input it
learns the mapping
but when it comes to a sequence what
happened before matters to what happens
now what the words that you had
previously like I like recording videos
about AI because I love you know maybe
it's tensorflow but predict what that
word is you got to know about the word
AI you got to know about the word video
you can't just know you know use the
previous word you got to use the whole
sequence right so what we're current at
works too is that every time step it's
not just the next data point that's fed
into the network it's also the previous
hidden layer that's learned over time
that's fed into the time step and so at
every time step not just a new data
point but the previous hidden layer that
was learned is fed into the network so
it's learning not just the next data
point but it's learning based on what it
already learned before if that makes
sense and that's why it's called a
recurrent Network because there is this
recurrence or feedback loop that's
happening and what's there's a problem
though in that for recurrent networks if
the sequence is too long then there's
gonna be a problem called the vanishing
gradient problem so during optimization
back propagation we use the gradient
which is the difference between the real
output and the predicted output we use
the gradient to then update all of those
layers beforehand but what happens in
recurrent networks is that the brainian
gets smaller and smaller and smaller the
further back we go in the network and so
how do we preserve that gradient so all
the layers are updated accordingly well
we need to trap that gradient somehow
into what are called long short-term
memory cell cells that consist of gates
values and these gates trap the
gradients in such a way that the
vanishing gradient goes away and this
allows a network to remember very very
very long term sequences of data like an
entire essay right so they lets us then
write an entire essay or article and so
you might be thinking how do I build
this very complex thing and the answer
is chaos chaos is a machine learning
library built on top of tension flow
that lets you build very complex deep
neural networks in just a few lines of
code and AI marketers can use this to
automatically generate content best
suited for a particular subset of their
audience so the idea is that if you have
images or video then you want to use
generative adversarial networks that
generates content if you want to
generate audio you use wavenet and if
you wanted used if you want to generate
text you use LST ember current networks
like I'm talking about here and remember
I have videos for all of these models
just search my name in the model so
here's a very simple example of us using
Karos in under a hundred lines of code
to generate an essay in the style of
each so the text is neech's writing and
then what it does is it takes that input
data it's formats that data it feeds it
into a model built in chaos where every
line of code corresponds to a single
layer in the network so it's very
readable code and it's only three layers
long we optimize it using rmsprop which
is a type of gradient descent search
which activation function should I use
Siraj
on youtube to find a great video on all
the differences between all of the
different activation functions out there
you know I also have a video on which
optimization function should you use as
well but anyway once we do that we
minimize it using a loss function and
that's it and then it what it's going to
do is it's going to predict every word
that that neech a would have said based
on what it's learned in the past and so
we can use this for the entire pipeline
whether we're targeting users and then
once we've targeted them generating
content for them and we can do this for
the entire marketing pipeline there's I
mean there's a huge huge space for
startups to come into this space and
create services for big brands for
consumers to help them optimize to save
time to save money to save resources
using the latest technologies and look
even though I said that there are some
startups out there that do this
currently there's a giant massive
opportunity for new players in this
space and there's a huge need for it as
well so I hope you found this video
