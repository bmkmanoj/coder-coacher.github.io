that's a good name
right cause it's greatly appreciated
yeah so like how I was like how's
everything going
like that's pretty good actually living
in cities in the world
New York is very close second I think I
love my job
love my apartment was my technique you
can penny I think what is the name of
Kent which is not very good name he
doesn't actually have a name he's like
super chill be super show yeah is he a
killer snake
no do you have my support
what was I need to start working on
especially in college and he reached us
means that they're looking for a
front-end engineer on a particular
project
I don't like there was that moment
something incredibly special about folks
at this time it's just like a bunch of
quirky nerds who just love technology I
love what they do and nobody's really
trying to show off
or you know that's awesome yeah and it's
cool that like you know through this
period of like Java on sandwiches can be
really hard you found a great position
that you seem to love yeah okay like I
personally like I was looking for jobs
and I got rejected by a lot of places
yeah it hurts a lot
did you have any kind of advice for this
book we're looking for tech jobs like
how to like you know deal with rejection
like you know like what will be boy what
did you do
Oh we'll definitely crying in the shower
yeah rejection is definitely gonna
happen and it hurts I mean there's
really nothing about it but usually
you'll find after like the initial
period of being upset but like it's
usually like oh you know like kind of
put a blessing in disguise
they usually realize that like that is
not the right list to be working like
either you know
right fit or you know also like it
somebody doesn't want you working there
like it's not you know if you don't want
to date someone who doesn't want to date
you
I think the key is to keep powering
through and let it get you down too much
eventually you find the right thing for
sure and I think that's a great analogy
yeah
what's like your day-to-day life at work
because it's like oh that's an open
source protocol yeah but it's a company
yeah that's money right we we have
multiple products as well it's not just
what we call that our client so I work
on the project master yeah although
we're actually renting the spring answer
Oh super sexy oh yes but I kind of
engineer but it's basically BitTorrent
but in the chromium project so you can
the chromium open source code
and enter magnet link and get a point
right in your browser that's awesome
yeah is it challenging or do you feel
like it's something very to do oh yeah
so which is kind of why I love my job
yeah some things are just super easy
where it's you know doing some kind of
you know just very straightforward and
simple and then sometimes I catch that
thing I do today was going in and trying
to change trying to get our torrents of
a link into the chromium thank you drop
down menu oh and you think that would be
really straightforward except the
chromium code is not so you basically
it's basically like a treasure hunt and
you're trying to figure out the glare in
the code you actually have to change
something so it's really challenging but
it's also really fun and it feels good
when you actually figure out that'd be
something yeah what what got you into
program in general so
one of the thing one of the sad things
about some guy is it's not enough women
in program yet it's awesome that you are
just do you have any like advice that
you would give to like girls who you
want to learn to code or you know yeah
definitely I would definitely say that
first you to sort of find something that
you want to build or main procedure just
something major curious enough it
doesn't have to be good it has to be you
know useful it need to be something that
someone did already that you want to
learn about so you just want to rebuild
it over a certain thing but everything
are interested in someone actually up
and then you just sort of have to go for
it and the other bit of advice would be
to let anyone like you can't do
something or let anyone down and people
do because you will definitely encounter
people
just find any way to not let that uphill
absolutely because that's that's huge
I went into an interview once I
definitely won't say where and you can
tell the guy who came in to look at me
and you just look at the space like it
was just immediately like it went from
like friendly to Wow okay ten years
maybe a little more science or
would be but I'm actually really tired
yeah
without that certainly needing like a
PhD or something you had pretty ones
need a PhD yeah so that's awesome cool
well I think yeah thanks for answering
all these questions thanks for coming
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
