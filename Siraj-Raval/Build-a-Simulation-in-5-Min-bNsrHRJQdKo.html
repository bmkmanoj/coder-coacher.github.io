between my cheeks feels really weird
check out this pinecone that I found on
the way here there are eight sets of
clockwise spirals while there are 13
sets of counterclockwise spirals we
divide 13 by 8 the answer is 1.6 better
known as the golden ratio the golden
ratio is all around us it's in the
curvature of the ocean waves it's in
seashells it's in the spiral that makes
up our Milky Way galaxy from a simple
set of rules emerges enormous complexity
and the universe works this way our
brains must as well we're going to
create our own universe simulation in 60
lines of Python in 1970 an article was
published in Scientific American about a
game created by a mathematician named
John Conway called the game of life
Conway was interested in a problem
presented by the computer scientist von
neumann von neumann theorized of a type
of machine that could build copies of
itself he called the universal
constructor this machine would be useful
for colonizing other planets we could
theoretically send this machine to Mars
before humans and it could mine and
smell iron in order to make more copies
of itself and soon an army of these
could help develop an atmosphere before
humans arrived or it's like Independence
Day and only well Smith could save us
welcome to Mars he based it off a
concept he called cellular automata or
CA the idea behind CA is that the
behavior of a group can be described by
the interactions between a simple
machine or automata and nearby identical
automata that interact with it in the
game of life the universe is an infinite
two-dimensional grid of square cells
each cell can be one of two states
either alive or dead and every cell
interact with its eight neighbour cells
there are just four rules to the game
any live cell with less than two live
neighbours dies of loneliness a new live
cell with two or three live neighbours
lives on to the next generation or
survives any lifestyle with more than
three live neighbours dies of
overpopulation and lastly any dead cell
with exactly three live neighbours
becomes a live cell as if by
reproduction once you say your initial
configuration of cells on the grid and
start the game complex patterns will
start to emerge with just those four
rules like the eater which eats all
sorts of organisms or a breeder which
grows it's number of life cells faster
and faster or glow
and spaceships and really crazy gigantic
ecosystems that become more complex with
time yo okay let's build our own command
line version of the game of life in
Python we just have to libraries to
import both sis and terminal will let us
input data and read it from terminal
let's get right into the main method
where we will implement our high level
code well first want to define our grid
universe depth erm size is a function
that returns the host terminals width
and height once we have those two values
we can format our grid so that it fits
into our terminal the grid will be a
two-dimensional array now that we have
our grid defined we can draw it on the
screen with the update screen function
which will update the terminal to
display it with a set of ones and zeros
for each cell dead cells will be white
zeros and living cells will be red once
the grid will start off with all dead
cells so we'll want to set our initial
living cells once we set these they will
evolve within the simulation while
abiding by the four simple rules we
talked about earlier the read initial
configuration function takes the grid as
a parameter and will ask the user to
input the coordinates of their living
cells to start the game once we have our
initial configuration set we'll need to
know how many iterations to play the
game so we'll ask the user for that
number we'll set an iteration step
variable to keep track of which
iteration we're on then update the
screen to show our user inputted
structures well then create a while loop
that will run for the length of the game
inside of our while loop we'll create a
variable called play which will
represent the user input either the
number of steps remaining or the quit
input but don't quit because we're if
the user types in quit we'll break the
loop and the game is over we will code a
try except block to convert the string
input to an integer for the number of
steps and set them to one if there is an
exception then we'll start our for loop
for each step defined by the user that
means at each time step we're going to
apply the four rules to what's on the
screen until the total number of
iterations is over we'll create a new
grid that will store the original grids
next step in the next step function will
help us do this let's take a look at
that function in more detail it's got a
nested for loop in it this is where
we're going to take our old grid apply
our four rules to it and store the
result in the updated grid it's a nested
for loop since we're going to go through
every single cell and the grid matrix to
apply our four rules to each of them at
each of these cells we'll need to count
the number of live cells around it which
is what the healthy neighbors function
looks for it takes our grid and X
coordinates as his parameters the live
neighbors variable stores our number of
live cells once we have that number we
can apply our four rules in the case
that our current cell is alive any live
cell with fewer than two live neighbours
dies as if caused by under population
and any live cell with more than three
live neighbours dies as if by
overpopulation the end result for both
of these cases is a dead cell so we can
set our current cell to zero or dead if
either of these is the case else it
lives since that is our third rule any
life cell with exactly two or three live
neighbours lives on to the next
generation that leaves our last rule
which is four dead cells any dead cell
with exactly three live neighbours
becomes a live cell as if by
reproduction sex so we'll set it to
alive so that will place our new cell
States in the new grid once we have this
new grid we'll set it to the original
grid and the new grid will be set to the
original grid they switch values we can
then update the screen to show the state
of our updated grid when our loop
finishes we'll update our iteration step
variable to include the number of steps
the user input and that'll be the end of
our while loop will run our script by
typing in Python like pi we'll be able
to see our initial grid with no values
I'm going to create two small glider
organisms that will move through the
space I'll type in a side of coordinates
for each of them for each then when I'm
ready I'll say let's run this thing for
1,000 iterations
ya-ya-ya-ya-ya I've got links for you in
