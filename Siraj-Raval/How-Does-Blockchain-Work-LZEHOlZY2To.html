to talk about something a little
different this episode called a
blockchain and how it can be used to
improve AI the world wide web has only
been around for a couple of decades and
it's growing orders of magnitude in that
time billions of machines are coming
online and Internet connected devices
mainly phones are distributed globally
we've collectively defined a standard
for how they should communicate called
the Internet Protocol suite at the
lowest level the link layer puts data on
a wire then the internet layer routes
this data the transport layer persistent
and the application layer delivers
abstractions of it in the form of the
apps that we all know and love this has
worked pretty well for our machine but
there's a missing layer a layer of
smooth refreshing manatees now where's
the protocol to let them exchange not
just data but value the main way it's
done right now was invented pre-internet
and it requires using a centralized
Clearinghouse to machine tested
sometimes wait four days for a payment
to transfer from one to the other but in
all other aspects they communicate with
each other at a mind-boggling rate what
if they could send each other micro
payments in the same way two meter
resources like electricity and storage
space and computation all without having
to wait for a middleman for a payment
based on my painting didn't you know
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies solve
this problem they act as a fifth
protocol layer for value transfer and
their underlying technology called the
blockchain make this all possible the
blockchain for the first time allows
machines to agree on value transfer
without having to trust a central
authority in the real world if I create
a painting i and only I own it but on
the internet if I created a digital
painting you could just copy it and then
we both own it there's no way of proving
who owns it without using a central
server that records that ownership we
have to trust the server the middle one
but the blockchain lets us reach
consensus in a decentralized way that
prevents a bad actor from falsely
claiming ownership not just for
paintings but for any asset like Bitcoin
but how can it be used to improve AI
well
one use case is giving both datasets and
machine learning models a reputation how
do you know that the data or the pre
train model that you're using is quality
that they haven't been tampered with
you basically have to trust a single
source unless you use a blockchain
deepmind is using a blockchain to create
a publicly verifiable auditing system
for health care data it records every
interaction they have with sensitive
patient data so patients know if a piece
of their data has been used and a reason
why it's right only so once a record of
data use is added it can't be erased
that means patients can verify that no
one has tampered with any of the entries
hi another is a peer to peer network for
training models instead of training your
AI using services like AWS and Google
Cloud imagine a system where people
could just rent out their spare
computing power to help train models and
get paid in tensor coin or even a
company that is run entirely by AI block
chains are decentralized databases so if
an AI lives on a blockchain no one could
control it it could live as an
independent entity on the web paying for
whatever services it needs just to find
an initial set of rules and set it free
one example would be a self-driving car
network run and maintained completely by
AI yeah let's build our own simple
blockchain and Python to understand more
about how this incredible data structure
works but first human
do you listen me of my new get access
with your private key first let's define
what eight block is for simplicity's
sake let's say that each block
represents a single transaction a value
transfer between two machines well
define the block object in its own class
with a set of important attributes the
index represents its ordering in the
chain of blocks its time stamp shows
when it was created it will store some
data that is defined by the sender as
well as two hash values one for the
previous - in the chain of blocks and
one for its own hash the reason a block
needs a hash is dual purpose it gives it
a unique ID and it verifies the
integrity of the data we use the popular
crypto hashing algorithm called sha-256
to help generate a 256 bit signature
from the other attributes for each block
in the hashing function so how does a
block generated well the user provides
some data in their transaction so we use
that as the only parameter in the
generate function and since each block
is ordered we've got to fetch the last
block we'll use the last blocks out to
find this blocks index as well as attach
we'll also give it a timestamp so we
know when it was generated
so each generated block points back to
the previous block by storing attach
it's a chain of blocks it block chain
the first generated block is called the
Genesis block and we'll hard-code it in
by priya finding its attributes in its
own function then we'll use it to
initialize the blockchain and we'll
store it as an in-memory list so
remember how I said that a blocks hash
serves as both its identity and verifies
its integrity we can use the hash to
determine if a newly generated block is
indeed valid given a new block and the
previous block which is the last block
in the chain we can first check to see
that it's got the right ordering its
index then we can check if its previous
hash attribute matches the already
verified previous blocks hash lastly
we'll calculate the hash for the new
block and make sure it matches the hash
that it stores if it's after these
checks it's verified assuming all nodes
store a copy of the blockchain we need a
way of choosing which blockchain to use
in kay
there are conflicts let's say two nodes
generate the same block number our
solution will be to choose the chain
that has the longest number of blocks
since it's been around longer it's more
likely to be the true blockchain given a
new blockchain we'll check if it's valid
programmatically and if it has more
blocks or replace our blockchain with a
new one else we can just reject it as
invalid since each node stores a copy of
the blockchain and blocks are constantly
being generated as transactions occur we
need a method of keeping each nodes
blockchain in sync to do this each node
broadcast to all the others whenever it
generates a new block when a node
connects to a new node it queries for
the latest block and want to know it
encounters a block with an index larger
than its current node block it can
either add the block to its current
chain or query for the full blockchain
and so the way we can encapsulate the
node so that both the user can query it
as well as other nodes would be to
create an HTTP server we could create a
endpoints for a couple of actions that a
user could take one would be to list all
the current blocks in the blockchain
another would be to create a new block
given some data as a parameter by the
user and another it could be to list all
the other nodes in the network or even
add new ones so the user would control
the node via HTTP requests and it would
communicate with other nodes via
peer-to-peer WebSockets so that's our
simple block chain it's very minimal and
doesn't include all the features that
bitcoins blockchain has but hey it's an
example
however crucially there is one key
feature that I left out that we should
talk about called the proof-of-work
algorithm our naive blockchain is
vulnerable to what's called a civil
attack this is when a bad actor creates
a bunch of nodes to get
disproportionately large influence over
the network once he has control of at
least 51% of the network he can validate
its own transactions it can spend the
same money more than once or double
spend to prevent this Bitcoin mining
nodes complete a series of really
computationally expensive calculations
to approve each transaction and get paid
in Bitcoin for their computational work
in order for a newly generated block to
be accepted by the network miners must
complete a proof of work which covers
all of the data in the block at least
51% of nodes must reach consensus
that a new block is valid for to be
added to the blockchain and so a bad
actor has to have more computing power
than half the network for Bitcoin this
amounts to more computing power in the
500 fastest supercomputers in the world
combined no one has that much computing
power not even you Mark Zuckerberg
Jarvis also helps me get ready in the
morning hell yeah and that's why the
Bitcoin network is still secure even
with a 50 billion dollar market cap
every week new block chains are being
created with different use cases there
is so so much to talk about when it
comes to the blockchain and we've barely
begun to explore what happens when we
use the blockchain as a way to improve
our AI it can help us verify the quality
of our data and models create peer to
peer exchanges where we trade them with
each other create never before possible
businesses or we monetize different
aspects of AI development and even
create independent organizations run
entirely by AI last week's coding
challenge Lerner is Charles David block
he used an earthquake data set to
predict the magnitude of future
earthquakes even teachers like latitude
and longitude he built several
optimizers from scratch for his neural
networks including atom momentum and
stochastic gradient descent all three
are viewable in his graph awesome work
Charles David wizard of the week and the
runner-up is Permenter Singh who also
implemented all three optimizers from
scratch to find a local minima of a
function
this week's coding challenge is to write
a simple scheme to encrypt a data set so
only someone with its private key can
access it check out the readme for all
the details and I'll announce the winner
next week please subscribe to become a
programming wizard check out this video
right here and for now I've got to
invest in aetherium so thanks for
