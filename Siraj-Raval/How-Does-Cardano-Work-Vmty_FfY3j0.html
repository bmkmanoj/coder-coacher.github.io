gonna talk about a cryptocurrency
called card on oh well the coin itself
is called ah da but the blockchain that
it supports is called card ah no and it
was created by the cofounders of
aetherium you've got Charles Hoskinson
which is he's basically like the Steve
Jobs of crypto and you've got Jamie wood
so both of these guys have been in the
space for five plus years and they've
seen a lot of the problems that happen
with crypto currencies and they took all
of those problems in the decide to make
one single solution call court card on
Oh which I've been researching a lot
lately and I think the platform is very
very cool so in this video I'm gonna
talk about its architecture how it works
how its delegated proof of state
algorithm works and how it's different
from Bitcoin and etherium so let's start
off with Bitcoin you always gotta start
off with Bitcoin right when it comes to
crypto currencies so there have been
three generations of distributed ledger
technology so far the first generation
was obviously Bitcoin right you got
litecoin and all the initial altcoins
but the idea was always the same can we
create decentralized money and the
answer was yes right so money that
doesn't require a trusted third party no
I'm not gonna explain how Bitcoin works
I've done that in previous videos but I
will say that Bitcoin allows Alice to
send money to Bob without meeting a
trusted third party right we had the
traditional way to do this and involve
the bank a clearinghouse the ACH network
all these different networks that were
pre internet right and so it took it
takes some time for Alice to send money
to Bob if he's in a different country
because it's requiring all these
different old old-world protocols but
there's one thing that Bitcoin cannot do
what if Alice wants to send money to Bob
only if Bob mows her lawn right so
you've got to have a network that's able
to communicate with the real world
some kind of lawn mowed API or something
like that where the transaction can tell
if Bob mowed Alice's lawn and and if and
only if that happened it will release
the funds and send them to Bob from
Alice
but Bitcoin does not allow for this
however a lot of people don't realize
that Bitcoin does have its own scripting
language right Satoshi implemented a
scripting language in Bitcoin however
it's very limited and that's for
security reasons mostly for example the
Bitcoin scripting language does not
allow for looping at all so this is an
example of a Bitcoin script it's a very
trivial example you just have three
variables here I add them together and
then I return them so that's an example
of Bitcoin script it's useful for things
like escrows but not very detailed
escrows or anything more than just you
know Multi multi signature transactions
so enter etherium so if ariane came from
a problem with bitcoin as in can we
decentralize everything else in the way
that we can decentralize transactions
without the need for a third party can
we also decentralize computation right
can we decentralize the way of building
an application in general so I'll take
quote Vitalik the founder of aetherium
when I say comparing Bitcoin to
aetherium is kind of like comparing an
apple to a phone there's just completely
different technologies so if you're in
for example is if theorem is a
programmable blockchain that's the way
you could think of it it's a
programmable blockchain and you might be
saying what wait a second Bitcoin has
its own scripting language its
programmable it is but it's very very
limited if theorem is a has a
turing-complete
programming language called solidity
turing-complete means it's able to do
everything loops is one trivial example
recursion is another one but anything
that any programming language can do if
theorems solidity can do it's kind of
like when javascript came to the browser
for example before javascript all web
pages were static right you had HTML you
had CSS but once javascript entered the
browser we were able to do dynamic
things and had much much many more
features than we could before right so
it allows for customizable transactions
and what I mean by that is code on the
blockchain so Heroku is a great example
pre aetherium you've got Heroku you code
some script you upload it to Heroku
Heroku is that centralized source for
that code it runs the computation and
then all nodes that are can
to your web app with your Heroku
back-end have to connect to this central
source however with aetherium you don't
push that code to Heroku you post you
push it to all the nodes in the network
via a transaction that's your push your
push is a transaction and then all the
nodes that are running a full aetherium
client have to process that computation
block and so then once that code is run
all the nodes in the network have to
compute that code right so it's
decentralized computation and this
allows for unstoppable applications
applications that no one can shut down
this has a range of use cases from
financial transactions to healthcare all
sorts of things but I won't go into that
either here's an example of aetherium
script right here solidity it's much
more readable it looks kind of like
Python but this is a proof of existence
script in etherium you've got one
function that's returning another
function so that's an example of
solidity but aetherium as awesome as it
is has its own problems right so a
theorem has governance problems aka the
hard fork or in the soft Fork it's got
security problems aka sick scalability
how do we solve these problems right how
do we solve scalability how do we solve
interoperability and how do we solve
sustainability I'm gonna go into each of
these three points in a second but if we
look at the blockchain history Bitcoin
allowed for a distributed ledger and it
allowed for the advent of cryptocurrency
aetherium allowed for this is the same
two things in addition it allowed for
smart contracts now the third generation
of blockchain has to do more than both
of them combined what can it do well we
know that any kind of programmable
blockchain is turing-complete it allows
for building all sorts of decentralized
applications however the problem is not
the number of features that the problem
is it's its infrastructure how do we
improve that infrastructure right so one
huge problem when it comes to block
chains of scalability and these are the
three points that Cardno
aims to solve I'm gonna go into how it
aims to solve all three of them right so
for scalability there are different
proposals for solving Bitcoin
scalability right what
we shift the burden onto the users via
trusted intermediaries for aetherium
what if we tweak the tuning parameters
limited Headroom or do security margins
and then there's entirely different
solutions like semi-closed groups like
the ripple protocol or stellar you lose
your openness but you have public
transparency benefits and then the
hardest solution is to rethink your
architecture entirely and that's where
third-generation cryptocurrencies are
coming into play right now I talked a
bit about iota right so iota just
discards the idea of a blockchain
entirely and moves to a directed acyclic
graph right so it's it's it's instead of
a linear data structure it's a dag data
structure but that's just one way to
solve it it's not that the idea of a
blockchain is inherently bad it's just
that the infrastructure around it can
cause these problems right having a
blockchain that uses the proof-of-work
for example requires huge amounts of
computation way too much a lot of
electricity a lot of scalability
problems having all the nodes have to
download a full copy of every
transaction in and of itself is just not
able to scale right what if we have you
know what if in five years we have
billions and trillions of transactions
you're telling me if I want to be a
miner I have to download all of those
transactions to my laptop that's a lot
of transactions hence the problem with
scalability right and so that brought
the blockchain protocol the Bitcoin
protocol specifically relies upon many
nodes possessing a full copy of the
blockchain data and so this restriction
prevents crypto currencies from scaling
to compete with legacy financial systems
like Visa for example right the Bitcoin
network allows for seven transactions
per second visa is something on the you
know just orders of magnitude more like
10,000 plus transactions per second
so what Cardno offers as a solution to
this is its own proof of stake protocol
it's it's actually a delegated proof of
stake protocol and they call it
Ouroboros which I'm gonna go into at the
end of the video there's another problem
with scalability it's not just about the
number of transactions per second it's
all
about bandwidth so when it comes to
bandwidth how much data can we pipe
through these networks all at once and
so their solution for this is using a
network architecture called Rena which
is short for recursive internetwork
architecture which I'll go into a bit as
well at the end and the last problem
when it comes to scalability is data
scale right how do we scale the amount
of data that it's that is in the network
how do we structure that data so
everything is as fast as possible and
there are several solutions for this
there's pruning there's compression
there's partitioning so there's a lot of
problems when it comes to this and
there's a lot of proposals on how to fix
this
so interoperability right so this is the
second major problem we've got
scalability interoperability and the
last one which is sustainability so when
it comes to interoperability whenever we
want to send cross-border payments using
the legacy financial system one bank
will send money to another Bank right
and they have this partnership right
they have these protocols to send money
between different banks they have
partnerships and they have all these you
know kyc and all these different
compliance protocols so they've been
around for a while and so it's very
difficult for Bitcoin to communicate
with aetherium for example and other
altcoins however for banks it's easy
because they built these protocols over
many many decades and so in the
traditional financial world how is a
bank supposed to talk to Bitcoin forget
about Bitcoin talking to about talking
to other altcoins how do you get a bank
like ING to talk to the Bitcoin network
for example this is very hard right
banks need these compliance regulations
kyc you know there's all these different
compliance regulations that other banks
are really good at complying with that
cryptocurrencies are not they're just
these networks run by developers and
they're not as mature so we would need
these compliance protocols built into
these crypto currencies for the
traditional financial world to be able
to talk to the new financial world and
we need cross chain transactions without
the need for a third party right so
right now the way that Bitcoin can talk
to aetherium is by using a centralized
party like coin base for example or
crackin or any of these exchanges so
these are kind of
per area solutions to transfer value
between different currencies but their
centralized solution in and of
themselves right so we need a way to
allow for value transfer between crypto
currencies without the need for a third
party and we also need three other kind
of smaller details we need metadata that
is who is sending the transaction and
have that be opt in or opt out based on
whether or not you want to be visible we
need attribution who sent what right and
we need compliance like I talked about
before kyc and so for Bitcoin there's
this idea of the sidechain proposal
where you peg an altcoin to Bitcoin and
this would require a change inside of
the Bitcoin network that the developers
have to accept and there's this whole
theory behind how side chains can work
etc but it's in the works
now lastly there's one more problem when
it comes to crypto currencies in general
and that's sustainability okay so how do
we sustain a network over a period of
years if not decades so one way to do
this is by using the ICO model right so
the initial coin offering model this is
a way for the network to gain a huge sum
of money all at once but the problem is
this is a huge sum of money all at once
right this money can well no matter how
big it is eventually it's gonna run out
so it's not a very sustainable model for
fundraising for the developer to the
network and for the the users and the
contributors it's just not sustainable
so a better way of sustainably funding a
network is through the idea of a
Treasury right a Treasury system so one
cryptocurrency that did this very well
is the - protocol so what the - protocol
did is it has this Treasury that is this
kind of vault of savings that the
network holds and so the users can vote
on how that on how the money in the
Treasury is spent through voting right
so you have all these different
proposals for things that would grow the
- network like launching - in Zimbabwe
promoting - to 200,000 people let
millions of Chinese investors on who all
be invest in - all these different
things right - documentary and users can
vote on how much cryptocurrency
want of to be allocated towards these
proposals so that's just a more
sustainable way of doing things and
Cardno has adapted this model of using a
Treasury right so oh you know how should
we go about something how do we solve
the problem of governance and this is a
this is a very hard problem right with
even with aetherium there's been this
idea of the hard fork and the soft fork
to explain a little bit about the
difference between the two hard forking
is not backwards compatible so it's a
completely different type of network
soft forking is right so it's it's it's
a change to the network that the old
nodes would have to upgrade to or else
they're not a part of the network ever
anymore so let's talk a bit about
Cardinal now that we've talked about the
problems with blockchain so far so the
team so far consists of Charles
Hoskinson and Germany would both of
these are co-founders of etherium these
guys have been around for a while so
they've they've seen the problems that
come from both turing-complete
and non turing-complete block chains and
so they claim that it's the first
blockchain platform to evolve out of a
scientific plus philosophy and a
research first driven approach I mean if
you look at their team they've got a
bunch of PhDs it's a it's a very solid
team which is which is cool and it's
backed by three independent entities the
Cardinal Foundation which is a
non-profit the IO HK which is a crypto
studio started by both of these two and
emergo
which is a card a no specific blockchain
studio so it's got a lot of money that's
been funded into a lot of resources
development and and funds so when it
comes to its architecture one thing that
I think is very interesting is the fact
that it uses Haskell as a programming
language it's the first blockchain to be
coded in Haskell and in Haskell if
you're if you love math Haskell is a
language for you but basically Haskell
is a language that allows for
prototyping very complicated math
equations very fast and I've got a
little example for you here that I just
pulled from their repository to see just
so you can see what Haskell looks like
in the context of a blockchain so it's
the first cryptocurrency to be written
in Haskell it also has two scripting
languages one of them is solidity so it
another example of solidity very
readable language looks a lot like
Python and if you're familiar with
Python you'll you'll catch up with
solidity very fast
also it's composed of two independent
blockchain layers
you've got the settlement layer and then
you've got the control layer and I'll
talk about the difference between the
two Cardno separates the accounting from
the story behind it by creating two
protocol layers a settlement and the
control layer the settlement layer will
have a unit we'll have a unit of account
or value while the control layer runs
computations in the form of smart
contracts so right now we can look at
the settlement layer the computation
layer is still in the works it's still
to be built so let's take a look at the
settlement layer which we can look at on
github right now but it's a standalone
blockchain powered by the actual ADA
token which you can buy right now and
Ouroboros there a proof of stake
algorithm allows for features such as
delegation and side chains which allows
for interoperability so if we look at
this github repository right now we can
see that what the settlement layer looks
like the whole thing is coded in Haskell
it doesn't have that much internal
documentation on the github website but
if you want to see documentation they've
got the separate website called Cardinal
Docs which we can look at a lot of it is
just reasons why you'd want to use
Cardno but it's also got installation
instructions as well for supporting
platforms you can install their their
wallet on Windows and Mac OS and it's
got a bunch of descriptions of how api's
work how that how the transactions work
how the stake is distributed it's got a
lot so it's got a lot of documentation
which is a good thing and I can make
another video on that to go really into
those technical details but check out
the github repository and check out that
technical documentation now the
computation layer is what they want to
build so this is kind of a future thing
but it's where information contained in
this settlement layer is processed or
computed in particular transactions so
it's the smart contract layer TBD it's
just I mean TLDR it's a smart contract
layer it's what never touches or wait
for the CSL layer except for when a
reference point is necessary and runs an
implementation of their proof of State
algorithm just like the settlement layer
so they both do
so let me talk a bit about Ouroboros now
their their consensus algorithm so when
it comes to proof of work the way proof
of work works is you have the
probability of mining a block dependent
on how much computational work a miner
does and so payouts become smaller and
smaller for Bitcoin miners and there's
less incentive to avoid a 51% attack and
they're these pows systems become these
powerful mining communities that tend to
become centralized so the way proof of
steak works is instead of saying it's
all about computing power it's about how
much money you have in the network
how much stake you have in the network
so a person can mine depending on how
many coins they hold so depending on how
much stake they have in the network and
the POS system makes any 51% attack more
expensive and so POS systems are more
decentralized but must work hard to
build communities around their coins
right you don't want centralization in
terms of only these people have you know
this much stake so when it comes to
delegated proof of stake and this is
what aura Boros implements voting power
is determined by how much stake you have
it's not just about how much mining
power it's about voting power right so a
whale that owns a hundred thousand
tokens has much more voting power than a
minnow that only owns a hundred tokens
right and so based on how many tokens
you have your voting power increases
right so it's kind of it's it's it
facilitates the decentralized elections
of a quorum of consensus notes so it's
not completely decentralized it's not
totally centralized it's a mix between
the two it's kind of like liquid
democracy if you've heard that term
before but it's delegated proof of State
you've got some delegates right that
people vote for in the network and if
the delegate is bit as corrupt
everything is transparent then you just
fire the delegate and find a new
delegate right so that that's kind of
what they do bad actors are firing and
it removes the requirements for
widespread storage of the entire chain
so not every node has to download a full
copy of the blockchain which speeds up
speeds up transactions right it solved
that scalability issue and so these
consensus dode
and run more traditional protocols
developed over the last 20 years to
accommodate the needs of large
infrastructure providers at Google and
Facebook that are more centralized
because these notes have been elected
democratically by the network and it
reduces resource requirements which
makes it easier took for multiple
quorums concurrently to partition
transactions to different forums so the
the other part is the recursive internet
work architecture and this solves the
problem of bandwidth so rina is actually
pretty complex there's a lot of there's
there's a lot of theory behind it and
they're actually still developing it but
it's been around for 10 years but
essentially it's an alternative to
tcp/ip that is more suited for
decentralized applications so it's it's
better suited than tcp/ip is for nodes
that are completely decentralized right
so in the end of this video I want to go
into how you can buy card on Oh
so this is great link here called get
crypto info slash card on oh and they've
got the step-by-step tutorial on how to
buy card on oh but the first the first
step is you want to download their
wallet which is Daedalus I hope I said
that right Daedalus but you've the first
efforts for you to download their wallet
don't worry they have it for Windows
they have it for Mac so go ahead and
download their wallet you can run the
program and once you've synced with the
blockchain you've created your personal
wallet you've created your passphrase
then you can go you could pick any
theory of exchange to buy some aetherium
or you could buy some Bitcoin and then
exchange it from there coinbase is
another example but this is a great link
for that get the wallet download it I
think this is this cryptocurrency has a
lot of promise and I hope you found this
video useful please subscribe for more
programming videos and for now I've got
to study some networking protocols so
