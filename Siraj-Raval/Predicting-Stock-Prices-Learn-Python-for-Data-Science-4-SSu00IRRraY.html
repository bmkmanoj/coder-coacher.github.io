we're going to build a stock price
prediction graph using scikit-learn
in 40 lines of Python have you ever
wanted to get rich quick sir my models
are very profitable
I always retrain them to prevent
overfitting many times a week three
times a week
those are rookie numbers in this racket
really how often do you retrain right
after a workout and then once right
everyone oh the stock market allows you
to buy and sell units of ownership in a
company which we call stocks if the
company's profits go up you own some of
those profits if they go down you lose
profits with them it's as simple as that
so if you were to buy stocks in the
right company at the right time you
could become rich overnight is there
something we could do to predict future
stock prices given a data set of past
prices machine learning this sounds like
a data science problem but according to
the efficient market hypothesis the
stock market is random and unpredictable
but major financial firms like JP Morgan
and Goldman Sachs have been hiring
quantitative traders for years to build
predictive models on past market data
and you can be sure that if these firms
do have profitable models for trading
they are not going to share it with us
come at me Wall Street they have no
incentive to think about all the
features we could incorporate into a
financial model sentiment analysis on
company opinions past stock prices sales
growth dividends all the profits Warren
be missed for hitting on Bitcoin changes
in stock prices are not completely
random but very close to it good traders
will use predictive models as a tool
when deciding where to invest and we're
going to build three different
predictive models that predict the
prices of Apple stock then plot them all
on a graph to compare their results our
steps will be to install our
dependencies collect our data set write
our script and analyze our graph these
are our four dependencies CFD will allow
us to read data from the CSV file of
stock prices that we later download
numpy will let us perform calculations
on our data Saiki learn will let us
build a predictive model and map top
live will let us plot our data points
with our models on a graph for us to
analyze let's collect our data set we
want a list of stock prices from the
past 30 days and we can get this data
easily from Google fine
as you can see it'd be much higher if
they didn't miss the boat on AI next
step write our script our four
dependencies are here at the top and
we'll use the given names to reference
them throughout our code one thing to
note about map taught live is that since
it's a graphical library it will depend
on a graphical back-end and there are
several options if it doesn't want to
plot a graph on your machine for some
reason just use the switch back-end
option and try out a few different
possible backends all right let's start
hacking on our script first let's
initialize two empty lists dates and
prices well then write a function called
get data that will fill them both with
the relevant data we'll call it get data
and it's argument will be the name of
our stock prices CSV file well use the
width as block to open our file and
assign it to the CSV file variable the
open statement will extract the contents
of our CSV file to read it
hence the R parameter next we'll want to
create a file reader variable which the
CSV module will create for us using the
reader method with our CSV file as the
parameter this will allow us to iterate
over every row in our CSV file and we
can return a string for each line using
the next method we'll call the next
method first to skip the first row since
it's just column names now for each row
in our CSV file reader we'll add both
the date and price values to our
respective lists the append function
will allow us to add an item to the end
of our list we only want the day of the
month so we'll say get that first column
in our row which is at the index 0 and
use the split function to remove the
dashes between each of those three
values then get that first value in the
list which is the day wrap that using
the in turkey word to convert the day to
an integer for prices will append that
list as well with the opening price
which is in the next column of our row
and convert that to a float to be more
precise in our later calculations ok not
that precise well place the return
statement at the end to finish our with
block let's move on to our second and
last helper function called predict
price to build our predictive model and
graph it well first use numpy to format
our list into an n by 1 matrix the three
parameters will be the list we want to
reshape the new shape which will be a
one dimensional array the size of our
dates list and finally the order of
elements let's create three models each
of them will be a type of support vector
machine a support vector machine is a
linear separator it takes data that's
already classified and tries to predict
a set of unclassified data so if
we only had two data classes it would
look like this it will be the line such
that the distances from the closest
points in each of the two groups would
be farthest away when we add a new data
point to our graph depending on which
side of the line it is we could classify
it accordingly with a label but right
now we're not predicting a class label
so we don't need to classify instead
we're predicting the next value in a
series which means we want to use
regression SVM's can be used for
regression as well the support vector
regression is a type of SVM that uses
the space between data points as a
margin of error and predicts the most
likely next point in a data set let's
create our first model a linear support
vector regression well use the svr
module we imported from scikit-learn to
create it and it's going to take three
parameters the kernel which is a type of
SVM then our penalty parameter C of the
error term we want two things when using
an svr aligned with the largest minimum
margin in a line that correctly
separates as many instances as possible
but we can't always have both C
determines how much we want the latter
our next SVR is polynomial in math
folklore the no free lunch theorem
states that there are no guarantees for
one optimization to work better than the
other so we'll try both also if you work
at Google you actually do get free lunch
so take that finally will create one
more SVR using a radial basis function
our bf defined similarity to be the
Euclidean distance between two inputs if
both are right on top of each other the
max similarity is 1 if too far it's a
zero our gamma defines how far to far is
and let's fit or train each of our
models on our date and price data using
the fit method it's time to create our
graph we'll plot the initial data points
as black dots with the data label and
plot each of our models as well well use
the predict method of the svr object in
psychie learn using the dates matrix as
our parameter each will be a different
color and we'll give them a distinct
label we can set the x axis and the y
axis accordingly and we'll add a title
in a legend the show function will
display it on the screen and we'll want
to return the predictions from each of
our models now we can call our get data
method on our CSV and create a variable
to store our predicted price given our
dates and prices for this date will
print out results for each of our models
- command line let's analyze our graph
we can see that each of our models shows
up in our graph and that the RBF model
seems to fit our data the best so we
use its prediction in command line to
stack dead presidents so to break it
down the efficient market hypothesis
states that the data needed to set the
prices for tomorrow stocks only come
from tomorrow but well-tuned machine
learning models can give us predictions
that are slightly better than random if
we use the right data and support vector
machines are a type of ML model that can
be used for both classification and
regression to predict novel data points
in a graph the winner of the coding
challenge from last week's video is
Victor C Rana Victor created a system
that recommends artists to users using
the last FM music data set badass of the
week and the runner-up is Kevin Nelson
he demoed his own recommender algorithm
the challenge for this video is to
create a financial model to predict
stock prices with a neural network using
both price history and sentiment
analysis as features details are in the
code readme post your github link in the
comments and I'll announce the winner in
the next video please subscribe for more
programming videos and for now I've got
to predict snapchats IPO price so thanks
