are you good how are you doing all right
are you don't to answer a couple of
questions yeah you wanna walk talk yeah
let's do it what project are you
currently working on I am working on
image compression using neural nets why
do you think deep learning has gotten so
popular recently other than it obviously
doing really well on a lot of problems I
think it also gives people with a
technical skill set a chance to think
about like big questions like
consciousness or things like that
hey Joel what's your favorite operating
system a bunch oh cool thanks favorite
thing about working at Google um I would
say all the smart people and it's pretty
flexible how would you describe your
experience at Princeton hard and
formative if you could spend an evening
with one famous person who would it be I
feel like John Stewart would be
hilarious to hang out with do you play
any sports I used to do a lot of rock
climbing but not so much since I moved
to the Bay Area what time do you go to
sleep midnight
what's your favorite car ah my
motorcycle Honda 250 CBR what machine
learning model would you never use that
is a trick question I would use any
model like its job done programming
language of choice for machine learning
tensorflow so C++ and Python favorite
professor robert shapiro name one person
you really admire i would say any of my
friends who moved to a foreign country
without speaking the language are you
liking the bay area i love it favorite
place i've lived by far what drives you
to do research i think it's in that
golden sweet spot for me of hard enough
so that i feel like I'm growing but not
so hard that i cry myself to sleep every
night was there ever a class in college
you really didn't like um I would say ah
yeah not sure what's the most beautiful
thing in the world
your smile of course Suraj ah what's
your favorite exercise I've been working
on the clean-and-jerk these days
favorite food food on definitely do you
miss the East Coast not not really at
all what website do you waste time on
I'm like the only person I know that
doesn't I don't really waste that much
time on websites I think last person you
emailed I just emailed my team about
setting up a reading group you get an
all-expenses-paid trip to one
city where do you go I really want to go
to one of the mega cities in Brazil that
would be great would you visit Mars uh
yeah if they have Wi-Fi what is one
thing you can't live without I guess I
just learned it's Wi-Fi what is the
first thing you do when you wake up I
hit the snooze button what text editor
do you use I wish I could say something
like them or Emacs but I am using a
Google internal tool what open source
library do you really like I again I'm
kind of biased but I would probably have
to say tensorflow
what's one of your favorite movies umm
the matrix I don't watch that many
movies what did something you do to come
up with research ideas I love talking to
anybody and everybody that will listen
to me
ah that's pretty good for me what
inspired you to get into machine
learning it kind of just happened I
think I moved out here and I guess a lot
of the problems that were in machine
learning seemed really interesting to me
what was the first program you ever made
probably either HelloWorld or one of
those like for loop things that print
out a certain number of asterisks what
is one book you really like I really
like perdido Street Station what is one
thing you are afraid of um not having a
positive impact I guess what is a big
misconception about you I think I
simulate an extrovert pretty well but
I'm actually pretty introverted what is
one thing that excites you um I really
really love to travel and meet new
people
best advice you've ever received ah it
wasn't directly like this but it was
something like even if somebody looks
like they have their together on
the outside they probably have a lot of
stuff going on that you don't
necessarily see what's the bravest thing
you've ever done probably move to
California without having a job what is
one piece of advice you'd give yourself
ten years ago uh take care of yourself
better if you were a rapper which rapper
would you be probably Snoop Dogg because
of the physical resemblance do you have
any pets um I used to live with a dog
but sadly I don't anymore what's
something you've learned in the past
month um I just learned
uh something about
adversarial networks what is a topic in
machine learning you'd like to explore
more I'd really like to get into
sequence the sequence modeling a bit
more do you think we'll solve
intelligence in your lifetime I don't
think so actually so anytime somebody
says that something can't be done
they're usually wrong but if somebody
says that it's gonna take a certain
amount of time usually it's like 10x
that if you were in the world
what is one law you'd enact I don't know
nap time for everybody what did
something you do to relax I read a lot
of fiction I exercise and watch rock
long videos what is a risk that comes
from deep learning I would say maybe
forgetting about all of the kinds of
machine learning that came before that
aren't necessarily related to deep
learning I think nowadays people when I
just throw neural nets at stuff and
that's not always the right answer who
is one person you looked up to when you
were in college who not sure what were
you like as a kid in grade school I
think I was god of a jerk what deep
learning library do you use the most
not not unbiased here but probably
tensor flow and ruang once said machine
learning is like the new electricity
agree yeah I think that that sounds
pretty good it's just it's amazing the
way people are able to use machine
learning to do a large number of
different things if you were to start
from scratch today what is one learning
resource you would use to learn machine
learning if you're not afraid of doing
math and maybe Kevin Murphy's textbook
what is it a machine learning a
probabilistic approach if not again I'm
probably pretty biased but I think the
tutorials on the tensorflow website a
pretty good what is one major unsolved
research problem you'd love to tackle I
really want to figure out like a
generally better way of sampling the
data during training than uniformly
random what is the most surprising
result you've ever gotten from your
research so my team published paper a
while ago on our image compression work
and it's pretty amazing that we're able
to basically compete with state of the
art without doing anything like entropy
coding or a variable bit rate per patch
what's more interesting the brain or the
universe definitely the brain if you
could be an x-men character who would it
be
Wolverine so I could get the cool like
facial hair what's your spirit animal uh
squirrel does P equal NP I don't have
very strong feelings on the Vader I'll
leave it to the suits at Washington to
decide would you ever go to Burning Man
I have gone to bury men snapped your
face Facebook
droid for iPhone right now Android could
go either way
or DuckDuckGo I use Google Way board
that he's DuckDuckGo Linux distro uh
would kill all right Joel that's it for
my 67 questions thanks so much for
answering those absolutely as a pleasure
all right have a good one see you're out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
