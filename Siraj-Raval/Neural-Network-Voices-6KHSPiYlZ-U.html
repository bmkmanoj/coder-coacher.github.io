in the description hello world it's
Suraj or as my computer generated
version would say a little world it's
Suraj I don't know how well you could
hear that but that was the generated
version of my voice he says a lot of
things what is this madness this is
crazy I like to travel he says a lot but
basically he is a deep learning
generated version of my voice the demo
for today is gonna be us generating our
own voices what I just played was this
web app called Lyrebird behind the hood
they're using what's called a an encoder
decoder architecture to generate voices
after having trained on your voices so
definitely check that out it's called
Lyrebird AI but we're going to talk
about the technology that it uses and it
uses something that is very similar to
what Baidu released recently
Baidu really recently released a paper
called neural voice cloning and it's
really rare for any of these big Chinese
companies like 10 cent or Alibaba or
Baidu
to release something open-source so I'm
very grateful we should all be very
grateful and we should find ways to
incentivize these companies to share
more of their findings because China is
really really really going in on AI and
we want to see more open source work
from that region of the world so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna talk about
deep voice 1 be poised to be points 3
and then the latest version of deep
voice which is Baidu's text-to-speech
system called neural voice cloning
basically you can say something and then
translate it into somebody else's voice
like Kate Winslet for example that's why
I have the picture of Kate Winslet one
of the authors of this this github
library that we're gonna look at later
he translated his voice into Kate
Winslet's voice oh you could say
something enter it into the system and
then Kate Winslet will say the exact
same thing that you did right so we're
gonna look at the code as well it's
tensorflow code we're gonna figure out
how this architecture works how its
evolved over the past two years that
Baidu has been working on this and
hopefully you'll get an idea of how you
yourself can do this as well the link to
the github repo is gonna be in the video
description ok so let's let's go into
this so deep voice 1 so in February of
last year Baidu released
deep voice Baidu by the way is like
- version of Google it's like the
biggest Chinese company is focusing on
deep learning right now but they
released a system called deep voice and
what it was was a production grade
system that means that means that it was
a system that was made for use in
production environments for people to
actually use that applied deep learning
to text to speech synthesis that means
you type a sentence and a computer then
reads it reads that sentence and it says
what that sentence is right so the
traditional TTS text-to-speech pipeline
consists of hand engineering all these
features of like what a voice sounds
like what a single word sounds like etc
but deep learning does away with feature
engineering as you probably know if not
it does away with it and said it
Lauren's all the features that it needs
and so the system could be trained and
retrained in just a few hours and here's
that here's a really interesting bit
Baidu claimed a 400 X speed-up over
wavenet so wavenet was deep minds really
you know kick ass paper of the Year last
year on TTS systems and that's a 400 X
speed up on the world's leading AI
institution which is really impressive
if it's true it's very impressive
so yeah China we got it we got a we got
to get in on China see we see what's
going down in China you know I'm saying
so uh-huh
so let's talk about this architecture so
what they used was an encoder/decoder
architecture it was inspired by famous
paper called sequence the sequence
learning that came out of Google but the
model looks like this here's what the
pipeline looks like so you say something
right you say something it could be like
hello world it's Raj and then it it has
a text version of that right so there's
a text version and what it does is the
model will first it'll take that text
write all those words and it'll convert
those words into what are called
phonemes so phonemes are the way of
describing what a word sounds like so
here's here's what I mean by that so
think about the words though and then
rough they both end in this Oh ugh right
but they sound different so how do we
represent that for a computer to read
right so the way we represent that that
is by using what are called phonemes and
there are dictionaries of phonemes
online so a a so check this out the
phrase white room
and the phoneme version of that is w a
y1 so a y1 means a certain way of saying
H I so you see this sound here H I when
we say it in the context of white it
makes a certain sound like I write white
but if we say H I in another context
like hi it's different it's high instead
of I rides there's a H in front of it so
we could differentiate that using
phonemes so one would be like a a y1 and
then another would be a Y - right so
it's different than just saying like
here's what those letters are that
consists of the word here's what it
sounds like so the first part of the
model would convert the text into the
phonemes right once it had the phonemes
it would use another model to convert
those phonemes into a prediction of what
the duration was of those phonemes and
then the frequency of those phonemes as
well so how long do we say those
phonemes in the context of of a sentence
right how long does that phoneme last
right it could be small it could be long
and there's you know it could it could
be a millisecond difference but there's
still a duration for how long it is
frequency means intonation like how high
how low think about languages like
Mandarin right intonation matters like
you know there's like four tones in
Mandarin like mMmmm you know like that
so tone matters duration matters and
then lastly once it had all three of
those things right it had the phoneme
count it had the duration it had the
frequency it combined all of those and
fed it to a decoder and what the decoder
would do would be it would reconstruct
the original audio but in the context of
the original voice right so you have
some text it predicts all these three
features and then it's going to
construct the voice so what would that
the spoken version of the text be and
that's what it did it wasn't converting
anything into a different voice it was
just reading the text but this was a
really cool model and this the second
step like I said was predicted durations
and frequencies and by the way the way
they did this the way they predicted the
durations and frequencies frequencies by
is by using that model in the middle
that we talked about up here but that
model in the middle is called F
segmentation model because it's
segmented
the audio clips of each phoneme right so
you've got the audio of the text you got
the phoneme that we're feeding into the
segmentation model and it will map one
to the other once we've got those will
combine the phonemes and durations in
the frequencies to output a sound wave
that represents the text so they they'd
modeled this after deepmind's wavenet so
they were inspired by deep minds wavenet
architecture which looks like this so
the deep mind wavenet architecture we
can make an entire video in fact I have
one on this
it's called generating music using
tensor flow so check out that one so
wave Mnet's architecture is really
interesting because it's able to say how
am I supposed to pronounce this in the
context of what I'm about to say so it
uses what's called an attention
mechanism to look at the input data and
say okay so let's say we're trying to
have a system that generates a speech of
hello world and Suraj it's going to look
at the word Suraj in the future to see
how it should pronounce hello world it's
because you know how phrases like they
depend on like that there's there's all
kind of flow like an intonation flow
when it comes to phrases and saying
something is always dependent on what
what else you're saying if that makes
sense so in a sentence you're saying a
couple words and the intonation of later
words depends on the intonation of
previous words it's kind of complicated
but it's basically looking at the future
to try to predict the past and that's
the attention mechanism in this case but
basically it was an encoder decoder
architecture that's it it had two
different models and then in a few
months later they released what's called
deep voice to basically it was a same
model but they just scaled it up meaning
they they trained it on even more
speakers so they were say scaled it up
from 20 hours of speech and a single
voice to hundreds of hours of speech
with hundreds of voices and each voice
corresponds to a single vector so about
50 numbers which summarize how to
generate sounds that imitate the target
speaker right so if we have some target
speaker like me we train this model on
my voice it's going to generate a single
vector that means a matrix with 50
different numbers in there that's it and
that represents my voice and from that
the model can generate my voice like
what we just did which is really
incredible so
deep voice 3 was a couple months later
so nearing like closer to closer to now
which they said let let's do away with
that model let's create a new model and
it trained an order of a magnitude
faster and it allowed them to scale to
over 800 hours of training data even
more voices 2400 voices so it looked
like this so it was still a sequence to
sequence model right they had an encoder
and had a decoder but the difference was
that it used convolutional blocks so
recall that convolutional networks are
used for image processing however if you
look in papers recently convolutional
blocks are being used more and more in
sequence learning in general right in
recurrent networks in encoder decoder
architectures because they done so well
are CNN for example was used by Facebook
research recently to map someone's body
in a video and then turn it into a 3d
model in real time so convolutional
networks are being used more and more in
sequence learning like sequences in that
case would be frames of a video and what
they used was a low dimensional speaker
embedding so if they represented every
single speaker with the different
embedding and once it once they had that
embedding they could retrain a model
into somebody else's voice which is kind
of what led up to neural boys cloning
which is their most recent paper which
came out just a few weeks ago so neural
voice cloning is really impressive it's
really impressive because it was an
example of few shot generative modeling
of speech that means that using only a
few samples of my voice like a few
sentences it will be able to then
generate speech in the style of me so
it's like style transfer right taking
van Gogh's paintings and applying it to
novel paintings but doing it for speech
and not only doing that but doing it
with just a few examples which is
incredible it's incredible right so
let's check this out so so what they did
was they said let's segment this problem
into two different categories
there's speech speaker adaption and then
there's speaker encoding so speaker
adaption is saying let's say I want to
say something in the style of Kate
Winslet speaker adaption is the problem
of saying I'm gonna say something to
this model it's gonna listen and then
it's going to output something in the
style of Kate Winslet but in
to do that it's got to have an embedding
a representation of vector essentially a
vector of what I sound like
remember that matrix with 50 numbers in
it that represents Raj that is an
example of speaker adaption how do we
train a model to adapt to not only my
voice but to kate winslet sports and
then there's a problem of speaker
encoding how do we encode my voice how
do we represent my voice into that
matrix so segmenting the problem into
those two different problems helped them
build this model so in the case of
speaker adoption what that what it meant
for them was fine tuning a multi speaker
generative model with the few cloning
examples and they trained the whole
thing using back propagation so it was
using back propagation for both the
encoder and a decoder and so what they
found was when they mapped out all those
speaker embeddings that they learned
from all the different speakers that
they trained on they found that there
were clusters around speakers who had
the simple who had similar regional
dialects there were also clusters around
speakers who had similar genders like
males and females or clustered together
so males from a specific region all
clustered together in terms of where
they were in this latent space right
this embedding space the learned space
which is really cool if you think about
it there's a lot we can learn from that
in terms of how language works and and
how different people relate to each
other in terms of their language and
where they're from so there's that and
it was called neural voice synthesis so
I thought ok cool let's see let's see
what we can do here obviously they
haven't released their code but they did
release the paper I took a look at the
paper it's really the paper check it out
links are gonna be in the description
but Lyrebird was a way for us to you
know really do this with a web app
there's also this really great
repository that I found it's a it's it's
only four months old so it's relatively
new and their architecture is very
similar to neural voice cloning which is
why I picked it for this video but
basically they had two networks right
just like the neural voice cloning like
an encoder decoder type architecture so
the first network is an encoder and the
second one is a decoder we can also
think of it as the first network being a
classifier and the second network being
a synthesizer or a generator let's just
look at the code here so I've downloaded
the code
and we're gonna look at it right now so
under models up pie we can see some of
the code so let's let's make this bigger
and see what see what's going on here
okay so they've got two networks here
they've got network one and network two
and they're trained sequentially so we
were first gonna train Network one and
then we're gonna train network two in
this code so network one is gonna act as
a classifier what they did was they
trained it on what's called a timet data
set these are six hundred and thirty
speakers with the label being the
phonemes for each speaker right so if a
speaker says you know hello world its
Raj the label for that input data is
going to be H e1 l2 right the phonemes
for the for that for those words and
when it comes to input data with labels
it's a form of supervised learning so
what the first network did was it
essentially it was just learning the
mapping between the input data and the
phonemes right so if you give it some
novel speaker like it's whoo-hoo it's
never seen before
it'll be able to predict what the
phonemes are over time so remember
neural networks are just a series of
matrix operations right and these are
just numbers and operations that are
being applied to and using some
optimization scheme like back
propagation or whatever genetic
algorithms it will slowly update the
weight values over time so that whenever
we have some input data it's gonna hit
the right numbers in those matrices so
then output the the most likely
prediction right over time it's gonna be
trained by minimizing the error like how
far off it is from the actual label so
when you give it some novel speaker it's
never seen before it's able to predict
what the phonemes would be just because
there's a likelihood that it's going to
be that based on what it's seen before
so if we look at this further through
the first Network it first loads up that
vocabulary right the phoneme - ah DX -
phoneme idx - phoneme and basically that
those are the labels and the phonemes
like the words and the phonemes for all
those speakers and then it does some it
does a form of data pre-processing but
using a very small neural network just
to make sure that the data is normalized
so they call that a pre net then once
it's once it's got that normalized data
it feeds it to the network so they call
it here in this code see bhg but if we
look in the modules
see bhg it's actually just a
convolutional network right so it's just
a it's just layers of convolutions over
and over and over again convolution one
normalized convolution to normalize
convolution three normalized and then if
we go back to the models we'll see that
okay it's it's it's got the input data
it's got the labels and it has the it
has the output right so what is a
predicted label and then it lastly it
does a final linear projection by using
a fully connected layer this is usually
this is like a very common thing and
neural networks to have your last layer
of your network actually just be fully
connected or a dense layer in the case
of tensorflow a softmax are then output
a class probability and then the
predictions are going to be formatted
using two and thirty two and then we
return all of those right so that's the
first step to train this first network
on the input data and the phonemes and
once we've got that fully trained
network then we can train the next
network by the way the loss function
they're using for that first network is
cross-entropy loss which means we're
just going to do them essentially the
mean squared error that's just a
different way of saying mean squared
error taking the mean of the of the
actual the prediction minus the actual
label squaring it and then returning
that for the second network it's gonna
say or we've got the first network
trained now it generates some new some
new audio right so how is it going to do
this so when it comes to the new audio
that what they used was they used some
speaker data set so for Kate Winslet
they used two hours of audio books read
by Kate Winslet okay so so what I mean
is they said let's first input what Kate
Winslet says that waveform into the
first model right so it's a fully
trained model they fed the what Kate
Winslet said not what the timid dataset
speaker said what Kate Winslet's said to
that fully trained model now what's it
gonna output after having been trained
it's going to output the phonemes
exactly yes once it's got the phonemes
for what Kate Winslet would say then
it's gonna feed those phonemes to this
second network right which is the speech
synthesiser network again it's going to
do some data processing using this pre
network again
then it's gonna feed it to the same kind
of convolutional network right it's a
similar convolutional network but it's
in the reverse order right
so remember neural networks are just a
series of matrix operations right you
have some input data you do some matrix
multiplication you do an activation
function and then you repeat and
everything's really a glorified version
of that this is a matrix multiplication
over and over and over and over again
and when it comes to deep learning
research deep learning research is just
playing around with what types of
operations were using what sequence were
doing those operations in and in the end
some of the best models are just
researchers playing around with what
should come first or should we tried
this multiplication here or should we
divide this and then use the mean
there's this great xkcd where the guys
just like how'd your deep learning model
work so well and the other guys just
like I don't know I just jumbled up all
this linear algebra together and it made
its great output that's basically the
appointing research in a nutshell when
it comes to the second Network it was
able to generate audio from the phonemes
so the way it did that was it used a
different type of loss function and the
different types of the different type of
loss function was called a
reconstruction loss so we could see it
right here so it used a reconstruction
loss it had the phonemes and using those
phonemes it applied the series of matrix
operations in this convolutional Network
and at first it knew nothing right so
it's just here's the output a jumble of
numbers and so that jumble of numbers
they compared it to the original what
Kate Winslet's said right what did it
what did Kate Winslet originally say
that's the actual output so then it
computed a reconstruction laws which is
how well could it reconstruct what Kate
Winslet said from the phonemes that were
generated from the first model you see
what I'm saying it fed what Kate Winslet
said to the first model output phonemes
fed the phonemes to the second model
output what the reconstructed version of
what Kate Winslet said which is actually
just a bunch of numbers at first it
compared that output to what Kate
Winslet's voids originally was
that's the Reconstruction era the loss
between those and it used that
difference and it minimized that
difference over time using back
propagation okay
so over time then the second model was
able to better reconstruct the Kate
Winslet's voice over time now
that's just Kate Winslet if we kept
feeding at different speakers it would
learn multiple speakers right so because
we construct all of those different
speakers over time but they just fed at
Kate Winslet so eventually right after
training both models in that way so the
first was a classifier trained using
cross-entropy laws the second was a
generator and the loss was instead a
reconstruction loss
the first was trained on a million
speakers the second was trade on just
Kate Winslet so then if I say something
it will go through the first create a
phoneme list that PETA to the second and
then it will read it will reconstruct it
as Kate Winslet after training so that's
that's how they did that if they didn't
using tensorflow the model works the guy
even has a demo of it as well work with
ends working with units on Soundcloud he
called it voice but the culture the
revolution thus far had exhausted the
Janka but to culture the revolution was
fired and exhausted beyond er its
Cynthia so yeah you can check out the
demo there as well but yeah pretty cool
stuff all the links that of but the
stuff I've talked about are gonna be in
the video description and I hope you
found this video useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
