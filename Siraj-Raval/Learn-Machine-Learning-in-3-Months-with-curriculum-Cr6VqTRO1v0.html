learn so hard hello world it's Suraj and
the question I get asked the most by far
is how do I get started with machine
learning I've created a three-month
guide to help you go from an absolute
beginner to proficient in the art of
machine learning and I'll describe it in
this video it's for those who can only
dedicate part time to learning since you
either a have a job or B have to go to
school but your if you're able to go
full-time you can complete this in half
the time this is something that I create
for myself if I were to start learning
AI today but I'm open sourcing it for
you to help you out let's start by
looking at the hiring page for deep mind
arguably the world's leading institution
when it comes to publishing
state-of-the-art AI algorithms if we
look under the research engineer
position we'll see a description for
what it takes to be a part of the team
responsible for alphago the deep Q
network and wavenet each of which
revolutionized the field of AI the
minimum qualifications are having a
bachelor's in computer science or a
related field strong knowledge of Python
machine learning and algorithmic design
no need to have a PhD or have published
a ton of papers even under the preferred
qualifications if we were to create a
pie chart to try and understand the
necessary topics for machine learning it
would look something like this
thirty five percent of it would consist
of linear algebra twenty five percent
would include probability theory and
statistics fifteen percent would be
calculus another fifteen percent would
be algorithms and complexity and the
last ten percent would be dedicated to
data pre-processing knowledge we can
build our own curriculum around this
chart wait where to begin I've divided
this curriculum up into three months the
first month consists of math and
algorithmic complexity the second month
consists of machine learning and the
third month consists of the most popular
subset of machine learning deep learning
but before we begin
I want to first say that one of your
daily tasks should be to keep up with
the field so here are the best resources
to do that first is my youtube channel
I'm going to be pushing AI content here
non-stop every single week so hit the
subscribe button to get notified of new
content if you haven't yet next is the
machine learning subreddit it's a place
where people working both in academia
and in business on ML share their
findings Twitter is also a really
underutilized resource Twitter acts like
a learning feed if you use it the right
way follow really smart people and
scrolling down your feed unlike most
social platforms won't drain you in fact
it will enrich you with knowledge ml
researchers love to use Twitter there
are some really good academic debates
that happen there as well
some examples of researchers I follow
are Ilya sutskever Trent McConaughey
Andrej Carpathia Andrew Trask Petera
Biel
Chris Ola and Nando de Freitas there are
many more I'll link to them in the
description hacker news is another
must-have the audience is well versed in
the technical details of the topics
mentioned so you know that the only the
best arguments rise to the top all of
the resources I suggest are going to be
video based I just learned so much
better using videos and short form
written content on the web and by using
a plain text book that just lists
equation after equation after equation
with no real-life application now on to
the first month learning the math we'll
start with the portion that makes up the
most of machine learning linear algebra
one of the most popular courses on MIT
OpenCourseWare website is the linear
algebra course taught by Gilbert strong
he's got a kind of infectious enthusiasm
for this stuff and there are 35 video
lectures available on YouTube as a
playlist watch each one at 2x speed if
possible 3x if you can handle it take
the time to handwrite your notes as you
watch not necessarily for your record
but just
ingrain what you're learning into your
head that much more efficiently studies
show that taking notes by hand really
does enhance your brain's ability to
retain the concepts you're learning then
you can move on to calculus 3 blue 1
brown has an incredible playlist called
the essence of calculus grants a friend
of mine and I can vouch for his work
he'll teach you calculus in a way that
makes you feel like you could have
invented it yourself and when it comes
to probability and statistics EDX has a
really good course called the science of
uncertainty taught by MIT you'll also
find an awesome course on algorithmic
design and analysis on EDX taught by
UPenn dedicate a week to each one of
these courses even though they say they
take longer we're practicing what's
called accelerated learning two to three
hours every single day of undistracted
absorption you are going to be like a
sponge watched a lecture at a faster
speed take notes as you go and complete
one project at the end of every week
preferably one of the harder ones at the
end of the course to complete yourself
each of these subjects has a one-page
cheat sheet you can find on the web
anyway don't feel bad if you complete a
course faster than what the authors
suggest learning is just about
downloading data into your brain you can
use tools to accelerate that process now
we're ready for month two machine
learning I've got three playlists for
you to watch in order learn Python for
data science the math of intelligence
and intro to tensorflow then check out
Udacity z-- free intro to machine
learning course it's pretty well made
for the next two weeks you're gonna pick
some cool machine learning projects to
complete and code them yourself using
Python I've got a great compilation of
ideas in the form of a github link to
help you this is gonna help you develop
a sense of when to use a specific
machine learning model and how it would
work for an application specific use
case I also recommend participating in a
casual competition it's a great way to
learn and earn money at the same time
it's this ability to categorize certain
types of problem
certain types of machine learning models
that well-paid machine learning
consultants provide for companies if you
can build this intuition yourself you'll
be much better off
I'd suggest picking and choosing two
projects a week and building each from
scratch this will give you hands-on
experience with the pillars of machine
learning including optimization data
pre-processing types of learning data
set splitting and model evaluation this
is all about turning sponge mode into
code and a lot of the art of data
science lies in the dozens of micro
decisions you'll make to solve a
specific problem this is the perfect
time to practice making those micro
decisions and evaluating the
consequences of each side can't learn is
a really easy framework to quickly
implement some machine learning models
you'll find that over time to complete a
problem you'll be asking yourself the
same questions how to best split the
data what are the best parameters etc at
the end of this month you should give
yourself a final project and that would
be to code up the simple gradient
descent algorithm from scratch it's the
most used optimization strategy in
machine learning if you can code this
from scratch literally everything else
becomes easier alright on to the third
month deep learning the specific
algorithm called a neural network when
given vast quantities of data and vast
amounts of computing power outperforms
almost everything else almost every time
and that's why it's so popular
check out my intro to deep learning
course on YouTube then check out fast
ais deep learning course 36 hours of
high quality lessons for free for the
last two weeks just implement deep
learning app after deep learning app
over this time period you should have at
least 5 to 10 projects related to
machine learning and deep learning on
your github you'll be surprised how fast
you can go from learning about simple
perceptrons to state-of-the-art models
the difference being usually just a few
minor tweaks in the architecture the
deep learning space as of now is rich
with technical literature and some of
the best stuff is free
at the end of these three months you
should feel confident enough to take
your knowledge and either a work in the
field as a machine-learning engineer B
start a consulting firm or C start your
own product based AI company just figure
things out as you go stop telling
yourself that you can't learn it or
you're not smart enough remember
learning is a life long process no
matter how old you are or where you're
from you can get to the point where you
can make an impact in this field thanks
to the internet and look if you don't
like my learning plan make your own do
what suits you best and better yet get a
friend to commit to the same learning
path as you that way you can keep each
other in check and not drop out as long
as you're giving yourself positive
feedback along the way you won't give up
AI is going to eat every single industry
and change what it means to be human
it's all happening very very fast either
you understand it or you don't
which side do you want to be on same so
get started on your learning journey I'm
rooting for you wizard please subscribe
for more AI and blockchain videos and
for now I've got a course to launch so
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
