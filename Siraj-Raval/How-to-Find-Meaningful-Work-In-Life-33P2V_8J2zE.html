It's Siraj.
And how are you supposed to find a meaningful job or career in your life?
I'm gonna talk about 8 steps you can take today that'll help you do just that.
Thanks to social media you can get attention and validation for your life choices by sharing pieces of yourself online.
We live in the age of instant gratification.
Many time we do things just for the likes we receive.
In fact, there are entire exhibits that have been built just for Instagram selfies.
Because of this, the expectation of how awesome our lives are
from our friends 
and family can run pretty high.
So while it might be easy to say &quot;I love my new job at Airbnb!&quot;,
it's a lot harder to say &quot;I don't know what I want to do with my life&quot;,
because of how people could negatively perceive that.
It can be really hard to admit that you're lost.
If you let yourself,
your mind could just wander through
all the negative things
people could think of you
like &quot;Doesn't he have a plan?&quot;
or &quot;Why isn't she contributing something useful instead of waiting around?&quot;
But the fact is this:
it's completely okay to be confused
to be uncertain about what you wanna do in life
In the preindustrial period
there were about 30 different trades a person
could do
from being a blacksmith to a barrel maker
But fast forward to today
and career websites lists tens of thousands of potential jobs you could do
and
the results of all of these options
are that often we get so anxious about
making the wrong choice
that we end up not making any choice at all
Psychologists call this &quot;The paradox of choice&quot;:
too many options can leave
you standing in one place
like a deer caught in the headlights
and because we
can be so risk-adverse
our minds tend to exagerate everything that could
possibly go wrong
So it's not easy to change jobs or find an entirely new job
There's bound
to be a lot of confusion you go through in order to get there
and that's
okay
You've got to recognize this confusion as natural
get comfortable with it and once
you do that
you'll be able to move forward.
Accepting your confusion is the first step
but clearing it up is the next.
In order to clear it up
you've got to take some time to reflect on yourself
Who are you? What are your unique gifts?
What matters to you the most?
What kind of impact do you wanna have on the world?
Take some time to be introspective
I keep a journal where I write about a
paragraph summary
of my day at least twice a week
A helpful exercise can be
to write down five traits that best describe you
and then ask two close
friends to give you five traits
they would use to describe you
You might be surprised by what they say
and you'll definitely learn more about yourself
Think about what you can't stop yourself from doing
What are you habits? 
What are your flaws?
You've got an unique set of skills
that you likely don't even
fully realize
and it's when you're able to combine all these skills
in a way that no one else can
that you'll find success
Discover your weirdness, and embrace it fully
The more you know yourself the
more capable you'll be
of finding a work that matters to you
and, let's face it,
nobody is perfect
Everybody has got some kind of imperfection
and that's okay
because everybody has
something unique to contribute to the world
So, it's important to remember to
love yourself
and that's a daily practice
If you love yourself in all your beautiful imperfections
you'll take better care of your health
you'll have more confidence,
more style, more swag
and you'll be more corageous to do
what you've always wanted to do
It gives you the freedom to fail
to learn from that failure
and the drive to
continue despite it
So, writing out your personal strenghts and weaknesses
is a great way to learn
more about yourself
but picking a career you've never tried before
based on that alone?
Is a mistake
You could find that the job that perfectly fits
the profile you've created for yourself
is in reality not that fulfilling or exciting to you
So, instead of planning and then implementing
act first and reflect later
by switching to a model of rapid experimentation
Find some free time
whether that's in the evening, in the weekends
if you currently have a day job or if you have
some savings
even better
Use this time to try out a list of things
that you've always wanted to try
Think you might enjoy developing
security techniques for the internet of things?
Volunteer for an open source project
that centers around that
How about product management?
SEO? Content creation?
There are online communities and projects
that'll allow you to take on any role you'd like
Give each of them a shot
try one out for as long as you like
Trying, not speculating
is the only way to really know
whether or not you'd enjoy the activity
I worked as a software engineer for a few years
before randomly deciding to try out a role
as a developer educator at Twilio
That's where I realized that I preferred
teaching code to maintaining it
and while I worked there
one of my many side projects
was starting a youtube channel
And I had to start doing it to realize
&quot;Hey, this is what I actually enjoy
more than anything else.
In fact, I would take a huge pay cut
just to be able to do this full time&quot;
And that's exactly what I did!
An important realization for me
was that it's not about finding what you love to do
it's about finding the
people you love to serve
If you can find that
almost any work you do for them 
immediately becomes fulfilling
And for me, it's been 
the developer community
Imagine you could literally do anything
and have any kind of life you'd want
what does that life look like?
In order to get to that life, you need to
create a goal plan.
What I do is I have a set
of daily, weekly, monthly and
five years goals
that I write out to myself
I make sure that the smaller goals
are achievable in the short term
and that gives me a positive feedback loop
a set of mini victories that incourage me to continue
Goals are your dreams
they're what get you excited 
to wake up in the morning
they're the driving force in your life
they can be anything you'd like
and meaningful work is one
 big way to help you achieve them
It's important to be really specific about your goals
if they are too broad,
like &quot;Teach people&quot;
instead of  &quot;Teach children programming in Python&quot;
you'll never get started!
And once you have your goals
you have to  learn to say no
to everything else but that goal
Just imagine if you had the idea
to start Google, Amazon and Facebook
20 years ago
if you picked one of them you could be worth
billions of dollars
right now
but if you tried out all three at once
you'd be nowhere
Everyone has great ideas
but the problem is that too many great ideas
cancel each other out
The most succesful people in history
everyone from Einstein to Jay-Z
had mono maniacal focus on a larger single goal
If you feel like a goal is too boring
to dedicate all your time to it
then aim higher!
The more ambitious the goal
the more exciting it becomes
And the key to be able to have this laser focus
is self discipline
Developing real discipline
is one of the most overlooked
but most important things
you can do for yourself professionally
and for your own happiness
One of the question I get the most is
&quot;How did you get so smart?&quot;
It's not that I'm some genius
who came out of the womb
knowing AI like the back of my hand
I've developed a discipline to study it
and so did every other
great practitioner in this field
Discipline is the difference between
those who fail and those who succeed
It's a learned skill
and you can build it
just like you build any other skill
one step at a time
So start small
get yourself to
say, meditate, every day
Then, add onto it
maybe adding a journal entry every night
or brushing your teeth
twice a day instead of once
or not letting yourself work from home
or getting up at a certain time every day
The more you make these habits
a part of your routine
the more second nature
they'll become to you
and thus the more discipline you'll build
And this discipline carries out
into every aspect of your life
When I was first starting my youtube channel
it was really really hard to
release two videos a week
and as my audience grew
so did the expectations they had
I was under a lot of pressure
and it was very uncomfortable
but because I had the discipline
to stick to my release schedule
everything became easier
and more manageable over time
I learned to adapt
and now it all feels
like second nature to do
Over time
my work has definitely improved
and I can credit that improvement
in a huge way to one thing:
being open to feedback
I am constantly reading
comments, replies, emails from my viewers
and using it
all to improve my content
Sometimes it can sting
but it's really important
to let go of your ego
when it comes to constructive feedback
and use it to help you 
guide your work
If you can do that
you'll not only be able to
find meaningful work
but you'll be able to excel at it
like no one ever did before you
So, I hope these tips were helpful
and the best time to get started
on your journey to find meaningful work
is right now!
So, what are you waiting for?
The world is your playground

and for now
I've got to go
serve the people I love
