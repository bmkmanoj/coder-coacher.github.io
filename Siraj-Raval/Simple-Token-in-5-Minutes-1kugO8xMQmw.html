these days everybody is creating some
kind of cryptocurrency token for their
business or research or even just for
fun pot coins sponsored a celebrity's
trip to North Korea
what the in this video I'll show
you how you can make your own token
using the etherium platform when Bitcoin
launched in 2009 as the world's first
cryptocurrency it had the single goal of
allowing for value transfer without the
need for a middleman bitcoins blockchain
data structure is essentially a
worldwide Excel spreadsheet that is
formed by lots of computers talking to
each other this blockchain is a digital
ledger continuously recording and
verifying records it's used to track and
verify Bitcoin transactions in theorem
is also a public blockchain network and
its appeal is that it has its own Turing
complete scripting language that lets
developers build what are called smart
contracts smart contracts are strings of
computer code capable of automatically
executing when certain predetermined
conditions are met instead of requiring
a single central authority to say yay or
nay these contracts are self operated
for example a smart contract could say
pay Joe 10 dollars every time he watches
Oprah's speech and cries and it would
pay Joe once those conditions are met
because all the nodes run this code
ethereal can be considered a worldwide
computer that no one can turn off and
that no one can tamper with it runs
exactly as programmed it's like using a
service like Amazon or digital ocean to
upload programs and run them except
there isn't a single party behind it
sorry not sorry mr. Bezos ether is the
cryptocurrency that powers this network
by allowing users to pay for smart
contract transaction fees so one type of
smart contract that's gotten really
popular recently is the token smart
contract tokens are digital assets that
can represent anything from loyalty
points to vouchers to i/o use to
securities to actual physical objects
like vibrators a token is nothing more
than a smart contract running on top of
the etherium blocked
it's a set of functions with an
associated database the code describes
the behavior of the token and the
database is just a table of rows and
columns tracking who owns how many
tokens if a user or another smart
contract in aetherium sends a message to
that tokens contract in the form of a
transaction the code updates its
database so let's say a wallet app sends
a message to a tokens contract to
transfer funds from Joe to Jack the
tokens contract will first check that
the message was signed by Joe and that
he has sufficient funds to cover the
payment then it moves the funds from
Joe's account to Jack's account in the
database it will then send a response
letting the wallet know the transaction
was a success in order to create a
user-friendly and broadly accessible
system for token creation a set of
standards called ERC 20 was created by
the etherium developers ERC 20 defines a
set of six functions that other smart
contracts within the etherium ecosystem
will understand and recognize these
include for instance how to transfer a
token by the owner or on behalf of the
owner and how to access data like name
symbol supply and balance about the
token together these functions and
events make aetherium tokens work the
same almost everywhere within the
etherium ecosystem this interoperability
is important to spur an ecosystem as a
result
nearly all wallets that support ether
now also support ERC 20 compliant tokens
so let's create a standard ERC 20 token
a set amount will be created and we
won't have any fancy rules like finance
Skynet's with all the profits the first
step is to decide what we want our token
to be we'll decide a name symbol number
of decimal places and the number of
tokens and circulation most tokens have
18 decimal places let's keep it simple
we want people to either have a token or
not nothing in between so we'll choose 0
our next step is to actually code this
token contract luckily for us we can
just copy and paste a standard ERC 20
token template contract written in
solidity aetherium scripting language
it's a token contract with fun
that define the total amount of tokens
balance the act of transferring funds
and approving transactions will inherit
from the initial token class to add the
details of how our specific token will
work using custom variables we can
replace the filler words with the values
we find to be best in our text editor
the supply we set for our token is
correlated to the amount of decimal
places we set so if we had a token with
zero decimal places and 100 tokens then
the supply would be a hundred but if we
had 18 decimal places and a hundred
tokens then the supply would be a much
bigger number we also set the amount of
tokens we receive as a creator of the
contract for now we'll just set it equal
to the supply so we receive all the
tokens we could set it with different
rules so different founders of our
project could receive different amounts
but we're going lone-wolf
right now all right now we'll deploy
this token to the etherium test net just
to see if it works we can download meta
mask since it has an easy-to-use
interface to test this out once
installed we'll set up the ROPS tin test
network then we'll head to this solidity
remix compiler which is an online
compiler that publishes smart contracts
straight to the blockchain we can copy
and paste the source code of our
contract into the main window we can go
to the setting and select the latest
release compiler version and uncheck
enable optimization we'll go back to the
contract tab and hit create under the
name of the token function we create
meta mask will then pop up asking us to
hit submit to pay for the transaction of
course we will
it's not real ether it's a test net and
when we hit submit it'll say contract
pending in meadow mask when we click the
date it'll bring up a screen that
details the transaction now we can see
if it actually created the tokens and
sent them to our wallet will copy the
contract address and add it to the meta
mask tokens tab it says we have 100
tokens so it worked now we can send
those tokens or sell them on a market if
we decide to we can also create another
contract that automatically sends these
tokens to people if they send us a
certain amount of ether which could
power your next IC o---- like Jesus coin
we'll also want to verify the source
code so that the public knows we're not
doing anything Shady we can deploy our
token to the main net so people can
actually use it
so we'll basically do the same thing we
just did except instead of being
connected to the Rob stand test Network
we'll be connected to the main net we
need to fund our contract with real a 30
this it can cost anywhere from 20 to 50
dollars worth of ether as of now
summarize a token is a digital asset
that can represent anything from loyalty
points to vouchers to securities tokens
our smart contracts and we can easily
create them using the etherium
blockchains turing-complete scripting
language called solidity and to create a
token we just fill in a smart contract
template written in solidity with our
details and deploy it to the etherium
blockchain via a tool called meta masks
please subscribe for more programming
videos and for now I've got to create
Suraj coin so thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
