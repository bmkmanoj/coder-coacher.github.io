ourselves in machinery that gives
abundance has left us in want
our knowledge has made us cynical our
cleverness hard and unkind we think too
much and feel too little more than
machinery we need humanity more than
cleverness we need kindness and
gentleness without these qualities life
will be violent and all will be lost
how is never the type of care to follow
the rules my parents got so mad they
said study for school I don't give a
fuck about intestine shit we'll try to
grade me don't tell me to go studying
shit I have my own dreams online online
online bitch try to take me offline I
ain't got time trying to make my own way
in this world trying to make it give
liberation a world so lonely it's just
me myself one and only real friends is
hard so many phony it's all good I'm
living up I know that's what's up life
is a marathon I'll run till I throw up
brazen Houston but moved up to NYC to
join that Ivy University damn ride how
would these then conclude that refused
to lose I had nothing to choose but then
I found a lab for robots and that should
have my name on it do not despair the
misery that is now upon us is but the
passing of greed the bitterness of men
who fear the way of human progress the
hate of men will pass and dictators die
and the power they took from the people
will return to the people and so long as
men die Liberty will never perish always
helped till the crack of dawn trying to
find all the box in my mind trying to
reach it online then I walked straight
up to
best to h your can I work in your lab

were sweet to my here signs up started
playing with motors and gears no fear

here
so visionary I made a robot startup
trying to make a robot so hot mission

whole lot but didn't work we felt a
whole lot huh no money's no sale I lost
it I failed my passion was lost
I'm taken by Jeff Frost no longer the
boss robotics was lost I packed my bags
I left for the West maybe I could find
purpose again I didn't fucking know the
power to create machines the power to
create happiness
you the people have the power to make
this life free and beautiful to make
this life a wonderful adventure then in
the name of democracy let us use that yo
shout out to SF my new home city fucking

learned robots would sell hot to me a
beat machine learning
No Go no alphabet all that shit huh
brothers in flames we got a make shit
better make some robots do some real
shit that matters I'm tired of all the
pain all day all the lives all the wars
all the spots huh trying to make shit

range in the robots make them so smart
