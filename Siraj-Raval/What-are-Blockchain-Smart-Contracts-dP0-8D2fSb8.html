been digging smart contracts lately
they're so powerful we're gonna build a
smart contract that implements proof of
existence it's an immutable digital
notary that proves the ownership and
existence of any document without
needing to hire a lawyer the advent of
Bitcoin proved that we could exchange
value over the Internet in a way that
didn't need to involve a third party
namely a bank what made this possible
was its use of a data structure that
distributes trust across many nodes
instead of a few called
the blockchain I think I'm ready to jump
on the path every node downloads a copy
of it and stores every single
transaction that's occurred in the
network it can't be hacked or tampered
with because it's secured by the
proof-of-work
algorithm only Jeff Dean has that much
computing power since then several
crypto currencies have popped up adding
their own features to the Bitcoin
blockchain to extend its functionality
but the cryptocurrency with the second
highest market cap in the world
aetherium is by far the most interesting
in terms of its potential to power a new
wave of applications if their IAM is a
digital currency just like Bitcoin but
it's also got its own turing-complete
programming language that lets you build
what are called smart contracts let's
rewind a bit in the Bitcoin network any
coins that you buy are sent to a unique
address no coins are actually held at
this address it just acts as a unique
identifier like a bank account number
that allows the total of the
transactions to and from this address to
be calculated we can think of Bitcoin as
a ledger that records the deposits and
withdrawals from accounts when we send a
transaction via the Bitcoin network the
old balance is reduced by some amount
and another accounts balance is
increased by this amount but no physical
value is ever moved aetherium works
slightly differently it stores the
number of coins you own at an address
called a smart contract this is a piece
of code which is stored on the
blockchain network it defines the
conditions to which all parties using
the contract agree upon so if required
conditions
met certain actions are executed no need
for a judge or AWS or really any third
party to enforce the rules the ability
to store info at these addresses is
called the etherium state whereas
Bitcoin only stores transactions that
have been sent in the blockchain any
type of data can be stored in the
etherium state and thereby the etherium
blockchain the information that is
stored could range from the amount of
either you have to the type of life
insurance you own and since computation
is scarce there must be a mechanism to
limit the resources used by each
contract every single operation that is
executed inside the EVM is actually
simultaneously executed by every node in
the network this is why gas exists gas
is internal it can't be purchased it's
used to calculate the price of a
transaction and ether and ultimately
limit the EVM an etherium transaction
contract code can trigger data reads and
writes do expensive computations like
using cryptographic primitives making
calls to other contracts etc each of
these operations have a cost measured in
gas and each gas unit consumed by a
transaction must be paid for an ether
based on a gas to ether price which
changes dynamically this price is
deducted from the etherium account
sending the transaction smart contracts
enable aetherium to operate as a global
server where you pay for each
transaction instead of a monthly fee for
some central server provider the gas as
well motivates developers to write
efficient code so that it would require
less gas or the execution one
interesting thing to note is that smart
contracts can't execute API call
directly if we wanted to build a weather
app and wanted to connect to a weather
API to retrieve data and show the info
accordingly that code would need to be
executed on each and every node so that
call to the weather API could happen at
different times as the nodes might start
executing the code not at the same time
in one second we could have rainy
weather data returned and in another we
could have sunny weather nodes wouldn't
be able to reach consensus on the result
of the smart
contract in this case but we need data
from the real world it's super useful so
the solution is to use what's called an
Oracle instead of the smart contract
calling an external API the API itself
pushes the data to the blockchain so
that means that all the nodes now have
the same data within the network so a
contract triggers an event an external
app can listen to that event retrieve
the data from the API and add a
transaction with the result to the
contract we can ensure the integrity of
the Oracle by using a smart contract as
an insurance policy against it
corrupting the integrity of the data but
wait bitcoins got smart contract
functionality too with Bitcoin smart
contracts it's important to understand
that each transaction exists as a data
structure composed of inputs and outputs
in order to send Bitcoin users must
provide certain inputs meeting
predetermined requirements that prove
they own and therefore have the
authority to send bitcoins they claim to
own users can also create contract
transactions that require a more complex
set of inputs in order to trigger the
release of bitcoins a simple example of
more complex inputs is a multi signature
transaction which requires more than one
entity that sign off on the release of
Bitcoin proving useful in escrow
situations where two of three parties
have to vouch for a transfer smart
contracts in general are pretty
computationally expensive to execute so
not every conditional transaction is
appropriate for execution via a
blockchain we should only use them for
features that demand the distributed and
secure nature of a shared ledger think
about an apartment complex and all the
administrative work required to maintain
it if we use smart contracts where a
tenancy is registered on the blockchain
they can be used to control access to
the building when you pay the rent
each tenants access to the building is
renewed owners with registered keys are
granted access to all the various types
of utilities like mailboxes and washing
machines we can also use biometrics to
help authenticate users no need to
maintain a server it's all completely
automated this can be applied to grant
ownership that is publicly verifiable
over really anything physical objects as
well making them smart property you
could even incorporate a company on the
blockchain and if we're really ambitious
an entire nation could be defined not by
geography but by the rules and benefits
of citizenship on the blockchain let's
get the building to start developing
aetherium apps will need a client to
connect to the network it will act as a
window to the distributed network and
provide a view of the blockchain where
all the EVM states are represented there
are various compatible clients for the
protocol the most popular being def a go
language implementation however it's not
the most developer friendly the best
option I've found is the test RPC node
which we can install and run we can run
test RPC in a new terminal and leave it
running while we develop each time we
run test RPC it will generate 10 new
addresses with simulated test funds for
us to use this is not real money and
we're safe to try anything with no risk
of losing funds the most popular
language for writing smart contracts in
aetherium is solidity so we'll be using
that we're also using the truffle
development framework which helps with
smart contract creation compiling
deployment and testing we should be able
to compile the example contracts by
running truffle compile then to deploy
the contracts through the simulated
network using the test RPC node we have
running we need to run truffle migrate
we'll be writing a simple proof of
existence smart contract the idea is to
create a digital notary that stores
hashes of documents as proofs of their
existence
we can use truffle create contracts to
get started then we'll open proof of
existence that's Sol in a text editor
contracts have States and functions it's
important to distinguish two kinds of
functions that can appear in a contract
the first are read-only functions
functions that don't perform any state
changes the only read States perform
computations and return values and the
other kind are transactional functions
functions that perform a state change in
the contract or move funds our code only
stores one proof at a time using the
data type bytes 32 which is the size of
a shoe
2:56 hash the transactional function
notarize allows one to store the hash of
a document in our smart contracts state
variable proof the variable is public
and is the only way a user of our
contract has to verify if a document has
been notarized
let's deploy proof of existence to the
network this time we'll have to edit the
migration file to make truffle deploy
our new contract
now that our contract is deployed we can
play with it as in we can send messages
to it via function calls and read its
public state using the truffle console
so what have we learned a smart contract
is code that is stored and run on a
blockchain making it trustless and
immutable we can use them to verify
ownership automate financial instruments
and create more autonomous software and
etherium is currently the most developed
platform to build smart contracts this
week's coding challenge is to create a
smart contract that an AI can interact
with more details are in the readme
github links go in the comments and I'll
give the top two entries a shout out
next Friday hope you liked the video
please subscribe for more programming
videos and for now I've got to fight the
power so thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
