gonna share 10 strategies I personally
use to learn advanced concepts as fast
as possible computer science is my one
true love
there are endless subtopics to explore
from basic concepts like abstraction to
more advanced concepts like machine
learning security distributed systems
and teledildonics and because I find it
so incredibly exciting I love the
process of learning it which brings me
to my first point find a reason to learn
before you start your learning journey
you've got to have that motivation that
drive to learn that means finding a
cause you really believe in this is my
first point because it's the most
important giving yourself the space to
reflect on yourself your life and the
state of humanity is one of the most
important things you can do in this
regard that means traveling seeking out
new experiences meeting new and
interesting people connecting with them
and really trying to understand their
motivations in life to help you
formulate your own for me traveling
through Asia for a few months gave me
the perspective I needed to finally
realize that solving AI was the most
important thing in the world I realized
that despite having failed in so many
other tasks I was a gifted communicator
and I saw an opportunity to apply my
unique skillset to help achieve this
goal
but once you're ready to learn how do
you know where to start what we're all
lucky in that the internet provides us
with a huge variety of learning
resources that we could potentially use
it is the new University and it is our
responsibility to use it as such the
only way to know which resources work
best for you is to try out as many of
them as you can and reinforcement
learning this is called the exploration
versus exploitation dilemma how does a
learning agent know how much to explore
possible options before choosing one and
utilizing it to its full capacity
different people learn best in different
ways for example whenever I'm
researching a topic I'll google it and
open up at least ten different browser
windows dedicated to informational links
on that topic
simultaneously some of them will be
articles some will be video
some will be papers some will be
podcasts I'll quickly skim through each
of them getting as much of the gist as I
can before settling on one that I find
especially interesting and retains my
interest longer than the rest my
personal favorite way of learning is to
watch videos at 3x speed on YouTube I
use a Chrome extension to do this link
to it is in the description it feels
like when neo had data downloaded into
his brain I'm getting both auditory and
visual input into my head at 3 X the
normal speed it was hard for my brain to
get used to that much of a speed-up so I
started off only a little faster and
over time gradually increase the speed
the brain will adapt it will learn to
process input faster and eventually
normal speed will feel too slow the same
logic can apply to podcasts and
audiobooks don't discount any medium of
learning the more diverse your inputs
the better or more generalized your
understanding of a topic will be but if
you have a bunch of possible learning
options you want to start off with the
absolute simplest ones first you've got
to have a basic understanding of a topic
first before you move on to the harder
stuff I usually look for a li 5s on
reddit for super-tough concepts those
are really helpful also short
introductory explainer videos on YouTube
are awesome so if I want to learn about
say gradient descent rather than first
going through the scientific paper that
introduces gradient descent with a bunch
of equations I'll first try to
understand the concept at a very high
level and the reasons for it then once I
have a basic idea from a few sources
I'll read some in-depth tutorials from
people who've gone through the process
of learning it already
the experts hopefully with code samples
so I can build off of their knowledge
it's like a tree of abstractions if you
can peer into someone's representation
of a concept in their mind by consuming
their contents you can grasp that
concept much faster when it comes to
code I use github like a google for code
samples I look for really basic code
samples that don't have too many lines
of code ideally under 100 that
programmatically implement some concept
I'll analyze the arc
texture and then move on to a more
detailed implementation if you start
with the hardest stuff first it will be
way easier to get discouraged and give
up so you have to create a set of small
achievable goals in your journey
whenever we begin the learning process
we go through a honeymoon phase where we
experience a release of dopamine as we
encounter novel concepts but there is
always a dip in excitement a period when
our progress slows and we get frustrated
many people end their journey at that
dip they convince themselves that they
aren't smart enough or they've run out
of money or they'd rather watch Game of
Thrones but if you can stay motivated
through the dip period then eventually
you'll get to the point of mastery a
place where you can finally feel that
you've learned the topic and be proud of
that fact set deadlines for each of
these goals the research shows that
doing this motivates you to complete
each one breaking up your larger
learning goal into smaller ones will
help keep you motivated you're receiving
a dopamine reward every time you've
learned some small part of a larger
concept and since each goal you've
created isn't too hard or too easy it
keeps you interested allowing you to
maintain a flow state a state of maximum
concentration and focus creating your
own well-planned Learning Path doesn't
come naturally it's a skill and like all
skills it needs to be honed learning
which are the right questions to ask is
a really useful exercise when designing
your learning goals what are the burning
questions you'd like to have answered
take some time to write them down it's
surprisingly useful to be able to see
them outside your own head let your
curiosity drive your learning path and
it'll be a lot more enjoyable learning
isn't just about consuming content it's
about doing studies show that you should
spend a third of your time researching
and two-thirds of your time doing for
example you can stare at the chain rule
all day and look at code samples but
unless you implement it yourself you
won't truly understand how
backpropagation works in deep learning
doing means finding some medium of
applying what you've learned for me that
medium is teaching I am constantly
writing scripts of what I've
speaking reading out those scripts and
editing adding relevant assets to be
displayed alongside my voice practice
finding the most dense description of a
topic you can how can you summarize an
entire algorithm into one sentence you
can also take notes by hand or create
flashcards both proven methods for
knowledge retention but look let's be
real learning advanced concepts isn't
easy so you've got to allow yourself to
be uncomfortable
nothing worth achieving comes easily
those experts weren't born with the
knowledge they have they put in
countless hours of study to get there
that uncomfortable feeling you get when
you encounter a topic you know nothing
about is the learning process you've got
to get okay with that discomfort just
know that the more you look at a topic
the easier it'll get your brain behaves
like a muscle so you've got to Train it
like one just like how the best athletes
train every morning no matter how sore
they feel or the best writers write
every day no matter how bad it turns out
the best students know that it's all
about having a disciplined study regimen
there are so many potential distractions
out there you have to have the
discipline to tune out everything else
and focus on your tasks do it in
intervals every 50 minutes
give yourself some intense highly
focused learning time take a 10-minute
break and repeat and because the
learning process can be difficult
remember to seek out feedback if you
have a question that you're having a
really hard time answering ask it on
Stack Overflow or a subreddit or a slack
channel ask a friend find someone you
really admire who excels in that topic
and ask them on Twitter directly you'll
find that most people are more than
willing to help you out if you ask a
question in a short concise and easily
digestible way and lastly take care of
yourself
that means treat your body like the
machine that it is you've only got one
that means avoid too much sugar remember
to eat fruits and vegetables and find a
fun way to exercise jogging biking
fencing anything that will improve blood
circulation to your brain at least three
times a week anyways I hope my tips
helped you I've summarized them all in
the video description below and no code
Challenge this week please subscribe for
more programming videos and for now I've
got to feel to learn so thanks for
