going good to see you hi everybody
uh Wow just start off with the request
video request stock recommender system
uh that's gonna happen in the future I
actually have a video on that checkout
predicting stock prices anyway I'll
probably do another one the future hi
guys hello world oh my god everybody is
coming in I'm so happy to see all of you
I'm gonna I'm gonna list some names
really quick
george pericles a odd son Nico sanjay
mood it luck xie on john above yeah
Arthur hello everybody today we are
thank you I got it from open the eye I'm
glad you like my t-shirt I'm so proud to
wear this t-shirt even though I don't
work for them I love this t-shirt okay
so today everybody uh we are going to we
are going to build a tic-tac-toe and
we're gonna build a neural network that
gets better and better at tic-tac-toe
over time okay that's what we're gonna
do uh and uh the first thing I want to
do before we start building this neural
net to defeat tic-tac-toe is I want to
answer a few questions so we're going to
do a five-minute Q&amp;amp;A and then we're
gonna get right to the code and it's in
JavaScript I know it's in JavaScript and
that's okay because javascript is my
third favorite language it's like Python
go and then JavaScript and Java scripts
actually pure and it's in pure
JavaScript so we're not using any kind
of jQuery or any of that like you know
libraries we're using some pure
JavaScript okay so that's what we're
gonna do so it's not with a five-minute
Q&amp;amp;A and then we are going to uh get
started okay ready set go and I'm gonna
show you guys a demo at the beginning
and the end go five-minute Q&amp;amp;A
why javascript uh because I want to show
this to you in the browser and I don't
know I'm just I'm just kind of
experimenting with JavaScript you know
like I'm changing as a as a programmer
as an artist I don't want to just like
keep doing the same thing and you know
what it's really about the the grater
idea and I think it's gonna it's you
know however many inputs I can show you
like how in neural networks the better
okay what do you think about Mark
Zuckerberg say I I think you know I have
a lot of respect for Zuckerberg that he
did that and he wrote and he wrote
something about it so I can break is a
CEO of a multi-billion dollar company
and he still programs that is something
to admire minimax algo actually no it's
not going to be using the minimax
outgrow PHP is the shittiest language
you're absolutely right can we build a
neural net to curb the overwhelming
filming feeling of existential dread yes
um we an aural net that can read our
emotional state that can we need some
kind of like a brain computer interface
but it could read our emotional state
and it could tell us what to do best so
kind of like a personal psychologist
when are you gonna do the AI neural
network for Daniel shipments asteroid
code that's gonna be either next week or
the week after that but I'm aiming for
next week you have a separate bed for
your hair when you go to sleep no uh
Suraj please do a video on auto-encoders
for data compression I do have a video
on that it's called build an autoencoder
in five minutes but I'll do another one
soon how advanced is this J is gonna be
don't have much experience in J s uh how
advanced is it going to be in terms of
JavaScript like raw JavaScript it's not
that advanced in terms of computer
science theory it's a little advanced
because we're using something called
bitwise operations which I'll explain
into in the video okay so which which
one is better SVM or neural network it
depends on what you're trying to do uh
but generally neural nets perform better
across a wide variety of tasks uh
neural net from but they give a like
just very very very little data and
you're trying to something simple like
linear regression probably an SVM a
neural net from scratch and J is exactly
what is your new year's resolution I
want uh next year I want to get let's
see probably five hundred thousand
subscribers and I want to create a movie
um with starring myself and I direct it
and I want
- uh interview Ilan and uh yeah that's
about it talk about ambition right Suraj
please do a video on wind load power
forecast uh yeah okay I mean something
on whether something on whether I've
actually been planning that what are you
going to make today I'm gonna explain
that in a second uh we have two more
minutes in this Q&amp;amp;A why is PHP so bad
because it doesn't have a lot of
maintenance its programming language is
only as good as the people who maintain
the language not many people who are
good maintain PHP anymore because all
those resources are moving to Python and
go and JavaScript why not make an AI
that directs a movie someone actually
did that check out AI movie script
Google that what to do after Andrew
Aang's course build watch my videos okay
by the way I'm trying to interview
Andrew on and I tweeted him directly so
guys check out the Twitter check out my
Twitter and then look at my tweets like
tweets and replies and see the one that
I asked Andrew on to interview for my
channel like it retweet it okay the more
people who like and retweet it the more
likely he is to say yes I want to
interview that guy okay what is your
secret sauce my secret sauce is I
genuinely truly from the bottom of my
heart I love what I do I love AI I love
neural networks I love being a youtuber
and it took me a lot of tries to fail
fail to get to where I am so my secret
is that no matter how many times I
failed I picked myself up I talked to my
friends and I and I and I just kept
going okay so one more question and then
we're gonna get going uh I want to do a
question I've never answered before uh
why suraj ology to Suraj Ravel great
question I changed the name of my
youtube channel and my just hold public
persona to my full name because as I
grow I'm becoming a public figure and I
want to be known as my full name Suraj
Rubble it's not Suraj ology the game is
over
it's shit's getting real now okay so I
am Suraj Rubble okay so just remember
that okay so here we go that's it for
the five minute Q&amp;amp;A let's get started
with the code okay so what we're going
to do is we're going to build a neural
network uh to beat the game of
tic-tac-toe I'm going to go ahead and
start screen sharing and then
we are going to get started okay uh
alright so here we go let's get started
screen share okay so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to demo this for you
guys there's actually in the browser
okay it's actually in the browser um
this is what it looks like let me just
let me just move this to the side and
let's see what you guys are saying here
okay so this is what it looks like guys
so what it's what it's doing is it is it
is running a genetic algorithm okay and
it's gonna look like this these are
these are the four board games it's got
four board games running simultaneously
this is on the web this is a web demo of
the code that I'm going to do and what
it's doing is it's trying out a bunch of
its for AI simultaneously trying out a
bunch of moods and it's recording what's
happening in the source code okay it's
recording what's happening in the source
code okay and we could take the source
code the source is the weights while
okay the weights are the connection
between the synapses in the neural
network we can take these weights and we
can put them in our neural net and it's
going to get better over time okay so
I'm gonna explain this step by step this
is what its gonna look like okay it's
gonna look like this it's a game of
tic-tac-toe we're gonna build
tic-tac-toe from scratch and then we're
gonna build our neural network from
scratch okay and there's quite a bit of
code here so I'm just gonna get started
let me X out of this and we're gonna get
to the text editor okay alright uh okay
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put
this uh on the side so I can see what
you guys are saying just like that palms
are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
there's vomit on his sweater already
mom's spaghetti okay let me make sure
I'm in the screen this time okay there
I'm in the screen okay so let's get
started okay I'm gonna code to class
file why do you talk so fast makes me
nervous
okay rightness I will I want you're
right okay everything's cool
everything's cool okay so um let's get
started the first thing we're going to
do is we are going to build our neural
network sorry we're gonna build a game
we're gonna bill
Tic Tac Toe okay it's gonna be titty tjs
okay here we go
um so let's get started the first thing
okay so what is this let me let me uh
let me explain what we're gonna do here
we're gonna step one is we're gonna
generate um a randomly sized
me let me make it bigger up up above
size population yes
are you guys seeing these comments can
you build Harambee can you build around
it oh man I love you guys man you guys
are just the best okay so we're going to
generate a randomly sized population
it's going to be player versus computer
okay it's using be player versus
computer okay so we're going to generate
a randomly sized population of neural
Nets of neural nets or the best one and
then we're going to uh and then we're
going to uh we're gonna look the top
scrag ones are favored to pick to
populate the next generation uh best
ones yet to reproduce okay so that's how
that's the basic logic of this game okay
uh it's it we're going to use pure
JavaScript it's gonna use web workers
what web workers are and I haven't
actually talked much about parallelism
ah but but web workers are basically uh
concurrency they're threads in
JavaScript we want we want these things
to be happening in parallel
remember the demo I showed you guys at
the beginning there were four games
happening at the same time those are web
workers they are happening concurrently
that means at the same time okay uh we
are using tabs not spaces okay let's go
ahead and get started
increase the font size I can do that
bump up how about how about that how's
that how's that for big as F okay
so we're gonna we're going to define our
neural net uh and we're it's going to be
called TTT for tic-tac-toe sorry we're
going to define our game which is called
tic-tac-toe or TTT okay when I start off
with a function and the function um is
going to be TTT all right
so that's the function and let's get
started here and we're going to say you
know this gonna get a opening and then
that and then okay so alright let's get
started
bigger than that my twitter handle is
Suraj Rubble si Raj Rab al let me make
that even bigger for you guys okay so
this is as big as we are going okay so
let's start off by defining our our
three states so we're going to say bar X
our um o which is the which is the sorry
this that's the bar o is you know X's
and O's okay and then Bart I and and
we're going to be X and the computer is
going to be oh okay and tie okay so now
this is going to take about 45 minutes
if I can if I can yeah that's right you
guys don't need to see the chat that's
true that's true all right I'm just
gonna so I'm not I can't see what you
guys are saying right now I'm just gonna
like start coding because that really
makes it easier for me so um and but
I'll pop it up once it once in a while
okay so let me move this to do all right
so let me make this a little bigger okay
so let's get started okay so the first
thing we want to do is think about the
squares the squares like we're going to
iterate through it through them and it's
going to look like this the iteration is
going to look like this it's going to be
like it's going to be like 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 ok they're eight a game state is
remember a tic-tac-toe is 32 vertical
lines and then there's two horizontal
lines okay so it's going to look at this
and when we iterate them we're going to
iterate at the top left and we're going
to move to the bottom right okay top
left to bottom right and it's going to
look like that so I just want to show
you that for a second okay so now let's
go ahead and initialize our board so
we're going to say function new board
and we're going to start off by
initializing our helper classes helper
classes okay these are our helper
classes that's what we all we want to
initialize our helper classes so um what
isn't what is a new board well it's
going to get nothing right we're just
initializing it so we're going to return
0 a new board gets absolutely no
now you were gonna we're going to add
value to that Newport what's another
helper function we need we want to check
if the board is empty right so let's
check let's create a function called is
empty and is empty checks uh what is the
parameter the board itself right what
are we checking we're checking if the
board is empty right so let's check out
the board is empty and we can return
it's going to be a true or false value
so I'll do a in JavaScript there are
three equal signs to four for this so
say return board 0 okay so if it's 0
then return data is going to be true or
false it's going to be a boolean value
okay so that's that's that helper
function what else do we need here let's
say we're going to get the piece okay
what is the piece the piece is what this
is to retrieve uh what's what square in
the tic-tac-toe right which square are
we using here okay um
say board we're gonna say square okay
those are our two parameters we got the
board and the square which one so we
want to get the value of that piece and
what are we doing here well guess what
guys we are defining each of these uh
squares in our tic-tac-toe not as
integers but as bits okay and why are we
thinking them as bits each of these are
two numbers they're they're they're bits
that are two numbers long like zero one
zero two zero three like that and why
are we doing that well it is faster to
perform uh uh it's it's just faster if
we're operating at the bit level rather
than an abstraction which are integers
if we're operating at the bit level all
of our operations are faster okay and
that's one of the great things about
JavaScript is we can do that so we're
gonna operate at the bit level and what
does that mean that means that we're
going to perform what are called bitwise
operations it wise operations so I mean
I mean let me write this and I'll
explain what I mean by that okay so
board okay um and I'm gonna pull up the
chat in a second because I want to see
if you guys know what I mean when I when
I do this because this is a going to be
interesting so
up-up-up and three okay so what does
this mean what does this mean this is
this is a bitwise operation so this
essentially like so what this is saying
is so for this up so for this like
whatever is in the parentheses here for
the square
this basically means take the square and
multiply it by two to the what the first
which is the one value and that's the
value we get for that that's that's
essentially a bitwise operator um and
then what does it mean for the board
well for the board that that the whole
thing means we want to take the board
and we want to divide it by uh whatever
the value up here is okay whatever this
value is so it's going to be this and
then for that for the + sign we are
going to do a bitwise and multiplies
those those two values by three bitch
just because there are three squares up
both horizontally and vertically so what
this is going to do is then give us the
bit value of whatever of wherever we are
uh in the game that's it's gonna give us
that raw bit value because that's what
this whole game is operating on its oh
its operating on bit values okay because
it's just faster to run our neural net
that way okay so that's what that's
gonna look like and I'm gonna pull up
the chat for a second I wanna see if you
guys are uh let's say hold on hold on we
pull up the chat where it's we're where
are you guys okay alright okay you guys
are on point you know I'm just gonna
keep this chat window because I want to
see you guys because I you know just in
case okay all right thanks guys okay yes
we understand this okay cool kukuku
okay all right so so that's that's we're
getting the piece uh it is an opening
eye t-shirt yes not that I worked there
but I love the t-shirt okay so so now
we've got the piece uh and now we're
going to perform a move operation so now
we're going to say move um uh so for the
move operation what we
do is um no actually I'll close out okay
so now for the move operation we're
going to say we got our board we have
our square and now we have our piece and
we want to move that value to another
position in the board okay so what does
move look like well we want to say we're
gonna again we're going to perform a
bitwise operation and then explain how
that works so we're gonna say board or
uh let's see
piece less than or nuts not bitwise left
it's a shift operator it's not a lesson
at the shift operation so Square does it
that one okay just like that and so
we've got one two three okay so what is
this doing it's going to take it's
combining those values so that's what
the or operation doing it's combining
those values so let me write a quick
example what I mean by that if we had 0
1 0 1 and then we had um oh uh if we had
Oh 1 1 1 1 combined what this is doing
is its combining those values to show
the move so this would become 1 uh 1 1 1
right so it's taking it's that or
operation so so just like that ok so
that's a move value okay so that's
what's doing for move now um so those
are our helper methods and let's go
ahead and start writing our game up
functionality so we're gonna say game
functionality so we have our board we
have the turn whoever's turn it is and
we have the history of the of the game
state okay and this is stored use it
it's a stored locally and we're using
javascript local storage of
functionality to do this it's storing it
locally in a cache in a temporary cache
okay and that's the history of game
States and it's going to be an N and
it's going to be a stack a stack data
structure so we can easily pop the top
off and replace it and we can push
something new on every time that's why
we're using a stack for that okay so
let's go ahead and initialize our values
here this is one of the annoying things
about JavaScript we just we want to we
want to initialize these these values
okay
so this dot turn hold on it's that turn
equals
and this history equals history kind of
annoying but we have to do that and it
initializes those values so now what
we're going to do is we're going to
define a prototype so every JavaScript
object has a prototype a prototype is
also an object and all JavaScript
objects inherit properties uh from their
prenda methods from their prototype ok
so this is kind of like the god of the
object so the prototype so we're going
to call the prototype of the game object
and we're going to define a bunch of
functions for this ok so the first one
we want to do is define the equals
function well what's the equals function
doing the equals function says let's
take that um game equals a function that
we already have and we want to see if
two places in the game state are equal
to each other ok so we were going to say
hold on and make sure that's all on
point okay and okay so what we're going
to do is going to say return the value
of whether or not it's equal so we're
going to say we're going to check if the
board if the board equals a whatever the
other board is and what is the other
board the other board is going to be the
next state okay we want to check if
they're equal to each other okay um and
uh the turn is the same as this other
term okay um and this is going to be
that's the equals value so we're
checking if it's equal or not ah and
want to see where you guys are at okay
um let's see okay cool
okay so so that's so that's that you
guys are keeping up more or less and now
we are going to define the get piece
method our for the prototype a prototype
but yet peas and the get piece method is
going to get the value of that piece
from our prototype right and the value
is remember it's a bit wise it's a bit o
we have a local function for this and
we're it's we're going to initialize the
prototype using that local function the
square is the actual the gamestate or
sorry the board and we're going to
return we're going to return the piece
which is going to be when we give it two
parameters the board and the square
right the board and the square because
we've already defined that get piece
method up there remember up here we
defined it so we can just return that
for the prototype okay um let's see what
else we need we need to uh Oh a move
function right so prototype uh oh this
is gonna be fun to explain so prototype
dot move um and then we're gonna say
well what's the game move what is the
game booth
given the square that we are at given
the square that we are at what does this
look like okay here's the fun part
here's the fun part so we're gonna say
if in our history in our local cache
which is a which is a stack remember I
said it's a stack we're going to push
the new value of this the new state of
the board onto our stack remember it's a
stack of of game states and then we're
going to say uh let's get this let's
take the board that we already have and
perform a move because we've just moved
it right uh given the board the square
and the turn okay
the turn of where we are lastly we want
to define the turn and it's going to be
this XOR operator this is going to do a
a bitwise XOR operation and it's going
to assign the result to the first
operator operand so what does that mean
it's gonna basically it's shifting the
bit so it's either you or me you or me
you or me right so that's it just shifts
one of one way or the other
okay so whose move is it yours or the
AIS okay so now we're going to uh uh we
also want an undo function right game
prototype but undo
okay so function game undo but what does
this mean so if we want to undo one of
our moves this is what we have to do
we've got to take the board we already
had and this is why it's great to have a
stack for this right the stack data
structure is um great for this because
we can easily we can tell it's a
constant time retrieval of whatever we
just pushed pushed on it it's a constant
time retrieval okay so we're going to
say this time history dot pop we're
gonna pop it off the stack what was that
last game state well we want that game
state and we're gonna we're going to get
it and then we're going to uh remember
we're gonna switch that turn back using
that XOR operator it's it's back to you
or it's back to me whoever was the
opposite okay and so now we want to
declare our winner so how do we need to
clear a winner well if we're going to do
a once again game dot prototype dot
winner equals function and then we have
a function internally for who is the
winner of the game given the board right
given the board we can define who the
winner is going to be and um winner is
going it's going to return a value of
who is going to be given the board this
thought for okay so now um there's one
more thing I want to do in this class
there's one more thing I want to do
we're gonna we're gonna draw the board
okay we're gonna draw the board and
before I draw the board I'm going to
write this out and I'm going to explain
what this is
okay CTX CTX is our canvas this is how
we're drawing in JavaScript don't be
confused that thing and think this is
the context it's it's it's the it's the
canvas which we can think of as an
object that we're passing around and how
we draw on the screen it's a canvas
object and
uh we're going to step-by-step draw out
this board okay it's going to be a
series of values here so we're going to
start out by we're going to initialize
our canvas by saying begin tap okay and
then we're going to say uh
we want to do a move to function and
we're going to actually do this several
times so I'm going to copy and paste
this one two three okay just like that
and I mean let me talk about what I'm
doing here but first having my move to
and then I have my line to line two
okay I am iteratively right here I am
iteratively drawing out this uh state
can anyone okay so now I'm going to
engage you guys for a second before I
draw this I haven't done this before so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
engage you guys can anyone tell me in
their own words of uh when when to use a
canvas once you use a canvas in
JavaScript like what what is an example
beside this okay when when is it good
what is it when would we use a canvas
like besides a game looks like another
application I just want to make sure
I've got you guys uh no idea okay so
another so another example would be
drawing GUI is exactly okay any any kind
of GUI image cross image processing
great example making animations okay
cool so so great to draw stuff okay so
you guys are Maps all right a lot of
great great suggestions okay
so exactly so we're gonna draw this
canvas so this is this is the kind of
like uh this is the kind of little
boring part but you know I'm just going
to write out these values and I'm gonna
explain what I'm doing which is always
the you know that part about games where
it's like you know you got a manually
you know write up the values for the the
coordinates and and yes it's six six six
I know yes it's hilarious isn't it okay
so Papa ba line move to zero point nine
five zero point three three and you'll
notice that I'm
ah using similar values here move to UM
0.56 okay so this is a move and then I
want to end it with a stroke and that's
going to be okay hold on okay so what's
happening here okay so I'm drawing out
each of those lines okay so I'm moving
to a point and then I'm drawing a line
and I'm saying what is it what is the XY
coordinate that I want to draw that ever
have that point and what is the end
point so basically it's saying okay draw
one line down vertically draw the next
line down vertically draw the other two
lines horizontally and then it does all
that in one stroke and that's it's
called by the stroke function okay so
that is what I'm going to do for the
tic-tac-toe code and now I'm going to
get straight into the neural network
okay so let's go ahead and get started
with the neural network uh the neural
net code is going to use this this code
um to uh get better over time so now
we're going to write our neural net okay
so I'm gonna use a neural network okay
code I'm gonna write that out and let me
make sure you know you guys are you guys
are on point you guys are all good
everybody's everybody's Gucci whoa all
right
okay uh we got people from all over the
place and we're going to do a neural
network now okay um cool so let's get
started so first we're going to define
our neural net variable okay and how
does that work well we're going to use
this it was just good we're going to
find our neural net okay and we're going
to write all of our functions inside of
this neural net um and oh we also want
to make sure that we are I forgot about
this that's one of those JavaScript
things about the browser use strict so
what is you straight use strict allows
you to place a program or function in a
strict operating context what does that
mean uh it basically it prevents certain
actions from being taken and and
throwing more exceptions so it's kind of
like a safety check so you know when
you're in the browser you can have a
certain things happen that you don't
want like uh let's say
I don't know some some kind of crash or
like a just an unexpected operation
especially since we're using concurrency
there can be problems like deadlocks
there can be problems like uh you know
just like uh and uh just a lot of things
can go wrong and strikes helps prevent
that okay
so so that's why we're using strict and
let's go ahead and get started here so
we're gonna write our our first function
here for a neural network which is the
get sizes function what does this do so
okay let me let me talk about this for a
second and I'm gonna have the chat open
for this while I explain a little bit
about this so um uh so so what we're
doing here is we are building the neural
net right this is a feed-forward neural
net this is a feed-forward neural net
and a feed-forward neural net it's a
three layer feed-forward neural net with
128 hidden nodes there are 128 hidden
nodes okay um and the and and why why
are we doing this uh the brain had a
little thing about the brain by the way
this is going to be a two minute tangent
where I talk about the brain and then
I'm gonna get back into the code okay so
the brain has like a hundred it has a
hundred billion neurons which
communicate uh through electrochemical
signals and these neurons are connected
through junctions known as synapses and
each neuron receives thousands and
thousands of connections with other
neurons constantly signals to reach the
cell body okay and the resulting sum of
the signal if the resulting sum of the
signals surpasses a certain threshold
then a response is sent throughout the
axon so we have to reach a certain
threshold for that doubt for the value
to UM continue Appa gate forward
throughout through our neural network
okay that's what we want to do I'm going
to talk about the threshold in a second
okay so let's go ahead and start with
our get sizes function so forget sizes
and by the way guys check out write this
down okay write this down
MCB 180x well I'll say to get MCB 180x
it's a free course online by Harvard
University which I took I absolutely
love it's gonna it talks about the brain
is
introduction to neuroscience and it
provides a great gateway into neural
networks you see things like a theme
forward recurrent these terms that we
talk about in in machine learning they
are actually there in the brain and this
is a great course to learn about the
brain and kind of get biologically
inspired by the beauty of our brains
internal neural networks remember MCB
180x grade course okay so let's get back
to this so what we're going to do is
we're going to return a collection of
nodes notes are we have nodes in each
layer of our network right a three layer
feed-forward neural network each layer
has an amount of nodes so what we want
to do when this get sizes function is we
want to get the size of each layer and
what is the size of each layer it's
gonna be the number of nodes or neurons
in each layer so we're gonna say return
nodes dot Matt funk and return nodes up
map and we're gonna say um uh for that
layer let's uh return that layers length
all right so we have the length is going
to be the number of nodes in that layer
so that's going to get give us the
length this is a helper function so the
next one is well we know how to get the
sizes but let's make the actual node or
neuron itself so let's write a function
for that
so we'll say make node give into layers
index give in the index itself the sizes
and the notes okay um well so let's
initialize this hold on in it okay let's
initialize it so each node let's let's
start out by initializing our node our
node is going to have an input of zero
that's going to be the initial input
they have nothing remember or there's
nothing in there it's going to start off
as zero okay and now we want to define
our threshold fine threshold
okay and I remember I talked about that
threshold right the threshold is the the
the top it is the the threshold is the
limit right and it's and if the amount
of the sum of all the activation
functions on the data from one net to
the other if it reaches that threshold
then it can propagate but it has to
reach that threshold for it to propagate
just like in the brain
okay so let's define the threshold and
we're going to say if layers index it's
less than the length of the sizes of the
layers then we're going to say get that
threshold and we want to initialize it
as um whatever comes out of this
function okay what is the function we're
going to say the type of nodes if it's
undefined so as it as in there's nothing
there or uh that value is one then uh
the nodes it's get the layer index and
the index the other index let me talk
about this what's happening here
let's see now each node is connected to
every other node in the next layer so
it's a 2d matrix it's a 2d matrix of
values all right each node is connected
to every other node remember those
weights those connections those synapses
and it's a 2d matrix and we're going to
define the threshold just like that okay
so now at speaking of weights let's
define our nodes weights we have so
let's define those weights so those
wastes are part of the node and we're
going to say type of nodes if it's
undefined again so if there's if there's
nothing there or or if there's uh if
there's if there's nothing there or uh
hold on you array sizes we're index plus
one
just write this out and then I'm going
to define what I'm talking about here
layer index and then I'm going to pull
up the chat for a second just let see
where you guys are at um
function W and return W okay okay so let
me talk about what's happening here
okay so okay so we have our weights of
our nodes and if it is empty or there's
if we've uh if the node is empty or
there's an there's an array with with
with some value in it then we want to
return the number of weights in that and
in that node and we're going to update
the connections in that node via this
waitstop map function okay and we're
we're and we're gonna return the value
let me define the weights that's what
this is doing its defining the weights
okay now let me see if anybody has any
questions here okay what do we got here
what we've got here um did nothing in
the chat all right cool cool cool okay
all right cool cool okay so those are
our functions and when we and now we can
return that node okay that's the end of
that a function and we can return our
node okay um boom so now let's define so
that's the node now let's define the
network itself the actual network right
it's a neural network let's define that
Network and for the input we could give
it we could either create or we can
either initialize our network the
Assizes value or a node value as in the
size of a layer is equal to the number
of nodes so we're just going to say
sizes or nodes okay we can initialize it
either way um
and we'll define we'll define variables
for both of these things for the sizes
and for the notes so we want to say if I
array is an array of sizes or nodes that
value we had for the parameter and the
array is an array and if it so let me be
more specific about what I'm doing here
so um sizes are nodes hold on
and if there's something in there and
okay so first of all so what is it
saying this is saying it first of all if
there is if the if the parameter is not
empty then we want to take those values
and we're going to initialize them the
local variables that we initialize we're
going to use that get sizes function
that we define and we're going to use
the size or nodes a parameter and then
we're going to neutralize our nodes
okay there are two values that we're
thinking about here sizes or nodes um
else sizes equals sizes or nodes okay um
that's our else value and now we want to
define how many nodes we have okay so
now we're going to define how many nodes
we have so bump up up so how many nodes
do we have the map function is going to
help us get that that value it's going
to be a callback it's going to be a
function callback where we have a size
and the iterator as the parameter okay
which is which we're going to we're
going to use to to to iterate through
this um which is we're going to use it
to iterate through the array count the
number values and then that's going to
be that the number of nodes that we have
okay so we're gonna say bar each layer
is going to be an array initialized by
its size okay so and
so layer is initialized as an array of
sizes so let's do our iteration to count
the number of nodes we're gonna we're
going to count the number of nodes so
say bar J bar top is zero and uh J and
remember J is just arbitrary it's less
than the size for iterating through the
size and we're going to say uh plus plus
J okay so we're gonna iterate through
each uh and so and then I'm going to
pull up the chat and we'll answer a few
questions or if any if there are and
what is that so what is what is each
layer we're going to where we're giving
those layers values here and we're
saying make a node given the length
given where we are given the sizes and
given the number of nodes okay and that
come we're gonna define each of our
layers and when we're done with that
when we when we initialize you to our
layers we're doing two things here we're
defining our notes and we're
initializing our layers at the same time
okay that's so and then we'll return
that value when it's done okay and ah so
there's that um okay so we've got that
there where do I get the t-shirt uh guys
just wait a second I'm gonna I'm gonna
launch a clothing line soon okay right
no self-promotion guys okay so so that's
that um ok one more function in this
class one more function in this class so
we want to we want to set the weight
values okay we're going to set the
weight values we're going to say the
prototype of our neural network is going
to set our weight values um all right so
we could also if we wanted to we could
write a get function so we could get our
weights but we're just gonna write a set
weight function okay um
function is going to be the net set
weights um given the
so we're going to give it weights as a
parameter one of those weights going to
be well they're going to be a 2d matrix
each layer for each node each node in so
inside of each layer in our neural
network through a collection of nodes
and each node has a 2d matrix of weights
that connect it to every other node in
the next layer and we want to set the
values for those weights and how are we
updating this well it's not through back
propagation it through genetic algorithm
right so instead of just saying we're
gonna update the weights constantly um
via back propagation uh uh and gradient
descent we're going to update the
weights by putting them by by having
several neural nets and just having them
play like I showed you in the web app
and then taking those weights uh and
taking the weights of the best ones and
and and updating the only the best
neural nets and then having those and
then and then creating more from those
okay so so okay so for each node we're
going to say well where are we where are
we in terms of our layer and where are
we in terms of the weights so there are
two indexes here the index of where we
are in the layer and then the index of
where we are in though in the weights or
matrix okay so um we're going to take
the weights of our node and by the way
this code is going on github guys I'm
going to within an hour of me finishing
this I'm going to put postal code on
github the complete code including the
HTML and the CSS which is actually quite
long which I'm not going to do in this
I'm just doing the logic I'm just doing
the hard logic for this the logic that
matters okay so um so our waves are
going to be um we're going to take the
index that we were we were given and
then we're going to take the index right
both of those were given we're going to
map it to via this callback function and
then we're going to return the value of
W which is going to be our weight 2d
matrix okay ah now at the end of this
we're going to say that our neural net
equals the neural net that we've just
initialized okay and then we could
return that okay so now let me see the
chat and okay okay so now so so so let
me let me show you guys that then okay
so that's oh um so let's let's go over
what I've what I've done so far um so
what I've done is I've initialized my
board I've initialized that I've created
a set of helper methods to get the
pieces to check if it's empty uh to move
it to get the pieces then I've
initialized the gamestate and I've used
the prototype a function of JavaScript
of that game object to define a bunch of
very important moves like checking a to
pieces or equal to check it two squares
or equal to get the piece to move on to
see who the winner is and then to draw
the board is in canvas I've created a
neural net function or a neural net
class uh that's that initializes a node
what is a node look like well a node is
a an object that has connections to
every other node in every layer of our
neural network um there is a library
called convinent J s cray by Andre
karpati which I've met he's a cool guy
um but um yeah but that's not what we're
doing right now I would thought about
doing that I might do I will do that in
a future video um and uh we we've
initialize our know to initialize our
network we set the weight values for
each of those okay and so that's how so
that's how um that is working and and I
will fully comment the code and post
this on github it's not a recurrent net
it is a feed-forward neural net so let
me let me just show you guys this code
okay
so lunch will just look like um so
that's what that looks like
and putting a call right now do not call
me while I'm live you know what I'm
saying okay so so that's what that what
that has done and what I want to do is I
want to show you guys uh what that looks
like
um so we're going to go to the that
value I could run this off a local
server um Kitty um but I don't want to
do that right now I want to UM hold on
Shh does it did is it work what was this
not open up chrome from second what was
it T was it what was it
ioki it was something but essentially um
that was what it was and um all guys
 alright okay so um so that's what
that was and they're showing you guys my
history here okay so that is our aa
MacBook is promoting itself right okay
so so that was the code and uh what I
want to do is I want to if I can get the
link to this show you guys you know what
I'm going to post a link in the
description and uh then I'm going to the
link to the web app is going to be there
but but what happened was I I had that I
had the demo but I just can't find the
a link to it right now so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to stop the screen
share here and stop screen sharing and
I'm going to do me okay so uh ending
five minute Q&amp;amp;A and then we can get
started okay I say I'm still out there
yes yeah I'm still there okay
so yeah okay cool so five minute you a
can you make the same tic-tac-toe with
Java yeah absolutely
I I don't have a link to that uh but if
you just search tic-tac-toe on github
and then just Java I promise you you
will find results okay yes there we go
thank you ChaCha he showed uh where it's
where it's at where it's at exactly you
know what I'm going to show you guys the
the demo of this okay let me let me show
you guys then what you guys deserve a
demo so so so so I'm gonna screen share
oh I'm so excited I mean let me start
the screen share okay guys check this
out okay so what is what's happening
this was gonna look like
we take our we take our weights we take
our weights okay so which is it's going
to learn via genetic programming and
then we can we can we can test it so
what does that look like hold on okay so
we're going to say AI neural net and
we're gonna paste those weights in the
weights that it learn from genetic
program from from this genetic
environment and we'll paste those
weights in is remember these weights are
a matrix of values of what it's learned
through playing okay and I'll play
something it's gonna think and then it's
gonna play and then I'll play something
it's gonna think and then it's gonna
play look at the smart thing it's trying
to go in that bottom left corner I am
NOT gonna let you because you are not
smart enough to be a human yet okay so
that's what the hell looks like okay so
I'm gonna stop screen sharing again and
back to my now three-minute Q&amp;amp;A but
whoever some of the links that thank you
so much okay so three more minutes
Jupiter notebook ah that I'm gonna you
know what I'm gonna start using more
Jupiter notebooks um for sure in the
future great a great thing thanks David
for that compliment uh can you do more
slow tutorials focus more on
understanding the theory yes absolutely
max I I'm getting better at this
schooling I went to Columbia I studied
myself on the Internet all this stuff on
my own how is this better than simply
writing a tic-tac-toe game using the
Monte Carlo method um so the Monte Carlo
tree search is actually quite um
effective and uh out and alphago alphago
use Monte Carlo how is it better it's
not better actually um it's just
different
did you add more grey to your hair spark
uh I didn't it's just it's just always
like that now but I'm going to regrow it
in the future there's training more with
more is training more with more layers
make the AI better uh generally the more
layers you add the better your neural
network is uh but the trick is to just
to just have as many layers as you need
because the more layers you add the more
computation there is right so like
always there's that trade-off
Siraj I would like you I would like to
suggest to you a simple game I made and
want to implement a bot into it loose
loose loose Emma definitely post that in
the comments which books are useful um
Andrew Wong has a new book out called
machine learning yearning uh Ian's good
fellow uh has a book out who's one of
the researchers at open AI called deep
learning which I would definitely uh
read is the gray hair related to machine
learning the gray hair is just my style
you know what I mean which laptop are
you using a MacBook Pro 2015 no it is a
MacBook Pro 2016 with the force touch
could you make a simple tutorial about
deep learning which learn you from zero
to hero in that field that is coming up
next here and by next year I mean in
January it's going to be a from scratch
series that I'm going to make um hi
Suraj from where can we get the data set
for an AI girlfriend um look for chat
logs for um uh chat chat room chat logs
for like a dating site are you slowly
building a self-loading AI for retro
games maybe in the future uh yes I I
mean I I am going to focus more on games
in the future yes absolutely
okay do you recommend Jas or Python for
AI learn
Python Python a budget but but the Khans
net Jas library by Andre is actually
pretty good
Jake glad to have you here my life
livecast harsh thank you up up or can we
make more similar programs yes doing
neural net for playing Tetris eventually
make a neural net per assembly okay so
um I I'm going to tell a short story and
then we're done um end video with the
song that's a great idea
oh you know what I'm live so I'm just
gonna freestyle okay so uh by the way I
had this uh my mentor at meetup when I
worked at meetup as an intern yeah he
was like I remember like being really
confused
it was obvious an iOS programmer at
meetup for the summer and I was like
trying to figure out this problem in it
and if any of you guys have used Xcode
before you know that when something goes
wrong and you have a great point it
shows a bunch of assembly which I've
always kind of just like ignored but he
was like I was like I was ahead I was
focusing on his problem for like four or
five hours and I just couldn't figure it
out and then he comes in my mentor
Michael gray and he's just like you
looks at the assembly and he's like
within thirty seconds he's like that's a
problem looking at the assembly how
gangster is that so yeah neural network
for assembly maybe a bit maybe in the
future so I'm gonna end this with that
freestyle rap someone get and I'll
freeze all about machine learning so
someone give me a topic
I'll go it's gonna be a one-minute
freestyle someone say topic just someone
say a topic I'll just wait for a topic
here we go whatever is the first topic
uh assembly is badass let's just do
assembly okay I love assembly I'm like
it's like my enemy because it's so hard
that I cannot see what is happening my
mind is so free when I look at it it
looks at me and it says you can't beat
me because I'm better than you don't you
see okay so that was my short 15-second
restyle okay so anyway uh thanks guys
for watching for now I've got a go focus
on this video I'm making so thanks for
watching love you guys code is going up
very soon joined a slack channel by the
way there's a slide channel continue the
conversation there it's in the
description of every one of my videos
that wasn't even a minute I know
I'm getting better okay so thanks guys
love you okay how do I end this session
there we go
