fails at some point the question is how
do you overcome this failure I'm gonna
recall five times in my life where I
failed big time and talk about how I
later recovered to give you some insight
into ways of overcoming failure in
general one of my first big fails was
fitting in to the modern American
narrative what I mean is I was born in
Houston Texas shout-out to h-town two
parents from India and I spent my
formative years there I was born with
the name Suraj and in middle in high
school I got made fun of a lot in a
racist way I also never saw any
character in American TV or movies that
looked like me doing cool stuff and it
makes sense Indians had only started to
migrate to the States
in the past couple decades but I didn't
feel like I fit in with the Indian
culture either
I was never Indian enough for that group
my family of course loved me but I
wanted that love and acceptance from the
kids at school and the ladies of course
and I just never felt it I wanted to be
white I didn't want to be racialized aka
put into a box as that Indian kid who
did some great thing but instead I
wanted to be that kid who did some great
thing so I legally changed my name to
Jason Scott Revell the year before I
went to college at Columbia University
in New York City I lightened my skin
changed my style tried to be a whole new
person
a fresh restart on life but what I later
found was that nothing really changed I
still didn't feel fully accepted and
introducing myself to Indian people
became awkward AF as the years passed I
learned to fully accept myself for who I
was I stopped trying to be what I
thought other people would like and
instead focused more on being the best
version of me sure I don't know anyone
out there who's both a rapper and really
into artificial intelligence sure it's
not a normal thing but I'm not a normal
person I'm a new breed and
I'm gonna bring my abnormal reality into
the mainstream narrative and change
culture I'll make a place for myself and
not as Jason I legally changed my name
back to Suraj and it was liberating when
I focus on being true to myself I
started to attract the right kind of
friends and finally felt that sense of
belonging that I always wanted my second
big fail I had was my first startup
lucid robotics that I started as a
student at Columbia
I was so manically obsessed with
building a robot to help the elderly
with chores I woke up everyday really
excited and spent long nights in the
robotics lab planning next steps I
managed to find a team of great people
after countless interviews I managed to
raise a seed round after being rejected
by 30 or 40 venture capital firms in New
York and we managed to build a working
prototype but the market didn't want our
product the team got disillusioned with
the idea and our Investor lost hope nine
months of hard work and I had nothing to
show for it the worst part was that
failing at the startup made me slowly
lose my passion for robotics in a big
way and I didn't know if it would come
back I felt really lost and afraid I
didn't know what I should do next but I
did know that I didn't want to dwell on
this failure too long San Francisco was
a place I'd always wanted to live in so
I packed my things and moved to a hacker
house 20 beds in one room it was gritty
it was uncomfortable but it was me
moving forward from failure into a new
environment of possibility and as I met
starry-eyed entrepreneurs there my
passion for AI returned and I began to
search for new ways to have impact the
third fail I had was getting rejected
from so many different jobs during my
first full-time job hunt in SF I made
sure my resume looked well formatted and
impressive and I used a bunch of
recruiting agencies to help me get
interviews for different startups in the
area but one
one I got rejection after rejection and
every time I would lose a little bit of
Hope meanwhile I had friends who
seemingly easily got jobs at really cool
companies I didn't know what I was doing
wrong
maybe I wasn't enthusiastic enough
during the interview maybe I needed to
study more maybe I needed to apply for a
different position it was really
stressful but I found that since I
ensured my body and mind were healthy
and that I kept a positive attitude on
life I preserved through all the
rejection until I got my first offer
it's never easy rising up the career
ladder whether you go through a
corporate route or a startup route you
continually build trust in your own name
brand by the brand's aka companies
you've worked with and things get easier
as you go but you've got to put in that
initial effort to get your first gig no
matter how many rejections you get at
first my fourth fail was getting fired
from Twilio and this is the first time
I'm publicly admitting that when I first
landed the job as a developer educator
at Twilio I was delighted I learned so
much in such a short period of time
technical writing wasn't some chore that
developers had to do it was a craft a
skill that could be honed over time a
mix of math and programming and prose it
was the perfect job for me I was writing
API Docs in multiple programming
languages for multiple products that
affected over a million developers I
loved my team and what I did but near
the end my performance started to drop I
had the idea to make videos for
developers and my team at the time
didn't really think it was a good idea
to focus on that so I started my own
YouTube channel to experiment with the
idea I started dedicating more and more
of my time to that and my performance at
my job suffered as a result so I was
eventually let go I gave myself a single
week to feel sorry for myself I felt
like I'd let down so many people who
believed in me but in that fail
I found the opportunity to finally be
able to work on my youtube channel
full-time I was able to turn that sorrow
into excitement it was risky it was fun
it was liberating and I don't regret it
one bit my fifth failure was actually
multiple little failures all the times I
received mostly negative comments when I
first started making YouTube videos some
of my initial videos were really low
budget and I definitely got a lot of
criticism my close friends at the time
sat me down and told me it wasn't a good
idea that I should instead get a job at
a cool company or think of some b2b
product idea but I was so motivated by a
mixture of wanting to educate people and
wanting my own independence that I kept
at it defiantly
I learned to take each negative comment
as crucial feedback I let the critics
help me mold and shape the content so
that it got better and better every time
I watched lots of YouTube videos of
people who inspired me and made sure to
stay inspired even during my darkest
hours I didn't really know what it was
that I was doing was it a startup
was it a hobby all I knew is that I had
a mission to inspire and educate
developers to build AI and that's what
kept me going no matter how silly I
looked on camera and eventually the
channel grew to what it is today it's
been just over two years since I started
this YouTube channel because of it I've
had the opportunity to speak at the
United Nations CERN a bunch of
conferences all over the world I taught
a deep learning course at Udacity I made
a video for Elon Musk so many awesome
things have happened and I've just
started what's turning out to be a very
successful company the school of AI if I
can do great things so can you so get to
it wizard I'm here for you the winner of
last week's coding challenge is Hamad
Sheikh Hamad used a really cool data set
to predict whether or not students would
get probation in theirs
second year and he used logistic
regression to do this great work and the
runner-up is Vladdy Vladdy also used a
logistic regression model built-in numpy
to predict whether or not there was
breast cancer in some patients amazing
work please subscribe for more
programming videos and for now I've got
explore Lisbon so thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
