well you mind if I ask you 67 questions
sure all right let's do this what is it
how the culture is great it's a real
emphasis on research and really I guess
advancing AI what excites you the most
about machine learning I think it's the
capability for people to do stuff that
no one had really been able to do before
without like an entire workforce of
people about where you grew up okay one
thing about Australia is eucalyptus
leaves they are beautiful and they smell
so nice you can look just trees
everywhere and luckily we have a few of
them in California what time do you wake
up I wake up oh gosh more like 10:00
a.m.
it was one of the most stressful but
truly pleasurable experiences in my life
I learned so much
I would have to say Twitter is my main
vice and also vote your favorite machine
Oh mixture of self Max's
one person who would it be Shannon from
entropy your last day I started got
acquired by Salesforce how did you
celebrate well the whole team went out
and had drinks at one of the nearby boss
so pretty time sad normal what's it like
doing research as a full-time job as a
full-time job it's amazing because you
actually get to hurt in on the exact
problem that you're interested in and
just stay there and keep working at it
bravest thing you've ever done Oh
probably more to the US away from
friends and family what is one thing
that scares you I would say Heights
honestly that's something that I don't
think I'm ever gonna be able to work
boss
favorite movie Oh
inception do you play any instruments
yeah I'll actually play piano and
trombone and guitar what's more
interesting physics or drone science
physics certainly because we can
understand it better at the moment
that's present you've ever received when
I was like I think nine or ten my
parents actually gave me a computer but
they set it in the middle of the
corridor and I didn't even realize it
until I go to the room what is something
you do to relax best thing is usually
television shows or movies with friends
what is something surprising about you I
am probably one of the pickiest eaters
you'll ever meet and chicken nuggets and
frozen Kerkar basically my life
do you prefer cats or dogs horses what
the machine learning model that doesn't
get enough attention
I think studying
I think starting with like the simplest
baseline models is the best way to go so
just stick with multi-layer perceptrons
for the starting point what's your
favorite operating I gotta say Linux do
you play any sports no really not most
adventurous thing you've never done a
multi-day hike through the Australian
outback
what's one source you use to stay
up-to-date and machine learning
honestly it's Twitter again like the
people you find there is this amazing
programming language of choice for
machine parts - favorite professor dr.
James carne from the University of
Sydney Australia why do you think
programming is fun
I think programming it enables you to do
some completely and utterly tremendous
things that again you'd never be able to
yourself you can control a machine that
can run billions calculations a second
human society because I don't see where
the end point is for it favorite comfort
chicken nuggets name one person you
really admire one of my curve of my
colleagues James Bradbury what was your
first program oh sorry
first program it was a hello world app
that literally just read in my name and
then spat it out back at me Oh Brad and
mi a-- from in video
back home to Australia would you live on
Mars yes what is one thing you can't
unfortunately my laptop
what is one skill you wish you have
I wanna see your nerve what is the last
thing you do before bed okay so I
actually play the same set of four songs
from a soundtrack every night from
Ender's Game what text editor you use of
them what open source library PI torch
is beautiful what was a hard problem you
so most recently language modeling
what's the meaning of life friends
family and I guess science who is one
author you really like I love Isaac
Asimov what is one thing that excites
you that we are getting back into space
best advice you've ever received just go
for it even if you have no clue of what
you're actually doing what is one piece
of advice you give yourself
be less worried about making mistakes
you spend more time on the internet or
real life internet well and truly you've
been do you have any pets yes if you
count my parents sir it's three dogs one
cat and three horses what's something
you've learned in to casa
how difficult audio is in terms of
actually processing with deep learning
do you like spicy food no not at all
what is the movie that made you cry oh
the beginning of if you are in the world
what is one law you didn't act
oh I'm gonna try and stay away from
being too controversial made a very soft
Universal income is this singularity
near not near enough to worry about yet
john johnson color filter basically told
me a good chunk of the programming i
know what deep learning library you you
know by touch if you were to start from
scratch today what is a learning
resource you would use to learn machine
learning fausto day I by Jeremy Howard
and Rachel Thomas what is one goal you
have in the next 10 years and the next
10 years I want us to be able to compose
an entire orchestra without having to
think about it favorite subject Oh Latin
if you could be a superhero who would it
be
this filming to be said about imn for
the fact that he had to develop
everything himself
what's your spirited
probably a flaw I'm kind of lazy what do
you predict comes next after the deep
learning hype
well hopefully the deep learning hype
doesn't die down but I think everything
connected devices Bitcoin are aetherium
aetherium did you delete your Facebook
nope
Google home or Amazon Alexis neither
don't want anything listening to me you
prefer supervised or unsupervised
learning unsupervised favorite
conference you've ever been to probably
nips Ostia awesome Steven well thanks
