I ask you a few questions let's do it
all right well how much do you sleep
every night about six hours where do you
live in Amsterdam where did you study at
Columbia University what's your favorite
book
the road by Cormac McCarthy what is the
coolest deep learning project you've
seen open mind by Andrew Trask do you
need to know very complex math at the
level of calculus or linear algebra to
start on the path of deep learning no in
fact you just need to know programming
and if you can code with caras you can
do this stuff in nine or ten lines of
code if you want to get more advanced
than you'll use some math how long did
it take you to get into machine learning
it took me I was on and off for about
three years but to really get started it
took me about three months I live in the
developing country how can I make a
positive change here through machine
learning there is always an opportunity
to use machine learning in some way find
a problem that you want to solve that's
the first step and once you do apply
machine learning to it you can always do
that in order to master deep learning is
there JavaScript comes in at a close
second and also go is a great language
which courses that you take a uni that
you would recommend uh at my university
there were I mean it was it was a close
university but online I could say a
great core to take is the Udacity deep
learning nano degree as well as Andrew
means new deep learning course can they
I be used to retouch skin portions by
removing blemishes playing with
Photoshop oh for sure yeah that would be
a that would be a generative problem so
you don't you'd want to use an auto
encoder to encode that image and then
you would learn the latent
representation and then you could
generate an image without the blemishes
which country would you like to visit
most I'm really excited to go to India
in five days so I will be in India I'm
very excited and if you've started today
which learning resource would you use to
master deep learning I wonder what I
would use my channel for sure my channel
and also I would look at Udacity and
Coursera
how can introverted or shy people
improve their confidence to be more like
you as these traits are helpful in tech
it just takes a lot of practice I'm not
naturally a super social person but but
just by constantly putting myself out
there in front of the world being
vulnerable it definitely just builds up
your confidence so it's a discipline
that you build up over time what drives
you to create YouTube content instead of
working on some high-end AI or machine
learning research independently or
collaboratively with great minds of our
time I would love to do a project that
is put in the hands of millions of users
but it's kind of a sacrifice right
making content is my way of making
impact I could do one or the other
ideally I could do both we'll see we'll
see where that goes
have you ever tried clarify school image
recognition technology which is a direct
competitor to Google I have I think it's
really easy to use and thumbs up what do
you think about independent startups
competing with big giants and AI Tech's
such as Google Microsoft Amazon and why
would you prefer one over the other such
as clarify versus Google there is
definitely a space for startups for sure
there's so many different exit
strategies there's so much different
data that's available for small startups
that you can use at Google or Amazon or
the Giants haven't used yet there's the
space is really hot so don't be don't be
discouraged by the fact that Google and
all these big companies exist okay well
if you were an element what element
would you be called and what would your
properties be I would be Suraj iam and
my properties would be dreaming big and
competence and science scientific
thinking lots of managers lack an
understanding of IT and what ml is
capable of and you experience how would
you best manage the expectations of what
is possible and what is realistic well
yeah I mean the standard rules rules
apply of under promising and over
delivering so just you'd have to have a
good knowledge of your problem domain
first and if you do and then be able to
say what you can and cannot do don't
just make BS promises because that's
gonna backfire do you stand for net
neutrality and how is it important to
you oh for sure we the internet is it
has to be a level playing field I mean I
went from zero to I think 170k
subscribers just on my own so far and
yeah if net neutrality didn't exist the
top creators on YouTube would just get
higher
and hire interns with subscribers and I
would still be at you know zero to 30 K
subs we need it how do I start my
journey as a text feeder uh somewhere
right I mean you always have meetups
near you just do something small and
work your way up build a name for
yourself your name is your brand build
it start somewhere do you get sponsored
by conference organizers for your talks
I have been offered and I've just
started to do the whole speaking thing
in person I mean I could just make
videos so yeah I'm gonna start charging
soon because it takes a time time tech
rifice away from my other content
whether you start with machine learning
I started I mean it's kind of ambiguous
like I started in college when I was a
sophomore
you know I dabbled in it but I only
really seriously got started about a
year and a half ago when I started this
channel what problems could you resolve
with deep learning technology in ten
years me personally or just in general a
lot of applications in health care
taking away a lot of the grunt work that
doctors have to do and also in
democratizing data there's a huge
opportunity there because everybody
wants data but data isn't accessible to
everybody so any kind of project that
does that helps with that is a good
opportunity do you watch a TV shows like
Silicon Valley mr. robot or West world
and if you watch them what do you think
I have heard of them I've seen the first
episode of Silicon Valley it's too much
like my life so I'm not gonna watch it I
don't have time to watch that much
long-form content i watch a lot of
YouTube but not really long with TV
shows what role do you think that
there's a machine that you should play
reading bias in machine learning
minorities it all comes back to the data
make sure that you have quality diverse
data right overfitting can result in the
things we've seen in the news where
there is bias in terms of race so make
sure you have diverse data why is it
machine learning called statistical
learning it could definitely be it's
just it's just friends right these are
just brands and stories and marketing
and we call it different things but in
the end it's all about mathematical
optimization what are your personal
objectives for the next
I would like to build a Content machine
it kind of like a Khan Academy for AI
slash Netflix for education that just
gets really big and gets a lot of people
to watch and makes a big big impact will
we solve intelligence in your lifetime
um yes we will 100% I don't even know
why I had to think about that for a
second yes we will we will what is the
best resource for learning mathematics
involved in machine learning or deep
learning there's a great deep learning
book by Ian good fellow definitely check
that book out also my channel for sure
the math of intelligence series watch it
all those are the two best ones in terms
of the current market which jobs would
you think would get first affected by
artificial intelligence anything that is
just people don't like any jobs that
people don't like so anything like call
center support or cashiers as well
cashiers in terms of the current market
which jobs would you think would get I
set that 133 if you were stranded on an
island for life which three apps would
you choose my I would choose Twitter
because I absolutely love Twitter I
would choose Facebook just cuz yeah
social media and also read it because I
love Reddit how important are data
structures and algorithms for machine
learning will it leads me to be deep
learning as well I'm a beginner the
instructions and algorithms are super
important for anything you do in
computer science definitely if you have
any interest in web development mobile
ml blockchain just get your data
structures and algorithms in line first
and then move on to the harder stuff
what's your view when alums concern
about the surge in AI he's totally right
we need to regulate it we need some kind
of oversight in some way to make sure
that the bad actors don't get too much
power what's the project you've built
that you're most proud of my youtube
channel what's the one resource which
helped you get up and running quickly in
machine learning the machine learning
subreddit do you have a circle of people
you mentor personally who plan to grow
in the field of machine learning if yes
how can someone join I don't I I don't
have enough time for that right now my
channel I think of everybody as a group
yeah
how do you see reinforcement learning
impacting the future in terms of
practical applications practical
applications reinforcement learning is
one of those emerging like it's gonna
have its de heyday it's not right now
maybe it's in maybe it's next year maybe
it's in five years but in terms of the
first applications I would say it's
anything with cleaning robots or real
life robots that will do some kind of
disaster recovery or something that
humans don't want to do if you could go
back in time but the same knowledge you
have now when and where would you go I
would go back to New York to Columbia
and I would have started my youtube
channel earlier is it essentially needed
when you prepare for technical
interviews to try to solve problems on
your own without looking at solutions
yeah for sure yeah you got it you got to
work the brain right it's a discipline
you got to work the brain the better it
gets at this algorithm stuff the better
it's gonna be for your interviews hey
Suraj you're awesome
I want to learn about machine learning
but I'm a complete beginner could you
outline a rough idea of what I should
look to do to learn machine learning
just okay watch my learn Python for data
science series then watch my machine
learning for hacker series then watch my
introductory x' then watch my math of
intelligence series in that order what
math courses have you taken I mean on
and off I've taken some calculus courses
linear algebra here and there online at
university in high school but in the end
you the best way to learn this stuff is
to just a Khan Academy is a great
resource let me just put it very simply
use Khan Academy for your math
essentials what do you think about the
latest achievement of open a eyes dota
playing agents oh my god that was so
badass that is very cool I'm so glad
that open AI did that they are back they
are hot right now so I'm yeah I think
it's awesome do you think that a
master's degree is required to work in
big companies or is a bachelor's and
being good enough
being good is enough for the right
companies of course are always gonna be
companies that really care about your
credentials but the but the best
companies care about what you can output
so make sure you have your github full
of great projects how many hours a week
do you work and study oh my god I work
at least 80 hours a week I am a
workaholic I work Monday through
Saturday I take sunday off
but it sometimes they even work on
Sunday yeah can you juggle three balls
no who is Suraj Raval the first of his
kind what is intelligence how far are we
in solving it intelligence is the
ability to adapt and to learn and we are
I would say five to ten years away from
solving it
what are GM's generative adversarial
networks are a technique invented by Ian
good fellow that let you that have two
neural networks dual against each other
and the result is being able to generate
data types that have not been possible
before you are about to get into a fight
what song comes on as your soundtrack
fight music by Eminem this kind of music
use it anyway what languages can you
speak
besides programming ones English
Gujarati which is a dialect from North
India Hindi which is the language of
India Spanish from high school I grew up
in Houston Texas shout-out to Houston
and I worked at a flea market with my
dad just selling cell phone accessories
talks about and I had to learn Spanish
so Spanish Hindi Gujarati and I'm
learning Dutch we'll see how that goes
would you ever go to Mars of course I
would go to Mars I am just waiting to go
to Mars that's gonna happen for sure
Elon if you're watching this you know
you know what the deal is so checking
yeah how do I get into research without
a masters or PhD yo okay so my thing is
I am trying to democratize research
right so I haven't really gone into that
field but we're getting to a point where
anybody will be able to publish research
online I'm trying to grow the amateur
research community you don't need to
have a PhD to publish valuable research
we're gonna get to that point in terms
of what the progress so far in that
field I would say it's this still dot
pub what do you do for a living I make
youtube videos I make you know some
money off of ads and patreon and my deal
with Udacity that I just did how do you
think blockchain and AI could be
implemented together oh my god great
question open mind by Andrew Trask check
that out great example file coin is
another great example anytime you want
to create a decentralized application AI
can be used to make it more
these are all technology and hey I are
just technologies to make autonomous app
software what inspired you to get into
AI I was traveling through India and I
saw a lot of problems that I didn't
think would be solvable in my lifetime
and I just came to the realization that
the only way we're going to really solve
all these problems
the only real chance we have is to solve
AI why it's a tie between Kanye West's
for being a creative who is unapologetic
and Andrew Andrew hung I wake up at 8
a.m. I drink some coffee and I either I
start writing and programming and
editing and sometimes shooting if I'm
shooting a video and I do that until
9:00 or 10:00 p.m. on and off suggest
some good books you think people should
read read ok some good book people
should read read the deep learning book
I already said that read how to create a
mind by Kurzweil and one wore this super
intelligence by bostrÃ¶m Nick Bostrom
what was the best advice you've ever
been given
also sapiens by the book sapiens the
best advice I've ever been given is
every time you have a decision it was
actually by my hair my hairdresser he
said the every time you have a decision
and you think the harder choice the more
risky choice is gonna be worse it never
is
so just take the leap and do the riskier
thing what are the coolest libraries you
use often tensorflow and also pi torch
and i have been really getting into
decentralized applications so I would
say truffle and open Zeppelin and
aetherium how can deep learning help in
solving unanswered questions in
biomedicine
yeah I mean you could use generative
models to generate new types of medicine
you could use discriminative model to
detect diseases that exist so both of
those things what do you think about
engines new course on deep learning I
think it's dope I I support anything
that he does we were trying to
democratize AI so definitely check it
out
what do you think about the future of
decentralized applications the time is
now it's happening and do you think
machine learning and deep learning are
just overhyped by tech giants can it
really solve general and super AI in the
future or is another AI winter coming
statistically speaking yes another AI
winter is coming we don't know how long
it's gonna be deep learning could be the
path forward we don't know personally I
think one-shot learning is going to be
the the field that is going to be the
next step after deep learning where we
need less data for the same results but
it's a very exciting space and as long
as we have attention and we have hard
hard working people into space it's
gonna keep it's gonna keep up
accelerating cool well thanks for
answering all my questions and showing
me around awesome thanks Dan yeah yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
