the currency that I'm gonna talk about
today so first I want to start off by
saying one thing I do not condone any
illegal usage of any cryptocurrency
Manero is an untraceable cryptocurrency
and definitely lots of people who like
to sell things illegally on the internet
use it but the reason that I'm talking
about it is not for that the reason I'm
talking about it is because you should
be able to control your data and some of
your data is transactional data and
currently companies can mine that data
for free and use that to make
predictions about what you will buy and
what you won't buy so they can show you
ads and stuff like that but ideally they
pay you for this data right and the only
way for them to pay you for that data is
if you control it and the only way you
can control it is if it's anonymous and
they have to ask you for permission to
see your transaction history
okay so Manero is the currency I'm gonna
talk about today and I have this image
here of this these three different
features that I thought was the best
high level description of Manero
so it says decentralized private and
digital and monaro is all three of these
things so it's decentralized because no
one controls it it's digital because you
can run it over the Internet and it's
private because no one can tell who you
are when you send a transaction that
means no one can tell who sent a
transaction who you sent it to and the
amount that you sent so it's all private
unlike Bitcoin and these three kind of
Venn diagram looking things are examples
of assets or currencies that are
examples of two of these right so
bitcoin is decentralized because no one
controls it it's digital because it runs
over the Internet fiat currency like the
dollar is private because you could
exchange it by hand it's digital because
you can do it over the Internet as well
and gold is decentralized because no one
authority controls it and it's private
because no one can tell you know if you
just take some gold and give it to
someone else there's no third party
involved so no one can tell anything
about that transaction okay so Manero is
all three of these things and there
other cryptocurrencies that are all
three of these things but in terms of
popularity Manero is definitely at the
top right now at least so let's get into
this technical analysis of how Manero
works I'm gonna talk about all the
features of Manero I'm gonna talk about
how you can mine it I'm gonna talk about
how you can buy it and mostly this is a
technical talk so we're gonna go into
the technical details of how these
transactions are private and what
differences it has from Bitcoin okay so
the first thing I want to talk about is
the difference between Manero and
Bitcoin so got this great list here of
all these different features that Manero
has and all the different features that
bitcoin has and how they're different
right because they are very different
some of them are very similar like they
both use the proof-of-work algorithm to
secure the network they're both digital
currencies they both have a transaction
fee however Manero is is much less than
bitcoins I don't know what what is
bitcoins now like $20 a transaction just
crazy that's crazy
block time is much faster from the four
monaro but the real difference here the
real key difference is the the trackable
factor Manero is untraceable and it's
unlink about bitcoin is not I'm gonna go
into the details of what I mean like
really into the details so so stick
around so a lot of the hype around
Bitcoin was that it says oh it's a
pseudonymous currency no one can't note
there's no third party involved there's
no bank you own your currency you own
your data you and your assets but but
the truth is that Bitcoin is very very
much traceable okay
you can send Bitcoin by literally only
pointing that transaction back to a
previous transaction in the chain of
blocks right a blockchain that's the
only way and that and so your
transaction when you make one in the
Bitcoin network points back to every
transaction that came before it all the
way back to the coinbase transaction the
coinbase transaction is that transaction
that occurs when a miner and only a
miner can make a coinbase transaction
receive a reward from mining some blocks
so it's like Bitcoin that comes from
nothing but it I mean it come
as a reward for performing the
proof-of-work algorithm but right so you
can trace any transaction back all the
way to the coinbase transaction in the
Bitcoin network and you might be saying
well how am I able to do this well it
turns out that you can look up any
transaction in the blockchain Explorer
so that's that and this can be hard to
do manually right I mean you say you
sense Center transaction to somebody
else and then they send it to somebody
else
right that's two links in the chain it's
easy to just go click once and then
click once again on the blockchain
Explorer but as nodes are added the
complexity increases exponentially right
because as those funds are split and
then those funds are split and then
those funds are split it gets harder and
harder and harder to tell where that
transaction originated from and if you
don't believe me when I say that bitcoin
is traceable just ask the founder of
Silk Road the online dark web market for
selling illegal items there are people
literally sitting in jail right now
because bitcoin is in fact a very very
traceable system okay so Silk Road I
mean there's this whole story about Silk
Road they should definitely make a movie
about it the guy was ordering hits on
people and he was doing all this crazy
stuff which I don't condone and I don't
think it's cool but he's sitting in jail
right now and they probably will and
probably have made a movie about it but
my point is that bitcoin is traceable
right so yes criminals don't want to use
a currency that is traceable but if but
the thing is whether or not I make this
video criminals will find a unfine and
untraceable currency you just have to
type into Google untraceable currency if
you want to do bad you will do bad right
I am NOT making this video for criminals
I'm making this video for you you are my
viewer right I'm making this video for
people who want to understand all the
technical details of how
cryptocurrencies work and then use this
knowledge to then do good for the world
right this is just knowledge in your
arsenal to do good ok so just remember
that as a motivation behind this video
so you could attend
to make anonymous transactions in
Bitcoin threeways so remember bitcoin is
not anonymous its pseudonymous meaning
even if someone traces back you the
trail of transactions back to you that
is still your public address that public
address says nothing about your identity
it's not like the word Siraj is embedded
in my public address right so how can
you tell ownership well there's a
variety of ways IP addresses you know
finding the endpoints of I'll talk about
it let me let me let me let me show you
this so there are three ways to attempt
anonymous transactions the first way is
to create a new wallet after every
transaction and coin based comm doesn't
does this like by default but as soon as
that money is used the endpoint person
could be squeezed for information right
so if you send some money to somebody
and you want to remain anonymous you're
creating wallets between every
transaction eventually someone is going
to use that money in the real world for
you know paying a dentist or buying a
soccer ball or whatever and then that is
an endpoint person someone a real person
that you know people with guns or
whatever can say hey give me the
information and then they can trace it
back to you another way is to wash your
money through a tumbler and a tumbler is
a service that aggregates your money
with many other funds and then sweeps
them through large financial
institutions so if I send money to a
tumbler service other people send money
to that tumbler service those funds are
then aggregated together and then split
up into little amounts and then they're
sent out through through these different
gateways right so it's very hard to tell
who originated a transaction however in
a court of law this could be deemed as
supporting evidence for criminal intent
by courts you could also wash your money
wash your money by purchasing assets
real-world assets you know a basketball
court a house a car and then
transferring that money back to Bitcoin
or another currency and just doing that
over and over again but that is illegal
and yeah so these are all not good
methods they're possible methods but
they're mostly illegal and you will get
caught okay so I
is it untraceable the only good for
criminals no no it is good for criminals
yes
so with paypal in the early days so was
Bitcoin in the early days but there are
legitimate use cases for non criminals
like us
right so distributed online payment
vulnerability is an example so target
right target the the corporation or you
know any of these corporations they mine
your transaction data to then use it for
predictive analytics to predict what
you're gonna purchase and show you ads
and other things to make you purchase
things this is your data it's very
valuable and as everything gets
automated your data will be the only
agency you have in this new world it
will be the only value of that you own
right so you should be paid for it right
and so if you understand where this is
all going you'll see that data is the
most valuable asset we have right so
watch my decentralized application video
just search the centralized application
Siraj and you'll understand more about
what I mean when I say just how valuable
your data is but the point is that if
your your transaction history is
anonymous then they have to ask you for
it which means they have to pay you for
it and as you're getting these payments
from all these different institutions
for your data you're making something
like a basic income right just from your
data and that's where we're headed and
that's the reason we'd want to use an
anonymous currency like Manero for
example right so if user visits an
online shop the online shop collects
user data and then an algorithm predicts
purchase probability you should be paid
for this in short so let's let's get
into the technical details now shall we
so the crypto note protocol introduced
the idea of anonymous not pseudonymous
transactions so it all started with buy
coins so by coin was the first
implementation of an anonymous currency
right it was this is a first
implementation of the crypto no protocol
is it's white paper and then there were
some offshoots up by coin right so first
buddha coin and then paladin coin bull
berry and then Manero and in Manero was
the one that really took off right
Manero i think is number 10 right now on
coin market capcom it's I think seven
billion dollar market cap so it's a lot
of money
and all of these currencies that follows
were offshoots of Manero they were Forks
of an arrow with added features but
Manero is really the most stable and the
most popular of the anonymous currencies
out there okay so crypto no transactions
cannot be followed through the
blockchain in a way that reveals who
sent or received addresses so Manero is
a version of crypto note that hides the
sender the amount the transaction
broadcast and the receiver so the sender
is made anonymous through the use of
what are called ring signatures which
I'll explain the amount through ring
confidential transactions that brought
the transaction broadcasts like the
location of where you are your IP
address etc through an ITP router called
Calvary and the receiver through the use
of stealth addresses now I'm gonna
explain how all four of these things
work ok so let's do that let's get into
this
right so monaro has a lot of features
the two main ones that really matter
that make it unique or untraceable 'ti
and unlink ability unlink ability means
if I have a public address in the Monaro
network no transaction can be linked
back to that public address so anyone
can take my public address and they
could say well what transactions were
sent to and from this address and no one
will know untraceable means that no one
can tell where any transaction
originated from so there are two
separate of descriptions they're very
similar but not quite and I'll talk
about each right now so for unlink
ability right so for unlink ability
here's how Bitcoin works in Bitcoin
everyone has a public address 25
character public address and you use it
to receive funds and anyone can see how
much you received right because it's a
public ledger when sending funds you've
announced to the entire Bitcoin network
that the funds you own now belong to the
recipients public address so that
transaction is fully public the
difference in Manero is this so this is
an image of a very high-level image of
how Manero works now get into the
details in a second so in Manero
everyone has a public address like this
right so it's a much longer public
address hold on and
unlike Bitcoin your funds are not
associated with your public address so
when you send funds to someone else's
public address you're actually sending
those funds to a randomly created
one-time destination address right here
the commitment public key so no public
record of sending or receiving funds
when I send funds to someone they're
actually sent to a one-time address it's
just created temporarily just for that
transaction and that's what's public not
my public key not that not the cent not
the receivers public key but that
commitment public key and so that public
address will never appear so your public
address will never appear in the public
record of transactions instead a stealth
address is recorded in a way that only
you and the recipient can recognize the
incoming funds so when the recipient
checks for funds they need to scan the
blockchain to see if any transactions
are destined for them so the recipient
has a secret view key which is used to
check each transaction when they scan
the blockchain to see if it was
addressed to them and because the
recipient is the only one that knows the
secret view key only the recipients can
see the funds that have been sent to
them right so that's why when you launch
manera wallet it's scanning the
blockchain to see if any transactions
have occurred for you as a recipient
right so but anyone who has your secret
view key can also see what funds you
have received right so when you send the
transaction right so it's an input the
output is going to be this commitment
public key which is public and then
these two secret view keys one for the
sender so I can see how much I sent and
one for the receiver so they can see how
much they received but publicly speaking
there's just this one time address not
linked to either you or the sender okay
and so that's the idea of stealth
addresses and what that does is it hides
the receiver okay right so it's also
untraceable so we talked about unlink
ability but it's also untraceable let me
talk about untraceable 'ti okay so for
untraceable 'ti that's where the use of
ring signatures come into play right so
for ring signatures in Bitcoin when you
when you have an input so some incoming
transaction right it you
it's signed using a signature by some
identity right and then all inputs are
clearly linked to a previous transaction
right so anyone can view this input and
say oh that's where it originated from
but in Monaro when you when you receive
an input it's not just one input that
you're receiving it's their several and
they're all linked together so as a ring
and all these us all of these inputs are
signed
what using using what's called a ring
signature and then any input is going to
be linked to more than one previous
transaction so no one will be able to
tell who that input originated from
because it's a part of a ring of
transactions let me go into what I mean
okay okay so here's what I mean by ring
signatures so the Monaro money supply is
divided into outputs just like the US
dollar is divided into dollar bills
quarters dimes pennies Manero is divided
into outputs divisions of currency and
these outputs store a certain value of
Manero each and the value they hold can
change over time so suppose that these
are all the outputs that exist and the
one you control and can spend is
highlighted in red so let's say these
are all the outputs all the green ones
and I own this red one number eight
which let's say is the equivalent of
light say three hundred dollars and some
of these are like two hundred some of
these are ten dollars and in monaro
currency right and when I create a
Manero transaction I'm using a ring
signature to hide which input is
actually being spent so and the way this
is done is by making it seem like as if
all the chosen inputs are the possible
real sender so when I send an input when
I send a transaction there are five
other transactions that are picked by
random from other nodes in the network
and we don't need their permission to
choose those they're just there to
obfuscate where that transaction is
coming from right they're all linked
together in a ring and they're all
signed using a ring signature so in the
photo your real input is red and the
five selected inputs are light blue and
these inputs can be controlled by anyone
else we don't need their permission to
add their input to the Ring signature we
sign them all such that an outside
observer cannot determine which is
real one being spent right and so once
we have selected the other inputs we
need to finish creating the ring CT ring
signature so the ring CT ring signature
is used to hide the amount that is spent
the ring signature hides that the sender
the stealth address hides the receiver
and the ring CTS ring signature hides
the amount that is being sent so you
sign it in such a way that all these
inputs appear to be the real one used
and this signature includes several
other important elements so this is a
more detailed view of what a transaction
looks like in the Monaro network right
so when I make a transaction there are
up to six other transactions that are
added to their to the Ring right all
these rings rings are signed using a
ring signature right and importantly
very critically a key image is created
from all of these transactions that key
image is one hash and it's given to the
network as proof that the signature was
created appropriately the network
verifies that this image has not been
used before to prevent double spending
so it's got a list in the blockchain of
all of these key images and they look
for a match has this key image been sent
before yes okay it's double spending you
can't do it no this is a valid
transaction
go ahead and so that's how spending is
prevented using the key image
next is the Petersons commitment so this
is used to prevent other people from
knowing how much is actually being spent
so it's a formula right so you have the
actual amount that is spent a it's
multiplied by a random number and this
constant value here and the result is
this number that is a result of the
formula and that that is a commitment
right you can use this commitment to
commit to spending a certain value that
only you have the authority to spend but
other people don't know what that value
is because it's it's the result of this
formula right it's not that it's not the
original amount it's a result of this
formula and that's what's public right
so so the Petersons commitment is a
critical component of the ring
confidential transaction or ring CT it
hides the actual value by adding a
random number X the commitment value is
calculated for the set of inputs and
outputs in the transaction
and it is broadcast to the network so
that's what the network sees as the
result of that work of that Peterson
commitment formula and it and so that
all comes together to form the ring CT
ring signature and the result is an
unknown amount of monaro being spent the
commitment public key is what's used by
the network to verify that commitment
that I talked about before right so how
do the outputs get used over time so we
can compare Bitcoin and Manero to find
out right so in this theoretical history
of the outputs we control all the blocks
highlighted reds are the ones where the
output appears and if this was for
Bitcoin we would eat really easily be
able to tell that this output was
transferred from user a to B to C but
with Manero it's not so simple there are
three reasons for an output to show up
in a block either it's new money and a
coin based transaction it was actually
spent or it was added as a decoy in a
ring signature I also want to talk about
Cove rewrite so we talked about how the
sender is hidden using ring signature as
we talked about how the amount is hidden
using ring C T we talked about how the
receiver is hidden using stealth
addresses but how about the location
right like where you are your IP address
and that's obfuscated using this I 2p
routing service called Calvary it's kind
of like tor but basically your
transaction is routed through all these
different nodes these internet what do
they call these internet invisible
Internet project nodes right III two P
nodes and these nodes pass your messages
along and have no visibility over what
is in them and that's under construction
right now it's getting better and better
over time and you can view its progress
on github it's all public and open
source but it's double spending proof
right because we talked about that that
key image that the whole blockchain has
a copy of and it's blockchain analysis
resistant not completely nothing is but
it's the most block chain analysis
resistant cryptocurrency that exists
currently and yeah so this is a huge
high-level level overview of everything
I've talked about if you want to go into
more details really look into this but
yeah those four components are really
the the key features of of Manero
lastly adaptive parameters like we said
before a monaro transaction has an
ambiguous output origin an unknown
amount in a commitment in an
known receiver so for every transaction
on the network all of the information
stored on the blockchain is obfuscated
right so let's talk about how to lastly
I want to talk about how to by Mineiro
and then how to mine Manero okay in
terms of how to by mineiro I've got this
great link here it's in the Jupiter
notebook in the github description so
check it out but change lis is the best
site I've found to buy Manero you can by
using Visa or MasterCard there's you can
buy it with Bitcoin and you can buy it
with even US dollar if you so please or
Doge or all these currencies so
definitely check out this website change
Lea and to mine Manero I found this
really great Python repository that you
can clone in docker it's about the all
the docker dependencies ready for Mac
and Linux you can run it and you can
start mining it as well and yeah it's
gonna be awesome
but yeah it wraps this javascript mining
library for coin hive that's kind of
like this generic mining library for a
bunch of cryptocurrencies but it works
with any Manero pool so these are pools
of miners based on the strata mining
protocol you can set up your own pool
there's no dead feed there's no adblock
and you can use any pool you'd like but
you clone this repository repository you
CD into it you build it with docker and
then you run it with docker please
subscribe for more programming videos
and for now I've got to plan my scaling
strategy for the new year so thanks for
