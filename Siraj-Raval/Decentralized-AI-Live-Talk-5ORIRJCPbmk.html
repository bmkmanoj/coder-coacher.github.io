assignees YouTube content creator
feature cars instructor I thinking a lot
of Europe tried to even incarcerated he
has omission things by educating
developers to baby I he's also a Jap
developer and entrepreneur founder of
platform for developers called happy
about several I went X and we and then
has worked on hosts of open source work
besides that you like to travel to the
musician postmodernist
and scuba diver and then I was like
tempted to say I think hi everybody
alright testing for eight seven six
that's the next code for Bitcoin so fly
it at that price I'm just kidding okay
yeah yeah you know the the end of that
description was like this really old
description that O'Reilly wrote when I
wrote the book decentralized
applications like four years ago which
at the time hobby was yes a
crowdsourcing platform that I you know
helps create but now it's deprecated in
etc you know how stuff moves in software
it's just like hearing God in like 30
seconds but yeah so this talk is called
decentralized when they move out the way
let me just get a feel for how this is
gonna work okay decentralized artificial
intelligence that's the name of this
talk it's really combining two
technologies that are very hot today
deep learning and blockchain we know
about these two technologies right even
if you're a data science you study
blockchain at some point there's
articles it's it's hard not to to look
at this space with some some level of
interest so we're gonna talk about how
to combine these two technologies
together to make something beautiful so
I want to start with a quote by a very
well-known public figure shall we say
the quote is he alone who owns the youth
games the future and this is by Adolf
Hitler
I just want you to think about this
quote for a second he alone who owns the
youth gains the future what did he mean
by that
clearly he knew what he was talking
about he was able to influence the youth
to kill people by the hundreds of
thousands so I want to ask you guys this
question who owns the youth single word
answers this is an open question you can
raise your hand
what's it you yeah Facebook okay really
smart guy any other any other okay you
guys know what's up yeah exactly yeah
Facebook snapchat those are those are
some possible answers but let's let's
talk about what the what the larger
answer to this question is who owns the
youth who owns the future so in the 80s
the web was created etc etcetera right
the world wide web oh you know we we
know that the web was created but I
remember going to sir CERN it was in
Geneva had a talk at CERN in Geneva and
it was amazing like that they designs us
they're like we were getting so
technical they knew exactly what was
going on their questions were so
beautifully orchestrated they were
challenging me I was amazing
those people I mean the amount of data
that CERN has is amazing like anyway
that's a tangent
when I was at CERN I remember seeing Tim
berners-lee's office the creator of HTTP
the hypertext Transfer Protocol for the
World Wide Web
arguably without that protocol
everything that we're doing kara told
everything about the web wouldn't exist
and I remember seeing his office and
just standing there for a second and
being like wow this is where it all
began and then I backed up for a second
I was just like oh my god and all these
kids started coming in those ago I bet I
better back up and these kids started
coming in in mass and they were like I
don't know eight eight or ten years old
it was like a school field trip and they
came in and they saw and then the
teacher was like but the guy was like
and this is where the worldwide was
created and the kids were like oh my god
and they
took a snapchat and immediately left
like they didn't even like some of the
kids just when they wanted what the
guide said that they just kept walking
so that's what's a future snapchat right
cuz I can't use snapchat those web 1.0
this man is web 2.0 who knows who this
guy is to shout it out Jeff Bezos who is
the richest guy in the world right now
Jeff Bezos yeah in 98 this was Jeff
Bezos he was selling books that's all he
wanted to do with amazon.com he was
selling books at a very very small
office his office was just a desk right
and now Amazon is more powerful than
Walmart it's market cap is higher than
Walmart its market cap is higher than
any bookseller in the world Barnes and
Noble's etc all of these global brands
Amazon eats them up literally quite
literally Amazon acquires them so Jeff
Bezos Owens Amazon yes it is the largest
shareholder in Amazon and Amazon is just
one example
we've got snapchat we've got Google
we've got Facebook and these entities
that we've created over time have been a
result of entrepreneurs saying how do we
take web 1.0 and how do we capitalize
off of it how do we create something
where we can make money off of it which
is it makes sense right this is a
beautiful technology and and the initial
eggs for the web were beautiful they
were very pure let's take this
decentralized internet that Tim
berners-lee helped create and let's
create services on top of it right so
let's let me take the server right and
instead of having you know all these
computers talk to each other which is
very hard to do at the time let me just
make one central server let me make let
me use this HTTP protocol to create this
get and set transfer protocol and store
all of that data on this central server
like that right and it made it easy to
do things like have an Amazon have an
eBay have a Marketplace have a social
network have a ride-sharing service all
this stuff that we use today is because
we were able to create these centralized
services it worked really well and there
were no problems in fact it was a faster
way to do things right it was a faster
way it was a more efficient way
it just worked but what's happened now
is really bad objectively speaking this
is not my opinion it is objectively a
bad thing and this is not just coming
from me this is coming from the creators
of the web Tim berners-lee Jerome Lanier
the pioneers of the internet don't like
what has happened today what the
Internet has become how do we fix this
what does web 3.0 look like not web 1.0
or 2.0 not having centralized services
but decentralized services what the web
the original vision for the web was to
have decentralized services in a good
economy we monetize more and more but in
a bad economy we monetize less and less
what is the most valuable resource we
have today can anyone answer that
question what is the most valuable
resource that any person has today yes
another word for knowledge is data data
exactly but what are we doing with our
data right now we are giving it away for
free in return for a free service right
that's that's part of the terms of use
for all of these services we use
Facebook Facebook's Terms of Service
snap chesterton service you let us use
your data we can learn from your data we
can profit off of your data we can sell
your data and in return we'll let you
use a service that's fine right it works
but what's happened is this is shrinking
the economy because all of that data is
being concentrated in these central
servers these connected cores that
everybody has a connector right these
are gateways for the web we need that
data because as automation technology
gets better and better as we learn to
automate all of these things the only
agency the only power you're gonna have
in this new world that we're very fast
moving to is your data but right now
you're giving it away for free so what
value do you bring to the world when you
don't own your data nothing zero you
have no value if you give away your data
you have no value so you need to own
your data and profit from your data
right this is akin to something like a
basic income when robotics and
automation technology and AI and deep
learning and machine learning when all
that gets good enough in the
five to ten years probably everything
will be automated everything everything
that can be automated will be automated
I just made that up on the spot you call
it my law there's accountability as well
okay so accountability is we don't know
what they're doing with our data right
first of all we want to own our data we
want to profit off of our data right now
we're giving it away for free and
they're doing something with it that we
don't even know what it is they don't
have to tell us right they don't tell us
what what they're doing with I'm data
they could give it away to governments
they could use to spy on people I was
having a conversation with a friend a
few days ago okay we were talking about
something a single topic later on on her
phone in the ad it said the topic that
we were talking about they are listening
on our phones they are listening in
real-time
Facebook is listening our phones they
are listening to us they are using that
data because there are no checks and
balances that's just what's happened
they are so powerful they're all around
us the Internet of Things is really a
set of spy devices for these central
authorities and lastly we are trying to
solve AI and I'm gonna talk about that
at the very very end but we're trying to
solve AI and we need a way to do that
and this is how we do that all of these
problems a shrinking economy data
ownership accountability and towards
general intelligence all of that can be
solved if we move to web 3.0 so you guys
wouldn't with me like we need to move to
web 3.0 right this is that this is the
plan how do we do this so I'm gonna tell
you how to do this okay I'm gonna tell
you how to do this I'm gonna show you
right now how to do this you ready okay
there we go
it all starts with something very very
simple
the links list who here is st. a linked
list before awesome yeah okay so the
linked list is a very very simple data
structure I've got the code for it right
here don't worry if you never code it
before don't worry about it it's only
you know 12 lines of code dwell single
lines in Python and what this does is it
creates a data structure called a linked
list and a linked list is just a very
simple object that's linked to the next
object that's linked to the next object
that's going to the next object and just
goes on its but as much as you want and
we can make one in Python we'll just say
class node this is a class this thing
this Square and let's say let's give it
some functions get data okay that's
going to give us what's inside of here
which is if we could store it the word
hello
get next get the next node in the list
stack send data what do I want to put in
this thing
hello a number an image a video whatever
data and set next one's going to be that
the data in the next linked the next
node in the linked list that's it
there's a simple data structure this is
going to help us move towards web 3.0
you might be thinking wait a second no
this has been around since the 80s how
is it going to help init with anything
so let's take this linked list let's
let's take this linked list and let's
store a copy of it on let's say a
million computers let's just say hey
guys I've got this linked list I want
you to store a copy of it and inside of
this linked list we're not going to
store the word hello that does nothing
for us let's instead store a transaction
and not just one transaction several
transactions in fact millions of
transactions between people payments
let's store that and let's try to make
it so that no one can modify this linked
list no one can change this transactions
in this linked list how do we do that
okay what if we had a separate system of
people and all they did was they solved
random mathematical problems with their
computer and this required a lot of
computing power like a lot so much so
that in order for you to be able to
change
any of the data in any of these knows
you would have to have more than 50% of
the computing power of all of those
nodes that are solving these random
mathematical problems now what if the
amount of computing power in those nodes
was greater than the 500 fastest
supercomputers in the world combined
well then you would have to have more
computing power than the 500 fastest
supercomputers in the world combined
to change this the data in this link
list what that means is no one could
change the data in this linked list so
if we did that we had a linked list that
everybody stored a copy of that no one
could change the data and we would call
it a blockchain and that's what the
Bitcoin blockchain is it's a glorified
linked list that's it it's a glorified
linked list and instead of calling them
links or notes we call them blocks and
the reason it's called a chain is
because it's not just pointing to a
random node with the word hello in it
it's pointing to a random node with
transactions in it and the reason that
the transactions are stored as this tree
decision tree to be specific we can call
it a merkel tag as well but not to talk
about that is because that's just a more
efficient way of storing and retrieving
from it but you can just think of it at
an abstract level as just a list of
transactions and that's a blockchain so
this is a very new idea right this is
this was you know 8 9 10 years ago when
Satoshi invented this this this concept
it was the first time where we could say
I'm gonna store my transactions in this
data structure that's what the
blockchain is is the data structure I'm
gonna store my data in this thing and no
one's going to be able to modify those
transactions that's why we use banks
right there are only a few real banks in
the world that we trust enough to store
our money in or you know are something
very valuable because we trust that
they're not going to modify essentially
the the list of transactions in our
account they're not going to modify that
there goes a this is the amount you had
before and this is the amount you have
now trust us right and that's it we
trust them but what if we could store
our money in a way that we didn't have
to trust a bank so there's not a third
party this is the first time that we
been able to do that in the advent of
this data structure right that's cool
okay okay we don't need a bank great so
what what else could we store in this
thing besides transactions we don't need
to trust a third party to store our
transactions we don't need to trust a
third party to store our data we don't
need to trust a third party to store our
code what about our web apps what about
our apps like snapchat and Facebook and
Google what if we could store code in
this thing not just transactions and
that is what aetherium is blockchain is
they took bitcoins blockchain they added
a bunch of other data like logs
dificulty timestamps mixes but really
what matters is this the code you don't
just store transactions in the ethereum
blockchain you store code what that
means is every computer every node
remember it's a glorified linked list
every node in the network is storing
code instead of pushing code to a single
server like Heroku right that's how we
usually build web apps we store it on a
single node that everybody has to agree
upon so in order to modify that code you
would have to have more computing power
than the fact 500 fastest supercomputers
in the world combined so this is a
trustless way to build web apps and
that's how we're going to get to web 3.0
so what does code on aetherium look like
go back this this 17 line of code
snippet is what you would call an
initial coin offering 17 lines of code
is responsible for raising more money in
the past two years that have been raised
by every IPO in the past ten we're
talking about more than a hundred
billion US dollars worth of of
investment from the public the public
every ICO that you're seeing these days
as a result of this someone takes this
as a variable that says how many you
know shares or coins or tokens do I want
and how much do I want to sell those
tokens for they take this code and they
push it to the ethereum blockchain via a
push command in terminal or they can do
if you're a BL web app and then they
have this public address you know 25
characters or more and they say here's
the address
I see how time invest and then people
just you know 30 million in a single day
this kind of stuff happens this is very
powerful and no one controls this right
this is the advent of a new structure
similar to a corporation a new type of
institution that no one no one controls
and we can do this with the theorems
blockchain because we don't have to
trust a third party not just a bank but
even a government legal documents things
like that we can build these with smart
contracts Thanks every every time we've
had to require to trust a third party we
can remove that and push that instead in
the form of contracts to the etherium
blockchain
there's a problem though so if you think
about okay well I'm gonna make a web app
and it's gonna it's going to pull from
the weather comm API and it's just gonna
tell you the weather that's it okay so
it's called my weather app decentralized
comm and all it displays is a single
text the weather today in Singapore and
it pulls that data from weather calms
API with the parameter of Singapore now
it returns the result and it displays
that write whatever degrees Celsius if
we were to do that on the ethereum
blockchain it wouldn't work why because
every single node in the network has to
pull back that data at the same
right because they're all executing that
code at the same time but but the
weather changes over time
right so they would all have to agree
upon the time how do you do that you
can't right so the solution to this is
to have what's called an Oracle and the
Oracle is a trusted third-party source
that speaks to the web that the etherium
blockchain can pull from so you might be
thinking wait a second okay I thought
this was trustless what it was is deal
with this Oracle thing there are
networks of Oracle's out there you know
delegations four or five of them and
they can all agree a krip agree on
things they can have consensus on some
data but this is a solution to pulling
data from the from the web 2.0 in the
form of api's until we have a better
solution but that's how it works right
now so you might be thinking okay we can
have our application level constructs on
the etherion blockchain we can pull data
in the form of Oracle's from the web but
then how do we store like huge databases
onto the blockchain could we do that I
mean you could technically but then
every miner everyone who's downloading a
copy of this blockchain would then have
to store all of that data on their
personal computer Facebook has a lot of
data if we were to decentralized
Facebook and say this is the ethereum
version of Facebook everybody would have
to store a copy of Facebook that's just
infeasible so what we need is not just a
an application-level construct that says
here are user names here your tweets
here at you know etc we need it to point
to some kind of decentralized data store
a storage for data that is not owned by
anyone now the best solution for this
that I found is called the
interplanetary file system so high PFS
is big there's there's a lot to go into
about ipfs it's it's it's a beautiful
system the way it works but essentially
it's a group of computers that all agree
on some data so if I want to push some
data to Google Cloud or AWS right now
right these services own that data right
so I would say you know got some huge
video let me push it to Google Cloud or
AWS and they would store it how do we be
centralize that with ipfs it's a
work of computers who are saying I'm an
IP FS node right when you push that
video to high PFS they not everybody
stores a copy of that video one person
will store a copy that video will be
split up into several parts and
replicated across the network so then
you might be thinking well what if
someone deletes their node well there's
already replications everywhere how are
these nodes incentivized well there's
this idea of file coin where these nodes
are paid to store this data so it's how
to incentivize these notes so that's
kind of our complete list of solutions
for this web 3.0 we can have a data
store called ipfs we can have etherium
to store code and application level
constructs and Oracle's to pull data
from the web this is this is how web 3.0
works this is the new stack
so this is how it works right
cerium references content big data
that's stored on ipfs it gets that
static content the distributed
application gets that content from ipfs
and it gets the global state or a theory
of its it's a global state machine so if
we combine ipfs and aetherium we can
build these distributed decentralized
applications right but what's a talk
what is what is really a talk without
talking about deep learning rights deep
learning is words that we've got this
thing called a neuron in our brain their
cells billions of these cells in our
brain and they make us intelligent they
give us consciousness and love and
emotion all these things we feel it
because of this thing it's a collection
of them I don't know how they work
neither do you
either there's nobody knows is the most
renowned neuroscientist in the world no
one knows how this thing works but in
the 50s some guy was like I mean I get
the basic idea there's some data that's
being fed into this thing something's
happening here and then it sends it out
and then very roughly very very roughly
he created a mathematical model for this
thing he says he said we have these
inputs let me just take this these
inputs these are a set of numbers let me
apply some kind of summation to this and
then some kind of non-linearity as in
let me take this data and make sure that
it it can learn a function that can
learn any type of function both the
linear and a nonlinear function that
means any type of function and then
output a result right so take some data
you know it does something to it and
then it outputs that data and what
happens here has been the topic of
debate amongst many researchers like
what do we do to it but but the idea is
the same as when we take some input data
apply some kind of function to it and
then we have an output and then we chain
these things together so we got we have
a lot of them and what happened is the D
pointing revolution right all of these
things that humans are good at image
recognition driving cars etc all these
things for some reason this model that
resembles the human brain
works well sometimes even better than we
do so this is kind of this is mind
boggling right on silicon these chips we
roughly estimated the the rules that are
happening here and it's doing something
that even humans can't even do could
there be some universal law of
intelligence out there that we're just
slowly approximating that we're just
slowly coming close to probably and this
is our first step there deep learning
incredible technologies okay so how do
we combine all three of these things how
do we combine ipfs aetherium and deep
learning
well there's one really great example
that I know of called open mind that a
friend of mine has built with his
community but the idea is this if I'm a
data scientist and you have some data if
I want to train my deep learning model
on your data how do I do that in a way
that involves no third party where you
don't have to trust me that I'm gonna
look at your data say it's very
sensitive like patient data like for
hospital records how do I train my model
to learn from your data so I can make
predictions about say cancer or some
other disease without looking at your
personal information so this is a
perfect example of how you can put these
three technologies together you can have
ipfs store that data you can have a
theorem build an application-level
construct for smart contracts so that
the data doesn't have to be stored on a
central server and you could use deep
learning to learn from that data so if
you want to know how all three of these
can work together look up open minds
the website is open mind org but it's a
it's a great example of how to combine
all these three these three things
together
so where does this lead us eventually
this isn't it this is a graph of
emergent higher level complexity simple
AI agents that are ants but complex
swarm behavior emerges right now we have
AI and they live on servers they live in
our phones they live on laptops but if
we could free these AIS from the
confines of servers and live and let
them live in a decentralized space they
could speak to each other they could
learn from each other and perhaps the
real solution to higher level
intelligence is to let that complexity
emerge rather than trying to code it in
why don't we just let it emerge right we
don't know how consciousness works but
we have this basic rough idea of how it
works what if we just have needs to give
it enough complexity and let that real
intelligence emerge we just can't even
understand it
that is very likely the case and if we
use block chains and we use aetherium
and we use IP FS and all these
decentralized technologies we can create
real artificial intelligences that are
as smart if not a hundred thousand times
smarter than all of us lastly you might
be thinking why would we want to do that
why do I care about that right water
crisis ease the spread of infectious
diseases weapons of mass destruction
North Korea Donald Trump interstate
conflicts failure of climate change
adaption energy price shock fiscal
crisis ease unemployment biodiversity
loss and ecosystem collapse some would
say it's too late for us to solve
climate change it's too late no matter
what we do we're not going to solve it
we are we are headed for destruction we
are headed for oblivion there is nothing
we can do
we're screwed I don't think so because
those people don't know about the power
of AI right if we solve a I let's just
say we solve it we create an
intelligence that's as smart if not
smarter than all of us we can give it an
objective a goal a function and that
objective could be solve climate change
it would look at data in a way no human
ever could in a way that 10,000 plus
scientists put together in a room for a
hundred years couldn't solve it could
solve all these things immediately it
could move
towards us utopia that we didn't think
even possible before if we do it the
right way and if all of us together are
thinking about ways to do this we all
have to be thinking about how these
technologies work together if you even
barely understand how this technology
works it is your responsibility to do
something about it because there are
millions of people across the world who
don't even have food and water right
sufficient these in Maslow's hierarchy
of needs they don't have any of these
things how can they come to these kinds
of insights they can't everybody in this
room it's your responsibility to do to
work on this to help make this happen
how do you do that you you learn from
the internet you use this new inner
University that we have is collective
University to teach yourself to educate
yourself on how these technologies work
and how you can best influence the
problems in our world using these
technologies so I want to leave you with
a single remark solve AI or die trying'
that's that's my motto that's what I
live by and if you want to learn more
there's my youtube channel subscribe
thank you very much
thank you sir excuse me
so to continue the example that we cover
that we can with ideas
we can have a picture that I've the
fantastic so the algorithm can see why
not the user that is active in that that
the enemy how the security you think
about that yeah security is definitely
an issue we had to solve when it comes
to decentralized applications one of the
reason that we centralized stuff was
because one person could just secure
everything right it's much more secure
to have data on a central server
security is one really really great area
to focus on if you're looking on
something to work on
that's one of those opening fields
there's so much a startup could view
their distributed security decentralized
security in terms of a solution right
now for security in general for
decentralized applications one thing
could be better ways of storing data
that involve replication so replication
with what is one example right a lot of
times data is just bust in IPA fast or
something like this just lost because
there's not enough replication so
looking at different ways different
algorithms for replicating data that are
Edition out a great way to salsa version
of the effectivity nobody can modify it
but if you want them provide the
security only that they can know what if
I secure and have because it happens on
a multiple pleasure but if I want to
secure the detectors that whoever is
authorized and authenticated or the day
that cannot will be excessively it is
like medium already provided or we have
complete activity layer on top of that
we don't have to do an extra security
level player on top of it like there are
their ideas within these communities for
ipfs and aetherium for security layers
but we would need a different protocol
entirely like one of these issues one of
the ways that this brings up is identity
right we don't know who you are we don't
know how to authenticate you identity
protocols as a layer on top of these
data and application level protocols
that would be something that's very
necessary people have tried this
Microsoft even tried this with one ID it
didn't work but the problem was they
weren't thinking about it the right way
so you've got to think about it from a
decentralized way how do I make us how
do we make an identity protocol that can
speak to these other other protocols
seamlessly and there's there's this idea
of cross chain transfers atomic swaps
from the Bitcoin community I think that
would be a good place to look for
inspiration
hi so I was wondering what is the
Olympic skating for the full homomorphic
encryption because the manami's the good
news it's pretty large and on top of
that most of them learning frameworks
like the deep learning models tend to be
computational halls yeah yeah so okay so
two questions are one how do we scale
homomorphic encryption and two how do we
solve the problem of deep learning being
very computationally expensive so so
there's this idea of one-shot learning
where we learn from one or two examples
like if you look at how humans learn you
give me a you give me an image of
something that I've never seen before
and and in two or three examples I'll be
able to classify it whereas with deep
learning
it requires hundreds of thousands if not
millions of images this is a problem
this is not even close to how we learn I
think the best example of a very data
efficient deep learning algorithm is it
actually came out of Facebook and it was
called the memory augmented neural
network so right now we intertwine the
processor with the memory in the neural
network that's the weight values right
those matrix weight values but what if
we could separate that memory into a
separate module and it could say here's
the memory module it's just a glorified
matrix and then we have the weight
values what would happen when they train
this thing was it was able to recognize
handwritten digits with only 15 examples
this was like two years ago and then
that that project didn't get that much
attention it should because that was
amazing I would say look at that that
project as an example Facebook AI
research Omniglot data set it's gonna be
the first link on Google but more
efficient deep learning models is
another open field of research
missions the first question is posed one
dream oh can we as someone who's
learning in data science adapt to the
changes in terms of a different
perspective so currently for example
using some of the typical education
functions which Mathematica is between
you know like Sigma technologies this
amendment also if there's any
mathematical evolution such that you
know in the future perhaps could be what
injustice you can break their interface
and the second question is I'm just
curious as to you know AI these days
they have robots that can charge and
truly like terminator
so in terms of cybersecurity I'm not
sure how well it is but what if one day
it happens to be and hence of maybe
someone who's extremists or terrorists
say for example will we all be doomed
because the weapons everything can be
you know come true and this robust might
just go you know is micro bombing to
hear some of the robots talking about
humans
a very negative way if you know someone
I cannot name the lady who has autism
yeah yeah so you know something negative
about the way she thinks about human so
I mean what if one day robots behave
like this and they learn how to
manufacture mass weapon of destruction
or whichever way that they can behave by
example okay good questions so for the
first question about different ways of
looking at neural network in the future
beyond the model that we have right now
this is one of the most exciting areas
of research in all of computer science
right now how do we evolve the neural
network architecture there's this idea
of well let me just stack more with more
layers let me change the weights let me
add a new type of layer right and these
are these are okay this works but what
if we changed the entire Hardware what
if we said instead of running it on
silicon let's run it on a quantum
processor what happens then there's
there's a brain use quantum processing
we don't know there's this idea at
neuroscience of quantum nanotube eul's
that that's the seat of consciousness
that actually lives in multiple
dimensions who knows but there's a lot
of great research in hardware as well so
if you want to look at really really
really different radical breakthroughs
and neural networks I would actually
look at the hardware the hardware love
them not the algorithmic level on to
your second question about terminator or
AI so some people say that the Bitcoin
blockchain is some people say that
bitcoin is one of those systems where
you can sell drugs easily and you can
but it's one of those systems that is
very untraceable right this is not true
bitcoin is the most traceable system in
the world key example Silk Road right
the founder of silk road every single
transaction is stored in a public way
that everyone can can view right they
can view it they can validate it they
can see exactly the trail of
transactions now what happens what
happens if we take these transactions
and instead we abstract them to two
actions
network this person likes this tweet
this person did this with this money
this person launched this nuke right if
we put everything onto this public
ledger that everyone can view that's the
way to democratize read access to
actions by everyone so if there was some
kind of government to write for example
probably the Singaporean government
would do something like this because
they're awesome where they said let me
just make everything public and viewable
by people right then every politician
would have to record all their
transactions on a blockchain right there
would be no more there would be much
less corruption there would be much less
right because this thing this would this
would be validated by everybody when it
comes to nuclear weapons weapons of mass
destruction if we are able to create
these systems in a way that everyone can
verify there's more transparency there
would be less likely of a risk like that
right because these people would have to
be held accountable and that's really
where this whole block change stuff
plays in it's all about accountability
do you think that with all the work be
done on that group of stay cannot change
3.0 there might be a better technology
than yeah I do I do I do
there are some promising blog trains out
there I think one is one is card on oh
right
Charles Hoskinson was one of the former
founders of ethereal and he's work he's
been working on that with on that with a
really great team they're working on kyc
compliance as a way to merge that with
the existing financial infrastructure
it's great I think the idea is that they
have our grades and yes there could be
something better than proof of work for
sure any proof of work is one of those
really computationally expensive
processes that wastes a lot of
electricity across the world that we
could look that could be put to better
use why have these computer software and
mathematical problems why not instead
have them solved protein folding or some
problem you know real problem that
matters so yes there's a lot of
potential right now however in terms of
building something that affects the
population that affects consciousness
that affects culture aetherium in you
know bitcoin these are ways of doing
that very fast and then we can update
those systems later on
do you think that'd be impossible
learning will work as in right now I've
seen so far is only on gigs chairs you
think you have more practical purpose
like for example the other classifier or
they start there we can do something in
the real world other than just playing
games Yeah right yes I do
the idea behind reinforcer reinforcement
learning has been around since the 60s
it's not new all of those concepts at
alphago used last year alphago was a
beat the best go player in the world
it'll refresh her and which was a huge
deal because AI experts predicted that
it would take 10 20 years for that to
happen we did it in a decade less all of
the components of alphago Monte Carlo
tree search right value networks policy
networks neural networks these all had
all been around for decades what was the
difference that well they just
synthesized some ideas that hadn't been
put together and fed in more computing
power than we've ever been able to get
before and then it gave us this result
that no one thought possible
so the real breakthrough there was just
giving a computing power there was no
difference in terms of the algorithms
just a synthesis of old ideas into one
bigger new idea which is how most of
research works to be real but do I think
that we could do better for sure for
sure I don't see why we aren't thinking
of new ideas from reinforcement learning
right there's so much we could do in
terms of search strategies for
reinforcement learning there's so much
we could do when we combine deep
learning and reinforcement learning
together games have been a testbed for
AI because if we can generalize to
different games maybe we could
generalize to tasks that matter that's
why these big institutions that have
been focused on games what they're
really trying to do is applied to
real-world applications some examples
would be cooling data centers that's
what Google did with the same
reinforcement learning algorithm they
use on a game they used to reduce the or
increase the efficiency of cooling their
data centers but I think it was 40 or 50
percent
which is huge that's one example and
that's just because Google did it guess
what
Google open-source that algorithm if we
look on github and we see these
reinforcement learning algorithms we
ourselves can take them and apply them
to some use case right all these
researchers are the top institutions are
working on games because they're trying
to improve the generalization ability we
can use them to solve problems today
right so we can take those algorithms we
can use in to solve real problems some
avenues like maybe three that I can
think of for reinforcement learning
specifically would be for example
traffic control that's that's a
reinforcement learning problem right
reward using an agent to take in a
reward and then cycling that back into
the system another one would be
increasing the efficiency of bandwidth
between applications like peer-to-peer
applications that's another one for
reinforcement learning and a third one
I'm just making these up as I go a third
one would probably be you know how
Google did this with the data center we
could do that with just lights in
general right energy efficiency that'll
be another one for reinforcement
learning all the ideas were we're
talking about some event some timeline
right where we are trying to increase
the efficiency of something that's
happening over time that's a
reinforcement learning problem right
because it's interacting with an
environment it's not an input-output
static data set it's a dynamic
environment so think about an
environment thinking about time think
about sequences and apply reinforcement
learning there
that's one
we've mentioned any about how you can
have individual simple blockchain and
all communication and commerce off you
urgently be there and that's the next
thing what if we don't like the image at
media cuz he can't control this one ETA
right answer the colony you know what
you do but you don't know how to behave
so what then
that's a great question so I met someone
who work on the ethics team at deadlines
and she was telling me that she was kind
of going to this game with me oh she was
saying oh why should we release this
source code why should we you know do
this why should we do this but the
conclusion that she made me come up come
up with which is what the conclusion
that she had already come to the thought
process was that deepmind wanted to be
the first to come up with the the real
intelligence they wanted to be the first
to solve AI because they knew that they
themselves would be benevolent with it
they didn't trust that other people
would so that's why they didn't open
source it at the time however that's not
good for us right because if someone had
deep mind is not benevolent for whatever
reason they could use that AI for evil
by whatever your means of evil it's how
do we prevent that the best way to
prevent any kind of malpractice any kind
of mal-intent is it democratizes
technology to give it to as many people
as possible this famous quote by this
English playwright Lord Acton also by
Elon Musk but the quote is the best way
and I'm paraphrasing the best way to
prevent the rise of a despot someone who
is a on how all-powerful dictator is to
democratize access to power
if the and the easiest way is to
centralize that power so if we D
centralize this power to AI to
blockchain to all this technology to
data specifically then we can better
increase the probability or likelihood
that we reach a good city in the future
is there a possibility that someone who
is a bad actor will use this technology
for sure I mean life is full of
existential risks right but doing this
democratizing these these technologies
further increases the probability that
that won't happen because we'll come up
with some sort of security system or
failsafe or check system that would
prevent that from happening
maybe there's a decentralized
that goes rogue well there might be a
decentralized security system that
prevents that that someone created
beforehand we just all have to be thing
about these things it's good it's a good
time oh yeah I'm always grateful with
all the speakers that share that time
for free that I just I'm not sure
doctors come here anything okay I mean
okay one of it so anyway for a while for
networking and stuff like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
