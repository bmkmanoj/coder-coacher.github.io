hello world it's Suraj welcome to this
live stream today I'm going to be a
visualizing data with d3.js which is a
data visualization library I don't
normally do uh anything with JavaScript
for this channel but I've done a lot of
JavaScript in the past when I worked at
Tulio when I work on my own side
projects
javascript is a great language for
hackathons or hacking up anything really
quickly to show off and data
visualization is really important for
demoing what you've done so that's what
we're going to be talking about that so
I'm going to start off this live stream
with a five-minute Q&amp;amp;A and then we'll
get right to the code and what we're
going to be doing is visualizing the
survivor data set for the Titanic kaggle
data set alright so let's start off with
the Q&amp;amp;A hi everybody
how's it going good to see you guys what
are my thoughts on neural networks for
FPGA um FPGAs operate on a completely
different architecture like a computing
architecture and I think that there's a
lot of space up for experimentation with
that I've only seen one tutorial on
FPGAs and neural networks on the machine
learning subreddit and that was like a
few months ago but I definitely think
there's a lot of work to do there a data
visualization with unity and d3 I would
pick one or the other I don't see how
both of them would work together unity
is like something entirely different
it's for 3d graphics and d3 is more for
2d a neural net for Pokemon would be
awesome that's actually been done before
actually if you look today on machine
learning subreddit there's a there's a
guy who did just colorized pokemon blue
for using a convolutional neural network
how should I
herefore thesis interview on autonomous
driving uh you should take the
self-driving car nano degree that I'm
working on with Udacity it's totally
worth it a bunch of car companies are
going to look at this as a valid thing
so you should totally look at that for
an amateur I would say start with d3 not
okay if you want to get into data
visualization using javascript and any
code PAP podcasts or YouTube channels
that I recommend I would say um my own
let's see I really like let's say
they're there couple but I think one
that comes to mind is one for iOS it's a
the guy who made a F networking so
search a of networking uh blog his
name's Matt any book for machine
learning I'm really excited for and
wrongs machine learning yearning that's
coming out in like a month I think
that's going to be super cool where do I
work I do this YouTube channel full time
I don't that that's that's all I do I'm
not going to work for anybody do I
classify d3.js as a low-level graphics
library i classify it as lower level
than a lot of javascript libraries
because it works it manipulates the Dom
directly which is the elements that you
see on the page the document object
model the Dom is arson is a fancy way of
saying what you see on a page are you
using d3 PI library no I'm just working
directly with d3 and also I just wanted
to say about the whole Trump election
everything's gonna be okay don't worry
about it if you look at the data the
majority of people 18 to 25 like 996
percent of millennial voters voted for
Hillary so the future is still bright
and you know if we just keep going in
this bad direction I'll just run for
president in like 20 years so well you
know what I'm saying so anyway what data
just it's it's all over Twitter I mean
just like yeah anyway
all right two more questions and then
we're going to get started this let's
see um what will the schedule for today
be it's going to be a schedule for today
we'll be using d3.js to visualize to
visualize data for the Titanic survivor
data set off of Kaggle and I'm going to
show you guys that okay last question
how old are you I am 25 years old 25
years old all right that's all for um
okay one more thoughts on self-driving
cars they're coming really really fast
like next year
I've actually saw a lot of self-driving
cars uh just here in San Francisco just
like all around like they're like uber
is testing them so anyway okay so here
we go we're going to get started I'm
going to go ahead and screencast so um
go ahead and I want you guys to work
with me on this okay if you have you all
you need to do is have node installed
nodejs
all right so let's I'm going to
screencast and we're going to get
started here we go here we go one more
time everybody feel advanced we chair
alright okay to to the share follow uh
okay so now you guys see a bunch of
stuff here all right I'm going to put
this in the corner that uh I thought
about being a rapper but you know
computer science is just my calling and
I'm sure I can combine both I'm actually
going to LA YouTube is I just won this
YouTube thing called next up for
creators like 20 creators and I'm going
to go to they're paying for the flight
and the hotel and it's going to be
really cool I'm going to try to make a
not try I'm going to make a machine
learning music video so oh I just
admitted that so you guys get to know
the details because you're watching me
live I never let anybody this okay so
here we go
let me explain what I have here on the
screen we maximize this let me maximize
this up up up up up up make it really
big e corner here uh there I am really
small just like my brain just kidding
okay so all right what do I have here
what do I have here I have a node app
okay and let me explain what's happening
here I have a few things pre coded so
that we don't have to code that I just
have a few things pre coded right now so
we just get right to the good stuff so
let's talk about what we have here so in
your so what you want to do is you want
to start off by creating a package.json
and in node well actually let me let me
start off with explaining what we're
doing here so we're going to visualize
our data in the browser with d3 okay the
data set we're using is the Titanic
survivor data set off of kaggle and let
me just show you guys an example of that
so the taggle Titanic data set is really
popular it's been in use in machine
learning for quite a while let me have
that show up on the screen right here
okay where did that go where'd it go
boom so behind this where'd it go hold
on there it is okay so yeah this is it
if you can find it on Kaggle there's a
there's a bunch of great data sets off
of Kaggle I'm always using kick
I will data sets they're well documented
and have a lot of people that are using
them and so what this one is is it shows
all the passengers off of Titanic and it
shows whether or not they survived and a
bunch of features about them so it's
going to show things like their age
their gender where they embarked from
where they're from in general and
whether or not they survived which is a
boolean like yes I survived or no they
didn't survive and we can do a lot of
things with this data we can predict if
somebody survived based on what their
gender is well we can predict whether
it's not somebody survived based on
where they're from
and so it's a really great data set to
get started with learning about machine
learning and predictive analytics okay
so that's the data set we're going to
using you we're going to be using you
can get it from right here right at this
link alright so that's the data set and
uh we're going to be using the node
we're going to be using javascript by
the way and the reason we're using
javascript is because javascript is the
programming language of the web
javascript is messy it's ugly it's been
stretched and pulled to do things that
no one ever intended for it to do yet it
is the language of the web it is
pervasive it is everywhere it is behind
every single website you visit on the
Internet
ok and so javascript is a really really
important language and everybody should
know at least a little bit of JavaScript
ok and the data set is not formatted in
JSON it's formatted in CSV ok and I'm
going to talk about that in a second but
we're going to be using is the d3.js
JavaScript library d3 is a JavaScript
library that you can add to the
front-end of your web application okay
so d3 stands for data-driven documents
let me show you God and d3 stands for
data-driven documents it was a library
that was created basically you showcase
all the data that people have and it's
it's got this huge open source community
there's like 9000 Forks on github for
the d3 library it is the biggest data of
is library in the world and let me show
you guys what I mean when I say that ok
if if you just look on the Internet at a
couple of examples of b3 you have
literally thousands of examples ok
thousands of examples of all the
different types of data visualization
things you can do with d3 it is
extremely powerful ok you can do pie
charts you can do matrices there's a lot
of animations all sorts of things bar
charts pie charts chord diagrams
lollipops tables bubbles they're all
over the place and d3 is a really great
library for visualizing these things all
right so that's what that's what we're
going to be using we're going to be
using d3 and um and what d3
does and the reason I chose it besides
it's huge open-source community is it
directly manipulates elements in the
document object model the Dom which is a
fancy term for saying whatever you're
shown on the current web page like the
table the head things like that so if
you're ever presenting at a conference
or a hackathon class you are going to
get extra credit for knowing d3 okay
because it doesn't matter how good your
work words you have to present it really
well and that's all about visualization
okay so let's get started we're going to
be using node to show this it's going to
be a web app and node is a JavaScript
runtime traditionally before node you
would have to when you create a web app
you create your back-end and your
backends going to be in some weird
language like you know skip Scala or
something else and then your front ends
going to be in JavaScript so you have to
know two languages but with node you can
do the back end and the front end in
JavaScript you can do the entire stack
in JavaScript so the back end means
things that are happening in the
background data manipulation data
storage uh you know machine learning you
have to do all that in a different
language but with JavaScript what I mean
with no you could do it all in
JavaScript so we're going to be using
node
go ahead and install node and you can do
that as a binary for any system you're
on and once you have node it comes with
NPM which is the node package manager
you can install a bunch of JavaScript
libraries just like you do with pythons
package manager okay pick NPM install
okay so this is our package JSON and it
shows it shows what our dependencies are
going to be in this case our dependency
is just going to be Express which is
kind which is a which is a dependency
that allows you to create a skeleton for
your node app automatically all right
and and we also have our apt j/s okay
which i've already uh coded a skeleton
for us here i'm just going to quickly
explain this so we can get to the the
logic that we're going to be doing in
this code in the app KS we have three
variables that we're going to start off
with for express the importer Express
module that we already installed as the
dependencies and then we're going to
create our app using the Express and
then we have a path variable that uses
the path dependencies which is going to
we're going to have I'll show you guys
what we're going to do with that the
first line is going to be AB dot use
Express static path join public what
does that mean it's it says take
whatever is in the public folder and use
it in this app so what do we have in our
public folder let's check in our public
folder I've got four items okay I've got
D 3 D 3 min J is what is this this is a
bunch of code but what it is is the d3
library you can download this and we're
going to we're going to link to it in
our index file in our index.html so we
can use d3 this is all of d3 it it's it
looks like it's not a lot but it's a lot
of code you just can't see it because
it's all happening horizontally okay and
then the next thing we're going to use
is dimple dimple is a wrapper around d3
that makes it easier to use so let me
show you guys what dimple looks like ok
dimple is an API to visualize v3 in an
easy way
so v3 can't the learning curve for d3
can be kind of intense so we're going to
just use simple to have an easy wrapper
around it so we're going to be able to
use d3 elements with an easy to use API
it's a great way to get started for data
visualization all right so dimple J's or
check that out so that's it those are
those are the things we're going to be
using and the last two the last to call
items are the Titanic data set the first
one shows the passengers their status
you know whether or not they survived
and the features about them class sex
and where they embarked from and the
next one shows more information about
them like their ticket the fare the
cabin things like that and their
passenger ID these are these are our two
these are our two dependencies okay
sorry our two data sets the Titanic they
say all right so that's what we're going
to be using in our app and that's what
we're saying let's use whatever is in
the public folder then we create our
first route alright and in our first
route we're going to say get whatever is
in the index one HTML file and show it
on the page so whenever we hit this
which is the
main page we're going to go to localhost
and we're going to hit it it's going to
show us whatever is in our index.html
all right so what is this last code this
last code is going to start our server
okay it's going to say start it at Port
5,000 using the address and port and
then and then print it to terminal
that's it okay so let's let's see what
that looks like I already ran it so I
already typed in node fjs that's all you
have to type in node app node fjs okay
and once you do that it's going to see
right here node fjs it's going to start
it's going to start the app at the at
port 5,000 so let's see what that looks
like
localhost 5,000 and we'll show it to you
guys right here okay all it says is data
visualization why is that because in my
index.html the page is showing that's
the only thing that I have show up so
what do we so what do we have here
so what do we have here well we're
starting off with a our script so we
import d3 and dimple and we do that
using the script keyword alright this is
all HTML but what we're going to be
writing JavaScript inside of HTML and we
can tell HTML to use javascript by
pointing by using these script keywords
alright so we've imported d3 and dimple
and now we're going to actually perform
our data visualization ok and so I've
written out HTML here what we're going
to be doing all right let's start off by
creating a bar chart boards - to plot
survivors by their class so whatever
class they were in alright so let's do
it
ok here we go all right so let's let's
type that out so in HTML we're going to
say we're going to create an h2 tag
which is a header and say survivors by
passenger class and it's going to be a
bar chart so we'll say bar all right
this is just text this is just plain
text all right
now we need to tell our HTML that we're
about to write some JavaScript shits
about to get real we're about to write
some JavaScript this isn't know HTML
anymore all right
so we'll start off by writing JavaScript
by the script tag and then we'll close
it okay that means that we're ready to
write our JavaScript and what are we
going to do well we're going to put this
inside of what we call a div a div is an
element now that we we group things adds
and we're going to call this give this
div chart container too because we're
going to have another one later
and we'll close the grid and in HTML you
open and close everything just like this
all right open and close all right so
let's start off by oh you guys are
hilarious okay so let's start off by
doing this all right so let's go ahead
and say we're going to create our first
SQL closing because my age to close my
h2 oh yeah thank you appreciate so now
let's do this so we're the first thing
we're going to do is we want to say bar
and we're going to call this SVG - all
right bar SVG - equals simple got new
SVG and we're going to call that element
that we want to use for this and um
let's see buh and then close it here in
the printing and then 600 400 so what
did I just do here
well I'm creating an ST SVG SVG is a
language for describing 2d graphics in
XML all right so we're going to create
one here so that the arguments here are
the parent selector um are the parent
selector which is selector which is what
the element in the Dom we want to write
this bar chart in and then the size and
width of it okay so it's an SVG element
and it's going to be a chart all right
so let's go ahead and do this we're
going to say we're going to now we're
going to use d3 so we three dot CSV so
we're going to call our data data from
our CSV file and then we're going to say
we're going to say function beta what is
this doing III has a bunch of wild kites
it can support when loading beta and one
of the most common ones is just plain
old CSV which is what we have our data
in so we're going to use the CSV
function of d3 to convert our data into
an array of objects and that array is
going to be that data variable that's
going to be stored in the data variable
all right ah so okay so here we go we're
going to I have not seen dr. strange yet
I want to watch black mirror so now
we're going to create a chart by
combining our SVG and our data variable
and beta variable what am I doing with
this uh that's not sure there we go now
all right here we go here we go so now
we're going to create our chart we're
going to say bar chart instance chart
instance thank you salon instance equals
new imple chart okay we're going to
create our chart and we're going to use
the SVD we just created that SVG -
variable and our data that we just
created with that function better charge
instant now we're going to set our
bounds set bounce I'm definitely gonna
close this function in second yep let's
see set bounds and so for our balance
we're going to say we're going to take
we're going to take that chart instance
and we're going to call the set bounds
variable and we're going to say the
length width height and size and we're
I'm sorry the length width and the
location on the screen we want this to
be okay so that's going to be the
balance and then we're going to say we
want to add our actresses right to our
bar variable we're going to say chart
instance and we're going to add our
category axis we're going to add our
category axis so that's going to be our
x-axis
okay and that's going to be our
passenger class so this is a bar chart
it's a bar chart we're going to call it
passenger class and
that's our X variable and we want to
order it we're going to add order rule
we want to order it by type so the type
of data that it is we can order it by
number by value we're going to order by
type so now we did the X and now let's
do Y so for our y-axis we're going to
say chart instance Tarkenton dot add PCT
axis which is going to create our y-axis
we're label Y and that's going to be the
count okay so that's the number of
people so kept to the passenger class
and then the count those are the our x
and y variables so now we're going to
add one one more variable which is going
to be status and that's going to show up
whenever we hover over one of the bars
so we're going to add a series and
that's going to show up whenever we I'll
show you guys in a second we're going to
call it that is and then we're going to
say
Grimbold plot bar so we're going to call
that lastly we're going to add a legend
so like we can see like what's happening
here we're going to add a legend and
we're going to say where do we want this
legend to be so it's a chart instance
and then add a legend so that x location
x and y values the sides of it and then
what part of the screen it's going to be
the right side okay so right okay so
that's that and now that's it and now I
think that's it oh no one more thing we
have to draw it so say chart infant you
are the legend answer to file you are
the legend chart and since dot draw one
thousandth of the size oh okay now let's
compile this and see what happens
okay hold on something's wrong here
let's see I have to close this right
I think somebody told me that now let's
see what happens uh nope not yet not yet
okay so now line 18h to close right
exactly thank you yes right
okay so there is a problem here let's
see let's figure this out we can do this
oh I see I close the script tag line 43
is write a capital here let's see what
we got here nope what else is going line
41 I've got this uh camel casing um
let's see let's see let's see line 23 um
SVG to chart container - I think right
um and oh and then I need to go ahead
and add a bunch of these uh semicolons
at the end of everything right so one
two three four five I forgot about that
I'm still in Python mode guys okay so
I'll add that everywhere and boom boom
boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
alright it's not needed but like okay uh
where are we here okay let's see there's
something we can let's just inspect this
using our chrome inspector what's the
deal here where are we okay hold on all
right whatever
let's just X out of that um so let me
remove these just so we could see what's
happening here we remove these comments
for a second Bob up up up up up um and
alright so what's the deal here okay so
line 24 I need to remove one of these
there we go
ah let's see and then in consult line 23
we've got um we've got dimple new SVG
and I'm closing it oh I need to add that
24 and so in line 24 I've got um Titanic
CSV and then um we got this we got this
uh this is hat what is happening here
I've got d3 dot CSV and then let's see
let's see in console so if we go to
inspect and then we go to console type
error chart instance on add category is
not a function uh add category axis
there it is
oh yes
okay cool so let's see what that looks
like all right boom so that's a nice
little animation right let me refresh
that so it goes with Lulu C it goes up
like that and uh let's see so what
happened here so this is our uh this is
our access I do need a linter but like I
don't have time for that so these are
our three classes right and we visualize
these three classes let's look at our
code and what it fit what's visualizing
okay and uh these are our three classes
and then we're ordering them by the type
we have a legend survived and died and
we have ordered it by percentage and we
have our legend here surviving that and
remember that third thing that I added
at the end of the what was it the ad
series the status that's just survived
or not okay so that's that okay so that
was a bar chart and now we want to do a
pie chart and this is going to be easier
right okay so let's go ahead and do that
we'll add a pie chart now let's do that
okay so this is going to be the same
thing so okay except we're going to do
now a we're going to show the share
passengers as a pie chart and so what's
happening here okay so for this we're
going to just create a
different so that's the first step well
create a bit and for the spit uh we're
going to oh man you guys are so funny
okay let's see what people are saying
here ah I am a pro because I use lives I
yeah okay so now give I bid vote I did
vote for Hillary I did I good but it's
okay it'll be fine
so now we're going to do the same thing
for the passenger share of pie charts so
let's let's go let's go ahead and do
this so the idea of it of this is going
to be called pie chart container twelve
let's just call it twelve for no reason
okay so now we're going to say we're
going to create our header for it
everyone say passenger share by class
wine because there are three classes
class 1 class 2 and class 3 and class 3
and it will close our bit alright so we
had that and now uh so now we're going
to say uh write our script so we'll do
our script tag again script and then
type equals what is it type the
JavaScript type right text slash
JavaScript um and now uh-huh
here we go so now we have our script
type and I need to close that and so
that is uh okay we did that so now let's
do that so we'll do the same thing we're
going to create our SVG so let's say SVG
twelve because it's the container 12
right and we're going to say dimple
that's the library we're using this is a
wrapper around v3 to create a new SVG
title we're going to get our element for
the Dom which we're going to call pie
chart we're going to call it PI naught P
star pie chart
hi chart all right container 12 okay
and okay some of you guys are like
JavaScript pros and that's awesome and
you have very opinionated views on
syntax to use and that's fine and keep
doing it but I'm just going to keep
going because this is about data
visualization alright
so tank line 38 line 38 I change it
because I don't see a reason to change
it but okay good bye D so now build a
wall in Python that might be a future
video of a big wall for Python so now
we're going to say this is the data set
we're using the Titanic train dot CSV so
this is a different than other data set
right and we're going to say or our
function thank you for our function that
we're going to use and we're going to
turn our data into an array so we're
going to take that whole that whole
thing and we're going to turn it into an
array and we're going to say we're close
well we'll just go ahead and start off
with it close right so we don't have to
deal with that and we're going to say
let's create our chart instance just
like last time we'll create a chart
instance and actually I only need to
give these two examples I'm not going to
do these are - these two exam examples
are good enough for this for this video
okay so you're going to see a bar chart
and a pie chart okay and you see how
we're working with two different data
sets so dimple dot chart and we're to
say SVG 12 right so that that variable
we just declared and uh and now we're
going to set the bounds for this chart
instance so set bounds set bounds just
like we did last time - where is it
going to be on the screen for 60 and 360
and then we're going to say what else we
do this so this is a part pie chart
right so we need to make sure that we
add our accesses I mean
are still accesses in a in a pie chart
but we they're just they're not like a
horizontal axis so someone said
something about 44 pi is the capital P
thank you all right so now targeting
since that ad thank you John I
appreciate it
ad measure axis okay so for our measure
axis we're going to call it P and P
stands for passenger class and we're
going to we're going to see what that
looks like in a second so now we're
going to add a series so that's going to
be the passenger class thankfully under
a passenger class and that's going to be
what we call all of it without the whole
series of that pie chart so we're almost
done with this and it's going to be that
pie chart then pulled up plot by pie so
now we have two more things to two more
lines for this and then we're done so
that's going to be we're going to add a
legend just like we did last time add
legend and it's going to be let's see
the legend is going to be 520 we're on
the screen 90 300 and these are absolute
values and we want it to be on the left
side of the screen uh and um well now we
can draw those that's it now we'll go
ahead and draw it boom now let's see
what happened when we visualize this
okay all right let's see it in our
browser okay so
something went wrong let's go ahead and
inspect the console as you guys have
suggested very the pie-chart container
12 selector did not match any elements
uh-oh oh that's a piece char
oh I think someone said that I was just
like not listening okay boom I to our
container 12 does not match any yes oh
it started pie chart in pain or 12 there
we go there we go
okay 3008 let's see what did someone say
about xxx there we go thank you thank
you okay so umm right so what do we have
here I feel like this needs to be more
descriptive but we have three classes
and they're they're all displayed here
right so it's that's kind of the same
ago we have here but it's a pie chart
right and if we reload it we can see
that animation for the bar chart but the
pie chart doesn't really have that we
could add that if we wanted to but we're
not going to okay so those are our two
uh sorry variables that we've done those
are our two charts and and yeah so that
that was my short video my short little
video on data visualization um I want to
do more on this stuff let me know what
you guys think in the comments later so
now so now that was it that was I know
this was a shorter video than the past
two times but I just wanted to show you
guys what this looks like and now I'll
do a closing five-minute Q&amp;amp;A and then
yeah that'll be the end so okay so let
me show you guys the code as well let me
make sure you guys get a full overview
of what's happening here right so I did
I did it in a bar chart and a pie chart
and it showed up just like this alright
alright
and yeah so
check out dimple and d3 there's a lot of
great visualizations that people have
done with d3 I'll take three questions
so what was my first machine learning
project my first machine learning
project was uh I worked at the robotics
lab at Columbia and they needed someone
who was going to take the code date
already written in C++ and convert it to
CUDA so we could run on a GPU and I was
like way in over my head but I was just
like yeah yeah I can do that I was like
inside like no but I just really wanted
to be in the robotics lab so I was just
like yeah I can do this and so that was
really hard but basically I took C++ and
I converted it to CUDA and that was a
huge learning experience so that was my
first machine learning project and what
the code did was it just it was a
classifier this was before any machine
learning libraries was out there so it
was like it was just like raw code it
was just like raw C++ no libraries so
that was my first project but I wouldn't
ever recommend that as a first machine
learning project for you if I were to
start today I would start with probably
like scikit-learn just to like like
before even neural networks just like a
linear regression okay how to connect d3
Dutch it's okay second of three
questions before we go can you explain
how to connect d3.js with Python sure so
d3 okay so there's a front end and a
back end in a web app okay so in the
back end you want to use a language that
will be able to store data and
manipulate it so python has a framework
for this called Django okay uh so Django
is a great framework for this Python and
Django look up Django okay dj-ing oh
okay so with Django you could create all
of this back-end manipulation so
intrigued right so maybe you just start
off with a jangle web app that just
shows a little text entry form where you
type in a name and then it shows the
name okay that's it and so python would
let you do that you add d3 to that
Django repository like the you know via
NPM and or not via NPM but just like
pop pop in that and Minjae sd3 file that
I showed you here in this public folder
right here and then you can just
manipulate elements directly of using d3
so anything that you send back to you
could send forward from the jingle web
app you can manipulate with d3 and show
in any way you want so the last question
is is it possible to generate this chart
directly in python language using a
django plug plug in uh to generate this
chart directly in the pipe yeah actually
there's there's there's a library call I
think it's called PI d3 or d3 PI which
basically lets you do that so yeah you
can totally do that
um and I can definitely prepare a
description of what to code along with
me next time all right
so cool so that's all for this live
stream I want to do these once a week um
and we'll see how it goes because this
is definitely like fun but it's also
like really intense so uh the goal is to
do it every week
I'm definitely under lease my you know
main videos once a week as well so
alright guys so that's all so for now
I've got to learn more about JavaScript
so thanks for watching my end is there
it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
