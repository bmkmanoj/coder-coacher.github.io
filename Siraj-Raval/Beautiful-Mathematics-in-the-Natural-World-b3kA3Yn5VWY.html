our universe take a look at this River
if we measure the length of it and
divide by the direct route from the
start to the end we'll get its syn
yosity or bendiness we found that the
average sanyasa T of every single River
in the world is pi the same mathematical
constant used to calculate the mass of
an electron and the gentle breathing of
a baby helps define how bendy all rivers
are its digits never end and never show
a pattern but they can't possibly be
random because they represent the
inherent order of so many things in
nature at a smaller scale we can observe
that this drop of water is a liquid but
depending on how the molecules are
arranged it could also be a solid or a
gas only if it's liquid though is it
considered wet not all water is wet it's
this specific arrangement of molecules
caused by surface tension that gives it
the emergent property of wetness if we
were to arrange these water droplets
together in a certain way we could get a
waterfall
all waterfalls across the world fall at
the same speed because they are all
subject to the same acceleration gravity
the navier-stokes equation describes how
all fluids like the water in this
waterfall will move and behave and it
also explains everything from how blood
flows in our body to how we can best
simulate water in video games we can
understand the order of the universe by
studying the patterns that emerge from
it even something as seemingly random as
the shape of a tree's branches has order
the main trunk of a tree will grow until
it produces a branch which has two
growth points and each stem branches
into two this pattern is repeated for
every new stem we can model this using
the Fibonacci sequence each successive
number is the sum of the previous two
and the average ratio of every two
consecutive terms in the sequence gives
us a famous constant called a golden
ratio we can find examples of the golden
ratio everywhere in nature the seed pods
of a pine cone are a spiral pattern if
we measure the angle offset between a
leaf on a plant stem and the one below
it we'll find the average value uses the
golden ratio it's even present in the
formation of waves in the ocean
this mathematical order applies to
mammals as well what makes something
alive or dead the difference between a
living bird and a dead one isn't that
we're adding some secret life juice to
it its state depends on the specific
pattern of its molecules many birds use
celestial objects like the Sun or stars
to navigate their flight path and this
requires some trigonometric calculations
but it's not that they're calculating
these things consciously animals simply
do what comes natural to them millions
of years of natural selection
helped equip them with the capabilities
to survive in their evolutionary niche
birds are solving a trigonometry problem
in the same way a waterfall solves the
navier-stokes equation or a dog solves
object location using visual and
chemical signals mathematics is just the
language that helps us interpret all
this activity so the question is can
math also help us understand how our own
brains work can we quantify the feeling
of meeting someone special for the first
time what's been your favorite trip
oh yeah or the feelings you get when you
spend time with them consciousness is a
mathematical pattern when information is
being processed governed by a set of
patterns like those found in the
branches of a tree or the fluid dynamics
of a waterfall the way it feels is
consciousness
it's a beautiful emergent phenomenon
arising only when molecules are arranged
in a certain pattern just like how
wetness arises only when water molecules
are arranged in a certain pattern math
gives us a framework to reason about
what the order behind these patterns
could be and we can use beauty the
beauty that's all around us as our torch
in this journey one that we hold up and
follow with the belief that eventually
it might just lead us to truth hello
world it's Suraj I'm here in Portland
Oregon just hiking I hope you guys liked
the video the winner of the coding
challenge from the last video is Vishal
bhature badass of the week and the
runner up is set to year no coding
challenge this video relax take a
breather and happy holidays to you and
everybody you love for now I've got to
go hike up to a waterfall so thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
