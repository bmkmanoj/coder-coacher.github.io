list 10 people that I admire today in no
particular order these amazing people
are a mix of AI researchers blockchain
researchers philosophers storytellers
and artists that I personally look up to
and gain inspiration from so hopefully
by sharing them with you you too can
learn from them I'll link to all of them
in the video description and remember to
hit the subscribe button if you want to
keep up with all of my educational
content
number one is navall Robbie Conte navall
is the founder of the popular angel list
website which aims to connect startups
to the resources they need like
investors and initial hires he invested
in some of the most valuable companies
that exist today early on and has an eye
for spotting potential but he's much
more than that
navall has a way with words I follow him
on Twitter and some of his tweet storms
just make me sit back and question the
foundational structures of society he's
really into blockchain technology mostly
for its potential to reorganize the
fabric of humanity and if Nietzsche were
alive today his tweets would probably
look very similar to navall and the
internet is going to become a giant grid
additionally some of his blog posts are
worthy of Pulitzer Prizes he's able to
connect the dots between politics
technology religion and social media in
a way very few people can number two his
Oriole VIN y'alls
in almost every single AI paper that
matters a lot to me Oriole is listed as
one of the author's neural machine
translation which improved language
translation immensely sequence to
sequence learning which brought chatbots
to a whole new level
wavenet which was one of the top three
advances in all of deep learning last
year a new standard in speech
recognition I was really excited when he
was listed as one of the 35 innovators
under 35 by MIT Technology Review
clearly Oriole is on to something his
ideas are pointing in the right
direction for where we should be headed
in terms of research and what
The Avenues worth experimenting with
number three is Andrew Trask when I
first started making videos about AI
almost two years ago
I remembered stumbling on a blog post by
tracks on how a neural network works at
the time it was by far the best
technical explanation I'd ever seen on
how a neural network works thinking
about gradient descent like dropping a
ball into a bowl now that's an analogy
that I can understand as opposed to the
dozens of other tutorials that forced me
to think about it in terms of concepts I
wasn't as familiar with Trask later
collaborated with me on the deep
learning course I taught at Udacity and
there I got to know him a bit better
later on we met up in London where I
interviewed him for the channel we ended
up getting along really well Andrew gets
it he understands that data is the key
to democratizing AI and he's working on
solving this problem full-time right now
as he builds the open mind community
he's one of the best technical writers
alive right now number four
Balaji Srinivasan I remember watching
his talk on exit at Y Combinator's
startup school uber Airbnb stripe Square
and of course you know the big one
Bitcoin are all things that thread in
DC's power it is not necessarily clear
that the US government can ban something
that it wants to ban it was a
revolutionary idea that Silicon Valley
should secede from the United States and
his reasoning relating the US
Constitution to deprecated code networks
as nation-states and geographic
communities to cloud communities
fundamentally changed the way I view the
world Balaji's tweet storms are really
insightful and his new startup earn comm
is probably the most successful
implementation in production of
blockchain technology out there right
now and it's because he's been thinking
about this stuff for so long his list of
accomplishments are pretty long and
overall his view on where things are
headed are unparalleled
number five Brian Johnson
Brian puts his money where his mouth is
he grew up in a modest family and earned
his wealth over the years he made huge
amounts of money with his previous
startup Braintree and decided to put 100
million of his own money to fund his
current venture Colonel Colonel is
dedicated to building a brain computer
interface essentially they want to build
a device that connects your brain to the
Internet solving AI and connecting our
brains to the Internet are two of the
most important problems of our time if
we do that we literally become limitless
in our ability to do anything so when
people say to me they think I'm crazy
for what I'm trying to do I would say I
would be crazy not to had the
opportunity to meet Brian at his office
in LA a few weeks ago and the
conversations we had had me thinking for
hours afterwards he's trying to create
an environment where discoveries happen
and the best discoveries tend to happen
by accident like that of DNA every day
he wakes up excited to solve that
problem and it's really inspiring number
six
Tristan Harris I first heard Tristan
Harris while listening to a podcast by a
modern philosopher I really liked named
Sam Harris and he blew me away the thing
is that any attention based company
snapchat Netflix you know meditation
after even they they all need more
attention to be successful he used to be
a design ethicist at Google but is now
working full-time on what he calls the
time well-spent
movement basically he sees how these big
tech companies are creating algorithms
that are optimizing for users attention
since that's what fuels their at revenue
business model and these algorithms have
become runway eyes even the creators
don't understand how they fully work the
Facebook newsfeed is an example of that
and this poses an existential threat the
content it shows us isn't necessarily
good for us it's just what grabs our
attention
Tristan argues that instead of
optimizing for attention they should be
optimizing for our time well-spent
content that would benefit the users as
AI development accelerates now more than
ever we need someone like Tristan
helping guide AI so that it's built in a
safe beneficial way number seven tupac
shakur okay i know this one is kind of
random and I know Tupac rapped about
violence and drugs but what I find most
inspiring about him is the amount of
courage he had Tupac wasn't afraid of
anyone or anything he spoke his truth
during a time of real political and
social turmoil in America very few
people had the kind of charisma that
Tupac had and he was a man with a plan
you just wanted to follow him
despite being constantly degraded by the
media and the police he fought for what
he believed in a brighter future for
people in poverty he never lost sight of
who he was number eight Kwan Bennett Wan
was my roommate back in San Francisco
for a bit and I worked with him a bit on
his project the interplanetary
filesystem ipfs and file coin are an
implementation of Kwan's greater vision
for the web when one talks about block
chains and distributed hash tables he
makes things seem not just possible but
simple to achieve that wouldn't have
otherwise we built ipfs a protocol to
remove those central points of failure
to improve the resilience of the
internet and the web and to give
information a stronger sense of
permanence he has this thirst for
knowledge that's really inspiring and
when he talks about the pioneers of the
web from berners-lee to Bram Cohen he
makes you realise that you too could
come up with a great idea if you build a
great protocol people will use it and
it'll become a key part of the web ipfs
is a beautiful system and I could tell
that he'd really done his distributed
systems research when I read it it's
people like wand that will move the web
and as a result all of humanity forward
number nine Steve Jobs say what you want
about Steve Jobs say that he was hard to
work with or he wasn't doing the real
engineering behind Apple's products but
no one can say Steve Jobs wasn't an
inspirational speaker when Jobs spoke
people listened and Apple totally
different apples placing it is totally
different and believe me the products
and the distribution strategies and
manufacturing have told me differ and we
understand that but values and core
values he was able to weave a story into
the fabric of the company he was
creating giving Apple something more to
believe in than just building products
I've read his biography and I've
probably seen every single Steve Jobs
video that exists at this point he's
truly one of a kind number 10 is Trent
McConaughey kind of like Andrew Trask
Trent is one of the few people that
understand both artificial intelligence
and blockchain technology really well
not only that Trent
understands the need to democratize
access to data and he's working on it
full time on Ocean protocol his blog
posts about AI and blockchain show his
deep understanding of how these
technologies intertwine and the way
they've raised money by putting a very
small cap on investment shows that it's
not about the money it's about the
mission there are so many more people I
could have mentioned here shoutout to
Elon Musk but we all know who he is is
there someone that really inspires you
post their name and why in the comment
section please subscribe for more
programming videos and for now I've got
to get inspired so thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
