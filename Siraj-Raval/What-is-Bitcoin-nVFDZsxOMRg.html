currency just like the US dollar or the
Japanese yet except Bitcoin doesn't
belong to anyone no one owns it no
government bank company or person it's
just open source software that anyone
can download and browse it's an
invention that no one owns but anyone
can use kind of like email it was
created in 2007 by a mysterious person
into Toshi Nakamoto the search for
Satoshi is been going on for years but
no one has ever found him before and
since then the total value of the
Bitcoin network has grown from nothing
to over 5 billion u.s. dollars once you
join the Bitcoin network by opening a
wallet it will generate 325 character
long public and private key using
cryptography hence why bitcoin is called
a cryptocurrency this is your Bitcoin
address they can be kind of like your
bank account number you can give your
public key to anyone it's what they'll
use to send money to you but your
private key is for your eyes only anyone
who has their private key can access all
of your funds so keep it safely hidden
every time someone sends Bitcoin to
another person the Bitcoin network is
responsible for processing the
transaction the Bitcoin network is
maintained by a bunch of computers that
verify all transactions to ensure that
they are valid this process is called
mining and anyone can set up their
computer to become a miner and get paid
for maintaining the network always do is
download the Bitcoin client and start
mining mining requires a lot of
computing power so you'll need a really
really good GPU chip an ASIC computer
would work best when anyone gets the
client their computer will start
downloading something called the
blockchain the blockchain is a huge list
of every single bit
that has ever happened in the network
these transactions are bundled into
units called blocks these blocks are all
chained together in order of timestamps
a chain of blocks blockchain get when
anyone makes a transaction each miner
will check to see if the transaction was
ever made before in its copy of the
blockchain if it was never made before
it will recognize it as a valid
transaction if at least 51% of the
network agrees the transaction is valid
it closed and is added to the blockchain
dodging is stored on every miners
computer there is no central computer
whatsoever it's completely decentralized
that means no one can shut down big but
what if a bad guy decides he wants to
try to generate fake bitcoins couldn't
he just create a bunch of mining
accounts and approve his own
transactions as a new majority well yeah
but Bitcoin has an incredible security
system designed to defend against that
type of attack also known as a civil
attack there's an extra step that every
miner has to do one says that a blog is
valid it has to solve a bunch of
randomly generated mathematical problems
using its computing power and once it's
done solving them other miners can
verify that it did indeed solve those
problems this is called the proof of
work out rhythm miners have to prove
that they've done a certain amount of
computational work before their vote is
valid what this means is that in order
for a bad guys
money twice or double spend he has a
control more computational power than
51% of Bitcoin network the total
computational power the Bitcoin network
is currently 13 thousand times greater
than the 500 fastest supercomputers in
the world combined as Kanye says thanks
I didn't know one person or entity has
that much computing power so their work
has never been broken before and it only
gets stronger as more miners join by
adding their computing power to it only
21 million bitcoins can ever be created
at the current rate of creation the last
Bitcoin will be my own the year 2140 so
when that happens the miners will then
be paid with just transaction fees
instead of transaction fees and
generated clients this makes a Bitcoin a
deflationary currency
unlike the inflationary US dollar
deflationary means that there is a hard
limit on the amount of currency that can
be created and inflationary means that
more currency can be created but what
isn't inherently better or more natural
than the other there is no natural state
of money its natural state is neither
inflationary nor deflationary money is
not a natural thing it's a tool we use
in our society to transfer dect amongst
ourselves turning the dials on the
economic models for money in either
direction has both pros and cons biglan
can plug into the existing system of
money transfer and make it faster and
more efficient and more widely available
there's so many ways to get involved
