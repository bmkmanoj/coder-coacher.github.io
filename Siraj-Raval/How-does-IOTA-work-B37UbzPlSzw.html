are so 2017-2018 is gonna be the year of
block DAGs directed acyclic graphs you
might be thinking what did you just say
and that's okay because I'm gonna
explain what I just said this video is
about a crypto system called iota okay
so it's called iota and it uses a
distributed ledger similar to bitcoins
blockchain except it solves a lot of the
issues or it aims to solve a lot of its
issues and it's getting really popular
and it's about number seven or number
eight on the coin market cap website
it's getting really popular and I've
gotten a lot of requests for this video
so I'm gonna do a video on this I've
been studying it all day and yesterday
so and I'm and I'm pretty excited about
what I've what I've studied so far so
I'm gonna share with you what I've
learned about this system today okay so
before we go into why iota is awesome I
want to start off with the problem with
block chains because block chains are
awesome
however they've got their problems 99 of
them but no not 99 problems just some
problems okay I just wanted to slip that
in there okay so here we go with the
problems the first problem with block
chains are scalability issues right
there are endless debates on Twitter on
slack on Bitcoin forums on scalability
and there's a million-in-one solutions
to scalability right so bitcoins
blockchain takes about 10 minutes to
confirm a transaction that's a long time
right 10 minutes to confirm a
transaction is a very long time for a
system that's meant for micro payments
right micro payments for machines the
machine to machine transfer we want
machines to be transferring millions of
transactions per second ideally just
giant mesh networks a machine just
transmitting value faster than any human
could but for 10 minutes that's way too
long right and that's what it's become
there are currently 200,000 unconfirmed
transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain
so if we open this list this real-time
list of transactions okay this is real
time we'll see that there are about 100
83,000 unconfirmed transactions and it
is flowing in right now just like that
that's a lot of unconfirmed transaction
and at ten minutes per transaction
that's just way too long okay so that's
a lot of unconfirmed transactions
because it's taking so long to confirm
them and this is annoying right why
would you want to wait or pay a higher
fee for a faster transaction validation
or deal with transaction uncertainty
let's say you're a multinational
corporation like IBM or you know Chase
Bank and you want to use blockchain
technology to sync up your different
branches across the world you know use
its ledger to sync up the data and in a
in a permissionless trustless way but if
you're having to wait ten minutes per
transaction that's way too long so check
this out
visa has two thousand transactions per
second visa is the network globally it
is the network for transmitting value
currently bitcoin is nothing compared to
Visa okay look at that
five to seven transactions a second that
is nothing we weigh more than that so in
comparison PayPal is way more so how are
we going to get up to that visa level
you know what I'm saying how do we get
up to that visa level and there's been
so many different suggestions there's
Segway there's a Lightning Network
there's all these solutions so I'm gonna
go into those a bit but that's the first
issue with blockchains
scalability it's hard to scale a
blockchain right you've got massive
amounts of computing power you've got
the speed of transactions decreases as a
network increases in size and you don't
want to store data on the blockchain
right there's this there's this thing
called blockchain bloat where you don't
want to store data directly on a
blockchain you want to have a pointer to
data that's living somewhere like in a
distributed hash table right so
scalability is one there's number two
are fees right so the mean transaction
fee that is the the average transaction
fee for a transaction and the Bitcoin
network is a dollar that might not seem
like a lot of money but that's a lot of
money for a network meant for micro
payments right that's that's the whole
point
visa has that 2% what is it two percent
charge for for each transaction the coin
was all about okay and we don't need
that anymore right we have we have felis
transactions or there's a very minimal
fee well now it's a dollar so anything
under that is worthless right because
the fee is going to be greater than the
transaction
so micro payments under $1 are virtually
useless or impossible now and this can
be more than the transaction amount
itself right so solutions include
increasing the block size using
lightning network central servers for
off chain transactions like using
coinbase for example side chains tree
chains there's a lot of proposals and
there's a lot of ways that the core
developers and just the the Bitcoin
community is doing to fix that I'm not
saying that they are not trying to fix
it they are but it's still it's still
it's not fixed right that there are
still the fee still exists so if we look
at the fee over time it's just going
straight up it's just exponentially over
time for transmitting even 0.01 BTC
which is what this graph is so there's a
lot of computing power required to
maintain the Bitcoin blockchain as well
as you probably know and mining has
become somewhat centralized by these
giant mining pools right in China mostly
but that's that's a lot like just I take
a look at this chart right here of the
distribution of Bitcoin mining power
right if you look at gee hash and BTC
guild together they make up 55% of the
network two pools make up the majority
of the network's mining power
now that is centralization okay that is
a lot of centralization for supposedly
decentralized network and transaction
speed declines as the network increases
in size as more transactions compete for
the limited block spaces so it's gonna
take more and more computing power to
mine the same amount of Bitcoin
you got to buy these Asics if you want
to be a miner you got to put the money
in okay you got to buy some giant a six
ideally if you want to make some profit
and then you know meter your electricity
costs etc let me just look at this this
is the hash rate you know that the cost
it takes to mine a block just going
straight up which means you need way
more computing power to mine the same
amount of Bitcoin that you would
otherwise okay and lastly one more
problem they're vulnerable to quantum
attacks right so Bitcoin and other proof
of work based block chains are
susceptible to being broken
by a powerful quantum computer so here's
why the proof-of-work algorithm and I've
talked about this in previous videos but
the proof-of-work algorithm is trying to
solve random mathematical problems right
it takes a certain amount of time to
solve these problems so for a minor to
generate a suitable hash to generate a
block they've got to check around 2 to
the 68th nonces that means numbers only
used once to find that suitable hash so
a quantum computer would need the square
root of n operations to solve a problem
that would normally need n operations on
a classical computer that's let's this
is an order of a magnet or of an order
of magnitude difference so a quantum
computer would need if we calculated it
out which I did right here is a quantum
computer would be 17 billion times more
efficient in Bitcoin mining than the
classical computer right so right so the
network requires lots of computing power
to maintain its security and if a bad
actor could gain control of more than
51% of nodes that means they have more
than 51% of computing power then they
would be able to double spend that means
change a transaction history and spend
money that they don't actually have and
that would break the entire network and
everything is based off of classical
computing right the laws of classical
computers however quantum computers
could do this 17 billion times faster so
with just one very powerful quantum
computer an attacker could break the
entire network and this is very
dangerous and we don't have a quantum
computer like that right now and it's
all theoretical but there are advances
being made in this space and it's it's
gonna happen so we need some sort of
quantum attack resistance mechanism and
I've got this little infographic here on
how a quantum computer works but the
most basic li5 explanation I can give
right now is that classical computer
only computes ones and zeros so there
are binary operators where as a quantum
computer uses instead of a bit a qubit
which can be both a 1 a 0 and a 1 and 0
at the same time so it's a superposition
of two different bits and this allows
for the types of computation that would
not be possible on a classical computer
I have to have a great video on this and
a part of my math of intelligence series
it's called quantum computation so check
that I just search
Siraj quantum computation let's keep
going here okay so those are all the
problems with the blockchain so let's
talk about why iota as a crypto system
is different from a blockchain so the
first big difference is the structure so
like I said blockchain tour so 2017 iota
uses what's called a block dag okay a
directed acyclic graph I just want to
talk about the directed acyclic graph
for a second okay so DAGs are not new a
dag is just a hierarchy of nodes that
are connected to each other where no
node is a descendant of itself that
means there are no cycles that's the
word a cyclic there are no cycles right
so it's just a hierarchy of nodes that
are connected to each other in one
direction so there are a million
different ways that you could structure
a dag but that's the basic idea no
cycles in this graph you could think of
a file system as a dag right because
it's just a hierarchy of nodes right
folder within a folder within a folder
get the the protocol that github uses
that's a DAC ipfs is ipfs the
interplanetary file system that's a dag
in fact you can even think of a
blockchain as a dag right because a
blockchain doesn't have cycles but it's
a very specific type of deck in that
it's a singly linked list it's a
glorified singly linked list that is a
that is secured by the proof-of-work
algorithm a dag is more general like so
here's here's an image right here so
block chains are just blocks that are
pointing to each other in one direction
and tangle which is what they call which
is what Iota calls its it's another word
for its tag I'm just gonna call it that
guys I know of you I know the iota guys
are watching this right now let's just
call it dag please let's not add more
terminologies to this just for adoption
so block chains are sequential chains
where blocks are added in regular
intervals right but I Oda's data
structure the dag is able to achieve
high transaction throughput by parallel
parallelizing validation no transaction
fees occurs occur for any transaction as
it grows more participants make
transactions and the overall system
becomes more secure and faster with
confirmation times
transaction finality going down what
that means is as more nodes are added to
the network the network's transactions
actually get approved faster and that's
in direct contrast to the blockchain the
more nodes there are the slower the
transactions are approved right and the
longer it takes for a transaction to be
approved whereas in the block tag that
iota uses the more nodes there are the
faster the transactions are approved
which is a much more scalable
architecture and you might be wondering
why is this but I'm going to that in a
second
okay so it's still a distributed
database it's still a peer-to-peer
network it still relies on consensus and
a validation mechanism so those things
are all the same it's just a structure
that is different and the type of
consensus and validation mechanism
that's different - right and it scales
like I said it scales as blockchain
scale the usability goes down as I Oda's
dag scales the usability goes up so
here's the big difference here's big
difference number two there are two big
differences right so the first one is a
structure the second one is consensus so
there are no minors so people who want
to be minors too bad you can't be minors
that's okay this is a good thing for the
network here's why
so in so blotching consensus is achieved
by requiring multiple parties to race
against each other in an attempt to add
the next block to the blockchain and get
the block reward right so miners are
competing to mine the next block the
fastest using their computing power and
whoever is first to do it gets to mine
it and they get the reward but because
of this consensus is decoupled from
transaction generation you have this
whole separate group of nodes in the
Bitcoin network that are dedicated to
mining right and then all the
participants in the network that are not
miners all they do is just generate
transactions right I want to pay for
this I want to receive this I want to
pay for this I want to receive this and
because it's decoupled that leads to
further centralization right because the
these mining pools can occur but in iota
there is no decoupling the all the nodes
are miners in a way or they're not
miners here's how it works
so an iota every participant in the
network making a transaction
also actively participates in the
consensus here's how every time you make
a transaction you reference two
transactions directly and and in a way
other transactions in the sub dag
indirectly just by referencing two so
there are no blocks in the classical
sense instead a single transaction
references to past transactions right so
here's here's a here's the graph it
bundles all transactions in a directed
acyclic graph
it's self-regulating consensus no longer
decoupled to a set of minors and it's
very scalable with a low overhead proof
of work to prevent spam so check this
out the green blocks are transactions in
which consensus was achieved the red
blocks are transactions where we are
still uncertain on their full acceptance
and the gray blocks are unconfirmed
transactions ideally we want all of
these transactions to be green right so
from right to left or left to right
depending on how this works eventually
all the nodes will be verified if the
nodes pointing to it verify that it is
indeed a valid transaction and there are
no transaction fees because there are no
miners you when you make a transaction
you have to approve to other
transactions and then you have to
perform the proof-of-work algorithm so
in a way you get paid by not having to
pay a fee right so because you're
computing this proof of work which is
for civil resistance right because
you're computing that proof of work you
get to make a transaction without there
being a fee and that is your reward so
there are no transaction fees which is
awesome so instead of a smaller subset
of the network being responsible for the
overall consensus ie the miners the
entire network of active participants ie
the devices making the transactions are
directly involved in the approval of
those transactions and so consensus in
iota is no longer decoupled from the
transaction making process it's an
intrinsic part of it and that's what
lets it scale without any transaction
fees oh and one more thing
like I said before it's quantum it's
quantum resistant it's not success
susceptible to quantum attacks and why
is this well it uses an how
them call the winter knits one time
signature I can make an entire video on
how winter knits one time signatures
work I'm not gonna do that because it
would be too long but check out the link
right here in this Jupiter notebook
which is in the github by the way okay
so here's a little picture of it alright
okay so here okay so you might be
confused by this process of making a
transaction let me clarify it so it's a
three-step process it's a three-step
process so the first step like let's say
I want to pay you know I'm a machine I
want to pay this other machine or even
I'm a human you know I want to pay this
other human here's how it works
the first step is to sign the
transaction input with your private keys
what that means is you've got a unique
set of private keys that identify you as
a unique individual node in the network
when you sign a transaction that you are
hashing you're creating the hash of that
transaction using your private unique
unique 25 character key which means a
transaction will be both unique and
linked to you so you sign it with your
private key then step 2 is tip selection
right so tips are the what Iota calls
these unconformity the Monte it uses the
Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to
randomly select two tips these are
unconfirmed transactions which will be
referenced by your transaction and in
the code these are called the brand
transaction and the trunk transaction
right so once you've signed your
transaction you then point to two
unconfirmed transactions that you're
gonna have to approve before your
transaction is generated and validated
so that's that's what you're paying for
this and step three is to perform the
proof-of-work algorithm in order to have
your transaction accepted by the network
you need to do some proof of work
similar to Hashcash similar to Bitcoin
right and this is for civil resistance
right it's all about the computing power
right you don't want any of the nodes in
the network that gain control of the
network by having the majority of the
computing power and that's what
proof-of-work prevents because everyone
has to compute this you know random
mathematical problem a node would have
to have more computing power than the
rest of the an attacker would have to
have more computing power and then half
the network in order to double spend so
proof of work as for double spending tip
selection is computed using the Markov
chain
Carlo process I also have a video on how
this works it's a part of my
reinforcement learning series I could go
into a whole video on that but it's
called Monte Carlo prediction just
google that but in short this is a
probabilistic algorithm that samples
randomly using distributions so it's
some so Markov chain Monte Carlo methods
sample from a set of nodes randomly
using a distribution function okay so
once you've competed completed these
three three steps your transaction will
be broadcast to the network and someone
else will come along
choose your transaction in the tip
selection process and validate it and
just like that your transaction is
confirmed so that's why if the network
gets faster transactions get faster as
it network scales because the more
people there are in the network then the
faster your transaction will be
validated because there are more people
available to confirm your transaction
right so that's why it scales as there
are more people okay so I do want to say
one thing so there is this concept of
the coordinator right now in iota and so
the coordinator is is run by the iota
foundation the people who you know made
iota and the coordinator checkpoints
valid transactions which are then
validated by the entire network it
cannot go rogue as this coordinator is
being checked and validated by the
entire network but what this means is
first of all it's very hard to bootstrap
a blockchain right because you need it's
you need a certain amount of nodes there
for the computing power to be greater
than what an attacker would have right
in order to gain control the network
because bitcoin is so big as an as a
system the amount of computing power an
attack would need is way too big right
but when you're starting a blockchain
that relies on the proof of work
mechanism you got to have some kind of
system in place to prevent a bad actor
from taking over some sort of civil
resistance so the way the i/o the iota
Foundation has sought to prevent this is
by creating this coordinator that is run
by that so it's centralized yes it's a
centralized node
that validates transactions temporarily
they've been clear about this since the
beginning which I like and yeah it's
centralized that's a bad thing but it's
it's a temporary thing and I think that
I mean their goals and their their aims
and their white paper its
it all seems to be pointing in a
decentralized direction but it's a
temporary mechanism to validate
transactions at the start but eventually
they're not going to need it or want it
and it's gonna go away
so I just want to mention that okay so
use cases right so first is data
integrity right so there's this
mechanism to send messages secure
messages between different nodes in the
iota Network which allows for nodes to
communicate data right and because there
is this distributed ledger that there is
consensus on that is permissionless and
trustless you can you can ensure that
the data that is being passed between
these nodes is is valid and data
integrity is super useful for any kind
of Hospital Records or you know any kind
of secure records that we need to you
know government law legal you know
anything that needs a lot of security
this would be great in a trustless
permissionless systems supply chains
right importers exporters shipping
liners logistic companies right they're
all over the world they're global and
they need to sync up on data and you
know what the what the status is of you
know delivery and what the status is of
this and this and this and this and
that's a perfect use case for
distributed Ledger's like iota right and
I mean this this system was meant for
the Internet of Things right so and when
it comes to the Internet of Things we
are we need ways to share a bandwidth
computing power resources you know data
all sorts of these things and that is
what this would be good at or any kind
of grid as well solar grid micro grid
services electrical grid just anyways to
share resources that doesn't need a
human in the loop just automatic systems
that are trustless permissionless that
coordinate scarce resources amongst
groups of people this would be a great
use case right so it's key features are
infinite scalability
No Fee microtransactions and quantum
resistance three key features that would
be awesome to have so I mean the network
already has a hundred million in
transactions that have occurred without
fees
yes it's using a coordinator right now
eventually it doesn't need to or they
don't want it to be there and I think
it's pretty cool I mean the promise of
No Fee transactions and a network that
scales really well and gets better in
terms of the speed of transactions over
time that is a that is a promise that I
like okay and I want that to happen we
should want that to happen
iota is a proof of concept I mean
everything in this space is a proof of
concept Bitcoin is even a proof of
concept what what I mean by that is it
is not production ready yet nor is
Bitcoin even but I like where this is
going I mean these guys seem to have
know their stuff like they worked on
next which was this this first asset
transferring service that uses block
chains in 2010-2011 so they've been in
the space for a while and you know
they're they're pre mine was modest I
think something like 500k and all the
coins are are generated all of them that
can be created have been created so it's
I think it's a cool system and I want to
see more of it I want to see more
development of it more interest more
excitement because yeah we need no fee
we need no fee distributed ledger
services right that's how we're going to
really get this Internet of Things of
things that are communicating and
transmitting value at millions of
transactions per second faster than Visa
or is a magnitude faster than Visa screw
Visa we just go million times a second
okay
that's what we want to be and if we can
just bypass all of these issues that are
coming up as a Bitcoin blockchain scales
and use something like iota that would
be awesome so I think that yes there's
still some problems and they have a lot
of promises but if they can come through
with them and I think that they can that
would be awesome for everybody okay so
let's let's look at the code for a bit
so they've got this GUI client which is
really cool if you want to just the
easiest way to get started this would be
it it's built in JavaScript you can use
NPM to install it it's base
of the electron wallet and instructions
are here in this github repository one
more thing is the client library in
Python so the base library is in Java
but they've got client libraries and
Python and JavaScript and in C I think C
as well but it's all on their github
right here at iota ledger which you can
look at right here Java they've got the
command line app they've got an Android
wallet yeah they've got they've got a
lot of repositories here to play with in
some different languages but what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna just download this
and just run it just just cause so let
me download that and I'm going to open
in terminal let's see let me go right
into that folder okay so pip install
Toyota okay there we go
right sudo pip3 install Toyota all right
so I've got I owe to up and running I
have a full node running on my computer
and using once I have this node running
I've downloaded the Java client and then
I can use any of the Python or the
JavaScript CLI libraries to then you
know integrate this into a web app or a
mobile app or whatever kind of app I
want but it's a pretty lightweight
client and it's easy to integrate into a
web app or mobile app so you can use it
for you know having an online wallet or
whatever payment system or or any kind
of system you want to create the last
thing is how to buy iota so I found this
great tutorial on BitFenix calm which is
this website this is it's an online
exchange on how you can buy iota with
Bitcoin so it's a five step process but
first first step is to make sure your
funds are on the exchange wallet so they
have three dedicated wallets that you
could use and you can instantly move
your funds from one wallet to another on
the wallets page which is right here and
so you can go to the trading page and
choose the pair you want to trade and
then there's an order form and the
exchange tab you could click exchange
buy and then the order is going to
appear if you
you've got to have Bitcoin in order to
buy I owe to coin and if you want to buy
Bitcoin then I would suggest using coin
base as a the most reliable way to buy
them it'll require you can do this from
virtually any country I think at this
point but you link up your credit card
or debit card or bank account by Bitcoin
and then transfer that Bitcoin to a
wallet and then from that wallet by Iota
on BitFenix or there's a couple of
exchanges actually but I think bit
finnex is is the one to do please
subscribe for more programming videos
and for now I think I'm gonna go buy
some iota so thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
