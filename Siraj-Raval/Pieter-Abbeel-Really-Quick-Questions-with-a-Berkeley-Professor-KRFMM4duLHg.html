are you doing pretty good can I ask you
67 questions
sure what is the culture like at UC
Berkeley I think a very supportive
hard-working but fun culture will online
learning replace physical learning oh I
think it's starting to shift a lot in
that direction but personally we really
like to meet the people I'm learning
from what is something you miss about
where you grew up I'd say the food and
the food yeah what time do you wake up
8:20 what website you absolutely love to
spend time on let's see yeah I'd to
avoid spending too much time on any
websites say before she morning paper of
2017 I'm gonna pass on that it seems to
to Vicki to meet one person who would it
be
I mean one person who could it be
Roger Federer favorite car
I prefer my bike what's it like working
with physical robots it's it's been
really surprising how people connect so
strongly when they see physical robots
do things I never anticipated this when
bringing people by for the first time in
the lab bravest thing you've ever done
I'm not the one to take a lot of risks I
would say what is one thing that scares
you I like it there good care of my
health
I guess favorite movie Shawshank
Redemption do you play any instruments
no what's more interesting physics or
neuroscience
tough call but I've been more inclined
to study physics so far best present
you've ever received
no no what is something you do to relax
a lot of physical exercise running
tennis basketball cycling what is
something surprising about you
maybe that uh back in high school my
well my goal was was try to become a
professional basketball player rather
than a researcher you preferred cats or
dogs I prefer no pets in my house why do
you like reinforcement learning
specifically so much I think the beauty
of reinforcement learning is that it
kind of gets to what is kind of close to
what you think about when you build a
real intelligent system it's something
that has tries to achieve goals try to
learn things about the environments
never done before and I find out very
intriguing favorite project you used to
work on
I would say Stanford helicopter project
as a PhD student and I think a lot of it
was the big panes who went through to
get to the results which made it yet
more rewarding to get to them what
project are you currently working on a
lot of our work is so there's a few
things going on at Berkeley a lot of the
work is on reinforced learning imitation
learning metal learning
item bought intelligence are trying to
put this into practice and get real
robots in the real world to do these
things and then a great scope we're
trying to do now
AI for grading automatically grade your
homework and exams are largely
automatically grade them to let teachers
spend time on other things if you could
repeat one experience again what would
it be speed one experience again what
would it be
I'll pass on that for now why do you
think deep learning has gotten is so
popular recently
I think it's it's getting really good
results on problems that people just
weren't able to get the same results on
in computer vision speech recognition
learning to be able to play video games
learning to control robots problems have
seemed out of reach for a very long time
and now there's a real tangible progress
what's your favorite operating system
Mac OS for me do you play any sports
they play I tried to play a lot of
sports my favorite ones are tennis
basketball and running
what's one source you use to stay
up-to-date in machine learning
definitely archive is critical and then
news feeds like Kirk posses archive
sanity preserver and also on Twitter I
follow a lot of people that post their
papers and Twitter
what's one ml researcher you follow on
Twitter Jeff Dean
programming language of choice for
machine learning I should admit that as
a professor I don't write a lot of code
so it's mostly my students who who write
the code so I don't really have a
preference here favorite professor very
professor no I'll go with my PhD advisor
Andrey
why do you think programming is fun
I think program is fun because in a very
short amount of time you can do very
powerful things compared to any other
engineering discipline where typically
it takes days weeks months to build
something and programming you can build
something in an hour that actually does
something last person you talk to on the
phone
not sure yeah you get an
all-expenses-paid trip to one country
where you go
that's trail yeah I think you live on
Mars depends on who comes along with me
what's one thing you can't live without
exercise what is one skill you wish you
had
I always have time to polish more
programming skills which I'm not finding
time for anymore
what is the lot what is usually the last
thing you do before bed I do a few
dedicated stretches and breathing
exercises that get me into sleeping mode
what text editor do you use I use
sublime sublime what open source library
do you really like
I personally don't use them myself but I
know my group benefits a lot from
tensorflow and pi torch what was a hard
problem your team recently solved I so
super recently those results are not
public yet but there'll be a couple
papers coming out that'll be I'm very
excited about of things that are already
public I would say the one shot visual
limitation were work led by Chelsea Finn
we were able to learn from videos of
humans showing how to do something
rather than from telly operating robots
and the robot can learn from that what's
the goal for embodied AR our goal is our
long-term goal is essentially make
physical goods as readily available and
as cheaply available as digital goods by
making manufacturing and logistics
extremely extremely streamlined best
advice you've ever received let's see
maybe not maybe I wouldn't say explicit
advice but I think maybe what I hold the
closest to my heart is uh what I've seen
from being an Turing's PhD students is
how kindness is always in everything
he's doing and how you know that is just
a really important value no matter you
know what you're trying to achieve
what's one piece of advice you'd give
yourself 20 years ago
that's all
pretty happy without that how things
have gone I don't think I would give
myself any other advice and I think no
I'm not saying I went down the shortest
path and everything but I think
sometimes going down a path that ends
and having to restart is not a bad thing
you spend more time on the internet or
real life I spend most of my time behind
a computer and as a way to essentially
communicate about research with my
collaborators what's something you've
learned in the past month
I would say well in the last month is
that I have not found any time to read
any papers and I need to change that if
you ran the world what if one law you
didn't act immediately if I were to rule
the world is that what you said
wow what a hypothetical um I think it's
really complicated to put things in
place with that I think you know if just
in general people if I could somehow
find a way for people to be more kind of
just generally kind and everything they
do I think a lot of problems would be
resolved is the singularity near it's
not sure what's near but I guess given
we started in bodies intelligence with
things are still you know a lot to be
done with regular AI before the
singularity will take over if you were
to start from scratch today what is a
learning resource you would use to learn
machine learning
yeah so it's a couple of things I would
use I would look at the faster they eye
to learn a few things from there I would
look at enterings deployment of the eye
course I would look at under Carpathia's
deplaning course and then I would look
at the deeper l bootcamp that we built
last summer and also Sergei Elevens deep
reinforced learning course and all of
those are available online so anybody
can start working with those favorite
subject in school when you were growing
up physics if you could be a superhero
who would it be
I guess I if I could be a superhero I'm
not too familiar with most superhero so
maybe I'll pick a real world person I'd
like to be somebody who really makes a
lot of difference so I think the way
Elon Musk is tackling things like
climate change bottom-up by building
companies that could really make a
change I find that really inspiring
what's your spirit animal koalas what do
you predict comes next after the deep
learning hype
I think we've seen with deep learning is
at the essence leverage the things that
are today available that you didn't have
before more data more compute and so I
see a trend where we'll continue to have
more data more compute so if anything
comes about that can leverage even
better more data more compute maybe
meta-learning if you consider it
separate from deep learning but I think
it's part of it but anything that really
leveraged the latest resources that are
available five more questions coffee or
tea tea summer or winter summer Google
home or Amazon Alexa I was such both of
them all Chrome or Safari Chrome WWDC or
Google IO
none of them are the right or right for
me nips and I clear awesome
alright Peter that's it for my questions
thanks so much for answering those sure
thanks are we good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
