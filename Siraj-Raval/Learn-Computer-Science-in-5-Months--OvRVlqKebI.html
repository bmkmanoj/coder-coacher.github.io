to learn computer science in five months
crazy right
I know welcome to my world traditional
universities tend to offer ACS major
that gives students a path to go from no
programming experience to having a broad
understanding of the many disciplines at
the field of computer science
encompasses in this video I'm gonna give
you my condensed version of a computer
science major one that will take you
five months to finish this is the kind
of study plan I create for myself if I
wanted to not only learn how to code but
to have a basic understanding of the
most important areas of computer science
all the resources I'm going to list here
are free and available on the internet
and if you want to stay up to date with
my educational content don't forget to
hit the subscribe button
before we start remember you should
speed up the time it takes to complete
the courses I list by speeding up videos
dedicating two to three hours a day to
this doing only one project per course
at the end of the week and handwriting
notes as you go for memory retention oh
and remember to follow some notable
computer scientists while you learn that
all lists here so you can stay up to
date in this field we're going to start
our journey by learning the Python
programming language Python is an
interpreted object-oriented high-level
programming language with dynamic
semantics WTF right I know lots of
jargon to take in let's start with a
learning resource that requires no
knowledge of CS jargon there's a great
free book online called automate the
boring stuff with Python it's a
practical guide to programming for total
beginners it shows you how to do some
basic tasks like sending reminder emails
moving files and formatting data using
the Python language spend the first week
reading this book it's 18 chapters long
so if you split it up into three or four
chapters a day you'll finish it by the
end of the week this book has a bunch of
exercises in it that you can execute
from terminal on whatever kind of
operating system you're
using if you need help installing Python
on your machine definitely check out
Python org for details on how to do that
in the second week of learning Python
I'd recommend taking the code Academy
course on Python it's got this really
fun interactive console in your web
browser so you can get instant feedback
on your code and whether it compiles
correctly it's gotten really popular
with beginners over the years and
they've got a bunch of other cool
courses you can check out later two
weeks in total should be a good amount
of time to get the basics of Python down
yes the applications you'll be building
in these first two weeks aren't
world-changing but understanding the
syntax of the language the keywords how
often they're used and why they're used
are crucial to help you get to the next
step building and understanding data
structures I remember when I was a
computer science freshman at Columbia
one of the mantras that everyone would
tell me was that data structures and
algorithms are the most important
subjects you'll ever take for your major
and at the time it seemed ludicrous how
could that be more important than say
learning something much more exciting
like robotics or computer vision well it
turns out they were right being able to
build cool things for the endless
applications of computer science
requires you to understand how to
properly store data and manipulate it to
accomplish your task EDX has a great
course on data structures taught by UC
San Diego that will show you how all the
various data structures from binary
trees to linked lists work with
implementations in Python after that you
want to move into algorithms perhaps the
best course for this that uses Python as
its base language is the intro to
algorithms course by MIT you can find
all the lectures associated notes and
problem sets in one place on their
website you'll notice when it comes to
data structures and algorithms that once
you start building and understanding a
couple of them everything starts to make
sense you start to understand the
trade-offs you'll have to make when it
comes to
data and storing it properly and when
you start thinking of applications
you'll be able to tell what types of
data structures and algorithms you'll
need to accomplish the task on to the
next one whether you're building a web
app or a mobile app or even just working
with data in general it's important to
understand how databases work sequel is
the most popular standard language for
databases and Coursera has this course
called databases with Python that will
help you understand that easily you can
go ahead and skip the first week of this
course since you've already covered the
learning Python bit and head straight
into the rest of it for the next week
we'll take a short break from Python to
focus on networking before you start
building apps that use the Internet
you've got to understand how this
internet this nervous system for
Humanity that actually allows us to
communicate instantly and globally works
Coursera has got a course that was
created by Google cleverly called the
bits and bytes of computer networking
you'll learn how the Internet Protocol
suite works and finally understand what
happens under the hood when you type a
website into the URL bar and hit enter
after you've done this you're ready to
dive into the world of web and mobile
programming I'm a big fan of the
computer science professor David Malan
at Harvard he's got a really charming
enthusiasm about him that keeps you
engaged the best course for this is
Harvard's cs50 web programming with
Python and JavaScript yes we've only
covered Python so far but it's necessary
to understand JavaScript the language of
the web as well you can find the videos
in a simple YouTube playlist and he'll
show you how you can combine some of the
most important technologies of web
programming together to create elegant
web apps that anybody can access from a
web browser spend the next week building
a single web app that really excites you
but it's also doable in a single week
don't get too ambitious else you won't
be able to finish it and you'll get
discouraged there are some great
examples on github that can serve as
operation and it'll give you practice
using Stack Overflow one of the most
important tools for programmers for
quick and easy explanations for how and
why to use certain programming
techniques when it comes to mobile
development you've got two options
iOS and Android spend the first week
building an iOS app and the second week
building an Android app that way you can
see the difference between both and
realize which type of programming
environment you prefer and build the
same app in both environments to really
see where the differences are build
something really simple it'll be a
challenge to even get a simple app set
up because you first got to install the
dependencies and learn how the
respective IDE s work like Xcode and
Android studio now that we've got the
fundamental stuff out of the way let's
move on to the funner stuff data science
is the art of making discoveries from
data usually this is done using
statistical analysis and machine
learning methods EDX has a course called
Python for data size taught by UCSD that
would be a great way to jump into this
field
it's especially long so spread this one
out to two weeks it'll help put your
Python knowledge to immediate use and
you'll get familiar with popular Python
libraries for data science like pandas
and numpy after this you'll have just a
bit of knowledge of machine learning
which contains so many different
disciplines in and of itself it'll take
you a while to really learn all of it
but a great way to dive into this field
is to pick applied fields of ml like
natural language processing and computer
vision and study those dedicate a single
week to each course arrows got a great
course on NLP and Udacity has a course
on computer vision taught by Georgia
Tech one thing to remember is that it's
not just enough to know how to program
you need to know how to program in a
team that's why you should dedicate the
next week to learning the software
development process Coursera has a
course called software development
processes and methodologies that covers
all the different team
techniques for working on code with
other people if you want to work at a
company be it Google or the smallest
startup it's essential to know this
stuff for the last week of this
curriculum you should get a broad
overview of the cryptocurrency
blockchain space because it's so hot
right now
not because it's the most advanced topic
to tackle but because it's a very
current topic and a hot one at that i've
got a great cryptocurrency playlist for
you on youtube that you should check out
I hope my curriculum is helpful to you
you'll find all the links necessary down
below please subscribe for more
programming videos and for now I've got
to learn how to learn so thanks for
