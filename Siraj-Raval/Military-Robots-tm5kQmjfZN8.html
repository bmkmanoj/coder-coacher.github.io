gonna learn a bit about how military
robots work and then teach a simulated
robot how to walk using a reinforcement
learning technique called proximal
policy optimization military warfare is
as old as mankind and the better the
technology the more likely the chance of
winning is so it makes sense that
militaries want the most advanced
weaponry they can get their hands on by
whatever means necessary
ideally militaries can minimize deaths
of their own soldiers while maximizing
their effectiveness that means removing
the human from the loop as much as
possible which is where the field of
military robotics comes in the first
wheel advances their team from none
other than electrical wizard Nikola
Tesla in 1898 Tesla demoed a controlled
motor boat to a government
representative it laid the foundation
for the first unmanned vehicles and
weapons as World War 1 began Germany
used radio-controlled motor boats to ram
into enemy ships containing more than
300 pounds of explosives during both
world wars inspired by Tesla's initial
invention using radio waves as a
communication signal was a revolutionary
idea the Germans use it to deploy the
first remotely piloted aerial drone
called the fritz they dropped a device
at a high altitude from a bomber then
Bombardier would steer the fritz via a
radio link using a joystick and it
wasn't just the Germans getting in on
the radio-controlled fun Americans
dropped more than 450 radio
remote-controlled glide bombs during
World War two remote-controlled vehicles
on land air and sea have improved in the
decades since World War two as more than
40 countries have developed
technological breakthroughs in that
regard there are three important trends
happening right now that are causing
rapid advancement in military technology
namely the plummeting costs and soaring
performance of computer hardware the
rise of cloud network robots and of
course advances in machine learning
put together these trends mean it's
getting easier to create more powerful
robots soldiers no longer need to aim at
targets if they can just use a
convolutional network to detect enemy's
commnets our neural networks that can
learn the features of any type of object
its trained on be that a certain type of
vehicle or a type of soldier using a pre
trained network soldiers can Don a set
of goggles that show a computed bounding
box around our targets or even feed the
computed coordinate to a weapon and have
its position adjusted accordingly and
fire automatically effectively using
auto aim reinforcement learning has been
an effective tool to get robots to learn
how to navigate virtual environments
some soldiers go through extensive
simulated training before being deployed
to the real world and an RL agent could
prove useful as an unpredictable and
adaptive enemy during combat simulation
for a range of soldiers from fighter
pilots to ground soldiers these agents
could use techniques like q-learning or
policy gradients or actor critic to
learn how best to avoid enemy fire and
even create effective strategies to
confuse the enemy before attacking AI
can also be used to change the medium
with which soldiers control their
weapons they can issue orders via voice
command instead of having to use a
keyboard in intense situations
thanks to developments in natural
language processing speech recognition
is getting really good and recurrent
networks helped make this possible if we
have some labeled audio data set we can
train a recurrent Network by slicing the
audio up into small chunks feeding those
chunks into the RNN sequentially and
generating a prediction for the next
chunk computing an error back propagated
the error gradients and repeating that
process lots of times since we're
current networks are made for sequential
data audio is a perfect use case after
training they can recognize human speech
with incredible accuracy and this
essential for mission-critical
applications governments have mountains
of data from surveillance systems and
satellites of all kinds finding
disturbances using unsupervised learning
techniques like anomaly detection via
auto-encoders war doesn't just have to
happen in real life it can happen online
as well today the process of finding and
countering bugs hacks and all sorts of
cyber infection vectors is still
effectively artisinal
professional security experts search
millions of lines of code to find and
fix vulnerabilities that could be taken
advantage of by users with ulterior
motives all of this could be automated
using deep learning to find the features
of vulnerable code and learning to patch
bugs by itself so rule-based
intelligence can only do so much but by
integrating learning algorithms machines
can become far more capable when a human
is in the loop they are able to make the
final call the highest level decision
that's the one that the human makes but
as AI gets better its able to make more
decisions for itself so how many
decisions should we delegate to AI how
much is too much take the idea of a
swarm for example any aircraft manned or
unmanned can be brought down by a single
missile but a swarm can take multiple
hits and keep going it's a collection of
drones that can coordinate together as a
single entity one could take out enemy
systems while the other creates a
distraction while the other picks up
important cargo evolutionary techniques
like particle swarm optimization can
make this happen the US Department of
Defense recently released a document
called a human systems roadmap review
that reveals a plan to use AI to create
autonomous weapons using social media
analytics to make decisions on lethal
force with minimal human involvement it
shows that while having a human in the
loop is necessary for the near-term
therefore turn vision is self-aware
systems they define this as systems that
have perception reasoning and
intelligence
allowing for entities to have existence
intent relationships and understanding
in the battle space relative to a
mission that means drones that
coordinate amongst themselves make
decisions for themselves prioritize by
themselves and of course decide who to
kill and when to kill them by themselves
that's kind of scary and reminiscent of
the infamous Skynet system from the
movie Terminator in the movie the
military system becomes self-aware and
decides to kill all humans and no one
can shut it down we know of one system
that can't be shut down and that's
Bitcoin because the blockchain miners
must verify transactions using the
proof-of-work algorithm it would require
more computing power than the 500
fastest supercomputers in the world
combined to shut it down and no one has
that much computing power an AI agent
that lives on this kind of blockchain
couldn't be shut down and if its
objective was to say destroy humanity
and it has access to weapons of mass
destruction
that's how Skynet happens IRL so how do
we stop this we've got to spread
awareness and educate ourselves on how
AI works the more people that understand
the power of AI the less likely it is
that governments will abuse this power
and the more likely it will be used for
beneficial purposes more research into
creating explainable AI systems that
give us a detailed list of why an AI
made a certain decision will help
unravel the black box of deep learning
and help fuel a debate for policy makers
as they regulate this technology so to
give an example of how a robot can learn
to walk we can use a reinforcement
learning technique called proximal
policy optimization this is two randomly
initialized neural networks and a
teacher that rewards forward progress
the policy gradient technique takes
steps in the direction that improves the
policy a similar technique is called
trust region policy optimization or TRP
Oh
the idea is to take steps in the
direction that improves the policy while
simultaneously not straying too far from
the old policy that's the difference
making too big a change from the
previous policy in high dimensional
environments can lead to a dramatic
decrease in performance a little forward
lean can help running speed but too much
causes a crash a naive solution is to
take minuscule policy steps but the
question then becomes how small a step
TR Pio takes a principled approach to
controlling the rate of policy change
the algorithm places our constraint on
the average KL divergence between the
new and old policy after each update so
proximal policy optimization is an
implementation of TR Pio that adds the
KL divergence term to training a loss
function with this loss function in
place we can train the policy with
gradient descent like a typical neural
network in our PPO algorithm we capture
sequences of states actions and rewards
from our environment and added to our
data batch line 10 adds value estimates
to each visited state from the rollouts
with predicted state values in hand we
calculate the advantages and add these
to the data set in line 11 the advantage
of a state action is how much better or
worse an action performs than the
expectation of present policy from the
same state we update the policy in line
13 finally we update our value function
to reflect our latest data in 114 we use
the present data batch and the previous
data batch to smooth changes in the
value function for our policy update
function we store the old policy and
compute the KL divergence as we make
policy gradient updates and after only
25,000 training episodes our humanoid
will start learning how to walk it's
pretty hilarious to watch the progress
in the meantime all right so three
ending points here militaries can use AI
to create autonomous weapon systems and
that means less and less of a need for
humans in the loop a Skynet's like
scenario can occur
the public isn't made aware of AI
dangers and governments go unchecked and
proximal policy optimization uses two
neural nets and the teacher to forward
progress to train an AI to complete an
objective this week's coding challenge
is to use the PPO technique on a game of
your choice details are in the readme
poster github links in the comments
section and winners will be announced
next week please subscribe for more
programming videos and for now I've got
to go prevent Skynet so thanks for
