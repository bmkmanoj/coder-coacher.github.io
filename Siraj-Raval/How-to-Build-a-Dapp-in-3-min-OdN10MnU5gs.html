be building a decentralized app or dap
in three minutes
let's get started for this video we're
going to be using embark which is an
awesome javascript framework for
building decentralized applications it's
integrating aetherium and ipfs to start
off we want to go ahead and install it
using NPM which is the node package
manager once we have it installed we can
go ahead and look in our bash RC and
make sure that we've linked it properly
once we're sure we've linked it we can
source our bash and run embark new test
that's going to create a new embark app
just like you would generate a django
app or rails app then we can go ahead
and run our blockchain the blockchain
runs on a theory so what we're part of
the etherium network when we run our app
then we can go ahead and type in embark
run we're just going to run our app on
our localhost just like a django app or
rails app at port 8000 there it is
there's our app now let's go ahead and
see what it's like it's just a skeleton
file
we've got contracts CSS HTML j/s
standard things the contracts is that is
the interesting bit all the front-end
logic of your code works just like in a
regular web it's the back end that is
different so let's go ahead and create
our first smart contract we'll call it
simple storage Sol which stands for
solidity the language of a theory
contracts this contract is going to do a
simple thing it's going to get and set
an integer in our blockchain the great
thing about smart contracts as opposed
to other types of contracts is it's
decentralized they're trustless you can
have dynamic code that you would deploy
to say Heroku that lives on a
decentralized network all nodes have to
verify that this code did indeed run the
intended output that's all it's going to
do and in our CSS 15 pixels for our
margin and then for our HTML page we'll
want to construct something more than
the standard welcome to embark and a get
button for it as well so once we have
our HTML we want to make sure that our
JavaScript works as well so let's go
ahead and create our index CAS file in
our index dot JSP file we want three
functions that run off of the Dom
whenever the user inputs a text we use
simple storage on set and then use the
value as a parameter the same thing
forget and we append it to the log what
just happened in our contract set yml we
want to make sure that we're running the
contract that we've just created so
we'll say simple storage and the
argument will be however much we want
to send as a currency transfer in the
staff in this case it'll be 100 now you
can use this for other things like you
know sending someone a picture on a
social network or or some kind of
financial app or gambling or poker
anything that involves any kind of
currency or data we want to pay people
for or receive for that's when a smart
contract would come into play an embark
will easily allow you to deploy your
adapt to IP FS by just typing in embark
ipfs so we can get in set the value
right here in HTML and you can see it's
creating transactions in the blockchain
that's it Congrats we got our first app
up and running so think of a theorem as
a decentralized Heroku and ipfs as a
decentralized database you can utilize
both for your DAP for more information
on decentralized apps please check out
