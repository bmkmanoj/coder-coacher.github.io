about the brains this is the really
exciting part this is where the full
capability of Microsoft as a company all
comes together the engineers on our team
get to work with top leading experts
around the world in Microsoft research
in fields such as computer vision
machine learning speech recognition
facial recognition digital signal
processing and we harness all that
creative energy and innovation combine
it with the production engineering
know-how on our team and combine it into
the platform that what you're about to
see today I'll point out the anatomical
correctness his hips are in the correct
location he has a multiple spine joints
he has true shoulders and collarbones
multiple joints in his head and neck
so he can bend over he can bend forward
he can move his head shrug his shoulders
so you know we're connected the first
version was really about understanding
gross human motion we have true human
understanding here infidelity of
expression as he moves around
another key advancement I'd like to
point out is the new joints we've added
in the hands
we have joints that represent tip of
hand and the thumb so as Scott is
opening and closing his hands you can
see it being represented on screen the
skeleton is a great representation of
the various bones and how they're
connected together but we took it a step
further and started with orientation now
this is block-man as a team calls him
and what block-man represents is the
actual orientation of Scott's body as
he's moving in 3d space as he rotates
his hands in his arms and his legs you
can see that block man is you know very
accurately depicting what he's doing so
we're kind of getting beyond the joints
we have the actual rotations that his
joints are experiencing you can even
draw small nose circles in the air and
we can see his head rotating on
block-man in line with what it is that
Scott's doing now I'm a pretty tall guy
I'm six foot four and my skeleton only
weighs eight pounds if you really want
to understand what's going on with the
human you need to understand and
describe what's going on with the
muscles the forces the torques so that's
our intro into muscle man so muscle man
is a real-time human based physics model
applied on top of our next-generation
skeleton and our high-resolution depth
map but what the colors represent is
green equals no force and then the
highest intensity red is the
rgeous level of force as you see as
Scott kind of shifts his weight between
one leg and the next as he lifts a foot
you can see the red disk representing
the greater force you know on the floor
being exerted you can see changes in his
core and his legs if I can get Scott to
do a little bit of a squat for me all
right go ahead and hold it like he's
feeling it in his legs and you can see
it on the screen you know normally I
make him do that for a long time but
I'll go easy on him today if we get
Scott to jump up in the air as high as
he can you'll see that his body goes all
green you know when you're in the air
obviously there's no force being felt
and when he hits the ground you can see
those red impact points you know beyond
just understanding the forces in his
muscles were able to estimate you know
mass and velocity in the force of
something like a punch give me a little
jab as you can see the nice little white
circles that represent how much he's
exerting now really put your back into
and shift your weight so look at the
size of that circle so we're you know
accurately calculating how much force
he's exerting you can see the weight
shifting from his bat leg to his front
you can see his core tightening up and
you can see the representation on screen
so you know with these three things
combined you have a fantastic
understanding of what's happening with
the human body but as any good trainer
will tell you this information is
necessary but it's not enough you need
one more thing you need heartrate so
what we have here is a real-time
technology that is actually detecting
the pulse in Scotts face we're using our
high-definition color feed and our
active IR feed to look for subtle
variations in both color and intensity
in the skin of his face
they're imperceptible to the human eye
but you know our Kinect sensor and the
Xbox one hardware is able to pick it up
we're literally reading the pulse in his
face pretty amazing stuff you know
fantastic for exercise scenarios or for
measuring exertion lots of possibilities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
