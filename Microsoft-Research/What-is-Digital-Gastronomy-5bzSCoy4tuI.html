so now please welcome Marcello culo all
right thanks can you guys hear me well
this is good I tend to mumble a lot if I
start mumbling just like raise your hand
and be like I can't understand what
you're saying at all and I'll say it
again up louder okay again good this is
better okay cool thanks for inviting me
this is being really great I feel I feel
like this is a very different crowd
wherever this crowd is in the crowd that
I normally am around of and I've been
learning a lot from every but it was
being pretty exciting so I'm going to
talk a little bit about some of the work
that I've done the last I think three
years at the Media Lab i'm a designer by
training and I've just recently
completed my PhD at MIT Media Lab and my
research was at the sort of intersection
of human-computer interaction and
materials and by doing my work I kind of
stumbled I won't pointing to food
instead exploring that a sort of tangent
of all I was doing and i'll show you
some of the stuff and some of the ideas
i have come out over the years on this
stuff and feel free to jump in and ask
and comment and let's talk about it so
just to give you a little bit of
background of where i'm coming from so
so i'm a designer we've been designing
stuff for ages and computers I've
changed design a lot I love this image
on the left or the left up here of a
designer this is a an airplane designer
and back in the day people would
actually climb up with us on the stables
and get this big rulers and get pans and
pencils and draw and use your whole body
so this is kind of really sort of
physical experience that they you engage
your whole body in you're designing your
kind of touching things and so on and
today the way that I design is like this
you sit in front of the computer any you
do circuit boards and you do enclosures
and you write software everything using
a keyboard and a mouse it's a very
different kind of experience and
particularly what's happening now is
that it's not just a design but it's
also the making of the stuff after you
make this mod
then they go to 3d printing machines or
milling machines and they get made on
the go like in one shot without anybody
actually touching apart so and if you
start tracing that into like a potential
future where what's designed going to be
into the future a lot of people start
talking about 3d printing started taking
over a design right like in the future
you're going to be able to just send
whatever term machine press the button
and it's kind of print it and make it
and especially being at MIT Media Lab
like I think in the last like maybe four
years that there has been a lot of work
at the lab at making very very cheap 3d
printers and 3d milling machines like
students are making them for like 300
bucks so everybody basically has one
other to ask if they want to have one
and seeing that happening sir I think
you know this is really interesting but
not everybody designs like if i look at
my parents for instance they never make
anything ever like they're never like
the don't draw they don't build anything
at all so i could never imagine them
having a 3d printer because for them
would be something not very useful but
what I did realize thinking about is
that my parents cook they make stuff and
most everybody does and if you even if
you don't have done it once or you have
done and you hate it but it's something
that everybody sort of engaged with and
I thought that dude there's something
really interesting there as cooking is a
kind of design activity where this
information computers could come in and
provide new opportunities for creation
so I spent a lot of time looking at like
the history of cooking and food and I'm
going to library and learning about it
basically because it didn't know
anything about it and one thing that
became really clear to me is that the
kitchen hadn't changed much like so this
is a foot of a kitchen the 20s and one
very recently like a book like a year
ago two years ago man really like the
only kind of difference is like a
microwave you know this is a faster oven
like all this sort of revolution that
we've seen in computers at any design
hasn't really gone into the kitchen yet
and to me that's really strange so a
colleague of mine mid sir Owen and I we
started thinking about okay what happens
if you combine computers and cooking
what happens if you bring this
information to the kitchen what's going
to happen so he came up with the Sturm
called digital gastronomy
and for us it basically means this
convergence know when you get digital
information you combine with food what
do you get and not only just thinking
about creation but also think about like
production and like distribution of food
and trying to learn more about your
eating and when you're eating and so on
so I have a bunch of examples on the
stock of like things that have we've
kind of like dug out who found through a
research and then some of the concept
designs have created to explore these
ideas and then some prototypes that have
done in the end so this is like one of
my favorite examples this is the
Honeywell computer this is actually the
first personal computer ever it was done
in 69 and it was a computer for storing
recipes which at the time was the sort
of major kind of body of information on
the home I you need to manage all this
recipes and computer was good machine to
do that and this one is particularly
cool because it looks cool but it also
has a cutting board that comes kind of
upfront and you can cut vegetables as
you kind of move switches and pull our
recipes and story recipes the interface
for this computer is terrible right
because it switches and like little LEDs
for going through recipes and it was a
total flop and ever worked out and
eventually disappear Ian this is the
first example of actual food three
prints that I've found this is a machine
the so Griffith has made this is
actually the center for bits and atoms
at MIT and what it does is has a little
funnel where you can throw some
chocolate in and it melts and comes out
into this little bad that's moving right
underneath it and I think I'm bad
example on the video it's saying like
Lego or something
this is another example that I really
like is kind of a combination of
typography with food it's something that
David small did where he actually wrote
this is different like like poems and
stories and vegetables and image as well
I think this is for a magazine cover for
Martha Stewart in the 90s there's
another interesting example that I like
is actually looking at eating this is a
project of the front of minded sujeet
where he put an accelerometer and a
microcontroller on a fork and he was
trying to measure how fast you eat today
for eating too fast the forked vibrating
tell you the kind of slow down or eating
too fast it's not good for your health
and I think actually this ear a product
like that came out on CES so the extras
like we're trying to say this stuff come
onto the market they were experimenting
with different ways of bringing
information to this sort of cooking and
eating experience there's another
example that I really like to it's a at
the Media Lab a lot of what we do is
like come up with kits and tools for for
design and fabrication for assembling
for making things and this is called the
kick it's a little part geometry that
allows you to stack parts and different
different orientations and somebody
Jana's Wong has made one out of cookie
so she made some cookies she kind of lay
down flat sheet and then she cut out
with a laser cutter so you could
actually assemble this edible structures
in a this is actually part of my
favorite example it really shows you
it's a photoshop for cooking it's like
it's a video somebody made my and you
really gives you a sense of like the gap
that we have between the technologist
for like manipulating image today and
the technology we have for cooking
you
um I love this video watch it a million
times dude so so so seeing all this
stuff we decided to step back a little
bit and be okay so if we're going to
bring these to information and
fabrication and this kind of digital
machines that control matures into
cooking what should i do what should
they be like and we but we started
thinking about concept designs we broke
those down into three kind of big areas
one is transformation they did like
getting ingredients in transforming them
into from one thing to another you can
think of baking for instance where you
make something you chemically transform
something and it's not reversible
modeling actually thinking about shapes
you know how do you give shape to
ingredients and give them a form and
then combination mixing different things
together and we get chocolate and
strawberry put them together you have a
mix and that tastes different than just
the two things individually separate and
it's also important to mention a little
bit like the kind of idea of doing
concept designs like like like the way
that the way that I work as a design is
I come up with stuff sometimes it's
completely crazy and outrageous that
doesn't make any sense and by working
through concept designs you sort of
think about without constraints you say
K hey what did this thing be like if I
could make it you design it and then you
actually realize you can make it or you
realize the parts you can't make and
that gives you really interesting
opportunities for research and
experimentation so here is some of the
examples of like concept designs that we
came up for this so this is one is a
robotic chef the basic idea is that you
could put something in this machined
already exists so banana or steak or or
whatever you want to put in there the
machine does different things at the
bottom of it there would be like a
heating pad they could warm up your
steak or cook it in some way at the top
there their drills it could maybe like
cut out parts of it or put little hose
and there's also that getting jection of
sorts for spices so you could imagine
this thing kind of perforating it and
that in different kinds of flavors
throughout whatever you're eating and
what's interesting about digital you
probably can't disability
this by hand of course you can but when
we started doing things digitally you
get the things they get in Photoshop for
instance right that you don't get when
you're doing something by hand right he
could apply a blur filter just something
or you could say look at this with a
Cameron replace everything that's this
call it for this other thing so you
started doing as much more automated
things or you could say start with
something that salty and at the end of
this cake make it sweet or the other way
around and that to me is really
interesting and then for modeling we
thought of as a digital fabricator so if
you like a like a fuse deposition
machine and you could imagine the top of
this machine there's they're a bunch of
like containers you can put different
ingredients in there maybe there's
something buy at the store maybe
somebody plant in your garden put into
the tube and put in your machine and the
machine can deposit different
ingredients and assemble whatever you
want to eat in this little chamber for
me interface is kind of a huge deal and
it's one of the most important part
about technology it's like how do you
access this functionalities and how do
you control it so really trying to think
about what an interface for a mission
like that should be like so like we've
got to be able to like stop at halfway
right if you want to taste and see what
it's like you got to be able to do
parametric like replacement so let's say
I'm a vegetarian so I want to eat this
last thing about I don't want to eat the
meat so maybe can I replace or something
else there's a machine like this should
all be able to allow you to do things
like that and at the inside of this
machine could have something like this
we have sort of an extruding nozzle this
ingredients can be piped into it and
also having ways of heating and cooling
things with certain level precision so
you can cook them as you assemble things
and finally we came up with this idea of
this kind of virtual is a mixture
machine because we're like okay I can I
can design something in this 3d printer
but i'm not going to sure what how it's
going to taste okay maybe i need a way
to experiment with taste or flavor sorry
and once I know what something tastes
like then I can put it into the Machine
and give it a form so then the idea of
this machine is I would have this sort
of like layered tears of ingredients and
the top would have ingredients of the
middle level you'd have a mixture and at
the bottom do you have deposited and you
could do something like well let's say
I want to have a cake that has I don't
know we start with like ten percent
strawberry and ninety percent chocolate
and give me every variation of it up to
the other way around you have like ten
percent chocolate nine percent
strawberry so you could find a specific
flavor that you like within that simple
range and then put that into the other
machines which means all right so after
doing this crazy designs I was like okay
what is doable here what is actually
practical what can we build so he
started prototyping some of the stuff so
this is a little prototype for a machine
that makes chocolate and nuts on the
left you have a chocolate extruder on
the right you have a little born at
extruder or shoot dispenser at the
bottom we have a little cooler so the
machine it goes through the sort of
swivel motion to deposit this two
materials and cool them down into a
candy this is the cooling element it's a
pill ta junction with a fan and here's
basically how it works on the left you
have I'm selecting how much of each
ingredient I want so it's like a little
bit more nuts a little bit more
chocolate and as I do that this little
candy gets a symbol and it tells me at
the calories are and I once you do that
then the mission goes to the process of
moving around and extruding it and in
this video is that I think was like this
it was already running for like half of
the day and it turned out to the valve
for it like was a luer lock valve had
already clogged from the chocolate from
friction so it turned out that through
this prototype I realized the most
difficult part is creating this
extrusion mechanisms that can handle
different ingredients so if anybody
knows anybody he's really good at that
tell them to contact me I'm not a
mechanical engineer but it turned out
actually that the stuff tasted really
good and I was surprised and people
really liked it and there's something
really magical about being able to
design something that way and have it
come out the way you wanted and and the
other part that I want to mention before
I from over is a cooking for me the
important part of it is a social part is
like be able to cook with people being
able to eat with people and there's this
huge disconnect for me between the
things that I do socially online right
now and cooking I can't do any of this
if a can't like do Facebook or Twitter
with food with my friends and I think
missions like that will allow you to do
that you know to create a rest if you
send the just somebody they could rate
it they could send it back to you could
replace something you could share I
think there's a really exciting area
that seems to completely unexplored to
me this is like at the latest version of
the prototype before my advisor told me
to stop work and this and focus on my
real research oh I was trying different
ingredients and this one has two
different kinds of chocolate chocolate
into different kinds of nuts and i think
the magic of the stuff is eventually in
the integration of these machines and
combining all these different properties
and the last slide that i think is
important to think about is what are the
challenges in really doing this and
really at getting food and bringing it
closer to information to these two
information computers and I think there
are four things one is quantification
how do you sample food how do you how do
you digitize its property so you can
manipulate and control it the other one
is transmission how do you send this
information about food to other machines
to people what are the error correction
schemes you know what are the protocols
for food we don't have any of this stuff
and then mature manipulation as i
mentioned like how do you extruded how
do you control food how do you hit it
and cool it fast enough and the last
part is the social part you know what's
the facebook for food that we're going
to be using the future
yeah like progress period
making people more efficient digitizing
things mrs. over shutter so it's
interesting that what the man
be a slow movement
is in slow food and slow
wonder if your isn't actually movies
or not having this narrative applied
through video reason the defense
you do a lot of meeting man you get a
question right so maybe I so how do you
respond yeah I mean there's 20 things
that you said in there that I completely
agree with and I think I think you can
unpack them like in more detail I think
there's I think there's a kind of a
weird like fallacy of imagining the
technology and there are different kinds
of Technology I'm specifically talking
about digital technologies this idea
that that technology are going to make
you lazy technology can be designed to
make you lazy but they can also be
designed to make you more creative they
can be designed to make your explore
things you couldn't explore before and I
think there is something really
interesting there and and I agree with
you I think we could make machines it
would make you press a button a burger
would come out but there's a machine
don't make me create or allow me to
create know more about the food that I
meeting in ways that I can't do right
now like when I go to a grocery store
today and I get something from the
supermarket I have no idea what's in
there no idea and I would like to know
I'd like to make choice about what I'm
eating based on information that I don't
have and finding ways to give that
information i think is really important
you're saying is really interesting I
also feel like what about the
conversations we have about cooking and
how cooking has been changed completely
change the way I cook has been
completely changed on the internet
because I cooking ingredients and I can
take shifts beginning here I different
pictures of dinner and sharing a
facebook so you could like okay what
about that yeah I think that's great and
but the way that I feel right now is
that that's sort of disconnected from
the extra cooking in terms of like it
doesn't really connect your tools it
doesn't connect to the ingredients
you're using like I buy something today
that know where it comes from I can't
tell my french by the same tomato from
the same farm because you don't have
that information and when machine
doesn't know what tomato a god and so I
think that's the part that's missing
it's kind of like the last mile of
connecting the mature manipulation to
the stuff that we're doing digitally
what he'll be back up in a minute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
