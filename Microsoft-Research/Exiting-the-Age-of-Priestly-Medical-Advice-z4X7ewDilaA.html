hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in

academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
it's my pleasure to introduce Steven
friend I usually do this by memory but
his award list was long enough that I
had to print out a little cheat sheet
now it's a wonderful set of stuff he's
done dr. Steven friend has dedicated his
career to untangling the complex ways
that our genes our environment our
behavior sort of interact to form our
being and our health he currently works
as founder and president out at Sage
buyer networks a company which among
many many other things which he's going
to tell us some of about today builds
tools to facilitate scientific
collaboration and discovery on a much
much larger scale than we've ever seen
or been used to Stephens an md/phd did
his clinical training out at Harvard all
while he was leading the team that
cloned the first tumor suppressor gene
at MIT at the Whitehead Institute he's
been faculty at Harvard mass gen u-dub
and has done a bunch of work out at the
fred hutch Cancer Research Institute he
was CEO of Rosetta informatics which I
believe got acquired by mark at which
point he became a senior VP foreign and
Kong ecology out at Merck the awards are
you know a extremely long list I picked
a couple out here fellow of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences an Ashoka
fellow senior advisor to the National
Cancer Institute trustee for american
association for cancer research the
Marquis Cancer Foundation research award
and Ernst &amp;amp; Young health care award
White House Champions of Change
recipient the list goes on and on yeah
and hence the the long sheet he's here
with Mike Kellen who's director of
Technology out at Sage buyer networks so
feel free to grab my conceiving after
the talk but rather than stand here and
say any more and get in the way I'm
going to hand the mic over to Steven
I'm of other people feel this way but
the the skill of introducing people in a
way that actually is a coherent is not
that frequent desney that was really
mean it showed that you didn't just read
the thing and thought about it no and I
bring that up because we're sort of
looking for partners always and partners
get chosen by finding people that are on
the same wavelength as you are and we're
proximal and so maybe there'll be some
things like that come out that's our
goal of Mike and I coming over is maybe
it will be on a particular project but
more important maybe you look in some
awareness of what we're doing just three
slides on the equivalent of why we do
what we do and then in an
uncharacteristic grey way Mike will tell
you I'm just going to stay on one topic
the whole time exactly hub but that
doesn't mean that I couldn't get th to
go to the side to left the right and so
make sure this is into one way the as
came out a little bit in the intro I
keep feeling as if I'm on unfulfilled
journey to figure out how to have some
impact on how health is given and sadly
whether it is as a physician as a
researcher in biotech in industry those
images that you actually can make a
difference and by that I mean a
difference not just do a job is harder
than it seems and and I have been rather
unsuccessful if filling is it that was
fulfilled the work we're doing its age
is because when we were working in
biotech and in industry there's a way
where teams will cooperate with each
other to get a deliverable that is has
nothing to do with recognition outside
the fact that you pulled something off
you go to academia so the opposite what
really matters is where's
even going to be what crow we're credit
and I'm interested we're interested in
how to make that so actually some of
that damages in each world get realized
in the other and so the when we started
sage 2009 these are the things that we
thought maybe we can mix them up and
come up with a way of doing high-risk
projects to de-risk how to do things
differently the imaging in the omics
data i think is probably clear to you
the work that Eric shot and others we
were doing on building network models
using priors Bayesian methods to build
things were coming into their own in in
in biology the concept that you could
actually host things in the cloud and
solve things as groups the the
uncoupling of the link between person
who generated the biomedical and the
analytic work was coming about but the
two that caught us also caught our
attention was this concept that actually
you might be able to generate data
outside of the medical industrial
complex what could you do if you do that
and also that in getting problems solved
there were methods to get people to work
together that weren't you're doing this
you're do you're doing that so those
were the sort of the ingredients to what
we built in the sage sage has about 40
people and and what we've been trying to
do almost like an outfitting shop where
we try things out and see people will
use it and don't try to take it through
to the product that loop you are talking
about maybe to a debt room we'll get it
to a point where sort of is something
that we hope is obvious to someone else
and we could argue maybe we should
complete that cycle more effectively but
it's about how can we build tools where
people could work in teams of teams and
the people who are the existing experts
are not necessarily the ones we use so
we get beyond that and so we've been
having I think a pretty good time and
now I'm going to drop down into the
title I used in Amsterdam for some of
this
earlier another version of this was
using sensors can we come to our senses
okay and so here it's a little more
verbose but for the most part we're
living in a medical world where people
get excited when there are investigator
based qualitative assessments that in
our mind our I'm not very helpful and
we're interested in shifting from things
like the word fatigue to having some
assessment that actually can have a
deeper meaning and so the title is
emerging opportunities and issues around
the transition from investigator based
qualitative to participant based
quantitative assessments of symptoms and
here importantly with in health and
disease so yesterday the White House did
its second press blitz on the precision
medicine you may have seen some of that
one of the things that even though we're
very much into omics and what that can
tell you about subgroups one of the
ironies is that if I had all the data on
each of you in your oh makes the chance
that that would actually give me a way
to assess the real time changes that are
happening to you is small and so I think
precision medicine has to be equally
based on being able to look at
fluctuations in state as it is in some
code that was written that you can get
out on a disk so precision medicine
right now is enamored with the concept
if I just know all these three billion
base pairs I'll be able to do X with it
but doesn't take much extrapolation to
realize how absurd that is and if you're
not tracking what's going on on a minute
by minute or a week by week or whatever
basis you're not going to meet our
needed is all I'm saying another way to
illustrate this is we've
this this seesaw has gone back and forth
80s and 90s people thought we had
reached rich phenotypic data because we
didn't have any genomic data now we have
some genomic data and so right now i
think this sort of inaccurate a slide
and it's a quest to obviously have a
have both one way of dividing the
aspects of clinical care is to look at
where that data is generated and the
nature of data so for a number of
clinical disease cancer infectious
disease etc the data that makes the
decision is generated still within
medical laboratories as quantitative
measures there are other diseases where
it's possible to take that assessment
that used to go on within a medical
building and actually make it mobile and
so it's shifting that quantitative
measure outside of the laboratories but
what we've been interested in and this
is an interesting topic for discussion
why his there's a whole swath of
medicine that actually is what i would
call qualitative measures ascertained by
trained physicians and if you ask okay
prove to me why you got to that answer
what is it whether it is interestingly a
radiologist or a pathologist whether
it's a psychologist or a neurologist it
has something to do with intuition has
something to do training but the bottom
line is it's neurons firing in that
person's head they can only be trained
to the extent that it's matching what it
is that they have is that aggregate and
to me that I think is morally wrong okay
we're living in a digital error doesn't
make sense to have the decision as to
how you're going to treat patient be you
know that person remember that this
verse plus this is that and it's in a
really weird way I think we'll look back
on sort of strange that we tolerate
someone saying
that it's almost like going to a
medicine man right that that that this
means you're going to get this treatment
because i'm going to call this this or
that so we chose to work here because we
felt as if it was the most ripe for for
changing the system so we could have
gone in and figured how do you take a
closed-loop glucose monitoring system or
there but but we've had a bunch of
people working up there right they're
going to get that solved could we get to
the point where we had sensor based
assessments that we're going to a
knowledge expert and if you can get them
to a knowledge expert at what point is
the knowledge expert better than the
cranium and and and that's the that that
that's what would a sage is interested
in so here are a couple of those
syndromes that that are out there and we
look through a number of these and chose
to work on four we have a lot of project
button for this one on a disease that's
coming up on its 200th anniversary I'm
really excited because I would like to
have it so that we do something next
year that sort of does a compare
contrast James in London and how he
thought you should do Parkinson and and
and how we might do it so by the time
you understand that tremor slowed
movements rigid muscles impaired balance
and loss of unconscious movements which
is basically you don't blink your face
if you look at some with Parkinson they
look like they're a mask so unconscious
movements are less that's if you want to
become a train neurologist that's at the
heart of making the diagnosis there are
subtleties and everything but that's the
the description needed you need to have
X number of to be able to say that
someone has Parkinson but what we wanted
to do and we wanted to do it in a
general way was we wanted to get a way
to navigate between health and disease
just like you navigate on GPS we wanted
to come up with the dimensions of the
disease and the consequences to where
you could say where you were on the
course and acknowledge that in fact it's
not a linear path and I'll show you it's
not a linear path so so what would it so
the sum you sir what we've been working
on is what would it take to build for a
disease way of knowing where you were on
the course and whether if you did this
or that right are you going off the
course okay that's the you know out
their goal to do that we realized that
we had to fundamentally change how
clinical trials were done because
there's no way you're going to get the
data that you need and so the strategy
that we went to was assuming that
smartphones were the best method to get
that data because orders of magnitude
more individuals that we could enroll
the frequency as you know for passive is
continuous but intermittent periodic to
multiple times a day but the fun part is
that you can have a thousand dimensions
on voice or two thousand here and that
you could have it machine readable so
this actually is the most important part
of the whole thing I would argue this
alone right meaning that you don't have
to read a chart and guess what someone
meant by something that instead you had
some quantitative signal and if you're
going to feed a knowledge expert that's
how you want to feed the knowledge
expert with something you're really
going to be able to to aggregate and so
three years ago funded by the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation we thought can
we shift the way at trial is done which
is to mostly today in a medieval sense
where you pay someone and they become
the subject in the trial and they either
live in a weird building with you know
for a month or you monitor in the mud
could you make it so it actually people
wanted to be in trials instead of paying
people to try could you make it so you
imagine trials going viral anyone with a
disease was wanting their friend to join
to join to join and to do that the felt
is if you needed to shift the symmetry
shift away from the asymmetry between
I'm the doctor and now this is what
you're wanting to do there had to be a
sense of engaging individuals
for them had to be something that they
were getting back and so this dialogue
concept of going beyond health apps that
are just data tracking
self-gratification loops where people
are you know think about it's great I I
was able to do this or that which
actually is really unsustainable sort of
sad that all that data just goes out
nowhere but to have a place where that
data could be stored where answers and
questions basically shifted the trial I
don't know how much you can tell but
this is fundamentally breaking most of
the rules of the double-blinded trial
like that and it actually has
consequences it's not without
consequence but we think actually we
have to get to this level of a dynamic
changing what the endpoints are mming it
along but most importantly having the
person who is the study participant feel
respected feel a partner and to be
engaged the way that most trial date is
collected whether it's on a notebook or
a pen and paper which is mostly what it
is almost everything is done in this
very block way where you're a one two or
three or four you pick and move to here
to here to here it's pretty remarkable
that today this is ninety-five percent
of clinical trials we go through the
current measures that are done in trials
and you look at what you could do on a
smartphone I'm not going to go through
each of them it's pretty obvious that
maybe we could pull something off if if
we used those assessments so this is
where we decided to focus you need to
know a little bit about Parkinson to for
this to make sense bradykinesia slow
movements postural instability unable to
keep your balance resting tremor and
rigidity are the four cardinal features
of the disease so we said what can we do
use questionnaires what can we do to use
sensors as active tasks and what could
you do passively to monitor those with
an idea that if you could build a
vertical stack between high friction
infrequent questionnaires you could have
frequent activities and then in the
background ultimately could you get to
where you don't have to do the activity
tasks so start collecting some sort of
passive data that could feed through the
current clinical standard is the
universal PD score called updrs and for
it is very important for it to be
approved as a measure which is what all
clinicians use and all pharmaceutical
companies use the process required
running eight hundred and some patients
in a cluster of 39 centers and showing
that the assessment that was up until
then done by writing down I think this
is what the patient have was robust
enough and I would argue by saying
robust it was also in sensitive enough
there's a sort of robust insensitive
that people could say I can score you so
every patient is followed on an
aggregate score that is all the
community has motor it has non-motor it
is what was done in the exam it is done
only you can only do this test if you
are a certified deliver of the test so
you get to charge for it and only these
people can do it so there are probably
thousands of people who are allowed to
give this Testament maybe there's 10,000
but at the point is very few they can
give it and yet that gives us a path to
how we might be able to get something
improved that's different from that so
that's a road map right if you did this
then we should be able to
go that way um the device that has is
the sort of closest to some quantitative
assessment has to do with looking at
basically tremor and that x is called
Kenisha Kenisha technology and what they
did was only 60 patients in two centers
comparing it to updrs and they used an
approval rate so they got what is it a
50 10 510 k whatever it is and yet
that's never been picked up right so I
don't know Mike but it's been years
since since since that approval is 2007
or something that when when that was
approved that that's not moved on but
again gives us some idea um I had a very
interesting year yeah good it is so I
don't I haven't been able to look up and
give it get a someone else's answers
this is my answer I think the most
likely is that it is one element of what
the physician is trying to do so if you
have six ways you're following a patient
and now you have this super cool way of
doing tremor which the company is
pleased was able to do and that's all
and there are four or five other parts
of the assessment that you can't get to
so to me I think that's the most likely
the other is that and we were talking
about this just before the lecture
physicians uptake is proportional to
whether or not they are going to be
reimbursed to do something I I got all
excited because I thought we can make
this for free we can do it on
smartphones so it won't cost anything so
we won't need any reimbursement duh
that's not the question right the person
wants to get paid right so the physician
wants to be paid forty dollars to do
something it's not that they have to you
know have something that has a cost to
it they want to make money and so the
other reason
is that and they have not gotten this
through CMS or Medicare or whatever it
is and so it's it's a I think if you had
forty dollars to anyone to use the the
tool then they would go how many
patients do I have to see to make it
worth me buying this machine to be able
to do that but it's a really good
question it's what scares me the most
about what we're trying to do is there a
value systems have nothing to do with
technology that are going to make a
difference of whether this integrates or
not is that something you guys are
looking good hmm as far as a check are
you looking into that loop like
basically the county how are you going
to disrupt this yes hey it model right
basically yeah yeah and let's hold it to
the end cuz you'll see where we got I
could do it now but let's hold it a
little bit and you'll see because what I
want to input from is you know like
seeing the real ingredient on the how
far are we off but then let's go to that
um so it's been a very interesting year
much the amusement of my koon knows many
people at Microsoft I'm working inside
of Apple for nine months and for nine
months I went down to cupertino every
week over a beer and more I'll tell you
more about what it is to be there the
reason I said it is if you were to say
to organizations that share values and
principles and sharing and openness at a
sage and very few people would write
sage and Apple who know anything right
as I don't know anything knowing but um
it was very helpful for us to work with
the group and coming up on a year we
helped build out two of these apps
directly and helped Harvard and Stanford
with much of what they were doing
because they were willed is important so
why did I do that because they were
willing to invest into a research tool
that's what I was interested in was a
research tool and that they agreed to
put open code hosted for github so all
the code for all these you can get and
that was sort of one of our people I was
in a prerequisite but it turned out to
be fortunately the case open
hosted on github and we sage could
function as a neutral repository for the
data so Apple said we're not going to
look at your data interesting in the
last two weeks of news and but but as a
Switzerland a sage could be a place
where that data was hosted for other
people to use and that's what we wanted
was one to build a place where many
people could get to that and so it was
because we wanted to build a framework
for clinical studies I'm not going to go
into it but a lot years of work going
into how to a consent without a
physician there how to have icon-based
consensus something we've put a lot of
work into to be able to do that so
empower is the app for the Parkinson
disease and we are marching through
three phases that will take us from
tracking to getting clinical guidance
and getting approval for that the first
was to just put together to attest in
small cohorts something that allowed us
to follow some of the symptoms the
second phase which were sort of three
quarters of the way through was to
deploy that in very large numbers of
individuals and patients and controls
and you'll see what i mean by large and
then go to this phase what i want to one
of the most important things in this
lecture is why this without this right
if you were to go here to here we think
you make mistakes so if you go from
designing a sensor based approach and
you're only looking at dozens of people
and then you go and you test that in a
hundred to two hundred patients here to
here and you haven't put it out and
deployed it into a large them you're not
going to see the diversity you're not
going to see some of the things that are
sort of holding back the envelope of
really what's going on
questionable phase 3 and actually the
previous client file types of Kenneth
empty cells so it strikes me about both
the commuter experiment the experience
and this particular alafaya instead
they're using this expert assessment
protocol as the gold standard for
diagnosing disease which as you explain
it other slides has some programs so
you're taking the psychology reach since
used to me I think it would be a much
more accurate assessments of the
progression of the disease you're
preparing it to something that is much
lower coldly the group I want to get
Ricky Dallas a look oh how does it going
this very young in these students are
cases uh you know there they have to
prove to them to a using you know on the
510k application that they are as good
as this really crappy SS right so there
are they like downgrading the quality
over there um how does it work yeah I'm
not you know with this work in place
during you said it really well and
having spent some time with the FDA they
realize the quandary there in okay so if
people aren't careful what they're going
to do is come to the FDA and say I'm as
good as X that's crap okay and I get
approved okay and they don't like that
all right so so that is exactly the
route that's what Canadian did so and
even more I want to give an example um I
know if we have it in here but Mike and
the team been working with Harvard on a
way of looking at cognitive load okay
and if you look at cognitive load you
can look at the way someone is moving
and it's 10 200 mil alerts variations
that actually make the tool for
assessing summons cognition it's not the
stumble of the drunk okay it's these
things that a clinician may not even see
so I'm going to add one more dimension
is we have things that we're seeing that
the clinician can't even see so what has
been happening I think the answer was
what the FT would like to see is
tools that are used in the wild our
reference to the best tools that are in
the lab not tools that are using the
wild or reference to the crappy standard
that is there the problem is that the
whatever it is 510 K is a much shorter
path to say your equivalent to crap then
to say I've moved beyond it is it but
yeah the fact have to go through it no
no no you can go you can say I'm not
going to but it's so convenient so so
it's not necessary just convenient the
bar never here upper fours just with so
many things that they don't get a
competitive advantage thought of doing
oh okay well this is very important
because I think we have to change that
anchor and we meaning whoever we're
trying to work with and I'm going to
save it for a later but I really want to
have a dialogue on closed versus open
systems and how you can actually get
that standardization and things like
that because I'm its was also one of the
reasons why I thought working with Apple
it would help us ok so the version 1.0
was pretty simple we had these high
friction infrequent surveys we then had
activities for tapping so this is the
type of thing that a neurologist does it
picks up several of the motor
dysfunctions not just a bradykinesia
walking in balance again what what a
clinician does in their in their office
voice we got attracted to maybe
inappropriately because max little at
the media lab did a lot of work looking
at the vocal cords as an assessment tool
if you say ah for five to ten seconds
you can pick up a lot of the changes
that are in the the
extremities in the vocal cord and he
showed very nicely that you could pick
up whether someone did or did not have
Parkinson bye bye not words but just the
ability to have a consistent tone
because it was the wobble it was you'll
see is the other thing so and then we
put in from ucsf very simple spatial
memory recognition each time you have to
remember her things were and they get
more complicated and things like that
and and put it in to try to figure out
how much with the dexterity of the
disease get in the way of the memory
test and could we account for that and
how could we extract them got heard
recently that the asymmetric arm swing
is a potential precursor for diagnosing
Parkinson's can you get that from you
probably can't get that from just a
smartphone into pocket is their way you
know I think you can what do you think
you owe you mean because the arm I have
heard this metric arm swing or wine arm
thanks to that way no you don't get it
from it I'm what I've been really
surprised is what this picks up do you
know what I'm saying that is it's what I
mean is there's a lot of dimensions of
data that can be picked up from a single
point whether you could get the
asymmetric and one of the things that we
got excited by one the reasons why I
came today was some of this what is it
called electric field type of approaches
that seem much better suited to doing
that type of of measurement I think you
guys are probably closer to being able
to help on that then then putting it in
the pocket so but also we wanted to
begin to bring in passive so for the
motor initiation we had the scores where
the tapping activity and then we didn't
use exact location we just did GPS
displacement vectors for that we did it
on a periodic basis so we're measuring
in I think it's 10-minute intervals
we're just where are you where are you
where are you and then for gait and
balance we put in similarly some
displacement vectors and the data itself
looks like this so that's the data feed
on the walking standing turning just off
the core motion detector the voice we're
a five-second read in and a 10-second
tapping timestamp for the tapping
incidentally the most important date
i'll show you is not frequency it's
actually where they are many things you
can get off the location the memory game
in there so what we had to do was we
wanted to build a system where the
patient ph I data was completely
separate from the study dated and we
wanted it coded so we basically have all
these tasks you get the login and this
is all encrypted and it's set as streams
to the bridge server that's our name for
basically the loop that takes you to
where the data is stored in in synapse
and we can't tie those two back together
so we did it initially so that there is
no one could come in and tie one to the
other a lot of institutions are saying I
need to I want to get back to that we
talked about privacy but that's how we
did it was you just get that completely
separate institutions will have a code
that actually allows them to know who
the person is so they can make that link
but we haven't done that I think this
pretty straight for any questions about
how we did that okay so in the nine
months between march and december
ninety-five thousand people downloaded
the thing just for lark 15,000 of them
actually went all the way through and
enrolled and sixteen percent of those
had the disease eighty-five percent were
controls and the most exciting thing is
we gave the individual or a way to say
do you want your data shared only with
the institution or do you want to share
it with qualified users around
the world and 70 thought more than 75
percent in everyone that we've built had
said I want incall to give it to
qualified researchers so we bypassed the
academic institution that says only
after the papers out well I want this
data to be shared it just means that now
we have control of the day the actually
it's the participant who has the control
and we're allowing what they want to do
so we have all that data up in synapse
across all the apps that we have we have
150,000 people now in synapse I'm
showing this one we have 150,000 people
who've given us their data to be able to
to look like that every yep is it oh is
that degree it wasn't for convert better
come congruent with the incidence rate
of Parkinson's across the population or
were these people soulful tourism you're
absolutely self filters yeah it's a lot
of people who had a relative but that's
where those controls and in fact unlike
most studies it's males aged 25 hardest
time was finding age matched controls or
many more of them but we had you know 20
30 40 50 year olds and the disease sort
of goes 50 80 like this but we had some
in every state this will come up later
when I talked about something else so we
had individuals in every state obviously
California New York Florida right where
the elderly are the most i could used
your map do you wanna be very nice to
throw it on the map with about 1700 9
out of 10 are taking drugs it's mostly
l-dopa 9,000 without PD four-fifths of
them are males very interesting very few
females were coming in as controls
virtually all of them had never been in
a clinical study before you're sort of
fun all right so what I want to show now
is what we did with the data was we did
random forest principal component
various types of analyses and what we
were looking for is could we find
and the features that were most
predictive in correctly classifying
whether you do or you do not have the
disease ok so the this signal here and
my description is looking at what were
the features within tapping their about
47 different ways we were looking at
tapping what was the one that was you
know strongest predictive value to say
whether you did or did not have
Parkinson okay so you're with me did not
have this is based on having somebody
else beautify it that no no that's what
they called what they said and it's
really important yes we were talking
earlier about the problem with doing
studies like this so we don't have
anyone going back in a neurologist and
stamping that person is having I know
sometimes the most recent release I'll
put myself as having Parkinson because I
want to test some features to the side
there are people who are in the control
group who have these strongest symptoms
you possibly could imagine in parkinson
there's there's a you know subset of
people probably three percent and I
don't know whether they decided to just
test the system they knew they had the
disease or they don't know they have the
disease my my you have flagging I hope
you know that and that's exactly this is
a good dialogue is exactly what we need
to think about is you know well where's
that contract with that person right
what do you tell him particularly if
they didn't know we think that we could
detect Parkinson by the phone well um go
to one fact before that it takes two
years between when someone has a symptom
of any of these movement disorders on an
average two years before they get
properly diagnosed so they get the
symptom they know they have a tremor
Sonia its average two years two years
before that we think we could actually
tell people that they have earlier form
of the disease that you just can't pick
up today so that becomes even more and
what I'm going to do with you think it
was also like
worried I know yes i do i do i do but
that that curve that's so age warped
makes me think that's not mostly who it
is is people who are doing think that's
going to be in there but the folks who
prefer not self reporting who have very
strong symptoms could easily be in that
Bank yes does their age distribution
look like it was it is ha that's what I
don't think I asked that question but
it's good does perfect question is
what's the age distribution tho those
who have the symptom we can both guess
but I didn't look at that just wondering
about the controls to you do you end up
because I can imagine there's a certain
set of people who are from the curious
about the app go in and get the study
but then they're not really engaged and
they kind of like getting this little
bit they do you have mechanisms to kind
of check to see if people cuz i look at
the feature like number of tabs imagine
ago maybe there's some people who can i
go in and they're like oh yeah oh yeah i
can show you this yeah we should the
answer is all the weird things we can
see from the people who say they're you
know walking with it in their pocket and
they put it on the table i mean to the
mean so we have all of that you're there
right to the people who are just playing
with it and and this are really
important this is that second phase and
asking knowing that whether or not you
can use it as a valid playground in
which to find robusta signals so um no
well this wondering is that lace is so
heavy are you coming up with mechanisms
then to try to separate that yes we
think that has to be done the third
cases but that's why the third phase is
start again run a third phase give any
ideas are guesses why you are talking to
so many farm they all said yes i'm on
the element of the controls we think
that and so I don't mean this in a sex
bias way but tech-savvy this take an
element of tech savviness and being
hooked into things that that may reflect
some biases that are there because in
general women will
volunteer will be willing to be cohorts
much more than men in general so we're
coming up with some other so this data
was on 400 participants with PD and I
forget 443 age-matched controls and the
aggregate is the auc 0 point 85 very
interesting i know if you would have
predicted this but the top feature often
does better than the aggregate know what
the aggregate would do better okay and
these obviously are not the mechanical
law or the actual descriptors I had
these because I wanted the FDA did know
something about the features we were
extracting same thing for gate so for
gate I think we had more than a thousand
dimensions similar types of numbers may
you see if point 88 and it's the walking
speed it's the overshooting right when
you go one place but you can't go it's
the fact that it's not smooth the wobble
and when you show this to clinicians
right so we came up with this not saying
we want it's exactly what they say so
they go that's Parkinson right right
you're you're capturing the disease
that's what we want to see you know that
looks good for balance very similar
aspects of overshooting wobbliness not
as a stronger signal there and and voice
a pretty strong signal coming from it
from the median frequency jitter and
then these are these male frequencies
that take up a lot of the sort of
derivatives of looking at voice okay so
now to the fun well end of that that was
fun stuff but what we did was we were
interested in how concordance the
symptoms were in given individuals
whether someone who had poor tapping or
walking or balance were sort of further
on in their disease or whether they were
independent paths so to know this you
need to know that
parkinson is a disorder of
alpha-synuclein very much in the prayin
nature of misfolded proteins and so they
migrated up they come in from the nose
that's why the smell gets lost first
here comes in from the gut which is why
the constipation comes in and so these
are basically disrupting of the nervous
system that then grow up through the
places where you have balance and gait
and so what this then says is if you
rank order for most severe defect and
tapping down 30 some individuals and
then you ask what is there walking
balance and voice they're not growing
out in the same ways so we think that if
you had imaging if you could do some
sort of alpha alpha synuclein imaging of
these people's brains what you would see
is that those misfolded proteins are
going up this way versus this way versus
that way and we think that when we get
better at it we should be able to make a
map that isn't require you to get a scan
because your manifestations opposite of
updrs aggregated all together if you can
get it granular you'll begin to have
some sense of what that person should
expect where the disease is is
progressing but we did not expect that
went to the neurologist and they said oh
yeah I should put that something's wrong
with our data here why is it so
discarding they said no no no these
patients each have their own path that
they're on and then we said let's look
on a day-by-day basis so this is 162
year olds data over a period of three
months prien read post in blue so not as
good tapping afterwards one of those
dimensions and notice how this is not a
constant degenerative disease with a
slope that just looks like this okay
notice how the med is not doing anything
some days and it's doing something other
days that is the reality of the disease
we just hadn't had the tools to be able
to examine it like that if we go to
looking at now tapping walking voice
balance pre and post mid and we take
those dimensions well you can see is
that for tapping that sort of like the
one I showed before and voice higher
statistical significance is in black
white is where we don't have data there
is more of an effect on voice and
tapping and walking and balance again we
worried that our tools were not very
well might not be working went to the
neurologist and they said and then
showed us bunch of articles that the
dopant and nurtured pathway which is pre
post meant well you should be affecting
effects tapping and voice much more than
walking in balance so even though we
didn't have the clinician sitting there
saying this is that I think it's a clue
that we're getting signals that are
approximating the disease so we see
these individual variations we see the
day-to-day changes see the medication
affects so now what we're trying to do
is can we build a portrait of the
disease for the person to give them
something other than flying blind
between six month visits because that's
what they get right now six month
between one day or maybe three months
you know when they get does he so there
is an activity tracker on the app that
shows a week that that doesn't work very
well so we've been working on and this
is an old design Mike sucking better
than this now but um this was could you
show pre-post med could you show balance
gate so this is where we could use some
design help there's a better way to show
this but we think on a monthly basis if
you could show someone the the pattern
it that would be what that person would
would would want to be able to follow
now when we first did this we used the
existing tool that had been called PD
scores max little had worked on an
Android device to say three's three
features of voice or balance or gate
were ones that you could compute a PD
score out of so we began to wonder
whether those were the best ones we had
ones that were different from what we
did so here's the PD score was you know
a block from looking at tremor a block
for voice etc for voice these were the
features that was for gate that was for
posture and tapping we went back in and
we used those scores to ask how accurate
were those his in this very large data
set the AUC for the PD score the way was
done was just above point five this
really frightened us because if you go
on his TED talk you'll hear him talking
about a ninety-five percent accuracy in
a ninety-seven percent specificity if
you go in and you look at what it was
that he used he used ten patients and
ten controls x 100 he just took the data
so I think that there is a significant
room to improve on how it is the measure
the I'm pointing out why the importance
of the second phase I do not think you
can go from phase 1 to phase 3 that
that's what and and the real question is
how to get the most out of that second
phase when you can't pay to have a
clinician doing the accurate measurement
I think we went way out there too far I
think so way to sort of do it better
than we did it but I think it's some
BOTS and large numbers of individuals
are there these are some of the
different ways of tracking so while
we've been talking to the fda's what
would that phase three look like and our
expectation is that if we can enroll
patients over a period of four months
and have the clinical assessments now to
your point you won't have them their
crappy but you've got to put them in
some place with the laboratory
assessments that are being used as the
in the in the smartphone but in a
laboratory setting where you could
assess you know how strong is that
a robust detector at those intervals so
not just the clinical exam but that that
that should you know is a way to get to
that so I'm going to just wrap up with
beyond these we the most maybe some
people have the most interesting thing
we learned was we asked people to report
in what was making them better or worse
over 20,000 responses we didn't do it in
as set words to use we let them just
right down the letters so it's it's hard
to go through all these different
comments but they grouped into
categories of exercise walking sleep
work those were the four largest for
better pain lack of sleep mood were
worse but the 101 to bring up was we saw
a lot of things that made us think that
the the manifestation of the disease is
being modulated by twenty thirty forty
percent by I'm what's happening to that
person in their world and how they feel
it's not the medication it's not the
stage in the disease and so we could
watch people say race relations out of
her was it in st. Louis yeah Ferguson
was saying was hurting the disease that
wasn't hurting Parkinson that's hurting
everyone and all diseases and health and
so I think there's really an interesting
question about what brings out any
disease and the power of trapping of
following not just the symptoms but the
modulators for giving people a better
sort of course with with with their
disease so I think we found that we
could extract features within empower
these things were relatively robust
repost medication some sort of
quantitative assessments I think it's
given us the excitement to go on to do
other things
I'm just a wrap-up here's one project
that we're close i hope to finding
funding there's a foundation that has
said if you can do this for parkinson
can we do it for all the movement
disorders how many symptom modules would
you need instead of just doing pd what
would it take to go ahead and build
symptom modules that would attract these
various components we want this all to
be open source so Parkinson has ALS as
ms has Huntington's that sit around it
but in fact they're about a hundred of
these disorders and in the charts where
you go to the neurologist they go
there's tremor there's this there that
so you can picture what sensor based
modules you would need to build out and
what we figured was if we had about 12
or so that we could begin to start
enrolling patients validating at a
different rate but that this approach I
think could could could whether we do it
or other people did I don't care who
doesn't but that would be a fun
basically we build the taxonomy of the
disease that's much harder than saying I
can track an individual for that were
reasonably far into building a
consortium of industry and academic
groups that want to look at the sub
domains of dementia we think that either
as games or as activities executive
function semantic memory etc you could
build a tool that would give a way to
follow patients over over time in the
fall we brought all the app to have
patience follow melanoma and track their
disease before they get to a clinician
that we've been testing but the areas
that were most interested now so if any
of your interest in these areas or
cognition pain arthritis depression and
anemia and just one extend another we
have projects going in how to build the
symptom modules that you might want to
build for those
um this is an article that just came out
last year that we wrote on how hard is
it or how easy it is to do that we're
excited at how these could shift the
costs and the ways that clinical trials
are currently drawn by pre enrolling
with the right level of data before a
drug is given for each individual
looking for new endpoints but the one I
wanted to go through which the FDA was
very interested in was imagine a way
where sensors could follow anyone who's
on a new drug anyone who saw on a new
drug you just don't know what their
symptom is going to be so this is the
voluntary reporting that normally goes
on and so we've been thinking of what
are the symptoms you would want to build
out to follow adverse drug affects you
what would be your first corset and move
out and I would say that you know we as
a non-profit or as a spin-out or
someone's you know someone needs to do
this because the benefit that comes back
like is enormous and then just the last
component is that sage as a whole um is
very interested in building out
ecosystems where the data can be shared
the bridge server puts it onto synapse
but I didn't talk about today but for
lots of omics and imaging projects we
enjoy building groups of people who want
to work on things together and so you
know what we enjoy doing is building a
place where other people could actually
carry out their work and I think it's
now March third I heard that as Mike as
of this morning we have three articles
that are going to come out and a release
of all the data so we're going to
release the first six months of all the
Empowered data but we're releasing it in
a way where we extracted it and you can
go to the raw data you can go the
extracted data and one of those papers
is just how we organize the data one is
on for clinicians to understand what we
were doing and then one is on this
concept of qualified users so next week
will release it then we're going to have
a webinar for anyone who wants to work
on that data and interested in being on
the community so two weeks after we
release it will hold the webinar to go
if you're trying to do this with this
data here's how you do this how you here
is how you do that so I'll stop your
head one side that showed synapse but I
don't think it's needed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
