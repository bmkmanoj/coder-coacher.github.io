you
okay so this is going to be it's going
to really offend me as usual I I have
overdone my talk so yes but it's as you
can see here it's hideously stretched in
this typography is nasty so I'm really
sad in my heart this is me that's what I
look like you can see me here spinning
around in midair and I'm like a sort of
dorky ninja or something out of a matrix
actually my tongue sticking out then if
you can see that that's the classiest
part I put this picture i was here in
CES in Las Vegas last week and I put
this up for two reasons one of which is
because i went to see us to look about
Internet of Things products and that's
relevant because that's what I'm going
to talk about and the other reason is
because there's some bits of this talk
which is so embarrassing to me that I
thought I must get out quickly and you
know hopefully this will be the most
embarrassing that I feel most
embarrassed that I feel during this
thing so this is the subject i'm gonna
be talking about how do we want to
communicate with the world of connected
objects and i'm going to doing a break
out afterwards about that particular
thing but in this talk i want to focus
on one area in particular which is about
objects with personalities objects with
expression but before i get really into
that i want to tell you a little bit
about a project I did called house of
coats and to do that I need to give you
a bit of background so the story starts
with a company that I formed a couple of
years ago with an old friend called Matt
but we called the company product club
we didn't know what we were going to do
with it at first we just knew that we
liked working with one another and that
we wanted to find a project together
that would make us both excited which we
thought could be a success now we've
done a few projects in the past that
have got us quite a lot of you know
street cred in nerd cred but they
weren't usually successful so we really
wanted to change that to put it another
way you know we were bored of being
critically celebrated we wanted a
breakaway pop hit so and maybe maybe get
a bit of credibility at the same time so
with this in mind we started a year of
interesting little projects Matt made a
mobile phone turns out people have done
that before so that wasn't a huge
product success we did a project an app
called query which was a local Q&amp;amp;A app
which some people who were
you might remember because we actually
demoed it for the first time at SCS a
couple years ago we decided that wasn't
big enough for sexy enough to be our
Taylor Swift in this particular case not
that she's big we did an awesome project
with TV which i think is actually too
complicated to tell about but we work
with lovely Greg Borenstein who some of
you might know and he is awesome you
should work with him this is using
machine vision to interpret live TV and
composite interesting things over the
top of it and we made some actual work
for people for money as well a project
for jawbone which is a coffee tracking
app that you could do physics inside so
these projects and then one of the
projects that we really the areas we
really cared about was the Internet of
Things and with lots of projects in that
space playing with various elements of
it and one of the experiments we did in
that space and not even a very big one
was a project called house of coats now
this is my house it's my house at its
most chai deist and with the largest
widescreen camera I could find to make
it look larger than its 800 square feet
which is what it is and the idea I had
was to try and live with an
internet-connected home and so I went
out bought all the objects i could find
go in my house I got Wemo switches from
belkin sensical twine that tracked
vibration and temperature stuff like
that I hooked up my weddings bathroom
scale I found motion sensor used bits of
apples Find My Friends app to send
emails to gmail i joined all of this
together with iThis than that to kind of
create a twitter account for my home and
low this twitter account was born so
this is house of coats so the point of
this and it sits up live now is that it
essentially narrative eyeses my house it
tells what switches oppressed what the
temperature is when I'm there or not
when there's motion in the house it's
been pretty carefully scripted to cover
up all the gaps and errors and the
problems that I I couldn't figure out
ways to get information out of so for
example I couldn't tell whether if a
light was switched on it was switched on
because I press the button or because a
rule was done or someone else press the
button cuz I did it on my phone
completely impossible to determine that
stuff so I just pretended and
waved and you know had the house say we
turned on the light because it was
getting a bit dark in here so lots of it
is kind of smoke and mirrors and it's
full of stuff that's sort of like held
together with string and chewing gum
which explains really why at the moment
only half of it is king and at any given
time barely half of it is working and so
the weirdest part about this process was
trying to work out what the feel of the
house should be like how it should talk
what was its voice what its tone was
like how would I wanted to engage with
me in my life so for example when the
moat when there was motion in my house I
got to tweet at me it would say
essentially hello Tom coats there's
motion in the house is that you and that
was great because it meant if I was out
and there was some motion the house I
would get notified and it's basically
the world's cheapest burglar alarm it
was less good when I was at home because
you know I can knew I was there and
there was really no way to tell it that
nonetheless I also didn't because people
were coming in and out of my house
fairly regularly I didn't to be shouty
or intrusive or weird or alarmist so I
kept trying to find ways of making
communications of calm and reasonable
tone of voice that wouldn't freak me out
so trying to find this voice that would
work in most circumstances and would
feel friendly and approachable and after
a while I found myself really enjoying
the presence of the little house talking
to me and it a bit of security like when
I was away if there was a problem like a
glance online and see what was going on
but it really felt like I was building a
bit more of a relationship with the
house environment that would normally be
mute and distant what I wanted to find
out about it I could just go on look a
line and when it wanted to tell me
something it could intervene in my
normal workflows and communicate with me
weirdly I wasn't the only person to
start building an emotional relationship
with my house temp turns out members of
the public were actually starting
conversations with my house which was a
bit odd occasionally I would freak them
out by responding in the houses tone of
voice that was always quite entertaining
they were never quite sure what was
going on but I have to be honest with
you whatever this kind of thing was it
wasn't a particularly big deal for me it
was a small project
of a small section of a year's work so I
thought about it at a couple of
conferences as an illustration of some
of the things you could do if you
connected objects to the Internet and
I'll after that then this happened and
it's a little article in MIT Technology
Review and in the article there's woman
Rachel Mets the route the journalist
just really seem to get it the stuff
that I'd found interesting and appealing
about it she just really resonated with
it she loved the idea of like building a
relationship with your home she
understood what I was trying to get at
in this one a small experiment and you
know wrote it up in a very pleasant and
appealing way and that was nice and
unfortunately or fortunately that also
triggered a whole bunch of other people
to be interested so this is I don't know
if anyone knows Metro in London it's the
free newspaper that goes out on the tube
in London I goes our everyday and it's
read by millions of people this is a two
page spread in the center of the
magazine about my house and the kind of
things and conversations I had with it
now again I was a bit surprised by the
way this stuff was handled because again
this was a very sensitive and
intelligent piece that said here are the
things that this could do for you here
are the ways it could build a
relationship with your home make you
feel more comfortable making film or add
you know at ease with things and and
it's so easy they could have so easily
gone with a completely different angle
like look at this ridiculous fat bearded
man in San Francisco who talks to his
house like that's entirely implausible
angle for a story and if anyone's going
to write it you know I would totally
identify with that actually it's
probably more accurate in this one but
but actually no it just seemed to get it
it just seemed to understand what I was
trying to do and really resonated with
it after this came literally dozens of
other articles newspaper articles
magazine articles blog posts like many
involved people wanting to interview me
and come round to my house and see the
little house and they were always very
surprised when they got there that it
was basically just a normal house with a
couple of switches around the place and
all the clever stuff
hang on the cloud and I kept saying to
my partner look this is a small project
but i did on the side I don't really
want to do all these things it's a bit
embarrassing you know I don't want it to
be on my gravestone you know like Tom
coats he talked to his house you know
that might be weird right so but he was
like no no no no no we're starting a
company it's a good thing go out there
or do the press blah blah blah and this
for example is an illustration about my
house from an article in wired magazine
and this is where it all started kicking
off getting particularly weird I ended
up being on Chinese television and
various other things and then this is
the New York Times real estate section
for the front cover of the new real
estate section and as you can see this
this guy was hidden my house all day
basically trying to make me not look
awkward and uncomfortable as you can see
he totally failed and then it got even
more weird and this is the day when CNBC
came around and interviewed me for a TV
program they were making this is the
most embarrassing thing someone or
something for watching you in your home
silently secretly observing your every
move knowing what you do when you do it
and the moment you walk out your door
god I hate this so much that's the idea
behind smart homes which watch how you
live and try to make your life easier
this is like a couple of its long I'm
gonna play you all because it's so
simply want I'll it roll my eyes here my
speak to him I have a fairly
conversational relationship with my
house I really like that agarran web
entrepreneur has raped his small San
Francisco home with a handful of sensors
that let him know through his home zone
twitter feed what's happening when he's
not there I'm just gonna hang on
 yes sir the weird thing about that
particular bit if I can oh I can't
figure any more the weird thing about
that particular bit was that I'm just
gonna I behave the way thing when that
particular bit was this woman I was
talking to this one Melissa leave from
CNBC she was interviewing me she's so
nice and so sensible that she was like
so why are you doing these things that's
interest
tell me more you know I'm trying to my
American accent so don't be offended and
she was talking through through all this
kind of stuff and then the camera came
on and she just went completely insane
her eyes just got five times as large
she was like oh my god that's so awesome
I just don't understand what's happening
here no and she just asked me all these
ridiculous questions and oh so freaky
and I kept teasing her about things you
know like oh god Melissa you got in the
way the camera again but she was very
good-natured about the whole anyway it's
really weird process i went to have
attacker when they film me having a taco
and they they fill me like three times
walking into the taqueria and sitting
down and then this like this family with
kids were like you in a movie and was
like no this is just the worst thing
that's ever happened to me and you know
it's just so mortifying and completely
awful to the extent that in fact this is
less embarrassing to me and that's why I
put it in right anyway so what was all
that about right so shown this kind of
stuff because it's slightly funny and
partly because I think it illustrates
something interesting and which
something was a bit of a surprise to me
which was that this idea of an
anthropomorphic home or home with a
personality and a voice really really
resonated with people in way more than I
thought it would you know this was a
little experimental project but people
really got this I didn't get almost no
one I did get a couple of people saying
why are you doing this this is weird or
this is strange or pointless I got
mostly people saying oh I wish my house
could do that i wish i could have
conversations with my home i wish i
could get more of a sense of what my
home is like and why it does the things
that it does so you know i think the
interesting for me was why is this a
particularly interesting way of
manifesting the information in a home as
opposed to set buttons or touch screens
so i have a few theories right so
quickly before i start there are a lot
of people i want to reference very
quickly who had done really interesting
work in this area and who i'm not going
to talk about insignificant depth so
adam green field in my canoe have ski to
people who've done particularly
interesting
in the sort of animistic or
communicative elements of objects Katie
London obviously with botanicals and a
bunch of the ITP folks yuri angriest
ramadan official here and there's always
work on bringing a social object theory
into the digital world and that sort of
has a resonance in application and
particularly matt jones who isn't a
lovely set of explorations of this space
and particularly in this article called
the demon haunted world which you can go
and find on slideshare but this is
basically the gist of what I'm trying to
get to is these two kind of basic
concepts animism and the pathetic
fallacy kind of mean roughly the same
thing in different angles human beings
have this sort of weirdly in eight
tendency to anthropomorphize things that
they don't understand and they use that
personality they've constructed the
other end to negotiate with and form
deals and relationships with we treat
nature and objects in the same way
fundamentally as we treat up the people
or at least you know I do which is as
confusing puzzling different and weird
things but maybe I can figure them out
in time if I really try that's how I
think of all of you people for example
anyway so this is you know so we all
we've all done it we've all done that
communication where we try and negotiate
or argue with an object how many of us
here have sworn at our computer why are
you doing that stop doing that I don't
understand when your cars stop stop
working or playing up you like please if
you just get me to this meeting I'll
take you for a you know an oil change
I'll give you a car wash it'll be fine
you know and i think the for me the
really interesting point is where we go
with objects from not anthropomorphizing
them when something is weird to when we
do what is that transition point and i
have an idea about that you know and i
think that idea is about inscrutability
we negotiate with objects when we don't
understand why they're doing the things
that they're doing when they're too
complicated to just go well the light
the bulbs gone on the light so i'll just
replace the bulb that's easy i don't
have to negotiate that i don't have to
try and persuade it but when it's doing
things that I don't understand for
reasons I don't understand we start
resorting to this kind of human-to-human
dialogue or kind of
theoretical framework and I think there
is no other area currently a technology
that is more inscrutable than the
Internet of Things at the moment
particularly because with the intent of
things there is this weird sense of
object acting with intent so an example
in my house like many of us I have
lights in my house lights are good they
help you see in the dark but my lights
are connected to the Internet and
they're connected to the internet
through a weird mishmash of systems and
services so one day I'm sitting at my
desk in my office typing away doing
things and the light comes on and I have
absolutely no idea why to this day I
don't know why that light came on it
sorry yes probably you thanks so anyway
I go and filter my way through every
single one of the services and the
rule-based systems that i use and try to
find it cannot find it anywhere I to see
if I've done a switch actually in
retrospect i suddenly realized i think i
know why it happened i think it's matt
webb in London who I let's stay in my
house once and got the Wemo controls and
they went home and just pressed kept
turning the lights on and off in my
house for infuriating reasons but at the
time it was inscrutable and confusing
and I had no way to understand it now
objects are starting to talk to one
another and they're starting to react to
one another which means ever every day
there are more things that can happen in
my home in particular and I hope I
expect in your homes in the next four or
five years that you don't entirely
understand why they're happening at
first instincts objects reacting to
other objects reacting to your presence
or absence reacting to one another
optimizing themselves to try and make
your life a bit better but at the same
puzzling you a bit not being entirely
clear why they're doing the things they
do and that's a problem and it's a
problem that will try and fix but I
think one of the reasons that we think
about these things and the
anthropomorphizing elements start to
feel quite interesting is because if
these objects could tell you why they're
doing things in a human interface II
kind of way it would feel more right and
I think that's because they already seem
to have intent they already seem to be
doing
things for reasons and and so something
about that lends itself to more bodied
or personalized kind of humid like an
activity another reason is these objects
shout these things feel more animistic
they feel more alive because the stream
of information coming out of them is not
continuous it comes in discrete moments
when an event happens they react to
things they want to talk to you on their
schedules they may have messages that
are urgent so nest you know your house
is on fire I want to know that right
away right or less urgent your washing
is done but this brings in this desire
for an object to communicate with you at
a time and that means it starts inve
investigator it starts fitting in with
questions about propriety and rudeness
and how it intervenes or pushes into
your life so there's another reference
for Matt Jones so talk we did years ago
about personal informatics about
quantified self stuff and it was about
the idea that we really want to build a
world with this information where yes it
looks nice yes it's relevant but it's
also polite it's not pushing its way
into our world and into our lives and so
when you start talking about politeness
with objects you're already starting to
think about them is slightly humanistic
anthropomorphised ways so give an
example my pet peeves things that beep I
really do not like objects that beep
this is a washing machine that beeps
when it's done does anyone have a
washing machine that beeps when it's
done do they does it continue to be
afterwards until you go and tours it out
god I hate those um you know it's how
rude is that you know you're you're
sitting that you're having a nap you
watch your TV program you're feeling a
bit sleepy and don't really want to just
completely immediately this precise
moment going cater to the needs of your
bloody washing machine and it just sits
there plaintively wailing hey it's like
beep beep what the
and there's nothing you can do about it
essentially it's communicating on its
own channel it's being intrusive and
it's being rude another example I have a
I have a sort of obsession with robotic
house cleaning devices I have five of
these robots now which is I think more
than I have rooms because I don't live
in a very large place and they set them
off and they start cleaning and then at
a certain point they get stuck and they
start beeping or if they don't beep they
do an even worse thing which is this
kind of voice which i think is supposed
to be modeled on the voice of the women
in Star Trek who does the computers just
sort of goes like you know error move
Roomba to a new location and press clean
to restart over and over and over again
now I'm sitting in a chair I'm doing
some work I'm halfway through a
conference call i'm watching TV I don't
want that to happen it's infuriating and
it's really weird to me actually given
how easy these things are to invest with
personality and life you know people
give them nicknames but they have this
sort of slightly odd limit matriarchal
kind of voice that sort of yells you
know like when your mother just said
something to you and you're just spine
just goes straight up like crap yes okay
when they do mum voice this talks to you
and mum voice just like literally a
friend of mine has a kid with my name
she just she does mum voice on the kid
and I just shoot straight up like oh
crap what have I done it would be much
better if these things talk to us in
ways that we understood through the
channels that we understood so it'd be
much nicer if they talked to us through
our phones through our notification
systems and could be understood in the
same way as we understand human
interaction the third actually I want
you know I want them to be polite I
wanted to be discreet yes let me know
when something's happened but don't
expect me to run to the phone at this
precise moment and talk to you and deal
with the situation right this moment
unless it's really urgent this is a not
a new idea this is a very old idea for a
I TPS as Courtney Love's medicine
cabinet and this is basically does is
it's got an IRB channel in the
background and it tracks how many pills
are taken out of the medicine cabinet
and when a lot of pills have been taken
out when she says something in the IRC
channel guys don't listen to her she's
high you know it's this is definitely
not polite it's in fact incredibly
judgmental but it's kind of funny
so we've used African boards so the
point I'm trying to get to is that we
can use anthropomorphism God Jesus to
combat inscrutability to make objects
understandable and comprehendible and we
can use the set and we can encourage
sensitivity to human behavior make them
act in more human ways to be polite and
discreet but I think there's another
reason this stuff can be really good
that is bonding that actually you can
form a more strong relationship with the
objects in your life if they act in a
way that is appealing to you and if you
can relate to them in a slightly more
humanistic way but you know I think
these emotional buns are extremely
powerful and very real but you know
they're not without risks and my go-to
person for risks in this area is
terrifying modernist Adam Greenfield
writer of the book everywhere and I
think the idea to him of a world of
objects that communicate and just sort
of intrude on his life being chirpy all
the time it supposed to be the worst
thing that could ever happen this is a
man who for whom like you know like I
think you find that absolutely repulsive
you know he wants a world of pure white
and you know featureless nurse in which
he can think deep thoughts that's that
sounded skating wasn't meant and I think
there are two deign to some dangers and
going too far down these directions and
personalizing things too much you know
and I think I just want to end with a
few bits of risk about how the world
could look like without the presence of
sort of neo militant minimalism there's
this stuff right as there's the absurdly
cute do we want objects infantilized in
this kind of way in our homes being you
know chirpy and and whimsical this is
the brave little toaster this is a this
I don't have anyone's going to find this
as funny as i do i put it in and now I
realize it may have been an error but
this is a brothers anyone other venture
brothers one person and it would have to
be user will not be alarmed we go can
you we turned out of it please do not be
alarmed we are about to engage
the nozzle this is the Northeast yeah
while the US is engaged moving will
disrupt calibration of the nozzle please
wait while we calibrate the non soul
please do not look the nozzle is down
calibrating this goes on a while the
nozzle is still calibrating the nozzle
has completed calibration thank you
there's our Pig Cheech energy man what
like that thing I have no idea standard
so you know so you've got this kind of
infantilized vision of objects with like
cutesy faces on them and then you have
this kind of utterly brutalist kind of
like oddly inhuman uncanny valley voice
of like messages from from your Roomba
you know please do not stand in the way
of the Hoover right that it's
unacceptable and then because this is my
favorite like absolute nightmare for
someone I had in Greenfield the
modernists everywhere which is just you
know is this the future we really want
you know cheerful t-ball team so these
are the risks right this is the worst
end of the future that were of inherent
objects that we have to do it like it I
find this you know sort of wonderful but
also I you know this is not a future I
particularly one luckily there are
people who are trying to fix this stuff
and this is for those people who want to
know what Matt and I were working on I
decided to work on in the end this is
what we're working on we're working on a
better put system for all this kind of
stuff and it's called thing tonight I
will be doing a session afterwards about
ways to interact with some objects
that's all thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
