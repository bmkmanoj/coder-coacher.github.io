I'm passionate about Nepal because it is
one of the poorest countries in the
world where there's a huge need to
children's doctors there so we don't
know why the children are dying in
hospital come and help so that's why we
started working there what we found was
that the most important and cause of
serious illness in hospital was
pneumonia
the project that I'm working on now with
with Jo and with annie pollard as well
is vidiyum vaccine data management we
provide the electronic forms and the
databases that the vaccines group we
using to collect and manage data for
their clinical studies what I love most
about my work is the ability to develop
vaccines that can change people's lives
can actually save lives pneumonia is the
most important cause of death in
children worldwide there are almost a
million cases every year so it is the
most important public health problem for
those under fire most babies in the
world get three doses of vaccines at 6
10 and 14 weeks of age this is quite a
lot to ask pneumonia vaccines because
they need their protection to last right
up until five years of age so what we're
doing in this trial is looking at a
different schedule which spaces out the
doses of vaccine to try and give much
more prolonged protection so what we
were able to do was to give them full
document management support for their
clinical studies both in this country
and in the pole using a combination of
Microsoft tools the people in the pool
themselves basically enter data into
here one of the exciting things about
this project is that the data can be
entered during the day in the ball and
fed straight to the team here in Oxford
so we're using sharepoint and infopath
Microsoft software to help do this what
we've learned about this whole
experience has been the standard
commodity off-the-shelf Microsoft tools
that are used in every office can be
actually used for real science as well
what's exciting about working with
Microsoft Research in silent in
particular is that they have expertise
not only in computer science but also in
life sciences
I travel to Nepal most years and every
time I go the ward is always full of
children with severe pneumonia some of
whom died whilst I'm there and so I know
that to be in a project where we can
perhaps prevent more of these serious
cases and deaths is a very exciting
important place to be
