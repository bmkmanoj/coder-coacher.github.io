hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
um so I'm pleased to welcome hon I'm not
going to try to pronounce your first
name lon Zohan is a distinguished
scientist and managing director I'm not
here let me start over so hon is a
distinguished scientist and managing
director of MSR Asia Han joined MSR in
1995 from Apple Computer he received his
PhD in computer science from Carnegie
Mellon sohan same speech so I it's a
great honor to be here on behalf the
entire msi to actually tell you the one
week and the china wicked msi and how
this all started and the way and then
thanks to add already primed for my talk
took talking about msi and i think it so
before i actually go to my presentation
in asia we have a tradition every time
we do something even we must take
picture and i think it because this is
the real proof the serially happen and
particularly for the week we can show to
Terry and kids every year Rick dick come
to China Indonesia so so starting our
opening in 98 and also we we do add
mention we actually do we have to engage
with the academic community just like
what Rick said set up the MSR and I
think the we actually also responsible
to bring the top research or scientist
Professor to China so people do I mean
including a I mean many you actually you
can see many people in the picture are
really sank to sanctuary all these
academics change gender for their first
trip to China it's all because already
been because real so you will see old
all the familiar people including many
people in this room so every year 25
2005-2006 and we start doing this bigger
bigger larger than life photo
ok hit a 2007 2008 2009 8 and our 10th
anniversary and so we all look the same
then you interested in 10 years ago 2009
sting or building 2010 maneuvers on high
Expo and you see people we have
certainly quite a trip there and last
last year okay all right pick the
picture time so this all of course it's
all started because you're weak and we
certainly achieve quite quite some feet
during the last 13 years and I try to
use the next 15 minutes to tell you what
how did it all happen so start with you
actually Rick's tht diseases okay you
will know why I think so Rick Rick
sisters is the power system for
interpreting the movie lightly spray 2d
no depth okay that I'm in the now you
have kinetic energy have the depth it
really just only 2d just stop just
basically just a just stopped and I
think even for human being I don't think
I don't think many people can achieve
really interpret this and I think we
take the challenge you to to really
start doing checking understanding and
on this move in life and i think the uh
it's it's really a huge inspiration like
the even bake different in the nineteen
seventy nine ninety eighty is possible
to reconstruct the human motion based
just on this very limited data and and
of course the our language a human body
which we sort of move ball by six with
some physical constraint you cannot
paint yourself too much and because
human body are sort of deformable use in
some to some degree and and i think the
people know about msi our we first make
our net in the multimedia area
particularly in computer vision computer
graphics and i think Rick thesis really
is by many walk we have our motion
synthesis and then Leslie
is tracking capturing reconstructing and
I would just show you some of the same
sort of the significant paper we publish
along the line particular in the early
day and I think this is the paper in
2002 and actually are the hair is well
Harry with my predecessor is to one of
the course we are basically with this is
kind of typical analysis and synthesis
with we trying to find the every every
motion it's a linear dynamics cistern
combination of some shorten our pattern
and we call that texture and then so so
so by doing this analysis and then any
motion sequence like tensing you can be
really a dynamical combination of all
these textual and now we actually
believe now we're actually using this
information in our today's pin video
search when you do the video thumbnail
we actually do some of this technology
today so I think that's certainly one
are the work inspired by Rican sisters
and then the second one is the paper we
published two years ago and so it's
still in the graphics you are trying to
reconstruct our to represent some motion
in animation or whatever are the the
scenario and then you cannot recall
every possible motion but at the same
time trying to apply physics to actually
on the any action is clearly today's
impossible so this list we take our
approach we actually take a video or
recording on some basic motion then you
are priced on local physic to actually
change too for instance now on the left
hand side you see that we recording
motion and then now now if you if you
actually fall through a step we kind of
apply some local fixing it's actually
done it it's strictly speaking it's not
real physic but it's all computer
graphics is about your pipe enough for
people's I it's actually like the like
that sequence on your life it's actually
our the wall we computer-generated
and then the next the bar the one in the
pattern is like you apply that sequence
on to robot and with with some kind of
deviation so that's another one which is
our what inspired by the creases then
our last year we publish your pretty
skinny my paper you see graph which is
for four long while people I mean if you
if you're in movies industry the movie
in light language the rig scissors
really like the party of moving light
and is like what you see on the left
hand side you do let's call more cap
motion cap you basically just put a
towel down on the body or face and
trying to recall so you can do in
reconstruction the problem we start is
that typical you enter cheat off our
spatial with Stacy overs like time
resolution so if you have a very good
motion you introduce the spatial
resolution so this the paper is the
first attempt to act you're using a
laser skin but there's a skin you can
only take the static our image so we
kind of combine both by find some we saw
we call Colonel face skin and that give
you vivid are the laser capture of the
face now in between we used in a motion
capstar 22 interpolation so this way we
can generate something like this so you
can see the scene on your right hand
side so that's what we work we are to be
able to generate and then under tracking
again before connect you don't have the
depth we actually this walk we actually
down before the Canadian for the one
Microsoft life can five years ago and
then the face is actually just like what
Rick say the move in lightly spray so
let's non-rigid she's deformable is
changeable but with some constraint so
we use the the important feature in the
face like eyes like knows like Mouse so
to to edge acute and then help us to do
the real time do your time face tracking
so this way we can
of course we can do con carne avatar I
put you many of you know today and it
actually today in the micro Sol webcam
you can actually are like put some
really special effect where he'll wear
glasses or make your nose bigger or
smaller because we can do this our
real-time tracking so so that's our
multimedia I say we sort of make our
name so in 2004 we are a lot of the
press also the book about msra and in
2004 one significant event in terms of
in terms of being recognized or in the P
alpha the technology review colors like
hottest computer lab and I think the
which is basically it is a great tribute
to how difficult to do the world class
lab outside US particular in China and
how we do it it's a good complement to
us and that's some actually we did its
work hotties computer lab because the
air conditioning broken so that so I
think this is right timing and so that's
we however we all know the rig p
actually after his teeth after each
city's work you came to see me become
top assistant networking professor so in
my micros also i will add mike rizzo is
basically a system and networking
company because we are a platform
company infrastructure company create a
platform for people to build all kinds
of systems and software so i actually we
have to talk kind of 12 always regard
until we build a world-class sister and
networking tin the project portfolio we
are now really work last year under
particular on the week so so so we read
with over the last few years actually we
take take us more than 10 years to
really build a strong system and
networking portfolio and king mostly
because the talent and its several
people mentioned already the best way to
reinstall digitaria the talent but
unfortunately are they are fewer our top
three fewer top
sister networking researcher of Chinese
researcher out there for us to actually
our recruit therefore we need to mostly
people ourselves and also gradually so
did so with the theatres take longer
than we thought and but the but I'm
happy to tell you now we actually think
we actually build upgrade our systems
and networking portfolio and team and I
think hear the sound of the work we have
a town in the last couple of years the
first one is on the solar it's a
software radio platform software radio
it's a actually this one is kind of
similar to mark in the sense inspired by
mark is like ah it would be wonderful to
actually do all this in South way except
the radio like we all know the wildest
we we need a lot of chips the ASIC chips
in doing all this kind of DSP similar to
mark in a sense can we have to put so
many fun feature microkernel
multi-process all this stuff in in the
very sling and also a portable always
and i think a lot of people know that
people probably said no they cannot be
done until you really do it so i think
the we the teen really take this
challenge to to implement a solution
which is you basically has a pci card
with all basically just a basic array
deal and the owner heavy lifting DSP and
other stuff which is done in software
and i take the wheel g1 several basil
base paper war and also the are being
adopted by 40-plus university make a
quite impact in the in the wildest why
they say while these are area and then
the the other direction is the are the
data center networking and I think the
I'll just quickly talk to you about a
few walk there as you know now we move
to a cloud area so I think a data center
network it's very its ever increasing
important and I think the one of the
thing we do is a PQ which you give a
different topology to give a direct link
between any two server rack and I think
the that were one of the first pool to
publish our paper you this area
the other one we are the NHD I 2011 page
paper war it's the server switch yes
okay and then the well this is again
using the commodity hard way and the
ASIC to actually allow people to do
flexible packet forwarding and etc and
then p match the start we do with OSD to
actually have a monitoring a diagnosis
stuff to actually knowing the what
happened in the network stack in the
service and then in the distributed star
which is we have the Matis which we have
to work with are the civil service seen
in the cloud service and using the model
checking and other technology to helpful
testing in the distributed system from
and our cloud meter it's also the other
similar ones but this is under on the
cistern lot and tiger which is the last
one I'm going to talk about which is
which we also carefully choose the the
project code-named if you feel free to
use the project cornet you ready you
ready halfway success so we recycle
recycle the tiger tiger party this is
basically this is new index architecture
for bin and to label so we can actually
put the smaller index in on the brain
and put the bigger index on the SSD take
advantage of density so we can actually
create one hundred percent performance
again so now really the last slide I
think the older older so from all this I
think they're here to here's our take it
like our experience of how to build a
world-class research lab you start with
the leader like Rick and then you take
the older taking your inspiration you
can find from here on now in this
particular case on we already on
multimedia computer vision graphics
sister networking and and then the the
most importantly I would say I you
straight to the research method
methodology value already pointed out by
many many people the stay of the two
advanced state-of-the-art principle come
first and then to an end to contribute
to a company to not just the technology
transfer also be 0 this technical razor
bow for the company
and then the cistern approach that can
do approach which is the we this is what
we tip here is say well no matter how
good the theory is we we want people to
actually just try the beer assistant and
that's also important well on the wrist
this taking part we call the other side
always say is a fail fast you try
something if you didn't work you quickly
switch to trying to build something else
and okay so and then finally the
research is the not it is more about
people now technology again echoed by
many other people okay sex okay so i
hope the title is interesting it should
i do this USB thing no I'll stand here
like you can see me right I can see you
well the history of India lab goes back
a couple of years before it started I
started pitching it and then took a
while to convince dan and brick but
interestingly the place you know the
time but it was finally decided was in
2004 tab meeting which actually might
have been held in one of these rooms
during tech fest and we had Richard
Newton at that time as a member of the
tub and handy when them and of course
large is here and it is still here and
together with John not linger and my
vagin a buddy names some of you may
remember may not remember we put
together representation I still believe
it's the picture of Taj Mahal that got
wrecked I decide to set up a lab in
India it can't be anything else and he
said well after that after the talk i
went to dine and I said what do you
think and Dan said well I don't think
rick has enough money in the budget this
year I said oh well another year so then
I went to Rick and Rick said well if
he's going to if you're going to keep it
to under 200 2 and a half million for
the first year I may be able to do
something so that got me working I took
Dan to India on a world wind fide a trip
I didn't get sick because he told me
that I didn't give enough time for him
to get sick because he kept going from
one city to another and and then I came
back to rig so what should I do he said
you have to do four things in order to
you know in order to get ready to set up
a lab first thing was people he said you
have to have people so I recruited Shawn
and kentaro and as you can see
appropriately I also dress them up and
indian indian clothes Kenda of course is
not working at Microsoft anyone Sean now
is settled in India by the way he wears
these kind of clothes every day as far
as i can tell an agenda of course this
is a you know my initial presentation i
won't bother reading it but just to show
that there was an agenda we had four
research areas sensor networks
multilingual system digital Geographics
and technology for emerging markets two
of which we in fact no longer do but
that's the nature of mission goals but
the mission goes is very similar to you
know the MSR one so I just borrowed them
from Rick and a place Sean and I went
around looking for place and looking for
a place and looking for a place and
looking for a place and 29 buildings
later we didn't find this we found a
shell which wasn't built up then it got
built up within a year and we were there
until recently because many of you would
know and then the last thing of course
he said is that we have to have a PR so
well this is not exactly was not the
announcement but this was a by our
facilities manager in India who thought
that this was the most appropriate but
this was really the announcement we had
analytical and so we actually had a lot
of PR we had an intent to set up the lab
announced in december two thousand four
and then an inauguration of the lab in
january 2005 and then inauguration of
the building in in october two thousand
five and so we were just looking for
events to do and we kept this is the you
know the speech from the inauguration
this is the minister for science and
technology oh okay i don't have audio so
by one why don't I won't show this now
because I didn't connect up to the audio
some other time if you want this was
actually the plaque so you know one
thing of course we do in countries like
India is to engage with the senior-most
government officials it's a good way to
sell both sides i convince into my
management that we are important i
convince you know the government of
india that we are very serious so we
take Rick around the minister for
science and technology mrs. couple
sibylla's only inaugurated the lab now
we understand right after this he got
promoted to a cabinet-level Minister
clearly because of you know setting up
MSR India couldn't be any other reason
and of course within a year we had some
crisis and I don't know if Rick remember
is this one of the things that happens
in India is that people are very
sensitive
as more to Bollywood actors than to
politicians so it just so happened that
we were literally within a stone's throw
of a famous Bollywood actors house I
mean no and so when he died and he died
you know by natural causes there was a
huge recession and you know people
coming to see him and they were they
went for miles and there wasn't enough
time and so people are getting upset so
as a part of time pass they started
throwing stones at all the glass
building that was along the way and we
happened to be you know right there and
we lost all our windows we got to
replace them and you know I didn't seem
it didn't see much at all frankly just
the kind of thing that happens routinely
and it just kind of thing that you deal
with this you go along so this is you
know that's India and of course we we
put garlits to minister when they come
to inaugurate your building and they're
heavier than well not can't be possibly
heavier than the ministers but might be
and regard to learn indian traditions
such as lighting a lamp and of course we
took him to famous temples and all this
kind of stuff now one thing about rick
and i'm going to ask Terry this I've
told them every year you have to bring
your family and do some sightseeing and
every year he says okay so next year i
think we expect all of you to come the
horses in india are nothing compared to
anywhere else but don't come for that
but you can ride camels I mean that's
actually a fun thing to do so that may
be the reason to come you know we have
we have a very social culture as most of
you know and this is from our fifth
anniversary party and I think given that
this seems to be the day when people are
taking potshots at Christian i thought i
should put this up
I do have a picture of the you know the
hotel person asking Christian you know
to politely to get down from the table
so he wouldn't break so Rick didn't come
to this party I mean usually didn't stay
for the parties because he gets tired
and all that next morning I was sitting
next to him he was giving a talk and I
think some women and computer science
forum and I'm you know tired i'm still
not over from the party and I said nicer
so he said hi heard you had a nice party
yesterday I said yeah you know Rick I
think you know where sometimes I worry
that will get a reputation for being a
partying lab he looks at me says on and
then it's not the lab it's you the lab
assistant I said then my you know if I
still have the job after five years when
my boss says this i don't think i have a
problem and this is from the next year
when we decided to have a slightly bored
modest drumming sort of thing in there
that is rick you can see him happily
enjoying drumming surrounded by some
very senior you know people of some
distinguish nature so i am and i'm not
going to get too serious about anything
but i should say one thing about working
for Rick and I think most of you have
said this in some form or the other I
think you get unlimited freedom you he
doesn't tell you what to do in fact if
you go ask him what you do he'll send
you back to find out what you want to do
and then come back I remember in the
early days we had a crisis where some of
the some of our friends were not
convinced that we should be a separate
business entity or some such issue and I
had a certain idea i talked to Rick Rick
said what do you think we should he said
what do you want to do I said what do
you think I should do he said well you
tell me what you want to do I said how
do I figure out he said where you
analyze the problem figure out what you
want to do you come and tell me if you
are right I'll say it's fine if you are
wrong when he didn't finish it I figured
you would fire me but turned out to be
right but then once you tell him and he
agrees he sub T supports you all the way
so when other people you know try to
detract from it I remember he sent me an
email saying so-and-so sent me this
email I think they're trying to do an
end run around you what you want me to
do and you know then he sticks by you I
think that's really great total
ownership and looks for results and I
think this is one of the maximize I
learned a long time ago about how to
deal with your manager don't go to him
with problems go with solutions and
that's absolutely true with Rick well
thank you Rick for
you know seven years of wonderful time
in India and I should also thank man
actually he was quite instrumental in
helping us and I think this is where I'm
looking at in the future all right thank
you in London so next we have Jennifer
and Christian I think they'll get a
chance to rebut some of this fire that
I'm taking oh yeah be careful okay all
right so while they're setting up while
we are setting I'll take the chance to
introduce them so Jennifer chaise is a
distinguished scientist and managing
director I also found a managing
director of ms our new england jennifer
joined MSR with christian in 1997 when
they co-founded the theory group
christian is currently deputy managing
director of our ms are doing the lab and
they are going to jointly talk and i'm
not quite sure how they're splitting up
their topic but they'll do that I guess
that's the way that's the way they work
okay and you guys hear me good I have to
clip her set up I think I'm not that's
interesting okay can people hear me now
good ok so I'm the germ husband in case
you don't know where and once it is on
tables right so when I actually came to
interview here what I realized after
roughly one minute business and he was a
little bit afraid of me and be he really
was trying he was not judging any of my
qualifications the only thing is he
wanted to make sure I'm not like the
previous husband and I think i passed
okay and I think Jennifer will have more
about it so if you want to I wasn't
planning on rebutting so how do we get
this let's see you absolutely you want
to click on no no no I have to do this
c8 sound
link I'm connected to pc 8 just like a
mathematician yes here I'll let a
systems guy I'll let a systems guy do it
you have to give me the girl ogre too
okay so you see i'm no longer wearing
dog collars okay and great and so I I
have all kinds of memories of coming
here coming here and being being being
recruited in 1996 and then trying to
figure out in 1997 with Linda stone and
brick and Dan how we were going to
convince Christian that that Seattle
wasn't you know that the dark side of
the world so I said to Jennifer that I
said looks yepper can't really be zet
nice and exciting a sitter city because
otherwise everywhere in Europe we would
have heard about it and we haven't and
so then Linda sort of us the quarter to
solve their property to help us convince
Christian so but actually the person
really convinced me was nice of us was
with Ric who actually managed to
convince me that microsoft research is
not like some of these you see i'm from
germany and you go do an internship in
some industrial labs here it's
structured okay and so I was very
skeptical about going to Microsoft that
sounded really worse and Rick was really
the one who convinced me that this is a
gorgeous place to be thank you so much
because I'm we are both very happy still
here and we are happy with our new lab I
I know most of the stories that you've
been hearing in this session or about
how these new labs started and got off
the ground most of our talk will really
be about research and about research
freedom the freedom to do crazy things
or things that don't have obvious
connections to Microsoft I did want to
give one anecdote about pitching the the
the New England lab to Rick I went in
and I
had a meeting with him and I pitched
that maybe we should open a lab in
Cambridge and it should focus on the
intersection of computer science with
the social sciences and Rick took a
minute and he looked at me and he said
that's not the stupidest idea I've ever
heard which I don't know Terry whether
you've gotten that occasionally that's
not the stupidest idea I've ever heard
Rick mentioned to me that I should go
talk to Butler who was our one person
who was sitting in Cambridge so I did I
went and I told Butler and I told Butler
this what I thought was a characteristic
Rick's story and Butler said that
doesn't make any sense and I said why
and Butler said well because ten years
ago I pitched to Rick that we should
open a lab in Cambridge and Rick said to
me that's the stupidest idea haha so
that is my story on forming the lab
somehow out of my mouth was a little bit
better than out of Butler's mouth which
tells you that rick has strange a
strange utility function I I think
anyway what I want to talk about is
research freedom I I know that there has
been abstract talk about research
freedom but for me and Christian we have
continued to do research while being lab
directors as Nathan mentioned we did
really bizarre things relative to
computer science we did phase
transitions and we somehow have gotten
from there two things which might be a
little more useful and then went beyond
useful to useless again for Microsoft so
even though there are more useful things
to come hopefully so I'll tell you a
little bit about that so i'll tell you
about phase transitions christian will
tell you the meat of the story with
algorithms and the Steiner tree and then
I'll talk about the cancer cancer
genomics work that we're doing so phase
transitions you know water to ice water
to steam that kind of thing we know now
that phase transitions can also happen
in combinatorial optimization problem so
this was you know nathan cain
to Rick and today an and said I know
this woman who is working on phase
transitions and combinatorial
optimization problems doesn't that sound
relevant right and I got I'm sure he got
that look just that look ok so what our
constraint satisfaction problems for
those of you who know them you'll
understand this for those of you who
don't if there are any of you then you
won't but anyway they're they're just
resources and and constraints their
constraints among these resources the
resources or variables or literals you
could do this randomly you could say oh
I've got n variables or in resources
I've got em constraints I'll draw the
constraints randomly and put them
together what are the odds that when I
do this it's going to be possible to
find a satisfying assignment so you know
if there are lots of resources and very
few constraints then you know not
surprisingly you can satisfy it and if
there are lots of constraints and very
few resources you can't satisfy it and
what's kind of interesting is that
there's a sharp transition so so it
falls off very quickly and it looks a
lot like a phase transition and from a
computational point of view what's
interesting is that the difficulty of
the computation is maximized near the
phase transition so in studying the
phase transition you learn something
about the structure that is making this
problem hard to solve it's a critically
constrained problem until we were
looking we were looking at these things
in our first few years at Microsoft and
there were other people also looking at
these things and in so doing in using
physics which sounds like a bizarre
thing to do to study computer science
problems we gained some insight into how
how these problems work and how to solve
them a lot more efficiently so Christian
will talk about that okay so i will
first tell you a little bit how these
strange algorithms work sort of nice and
would love to listen to it because it's
done by physicists and they know all
these things much
better than us mathematicians or you
computer scientists but so what we are
these algorithms the physicists
developed the physicist will write an e
somewhere for energy obviously so you
have this energy which is a number of
unsatisfied clauses you put a
probability distribution and you try to
solve it and in particular if you food
finds a maximum then you would find the
satisfying assignment if they are some
in otherwise the best you can do and
what is really important here something
called a factor graph which consists of
the owner gets is sing too yeah
something the notes which has a variable
Jennifer head and then em where these
constraints or clauses on the other side
and you links and whenever a variable is
constrained by the constraint and this
graph is sort of a nice little graph and
then belief propagation is something
which passes messages along these edges
here back and forth and magically solve
for this this formula up here okay so I
just show it here to you so you have
some don't really worry what it is you
have some probability distributions
where the variable know something about
the Word and tells the constraint and
the other way around and you pass them
along their you sort of you this
variable collects all the messages and
calculates a little bit sense another
message and it's very nice because it's
actually highly paralyzed of it so they
actually people in Microsoft who try to
put that into as one of the applications
of multi course because in contrast to
other constraint solvers this is highly
paralyzed by and now we come sort of to
to our work and I have to some are
related to Rick so are here's my very
lame attempt so assume you have three
planets which are far away each one
light-year ok and you need to get
something to two of the others okay
let's say you sit solve on the one on
the left here I mean you have
difficulties on this guy and you want to
send it to boces what do you do well you
ask your mathematician friends and say
you need a spanning tree
so you find this minimum tree to connect
that and here it's very clear you have
not much choices it's too light yes okay
but now it turns out actually you forget
you actually have the enterprise
somewhere okay so here in the middle you
park the Starship Enterprise and since I
was signing a release form i had to
remove the picture of the enterprise and
put your dot because otherwise I get
into trouble with Rick for copyright
violations so it was much more fun
before but anyhow we now have it like
this and now we can see what you have to
do well obviously need more fuel because
you're newer places to go to whether
it's actually not true because now you
can go here then sort of start to little
ships to these and if you calculate the
fuel you need it's actually less so that
is called so the starship here is
actually called a Steiner note and this
dino road actually reduces the cost so
this is what does it have to do this
with MSR and Microsoft well it turned
out you have to go on networks okay
let's say you have some computer network
you have some graph mathematical you
have something called term notes which
are places you want to connect with each
other and you have costs and then what
you find is the minimum tree connecting
all this stuff with minimizing this cost
so in this example you see you have to
add three extra notes you want to add
not too many because that other advice
will have huge costs and these extra
nodes are called Stano notes and
Jennifer will tell you what Stan our
nodes have to do with biology but I will
tell you what they have to do with
computers so there are many applications
in networking the simplest you can all
understand is sort of broadcast right
one of the terminals is my server or the
others other to the terminals and you
want to add as little network to it
because that cost and so now they are
variants on it which are important for
biology you don't necessary serve or
customers only which gives you huge
prices so you collect a price for each
terminal you include you have a slight
variation which Jennifer will soon sort
of talk about and now you want to use
this new Idol resin
and this is sounds very nice you try to
write down the factor graph and it's a
little problem so the problem is that
you have this global connectivity
constraint you want to connect everybody
which is a constraint containing
everybody which is not very paralyzed
anymore and actually also just doesn't
work so what we did it's be sort of it's
a few postdocs and Ricardo was one of
the original inventors of these
algorithms be patented in sort of oh
aitte I think we came up with a new
representation which makes this local it
sort of the details are not that
important and once you have said it
turns out that all constraints are local
we can use sort of belief propagation as
before this messages back and forth on
the factor graph and it turns out it
works really nice we tested it on
benchmarks and in contrast to standard
algorithms which are AP based this work
sort of effector thousand better so in
time which means a lot of problems you
now can do which before you couldn't in
a mango sauce jennifer vegetarian give
you five minutes of biological problems
that we've been doing with this okay so
there is a DNA chips and for each
experiment for each experimental
condition you get a chip which lights up
for the proteins that are differentially
expressed that are expressed differently
from what they are in background either
much more or much less and you figure
they are lie on some pathway that has
something to do with the with the
process that that that you're looking at
but there are some proteins that may be
really important for the pathway but
they work in their background amount so
they're not up regulated or
downregulated so how do you know that
these proteins have something to to do
with this and so we treat it as a
Steiner tree problem what we do is we
say the ones that are upregulated or
downregulated are the terminals the
things that we attached prizes too we
have costs which are the you know which
come from knowledge of whether protein I
will interact with protein J typically
in that that organism
and then the extra notes that we insert
we think of as proteins that are
important to the pathway but they're not
up or down regulated okay so we did this
in yeast and yeast is known to have four
or five thousand proteins about 15,000
known protein protein interactions when
we did this we took 56 different
experiments we got a tree for each one
we put them all together and what we got
was this network for the pheromone
response pathway there were two kinds of
proteins the ones that we had basically
put in and then the ones like the
Starship Enterprise okay so that caused
a is the protein that we didn't expect
to be in there that was in there does
that have anything to do with what's
actually going on in yeast so we begged
and begged and begged and we finally
found some people who are willing to go
in and knock out the corresponding gene
and the pheromone response pathway fell
apart so that was experimental proof
okay but who cares about yeast we care
about humans well here is where it's
really nice that we have a fast
algorithm because there are about 25,000
proteins 230,000 protein-protein
interactions and none of the lp methods
work we've talked to lots of biologists
and we've got some now finally who are
able to use our method for this and
we're doing work on the Cancer Genome
Atlas which is about 20 kinds of cancer
the NIH has put put tons of money into
this it's its biggest project now and
people are looking at many different
kinds of cancer the first one that we
started looking at with glioblastoma
which is a very deadly form of brain
cancer it's much more common in men than
in women about four to one it's what ted
kennedy had there are no good drug
targets and the franco lab at MIT used
our algorithm to construct trees for
hundreds of glioblastoma patients put
them together this is what they found
now it turns out that a lot of the
things on the network they found have to
do with known biology but the things
which are not read which are white
didn't get any prize
or penalty and then the ones that are
very large are the ones that are very
central so things are very central but
we weren't putting in there to begin
with for example this this protein here
what is that protein okay it's the
estrogen receptor so this is the first
explanation of sex linkage in
glioblastoma and the experimental proof
is that we put estrogen on glioblastoma
cultures and it seemed to kill the
glioblastoma and we're doing other
things with steiner forest blah blah
blah anyway but it's kind of cool that
the same algorithm to us it's kind of
cool that works for multi casting also
works for cancer for cancer genomics and
it's the kind of thing that Rick if not
encouraged as if not encouraging us to
do he lets us do because along the way
we find many interesting things so this
is part of our journey and thanks for
your attention all right thank you
jennifer and christian so let me get
Gordon up here microphone yep oh and I
want to apologize for leaving I broke a
tooth which means that I have to miss
all the rest of the top it's not gonna
just a jerk who walks out after I sleep
and I don't walk very well either you
ready all right I'm again the one after
dancing
alright so let me introduce Gordon while
he's coming up Gordon Bell is a
principal researcher dem SR as you've
heard earlier he advised Nathan Myhrvold
and helped to hire Ric Ratched but for
some reason i'd like to hear this from
Gordon himself some reason we do not
actually join MSR himself until 1995
Gordon worked at Digital Equipment
Corporation for many years were among
other things he designed the PDP for and
the PDP six and led the development of
the vax mini computer that we heard
about from avi so Gordon right now in
the written in the written rift I tried
to outline my side of the story and I
say substantially Nathan does does a
pretty good job of saying what it's like
I have it in my notebook and I've got to
say well we did the searching at least
the notes in my notebook my typical way
of decision making of a table of people
and some characteristics and Rick was at
the top so we he was very he was really
targeted with in terms of in terms of
the search but we just we traveled
around because fun traveling with Nathan
talking to all these people and
rejecting them hey I just really need to
start by congratulating Rick in terms of
what Emma's are has his turning our has
turned out or is turning out to be on
its on Rick's i would say his second
term esther and we're gonna I'll talk
about his third trimester of his life
later but anyway he's two-thirds he has
a problem of what's what's it going to
do for his lil encore I'm really frankly
honored to be part of part of this of
his organization and and congratulate
him on on the
the way it's turned out to be along with
Nathan the other thing is I think the
you know is this on this third trimester
I hope he doesn't turn into a steer
Roper or endurance writer we've got a
lot of experience there and I think part
of the Microsoft environment as far as I
can see really turns out to be a good
training around for a barrel racer and
that exhaust my understanding of of
equine and and analogies I think in the
spirit of of what we've all heard it's
no surprise that in fact he ended up
recruiting and marrying Terry who he
could delegate and now he has become a
horse rancher anyway so when my fondest
memories of the early tab was meeting
with bill bill bill gates and the tab in
the early tab we were trying to convince
him a bill that there this thing called
the internet was really real and that
Microsoft probably couldn't dominate it
and control all the standards and
everything and then eventually the
market by 1995 the market turned out to
to agree with him and so Microsoft got
with the program at that point the other
thing that happened with the tab was was
that it did a little bit of off-premise
betting that several of us profited from
we made three bets or predictions in 93
and they were the first one was by 1996
video-on-demand would have
half a million subscribers to in to
double three cars that drive themselves
would be sold and 3a I would be
considered more important than the
transistor prediction of course is hard
here now video appeared in in two double
09 it turns out I lost a bet so I can
say that's when it when I think it
appeared and so our three year are close
in prediction turned out to be 15 years
this was off by a factor of five let me
define this factor as our FF or it's
called the ROG fantasy factor we hear
about factors here and so I want to
really mark this one and now Raj was in
good company here because tiger I hear
the story about Tiger today and when it
actually when it was done and when it
actually appeared now cars that drive
themselves may come in by 2023 so let's
make that a fantasy factor of only three
now on the AI bet it's your call I put
that may be at infinity but anyway we'll
we'll see if that ever comes to pass it
only will when we forget that there's
something called a transistor ok now the
part that I completely blew because i
was making these promises about to Rick
about what it's it's a it's a letter
that I wrote I'll say it's my probably
one of my best best letters la Nathan
refers to it I didn't remember that he
wrote a letter I I spent all weekend
writing a letter and he's right it was a
very hard sell it was like you just
can't you know we know is not an
acceptable answer here and so I sent it
to him addressed to him his family and
said you know basically you're going to
do this all right here's why you have to
do it but any
it was a obviously my part was
successful in that now in that letter
the one of the other things other than I
said the page probably okay too is that
the it's going to be really easy to
transfer research into products because
you're so goes there you'll be in the
same same area and so there should be no
problem in that and so you have a
maximal impact in the world by having
all these products come out now when Jim
Gray started the San Francisco lab who I
also think i have have a role in
recruiting we and then Jim talked with
me it was about we really felt strongly
about that we wanted to do essentially
advanced development stuff that would
immediately or could go in and be out
there so that people could use it and
then we would know it would be a
practical thing that people could use
Jim's pterosaur went through the you
know is so in fact it was an ad lab Jim
strattera server went through the
technology transfer all right it became
Google Earth and then several years
before adopted as Microsoft Virtual
Earth and somehow I think there's
something about that which is there's a
DNA within Microsoft of you first need
to get a competitor out there so we can
come from behind this almost in seems to
be an instilled part of the DNA we need
to compete with somebody if you have
something really new there are a few
exceptions it's very difficult to have
find somebody to compete with so in our
own stuff I'm looking for always looking
for
competitors in our own case we the my
life bits has really been a template for
over 20 startups including Evernote that
claimed us as the research arm and every
every couple of weeks or so a new
company engaged in life logging visits
me for advice and occasional for sale
and then but I still expect apples I'd
life is going to have to evolve to such
a state that it will become a
competitive threat and then we will
respond and do very well with and
whether something like this we seem to
want to reject or accept something seems
to be a function of the of the pain the
competition politics and overall just
luck so I watch my colleagues in at the
lab and silicon value trying to birth
dryad link and the corresponding pain of
friends in Australia who are trying to
or would like to use it I think we
should all should wonder a little bit
too whether the distributed environment
that came from Xerox PARC that's always
quoted could actually be come out it
come from Microsoft if so with the
transfer have the same fate as as the
Xerox transfer or lack thereof what
about Siri or Watson could those things
have come or how do they come from from
the lab yeah it or do we care because
the products product DeMint demands are
not there yet what to me is exciting
probably our most recent and valuable
transfer certainly is the is the connect
because it truly is something that that
it took the research to make it work
certainly you have people there that had
a product vision is clear what they
wanted to
you but in fact this is a case of not
having the technology to do it and that
was the critical link that made made it
work nicely with with with research to
products I use by the way our sin scam
and collage both chem from Cambridge and
gadget ears something I'd like to use if
I had time incense cams case the
Cambridge camera was superior to the
commercial one that was transferred so
is it necessary to carry our research as
far away from Redmond as possible to
have it product so this is a direct
product to market transfer as a product
product as an internal transfer and it's
something I hope will continue to
consider as as XC is done in you know in
his case by the way an example of this
strategy is the fact that Dave Cutler
who's was referred to earlier is that
Microsoft in 1982 when Dave was working
for me at digital was in his as he often
does gets a little bit perturbed and as
a manager I knew how to deal with him
basically give him anything he wants I
said okay Dave you don't like it here
with all these all these people you know
this bureaucracy we've got all these
people go anywhere you want do anything
you want to do take anybody with you you
want and he chose Bellevue and that's
why Dave Dave pretty much is is here I
think that's why we've got so not these
remote labs such as Egypt and India that
I really expect great things things from
now about your next room last trimester
certainly within 20 years
there's going to be my machine classes
out there that are in the order of
trillions of computers that is there
will be a a platform built with that and
so my law of birth and death of computer
classes allows me to certainly explain
the 60-year path and I think the the
next year next 20 years at the time when
the computer itself disappears because
we can clearly see that by that time it
all of the at least the electronics part
of today's computers will be no more
than a millimeter cube if if that
including the battery probably and
anyway in the paper I mention of several
potential platforms that will come into
existence that will are possibilities
for for some for some of these platforms
I hope that we in fact are are more than
a more than a component of those
although i think the kinect technology
is certainly a candidate for our
component for part of them so like much
of our progress in computing we really
are building we very often are building
things for ourselves and I think that
frankly I think that no other norther
group and and leadership is more capable
than taking on this charge of looking at
these particular things that come in
fact in the same notebook the same day
and are the same period that i was at
microsoft working with Nathan I outlined
a robot Attila telepresence robot that
in fact is just coming into existence a
day and at that time Nathan said gee
that's really far out it didn't look
very far out to me but in fact in my own
fantasy
factors yeah what I thought would be
here in you know ten years ago is now
one of these bodies that say there in
twenty year and this time frame and
certainly will be prevalent within the
next next two decades that those those
anteroom more fake real physical robots
will will roam the earth and and I hope
that I hope they I hope their brain has
a little bit of Microsoft software in it
thank you all right Thank You Gordon so
we're going to take another short break
let's resume at four o'clock so about a
15-minute break</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
