hey there this is Seth Juarez and i'm
here at the microsoft research faculty
summit 2015 and i'm here with these two
distinguished gentlemen let's start with
the first thing computational
rationality I've heard that term before
what does it mean from the cognitive
psychology perspective and then from the
machine perspective for me there's sort
of three components to this idea that
are really in common I see them as
representing a kind of a synergy or a
synthesis of convergence of ideas in
cognitive science in AI and also into
some extent in neuroscience and to me
those three ideas are one the idea that
we can understand intelligent behavior
as a certain kind of rational action but
I think coming to both of us is an idea
that maybe you could associate with like
the foundations of economics and early
the mathematics of probability the idea
that intelligence is something about
forming beliefs and using those beliefs
to achieve your desires and then
formalizing beliefs and desires in terms
of the mathematics of probability and
utility theory and that but then there's
the idea that if you're going to build
an intelligent agent either artificial
or natural that tries to it has its
overarching goal to maximize expect
utility in the real world for the kinds
of problems that confront us that is
incredibly difficult and then there's
this third idea that you want to be
smart and even rational about how you
approximate your rationality in the 20th
century saw some really interesting
thinking that went on outside the realm
of computability or computation and one
theory for what one does in a complex
world where we as people or a machine as
an agent is uncertain about what's going
to happen what the world looks like in
considering actions there's a model of
ideal action to take that came out of
theoretical foundations of what was
called utility theory and over the
decades there was a bifurcation early on
in AI because it didn't seem those
formal models could be computed very
easily where do the probabilities about
different states of the world come from
what's the objective function how do you
compute these things you know with the
scarce resources we had to compute and
so some of the interesting motivating
work that came out of the 1950s and
1960s and 70s looked at bounded rational
system systems that couldn't possibly
from the point of view of the designers
do the right thing collect enough
evidence or mushy or information to be
rational and those kind of a discarding
of that whole view point was that must
be think about machinery that helps a
person get through life with your wrist
Ock's what works well what are some
patterns of logic that might be useful
what kind of patterns might be matched
in a very very ad hoc way you might say
but what happened in the 80s late 80s
was the rise of interest in science of
bounded rationality and the way Josh I
look at this is what happens when you
put a computational lens on scientific
theories of rationality you started
saying well listen I need to come up
with certain kinds of approximations I
need to offline or in real time have a
layer that reflects about how to do
things because I can't do it all and
even have to worry about how complex
that is in itself and then I need to
sort of learn and figure out where I put
resources of various kinds collecting
information looking data thinking more
is there evidence in human cognition
that that's how humans behave that they
have this past model and this slow model
and they they actually decide when to
use either or I mean it's through some
combination of evolution and early
development you know in some sense our
brick like vision is something we're
heavily optimized for right and the
trade-offs of how you combine the bottom
of the fast bottom-up system and the
slower top-down model based system in
some sense evolution already like the
meta rationality there is done by
evolution but then there's things which
are more like what we think of as
thinking right like planning like
deciding okay you know how am I going to
get you know when i wake up from where i
was staying last night how am i going to
get here today am i going to drive down
the highway or am i gonna take the slow
route
the human mind operate in a way that at
times will resort to richer slower
potentially more precise or less
familiar situations in a more
computationally intensive way yeah vs
sometimes flipping to a quick reflex and
recognition for example and I think
there's evidence and people have been
studying in psychology and have results
along these lines that there are some
fast twitch and slow deliberative
systems and it's unclear you know what
all the machinery is that guides you you
can see this in that in navigation
though right i mean like because you you
know when you're you sometimes you're
just sticking to the roots that you know
and other times you have to actually
have to stop and think and look at a map
and plan and think about is are going to
be more or less traffic I mean this
money that's one so that's one example
which is inciting in humans and other
animals and there are different brain
systems there are some systems which you
know what some parts of the brain which
really do a kind of planning many people
core AI researchers yeah mr. jeez I'd
say I want to do artificial intelligence
to make that my career are
foundationally motivated by mysteries of
the human mind that they find within
themselves within people they work with
even their their pets they're the
vertebrate animals we what we have in
our homes are just incredible and if
you're if you study physics or biology
or chemistry it's often a huge gap to
explaining what is going on within this
piece of human mind it's clearly a
biological system but we have very
little understanding from the point of
view of the foundations that was true
for me early in my life where I went up
to the neuroscience and biophysics into
neurosciences but quickly said you know
I'm go computational because I think
that that's the best path to figuring
things out and someday yeah I thought
could it be a it might be a hundred
years it might be a thousand years I
want to come back to the mysteries of
mind should I not understand them yet
through computation and come look at
human minds and other other vertebrate
features and not
have naturally evolved it's unclear as
to when the reentry for the I researcher
would be to look at results from
knowledge we that's the claim you both
think now yeah now there's a two way and
it's not one way it's a it's a two-way
street yeah where the prospect for a
unifying vision and one that we propose
as one potential perspective is one of
computational rationality where we have
systems whether they be human biological
i should say more generally or machine
are grappling under great uncertainty
they're trying to do the best they can
there is some representation of belief
or likelihood in the world and the some
notion of an objective functions being
cared about over time and all sorts of
limitations in resources the ability to
think how much time is left to before
you need to make a decision cost-benefit
trade-offs in timely action versus
delayed action in the world and we can
maybe understand both the biologic the
biology and the computation as a broader
computational framework will call in
competition rationality sort of finish
up yeah 30 seconds future of AI each of
you I've you AI as kind of a the crest
of the crashing crest of the wave of
computer science so you look at at how
much computation has done for our
society for socio economics in
applications like health care the
broader biomedical sciences been
incredible AI we're doing more we're
doing we're doing more and more of the
things people consider only smart people
could do
will change so many things with that
comes a lot of hope a lot of possible
benefits and also some concerns with
potential disruptions of a variety of
kinds will this technology remove
different whole sectors of jobs in the
future will machines become so powerful
and smart that they can't be turned off
and they come to outwit man these are
important and interesting questions that
need to be solved along the way but I
expect largely positive beneficial
results coming out of this research
largely because we guided these
technologies in the hands of humans and
we've got the technology I think if
we've learned anything from the past
history of AI it's that trying to
predict the future history of AI is kind
of losing game right um it's hard to
know where you're going or how long it's
going to take or even when you'll know
that you've gotten there right but I
think you know looking both at the past
and what we see going on right now
that's most exciting and next steps you
know again I'm sort of an optimist about
these things I I'm not going to make
predictions about what what we're going
to get to when but this idea that AI is
both an engineering discipline and the
science or you might think of it as
providing a lot of the technical
foundations behind the science of how
the mind works right there sort of
artificial intelligence and there's
biological intelligence and I think
we've we've learned this a few times now
and I think we know what I hope is that
we've learned it in a deeply
internalized way that will stay with us
through the future is that these fields
have a lot to say to each other and that
if we keep them in register right if we
keep if AI researchers keep looking at
biological intelligence for inspiration
about the problems to solve and the
kinds of solutions and if the people
studying biological intelligence keep
looking to AI and engineering for the
for the tools and the language in which
to form their theories and to think
about their experiments right then I
think that's going to be a really
productive synergy that can take us to
many interesting place this is awesome
thanks so much for spending some time
with us thanks for watching and we will
catch you next time take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
