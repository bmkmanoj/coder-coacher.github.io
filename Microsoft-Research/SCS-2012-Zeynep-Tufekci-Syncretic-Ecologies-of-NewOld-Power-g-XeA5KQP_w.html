I wanted to focus a little bit about
some of the interesting inflection
points that see in terms of how old
power and new power are coming together
and you're trying to look for the right
word for this because in Turkish there's
like a perfect word to describe what all
the new stuff come together I can really
find one in English I thought maybe I
could just get things using tours and
pretending they're untranslatable but
probably syncretic is the best word I'm
looking for because what's happening
often reminds me of my discovery of a
Latin American Catholicism was really
not what I had learned in Europe or you
know what I see of Catholicism because
it's this remix of indigenous traditions
and the Catholic Church kind of
coexisting little one sista they're not
there amalgamated in some statics but
you can see the distinct parts working
together you have all sorts of new ways
of power that wouldn't have occurred
without one or the other and this is our
famous baby of bottle of the Virgin of
Guadalupe and if you look at the images
there are a lot of indigenous you know
pre-christian T symbolism going on to
this as well as state obvious immaturity
I look at it this is how about American
proposed in Baltimore suit you have you
know lay people leading church in ways
that probably would not be recognizable
too many people in our traditional
European Catholic churches so this is
kind of what I'm thinking and I will
talk about one aspect of the system and
I'm just going to sort of I've learned
that it's best if I just start by giving
away what I'm going to talk about and
try to go from there and I want to say
I'm the only person using a pc everybody
else's mad people it is kind of a him
what I usually normally want statistics
and zero impulse of aggression blah blah
blah but I had to show any of that I
went through my presentation and took
out most of the words and numbers but
after watching the Ignite box out a
little thing like is not going to work
and I'm an academic and I tell people
usually our presentations are figured at
12 points we want you know that our
centers are pretty low on that but
yesterday's thoughts were so great i
said okay I'm going to try to not do one
of those but I want to talk about how we
have these all the new forms of focuses
acting and I'm going to talk about this
in the case of how it's working in
social movements and the Arab uprisings
and give couple of examples from there
by focuses I mean things that make us
look at something
talk about this problem and everyone was
asking why about the same problem and of
course you know the widest most like
things that eat the most love is the
same issue because if anything what
social media does is create enormous
influx of information visual stuff and
you can really need to wait for social
media name um 20 years ago there was
already too much a hundred years ago
there was already too much smart those
British accents make us think of that
and he was living of life doing what he
was doing successful business when they
are praising in the other Arab countries
also spread to Syria and he started
acting anonymously Sudan easily as a
spokesperson so he was getting
interviewed by NPR who was getting
interviewed by a Dec all sorts of very
key traditional focuses that kind of
goes back to Ethan's point about rich
people but a lot of rich people like
Ronnie don't tweet in both languages
don't speak in both my you just he when
he doesn't see exclusively tweets in
English but takes his contact from the
Arabic world from Syria where he knows
please join us in Syria can man who's
pretty dangerous and he's hoping and
trying out to be a Discoverer but he was
discovered and lucky for him somebody
called him said Roy so somebody on the
inside who ever discovered him there
were some bday
within that organization called and said
are you Alexander page and he said yeah
I am because if somebody's asking they
know and thanks to said 11 right now so
he grabs my mogul daughter hands of time
six months and his wife brand to Lebanon
probably like loosen an inch of his life
you won't like Houston that were an hour
late there would be no you wouldn't be
alive quite likely so he has deep to
Lebanon and then he went to Cairo where
he is now in exile and there's a lot of
cases of people like him that I've seen
I know bar greenies in Cairo I know
Egyptians who want to teach during the
uprising and there's a network of people
who are going around and even though
there are some linguistic barriers well
like air was just the same language he's
also active in Egyptian now
protectionist even Tahrir but mainly he
acts as a reporter a bridge that people
have known to trust so december 10 is
traveling to qatar for a conference
that's organized partially my university
i believe me but it's a tricky it's
something that should be no problem
there's traveling there where I see this
tweet this is oh and it says I can stop
and go airport and I'm told I'm not
allowed entry and they will get down
persuade my homeland to Syria now I
don't know how many of you are not
American citizens so you try to welcome
to the Turkish Passport immigration the
border is a no man's land legally very
often in fact if you follow the case of
the cheap April blog even for American
citizen it can be a no man's land lolz
there are pretty different and you will
have an immigration officer who have
pretty much absolute power over me
decisions not you don't really have to
cross even in the United States the way
you would expect let alone in Qatar so
what happened was even though we had is
supposed to have and he's invited you
know by a pretty big entities in Qatar
from immigration officer is looking at
this and saying you don't have staff
number blah blah blah blah blah blah on
your blah blah blah blah because they're
not immigration officers work but
according to the international legal
framework if you are deported from your
country for some other country you get
that next your country of origin you
don't get sent back to where you came
from you are Syrian Asian national you
get sent back to Syria so this was his
second tweet where he's really
frustrated and saying I don't send me
back to Syria send me back to each apply
19 I don't have to attend your
conference but I cannot go back to Syria
and the immigration
they're saying according to rule number
57 30,000 here blah blah blah we're
putting you on a plane to Syria your
Syrian that's where you go he's stuck so
at this point we can't I mean bunch of
us who Union were following this we
started the seals are a lot of people
started discussing what can we do what
can we do because Iran me insane Qatari
immigration and it's middle of the night
and Qatar what do you do so there was a
lot of attempts to try to contact their
people contacting the US Embassy what
what's the u.s. embassy going to do you
know wait till the morning and maybe
call some Qatari officials going to
brawl by then is good in Syria and you
won't even have time to have a free
Rodney hashtag because it's just going
to be dead so clear that because he's so
awesome but he's so long gone that's not
going to happen so there's like um I
couldn't really get a I had like a
screenshot this is not it but they're
like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
of tweets people trying to figure some
stuff out so we had basically a secret
program we have a 20th century pro you
know it's a comcast / arka see sending
somebody to start them torture and death
and these things can get fight we have
this 21st century network mostly
operating through Twitter because if you
want to speed it's really good and you
do this usually I've been involved in
couple things like this and you try to
do this on Twitter computer and email
there's a lot of replication and
application if you do on Twitter
everybody knows what you're doing so you
don't have to then explain to people
okay somebody contacted the US Embassy
you guys came back of that nice chord
angel so I turns out that we needed a
17th century solution we needed a shake
he really give it a shake it turns out
that sometimes too saw the 20th century
call you need your 21st century and
their work to grab a shame and I mean
like a shape so this is chucky who's
also in lebanon uh he's a Syria then he
said and any idea what happening at this
point because we weren't having bad
chatting discussions to but it's like
all right people he's a fan of
influential people aren't win his game
now if you don't know him you wouldn't
know from his father account that it was
taken care of but our network knew what
was going up week calm everybody down
thing okay you're fine because at the
same time we got al jazeera english we
get al jazeera everything we got CNN
remorse you've got lots of people on the
case but none of those people can get it
out of being sent back to Syria to make
a story of body will be this touching
story about the vet type of a
nine-month-old baby that's not what we
want it turns out we really needed a
shape and this is kind of the image I
have of the shake it turns out this area
bake or maybe like this I don't know I
mean watch
I you know I might be a jerk but I got
my hurry into a side I cannot pick up a
towel because everybody always asks me
like do you write camel with Turkey we
like I've never seen a camel except once
in my life and that would look to your
speech because piercings are capitals in
Turkish cigarettes camel back from
Turkey has a picture of a camel well
there are no cameras in Turkey and the
cattle to that comes from Bulgaria
excited look for Campbells I'm probably
shape we got through it to the airport
in are also he called what happened was
our network found someone who had the
connection and the guts to call a shape
in Qatar in the middle of the night
right so somebody call a shake in the
middle of the night to am walking up and
say well I don't know what is that like
I have a conversation in my head that
feels like to be Nietzsche but probably
not
I'm really really sorry really really
really sorry but we need you our shape a
sympathetic to the cause and realizing
there's no other way we're going to get
this resolved before the morning
otherwise probably got one of his like
know what he was driving and went to the
airport and plucked him and he just told
the immigration bureaucracy people all
right all right move aside and the 20th
century bureaucracy crumble before the
17th century power and he plucked him
out of immigration and he's that right
so he was able to get out and even got
an apology for it so him stuff you know
of the SAP story about the guy with the
nine month old daughter who got deported
killed that would have been a touching
and horrible story I get to tell kind of
like a after it's done so this was what
happened now I want to sort of I like
something here right the 21st century
network thing worked and worked and
worked so we got the last level we
needed somebody to go make that phone
call to wake up that shape just connect
us to hook up to old powder and a lot of
times when I've seen sort of need
media-based activism become politically
powerful it's when it packs the system
so that it can happen to the old powers
to channel them or to distribute them to
use them in ways that wouldn't have been
possible say 10 years ago so there is a
new game in town there's a new player in
town
wait but it's sort of MLB mating into an
old game so I want to talk about two
cases of the last mile problem and I
just sort of added this out I took a lot
of people yesterday and I excited I
would talk a little bit about the hot
damn last mile problem and this is the
visualization eres gay lot this is a
social club they really do need
visualization and analysis of foam as a
lot of sort of key political moment that
we would have otherwise yet and he was
nice enough to blog about them and I
what was the words like those syllables
I like them all the time in my
presentation this is a kid do you guys
remember when bin Laden was assassinated
there was an announcement that the White
House was going to make an outfit at
nine o'clock on a sunday was really
weird what on earth are they doing nine
o'clock in a sunday and there's this
huge discussion on twitter the cool kids
Oh until this tweet maybe I can show it
to you guys live now um Keith Urban who
is a former um 82 Rumsfeld got on the
phone with prolly Rumsfeld and learn
what happened we show you sweet probably
flying this on yep see there you go so
he tweeted yes now you see tweeted like
hundred million times now but at the
time Keith Urban had how many followers
couple thousand less less you know maybe
880 something like that so he was not a
big guy on the net
he's just somebody but see the thing is
he was being followed by brian Stelter
who was what i call these curator power
like Andy Carvin these are people who
are watching people who are probably
watching people right and because um
brian Stelter was following him resume
brian Stelter was following Keith Urban
in this visualization what you're seeing
is it looks like keith urban that we
tweeted a lot and grind speltzer who's
the new york times reporter retweeted
that big lots but this is a little
misleading if you look at it this way
with this kind of specialized now if you
look at temporally and there's a nice
visualization of that to thank you it's
great when you don't have to do all the
work and other people to these things
for you so this is the gynecological
determination where you see is the web
is buffing with because I existing one
he's a good off you have been louder so
the blue Sargon laws and reds are
Qaddafi and until this moment it's like
going neck to head Keith Urban tweets
that is that eight hundred followers are
not too many people are following him
brian Stelter who is a reporter said
wait a minute this guy's rumsfeld x you
know chief of staff i believe so this
must be true and once brian Stelter
amplifies it the web guff oh it's been
loving right and it just goes like that
and i think was in three to five minutes
people who are like a bitch in mark so
the power there was a curator power and
that seems like one
didn't cover occupy because he covers
Middle East he's like a curator a call
to a local historian which is not a bad
word either for Middle East uprisings
when he wouldn't go rock my Lots actives
were upset and it was like a people I
work seven days a week you know 17 hours
a day I have two small kids and I oh you
know seven why I don't even have any
extra time he dealt work seven days
knowing if you follow his twitter feed
the reason occupy people were upset was
that without that curated power they
were more likely to be ignored because
you have that last mile issue how do you
get to all power I think your Police
Department and you see days police
department realize we're going to solve
this problem for them let's create some
really nasty videos of us meeting of
students I mean you know they're just
August Leon are protesters and create
mainstream attention which is what
happened until those things happen if
you look at sort of the media courage
until those things happen and you got
mainstream media attention you see sort
of occupied and I have been talking to a
lot of people that people were getting a
little like okay we're just going to
fizzle out and then there was a spike in
response to a game being cooked into a
media box it's this combination the
other inspector case that is actually
look at top ten case the focus is in
play are you have their regular report
and use paper started using the Senate
the period any question was buying stuff
from
your time you have the network who
recognizes the value you have the power
of algorithmic focuses I think twitter's
trending topics is a new player in that
it's an algorithmic focus sir it tells
you this is what's going on that's why
such a valuable space that's why when
something's not trending a lot of people
are like we wanted the trend or people
want something there's always comes with
accusations of is it censoring is it not
it's kind of complicated how it works so
that's an E power do and you have even
Rumsfeld ex-chief of Stephanies in play
now my final case of focus is 1 i've
written about so i'm not going to talk
about this at length this is a friend of
mine in an egyptian-american greater she
was abducted in egypt around the
protesting no that's our dunno member 19
and she was able to send out this tweet
beaten arrested at interior ministry by
borrowing a cell phone of her activists
with Khan in there to negotiate again
you saw this middle of the night in
Egypt and we started with an he we
started to a hashtag free modem this is
in my blog so I'm not going to go at it
that length but I want to use one aspect
of it and three Mona in 20 minutes was
trending worldwide kind of interesting
in 20 minutes sir she's a wanted Mahmoud
Street she gets to tweet this out and we
have the sort of global attention but of
course and we had a lot of reporters and
we have lots of people covering this but
this was the case
nemo Muslim outspoken feminist she's a
very very outspoken dissident in terms
of being a google and very identified so
I thought you know she's in pretty
immediate danger so we need to again
find someone then immediately and we I
was in touch with a lot of activists in
Egypt like there's a great no military
trials organizations there's a lot of
people who were each of who said okay
tomorrow morning we'll go we'll check
all the police stations will try to
recover so this wasn't just sort of
there was a lot of and now we're
connected again I rich and all about
this i'm not going to go on long but
this is the part i wanna i like is that
we again had a last mile problem how do
you push out a US citizenship right she
had this privileged position and we're
thinking how can we use this privilege
to try to get her out of here as soon as
possible and for that you need the US
State Department and you have a last
mile problem there how do you get to the
US the State Department it's like lose
was Sunday night well I knew some people
and let me believe some people and we
also need anne-marie slaughter is a
former adviser for innovation to Hillary
Clinton whose great on Twitter so we
were like are you awake every she's like
yes and she was able to call and say
people pay attention to this now and
they were able to there's a whole
backstory to this to get to their
contacts we began the last model right
like somebody the US passport and you
have the US State Department acting it
but you need to display so in mona you
had all the steps going in what this can
create in terms of changing again sort
of start to end the story and 10 without
it was only broken hands and sexual
assault you know so that's kind of like
it this is what to show you how brutal
things can be egypt we consider this a
relatively good outcome that she only
had her hand broken and sexually
assaulted instead of all the other
possibilities that we were thinking
about the other things do happen to lots
of people who don't necessarily have the
same privileges as her which is the
global audience the US passport all of
that a platform and that yes it needs
the Pillsbury Doughboy t-shirt that's an
astounding linking to bloggers hang my
things or people we want to get it and
send my from the big guy yeah this extra
t-shirt for her and so our pictures is
my book love me freeze me take me home I
think this is hilarious after she's out
so what this is creating in many cases
this is for the interesting phenomenon
of the microcell every citizen
journalist activist and they're not
necessarily always as privileged like
normal of the New York is not from Egypt
in sandwiches live there so you think
well with this what does this work for
let's take someone in Bahrain which is
an ongoing Gary brutal crackdown and we
have these interesting cases of people
that I think of well maybe not Angelina
Jolie's my example
no service this sort of focusing power
she goes something and forgive people
follow works and she uses that often to
raise awareness but think of someone
like that and make a kind of a
journalist but not a nuclear stock
journalist again kind of an activist key
journalist but activists activists
journalists and what do you get when you
get invited al-khawaja and yeah we have
the same name but Arabic it's with Abby
and twisting angry Arabia it really
worthwhile following her her um I was
something like you want to know why
errors are angry at me right she is
she's the great there's not a great
twitter feed and she goes to every
protest she's from a very prominent
family of dissidents and at the moment
let's see her husband's in jail her
brother-in-law's in jail her father's in
jail and all the torture her father is
sentence of life and my cousin's jaw
broken six place of things like that her
husband's trial is continuing until we
got in four years and his family so that
she's out there all the time and this
church the next often this is her a lot
of times there's the waters ongoing
protests every day in bahria the amount
of sort of resistance that your movie of
the
those is something you might have missed
if you're not following it through the
alternative view doesn't get covered as
much but this line of right police on
their way to a village where there's a
protest and Santa Paul Khawaja is in the
Ohio sworn fairly commonly by the
protesters in Bahrain would participate
if they don't normally wear it's a way
of establishing a different kind of
power to and she's there stepped in
front of a longer ride police are making
the victory sign in not moving this is
two days after she and it was christoph
did go to bar mated interviewed her so
she's got even higher visibility at this
point what this picture gets out and i
watch this in real time this picture
circulating there's a lot of questions
about what's happening to worse and i
watched the media to shave of far
raining DC grumble about this like they
knew this was going around and there was
the fair said to arrest her but they
could really are a stir because they
didn't have enough female police and
she's like she's not practicing sort of
more active Felicity was not cooperating
so they dispatched female police to come
drag her but in the half an hour between
this and the time that the female police
got an iWatch this in this one we have
some actual information the barbarian
authorities were like doing arrested you
don't want this picture and you know
tomorrow's near tongues is the powerful
picture so they didn't arrest her
police can you get faster either right
they either have to drive her or
becoming and a want more so this much
but I can't live on that arrested this
is another protest where there's
pictures like that she went there and
then they dragged her at white this time
but they didn't know he was being fell
because this is a medical large area but
there was video effect and everybody was
sure including her sister who's an exile
she's doing a couple years of junk with
the bomber you get couple years she was
released once again so it's kind of like
 like this my personal liberty
activist it's a complicated thing she's
hard to arrest for the bottom any regime
but if you don't arrest her she's a
problem too it's not like you know she
goes away he's sort of microscale dirty
activist and I know couple now that you
said that we were tortured because
sources I mean Allah said this that last
by Allah who fought son who's also was
Egyptian actors whose jail once and 2006
and also recently in both cases he said
probably attention to his gaze might
have had kept longer but not tortured
there was another recent case raza I'm
Islamic Syria and again she said
probably she said she wasn't tortured
most likely her opinion because of this
Lisa
culture is so common metal coils you
know speak for that the point isn't
though and I want to make this August
point is none o one person is fair
torture because these regimes will you
know there's lots of people they are
torturing so having you know i'm not
saying also just solve the problem
because they will go and torture other
people they will go and kill other
people so you are not solving the
problem of torture or the problem of
killing of dissidents because you cannot
solve it like this but what it does is
create these people with these cocoon of
somewhat look particular absolutely but
some global protection can go everywhere
with a camera in their hand you see so
you're increasing the movement capacity
document to use my facility activist
again this is not on nothing solution to
these regimes tortured goes by
definition because of attention economy
that can only be so many of these people
right this kind of international
attention it's an unequal things that
unfair thing and in reality the way
horses you know only a few people get
this kind of visibility what they can do
that is to continue to be the sort of
mixture of journalists develop
13 and activist so um and Ronnie said
you know even when he was an integration
he was doing his Twitter feed will
slammed my people that told him
basically you know what ever happened to
do we're not going to forget about this
and that's often very important to know
that you're not going to be locked in
the kind of either linguistic or
censorship of pets that these machines
can create for you and you know then I
thought you know a little uncheck good
by the way plus anybody makes this is
easy she has a two-year-old daughter so
she also gets arrested but she don't get
arrested she gets jail her cousin is
already in jail look huge what's
happening is that a great human cost so
they did these people have repeatedly
said that this kind of media attention
and hacking into all power and you power
is how I interpreted it is a way for
them to keep doing what they can do for
their cause in a way that probably would
have been very hard ten twenty years ago
so this was my thing but i want to add
the to the political part and we need go
in this political parties in apparently
some time sheets to get that powerful
tension in this power of old media and
combined and well I guess I'll time is
really interesting world the way these
things are happening and
