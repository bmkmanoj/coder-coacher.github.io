good thing to maximize here's a radical
idea rather than personal wealth how
about personal happiness I love teaching
I think I'm pretty good as a professor I
probably I might be a terrible
entrepreneur so I think relatively early
on I said that was my value system and I
remember as I think back now early on
when my good friend John Hennessy who's
not president Stanford when we were
doing this reduced instruction set
computer stuff that was talking about is
some guy came by to talk to me and I
just went to my standard pitch about I'm
not probably good i like being a
professor i wanna stay there and you
know and i probably missed an
opportunity to start a company with John
because John said oh yeah we start
companies at Stanford so so yeah it's
been part of my fos is that to be happy
I was going to university as gonna teach
shape young students lives and what's
comforting is you know 34 years later
I'm really happy with that decision I
you know I whenever some one of my
former students those great things I
take all the credit for everything
they've done but you know it makes MX
field so I yeah I'm happy with my
decision</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
