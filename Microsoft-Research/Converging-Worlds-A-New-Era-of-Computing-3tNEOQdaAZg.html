annual set of visits that I make the
universities for years I've done this in
order to be able to share some of our
ideas about what's going to happen in
the future and also to listen to the
student and faculty and administrators
well this is several big trends I think
happening in computing it affects
everybody whether it's a worker at home
one is the arrival of huge amounts of
data and the computational capabilities
accessible to virtually everybody now
and this is essentially a 3d tool where
you can make your own movies of your
analysis of very large data sets so in
this case we took all the same rainfall
data and we made a guided tour where we
essentially going to fly through this
data computers actually now are smart
enough to be able to study things like
medical images and be able to extract
not just information but to organize the
pictures and you can find it internal
organs another big trend is natural user
interaction people have been pointing
and clicking and typing for a long time
but now we want more natural ways to
interact with our computers in the new
Windows Phone one of the things that
we're doing is taking a number of
features related to giving the phone for
the eyes and ears and applying them to
helping people get things done and so
some of the features will show is the
ability for the phone to recognize
objects and to translate that
information in Microsoft you know we
call this the transition from the
graphical user interface so the natural
user interface or GUI the nuit I think
the one thing which I really liked was
the evolution of the natural user
interface and how we're moving beyond
you know typing on a keyboard for more
natural in fact in the devices and
that's going to be quite fascinating
going forward one of the tricky parts
about merging the physical world and the
virtual world is finding ways to make it
easy to move back and forth another
capability will show as 3d scanning
capability
connect technology from xbox but using
it not just for gameplay but to allow me
to manipulate physical models or even
transport be into other virtual
environments I was really surprised by
this video scanner and the speed that it
performs it activities add and actually
all the Cape about it is to basically
design an object with this recently we
introduced it avatar connect where you
can use the camera to animate your
avatar send it out to meet people in
other 3d environments and I think this
is the beginning of what will become a
more robust telepresence experience over
time once connect was introduced it
represented a dramatic change the
accessibility of the technologies for
computers to see as a result we saw
developers around the world get excited
about using the camera for all kinds of
the things some other crazy and fun some
of them very serious so the ability to
have computers that can really see in
three dimensions is a revolutionary
capability you know when I come to a
campus and talk about these things we
hope that they'll really begin to focus
their own energies on how they can use
these things not just in their school
work but as they think about you know
going on and getting jobs and getting
excited about what they do for the rest
of their life that this will be an
integral part of way they think about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
