managed the Applied Sciences group here
at Microsoft and jovan my colleague
Moshe let's to be like a window
essentially using digital technology to
give the user the illusion that the
object or person that they're looking at
is standing right there in front of them
one must implement three very unique
techniques the first technique is called
stereopsis and this is where each eye
gets its own unique image the second
technique is called a view dependent
rendered image it is it's essentially
parallax and what it is is if you change
the view that the person is looking at
as a function of their head relative to
the frame so when you're looking through
a window it looks like so and the third
image is called focal accommodation and
this is where the objects that you're
focusing on are at the proper depth and
the proper focus today we're just going
to show you the first two techniques in
this research prototype that implements
those two techniques simultaneously so
here we have a 3d display that we've
created a Microsoft using our own unique
optics technology called wedge optics
and because we know where the user is
relative to the display because we use a
head tracking technology and in this
case connect we're able to turn on the
right LEDs for the user to put the right
image at the right I depending on where
the user is so for example as most
Moose's head left and right and the
camera you're indeed looking at two
strikes and those two stripes are indeed
to you very unique images the left eye
on the right eye and they're fine you
can see they're actually following most
so these beams of light are being
steered out an air using this wedge
optics and thereby creating a 3d display
the stereopsis effect without the use of
glasses super cool i'm really excited
about this technology the second
technique is this view dependent
rendered image and here we have to
change this live view as a function of
where most of looking at the pending
where his head is and to do that will
we've actually taken this motorized rig
and physically moving the cameras around
so when most turns his head left he's
looking at the left side of the teapot
and when he turns right he's looking at
the right side of teapot the combination
of these two techniques really creates a
sense of illusion the sense of realism
that the objects that you're looking at
are indeed there so the combination of
these two techniques
the ability of creating a stereopsis
image where you're sending in a unique
image one to the left on one of the
rights or I die without the use of
glasses plus this you dependent rendered
image working simultaneously using a
live stream gives the user the the
illusion that the object or person that
they're interacting with is physically
right there standing in front of them
and it gives you the ability to look
around the person and look around the
room that that that the person is in and
brings the communication between these
two individuals to the next level where
they can interact in a much more natural
and seamless way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
