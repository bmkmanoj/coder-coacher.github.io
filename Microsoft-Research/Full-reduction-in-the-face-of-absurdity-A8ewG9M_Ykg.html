you
ha i changed the title of my talk to
pushing the bounds of subtyping because
it's the first part of the toka
originally thought to give this is some
of it is based on drunk work with
Virginia Clayton and a Gabrielle the
donut subtyping i think is the sick in
the 60s although it's so natural
conservation should have been ideas
before but the first formation of
subtyping is in 80 by john reynolds and
then in 84 gak up there he came with his
language Humber if I had a lot of
amazing features so it look very
complicated however I think it was very
simple especially if we look with you
compared to what kind of language is we
trying to develop today the reason why
it was kind of easy it's because type
system was based on simply lying on the
calculus and subtyping so there is this
subtyping over the program estate as
type tau and then tau sub type of tile
Prime when they are subtitle prime so
typing is a binary relation and in a
simply not calculus it's a very simple
it's built from axioms that brings into
the subtyping relation some facts in a
real language without something like you
into the subtype of float and then some
structural holes to propagate subtyping
relation to type constructors this is
the well-known contravariant rule for
our site that says to arrow types are in
relation if the domains are in the
subtyping relation in the domain are in
the inverse relation I'm skipping a lot
in an essential part of the story of
course because Humber and many other
features especially record subtyping on
records concatenation and records that
played a key role for semantics mean
cuttings of objects and multiple
inheritance but this is not the point i
want to make beer in fact I'm brought
many more features it also had recursive
types modules dynamic types concurrency
primitive what I find really amazing is
that in a way look at the vision because
at that time you're already put in the
language things like we're going to keep
our community very busy for
the next decade and in him second
tributed to explore each of this topic
in depth at the same time we had
polymorphism and Luca also did some work
on polymorphism earlier because the
prince work on on ml the question then
is how do you mix polymorphism with
subtyping insist MF you just start for
alpha sigma as a polymorphic type and
the clever idea of Galilean ignore is to
say if we want to meet them and actually
sufficient to add bond which is bona
qualification to polymorphic types so
this stands for a set of type Sigma
where alpha ranges over subtype of tau
bonded polymorphism allowed to nada so
typing as facts as we could do before
but now to our reasoning under
hypothesis now we can say that Sigma is
a subtype of tau under some assumptions
on on alpha and once you have that you
can also have subtyping between
polymorphic types which is a famous rule
for F sub that Benjamin mansion and
there were many variations on the also
that I don't want to really comment on
Bondi qualification is very expressive
and it has been the base of many works
in the 90s and I think every type system
without subtracting polymorphism has to
do something around f sub still despite
is very expensive it still lacks a few
things for instance it only allows a
single up a bone why should it be so
because subtyping a theory is a symmetry
creation and also subtyping doesn't
allow that instance one of qualifiers
well this is not by mistake of design of
course but a design choice the choice
was to make subtyping a decidable
according to Radar into the rule here
shoes intractable and by keeping
quantifiers explicit so that subtyping
could be implicit so this is a good
balance point in system f sub still you
could consider type instantiation as
part of the type in relation and indeed
this is what ml does the only thing that
ml does is to say that the polymorphic
type is a subtype of all of its
instances this same rule was reused by
jean-michel in type containment when he
was using that rule and then extend and
edit the amber rose to propagate
subtyping through arrow types so that
when you could instant she had not only
at the at the top at the surface of a
type but also deep inside term by going
controversially on arrow types however
type containment doesn't seem to Bonnie
qualification with it because it doesn't
allow it to reason under apophysis yet
another form of qualification is instant
banda qualification that i introduced
myself in to do type partial type
inference in system f here we write
types of the phone for FF at is an
instance of tau sigma which stands for
the sets of type similar averages other
instances of tau and this this
constructions was a key to avoid having
to decide to early where the type should
be instantiated or cat polymorphic i
don't want to go more into the details
of MLF but what appears here is that we
have new flavors of new forms of typing
and the natural question is can we
combine them together so a question that
i wondered was whether we can combine
MLF subtyping however f7 that
containment could be could leave
together yet another question we may ask
if we take all features together but
restrict subtyping relation in other
ways for instance to restrict subtyping
to relation that would be invertible as
is the case in the internal language of
asgard and in fact we would like to do
more because if you want to encode
subtyping constraints that naturally
appear when you want to extend ml with
subside
thing when we would need multiple bonds
also we'd like to have recursive types
in the most general form which implies
co induction besides I would like to do
this in a setting with a full reduction
why do I want to do so because it should
work with full reduction and if I'm not
able to prove that it works it means
that it very something that I haven't
completely understood about subtyping
but also for reduction is models the
reduction of open terms and it avoids
postponing type errors under type
substantiation on the type of
abstraction moreover if i can do it for
full redaction then i would get the
results for a week any form of her
abduction so I won't have to redo a
proof for a man or a skirt I'll do them
once for another thing is I in fact I
argue that I think full reduction is the
bell model for a programmer it's a more
abstract model and it should be enough
to think about functionality the week
reduction model is only necessary when
the user wants to reason about the cost
of computation so to do so we just
modify banach modification and now
introduce quantification for alpha such
that p where p is a proposition that
could be a conjunctions of subtyping
constraints so having multiple subtyping
constraints this is the way we like to
understand it but it technically it's
more convenient to treat it as a born in
a qualification with kinds so I want to
toast for alpha of the kind k where k is
a can of power is kind of form of power
kinds that cuddly introduced in 88 so i
will have this kind that represents the
sets of types alphabet satisfy the
property p when there is a problem that
comes that appears now that we have
multiple bonds we have to be careful
that our kinds are inhabited otherwise
we could we could just high type errors
under inconsistencies in kinds so here
is an example we
type 1 applying to true with give its
eye pins by assuming that it's
polymorphic over some valuable alpha of
vision contingent kind that assumes that
int is billable Rao int and we could
build if we if we doing care if we don't
check about consistent if kind we could
do a derivation when visiting card
sensing goes from apophysis into on the
right hand side and rebirth tablet so
terms within consists in current terms
within coloring constraints they cannot
be safely reduced this is this is easy
to implement we now when we build kinds
when we build polymorphic types we have
just to be careful that okay the kinds
are inhabited so we had premise when we
provided witness Sigma for for the kind
however we also want in current we also
want to deal with in current guides
because they are situations where a kind
won't be coherent for instances of a
context but only for some of them and
this is a typical situation when you
type check GED tease so we introduced
yet another form of quantification which
is a vin consistent polymorphic
attraction when the kind here may be
inconsistent as a counterpart now
because we cannot reduce if we assign
return such a kind of carriage is under
it so we need to introduce a new
contract to freeze the abstraction when
we introduce such a kind and then
another concert 22 and freeze it when we
instantiate the kind so ah to conclude
our short journey what we have is an
external language for exploring for
design space we've put all the future
together which is very expressive and
his son however we last subject
reduction first this language is not
quite suitable neither for a surface
language no for an internal language for
a surface language because we put
everything in if we wanted the explicit
version of the surface language which
would be be there for so it's not
exactly what the user would
to write for internal language because
we don't have sufficient reduction it's
not quite suitable this is in a way
limitation but on the other hand I think
I think it's a good point 22 of X
profits and external language because
now we can we have shared the meta
theory and separated the study of
military what we can do from the design
of the language we want to use so now
that we know we know the bone of
everything we can do we can play with
sub languages that would could be used
as a surface or internal language
subtyping as played a very important
role in Rick as early works and I think
lik I contributed a lot to make
subtyping well understood but still
there are a few I think there are a few
variants of subtyping and uses still to
be explored so I would like to thank you
look ere for all your inspiring works
and a profusion of new ideas that kept
us moving forward faster and further
