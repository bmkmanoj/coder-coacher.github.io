okay good evening I'm Jane Nelson senior
program manager lead in Windows
international group windows division I'm
Cameron our senior program manager in
the winners of national division and our
talk tonight's about the multilingual
app tool kit an extension into Visual
Studio so let's go ahead and get started
your clicker is okay one that's quick
one Jimmy there we go so we're gonna go
there all right so let's talk about
creating a multilingual app tool kit
with the windows phone today so you
build your rock and cool apps got great
features pretty excited test it and
upload it to the store life is good and
then you start to notice that all the
downloads are in English okay no that's
great United States but really would
like to extend it out so you add some
resource files you're going to go do
some other languages including the
language that you're that you speak got
to add the bindings to the resources
that's after you thought you're doing
with the codes there's a little bit of
rework to there I get the resource files
localized which you know again is
something additional job you've got to
get done you got to figure out how to do
that once they come back you've got to
be able to test the app in all of those
languages as well and then discover the
bugs that require code fixes and then
manage all those different language
files separately again apply the fixes
rinse repeat and so it can become kind
of a job to to ship in more than one
language today so I think that's the
point of queuing up Cameron about so why
would I do that so here's your slide
alright thanks Jan so one of the main
reasons you do that is if look at some
of the research that add duplex is done
and they're stating that just for the
Windows Phone only thirty-three percent
of Windows phones actually are activated
in English which means that you're
missing out on potentially sixty-seven
percent of your mark
good for your app you want to make it so
it's you know works in different markets
right very particular to the the picture
of the country but most of the apps out
there are not country-specific they just
language-specific so it's a relatively
easily solved again the tax of having to
modify your resource files manually and
going back to you can be pretty
extensive so a lot of people that I've
talked to who are actually multilingual
don't even do it so we're trying to
solve some of that problem I have a I
have an app that I wrote a while back
and I really don't do much with it but
it kind of just keep a keep an eye on it
so I thought well those add duplex
numbers of interesting but how do they
really apply to me so what I did was I
took I took my app and I said okay I
shipped it with Russian in English
because i have a russian-speaking friend
and she said yeah i'll translate that
for you but i didn't do any of the
languages and it's been out there Oh
year to year and a half or so so I said
okay what happened if i put the ratios
of at duplex against my actual downloads
and I just I'm just doing bars not
actual numbers but what I did was I ray
showed up the number of downloads I
would have to have so that my English
down those would be the thirty-three
percent that the ad duplex says and then
the yellow bar or the orange that sorry
that's blue today isn't it the blue bar
are the bars that are my actual
downloads ratio to each other so you can
see I very strong in English that you
know cover in that covers Great Britain
that covers United States you know South
Africa some of the countries are very
dominant in english-speaking across the
other languages I get very few hits
Russian is obviously my second largest
language other than English the ad
duplex is almost exactly the same when I
ratioed it out so the for my one app
that I'm testing against their
percentages are working out for Russian
I've just uploaded my up with Spanish
Italian French and didn't know when I
forget so easy I forgot I mean I did but
I did former languages so be interesting
over the next couple of months to see if
those numbers start to ratio up with the
rest of it now go ahead and turn it back
over to you okay so with multi lap 2
multilingual app tool kit things are a
little different we have a common
workflow between the windows store in
the windows
we integrate directly with the visual
studio ide that includes the Express
editions so that the the price of entry
to use the toolkit is as easy as it gets
we provide a pseudo language so that you
can go ahead and do some of the
localization internationalisation
testing without having to know a second
language translation file export and
import is very interesting and that we
allow you to take those files and then
hand them off either through an email or
to a subnetwork share location that you
want so that if you've got if your small
app developer and you've got somebody
else you know casually who speaks
another language who can support you
it's very easy way to handle those
resources and bring them back in you
note that in the second or the bullet
after that we talked about an editor
that goes along with that if they don't
have a way to easily see those resources
we provide provide that for them and you
can see that we also use X lift which is
an industry standard localization format
an XML format for containing those
resources so that if you were to hand
those resources off to a translation
vendor who's in the business commercial
they'll understand what to do with that
file and then to get the suggestions
really quickly we have full integration
with Microsoft translator service built
into the toolkit so let's talk a little
bit about the workflow yeah okay so on
the workflow again talking to developers
one of the things that they've said is
it's just a tax I don't see the value
its attacks so we said okay how can we
make it less taxing or a tax free
environment so we don't solve the
problem if you need to actually put the
bindings into your code so you know I
have to bind to the resource in that
line that's we figured that that was
something that would be nice for us to
do but it's outside the scope what we're
trying to do right now maybe sometime in
the future but we decide not to take
that on although with windows sdk eight
it puts in the comments header block for
you so you just copy and paste so you
don't even have to know what the code
says you can just copy and paste and put
your resource ID in so it's really easy
to do so you want to do that while you
build your application after that we
don't want to force Matt on anybody the
multilingual up toolkit and so what we
have is an enablement project i want to
have multiple languages once you so you
select that manually from the tools menu
once you've done that we actually then
add the pseudo language to your project
automatically because suit is a great
testing language we do it here at
Microsoft and now be made it available
for third-party developers as well and
then you can say okay now me let me
select my production languages that I
want and for this example I've in the
highlighted I've got in French so I'll
just right click on the project go down
say add translation languages select
language I want of all of them that are
available big French and build now I'll
have an X the file with French or with
my translations from English in the file
now as we have to do is translate them
and that's what we do on the next one so
I've built because building this how we
take the resources gather them together
and put them into the process so with
phone you can get away with not building
the first time but if you add resources
you need to build before they show up
with the store you have to build before
they show up at all it's just a it's a
design of how it integrates in so we
don't interfere but the same time give
you the flexibility so you just machine
generate run your program it really is
that simple and um so enable add build
generate run and you have up to however
mangala jaunty the Microsoft translator
service for machine translation supports
39 languages right now so you can get
thirty nine languages in less than five
minutes now they're machine quality
translation and I would put a note in my
app if I ship that which I actually did
I said these are machine-translated
click here if you want to make them
better that way they can provide
feedback and I can actually show you in
a little bit how I can give them a tool
that they can actually do community
translation for me
so we have a whole round trip available
here and not slides this let's actually
get into a demo so I'm going to go ahead
and go into let me minimize this I'm
going to go ahead and go into Visual
Studio and what I have here is I have a
just a sample little phone app that
grabs weather and the reason I've picked
that one as my app and you stop it here
real quick is because a weather app
requires content from the internet and
content from the internet we were
actually having a conversation earlier
what language do I want the content in
right it also has local resources and
you'll see in a moment that it also has
resources that come from the operating
system such as calendar controls so a
weather app is a simple app but it's a
pretty good demonstration of what you
need to think about as you go into
multiple markets so I'm going to go
ahead and just run this I haven't this
is just straight app it doesn't have
multiple web toolkit enabled it's just
localization ready with English res X
file so let me go ahead and run this
just to show you what it looks like kind
of get a feel for it and you saw a
little delay when off the internet got
current weather you can see that you
know it's today's the current day it's
from redmond I'm getting it from the get
from the rent and municipal airport and
we have some sunrise some basic data and
the copyright of the information that
service provider is right standard
standard scrolling around I've thrown
some big text up because I really want
to know what it's gonna be like in the
next couple hours shower shower shower
shower service shower I don't understand
the demos they always say showers here
we need to talk about that yeah he'll
kill some so I California so we have
mostly cloudy mostly cloudy mostly still
clad oh there we go that's improvement
we have a ring now okay but you can see
I'm getting again whether back and
getting a feels like I'm getting time
I'm getting other information then I've
got my my week in the view I've got my
days of the week and um it's our hope to
be our sunny shores
so pretty straightforward app I have the
ability to change my location you know
no big deal and not going to demonstrate
that because you know we won't don't
want to see San Diego with the Sun and I
have the ability to change some
configurations now one thing I've done
here is I want to give my user the
ability to see multilang multiple
languages especially with machine
translation I might want to ship Italian
in machine translation because I don't
have any resources or money because I
give the same way for free to have it
translated but maybe they want high
quality English rather than suggestion
quality machine translation so as I'm
thinking about it do I want to give them
that option and in this case I do so I
have the ability to change my phone
language now as I said earlier this
Apple is only supporting english and in
easily english res X file at the moment
we're going to fix that just a second so
let me go ahead and cancel out stop the
program so remember the workflow earlier
I said first you write it sews
localizable baidu you're in bindings you
obviously install mat which I've done
it's a 2 megabyte download doesn't take
a lot of disk space then you enable it
so I'm just going to go to my project
climate observer and i'm going to say
under tools enable the multi-angle app
tool kit it modifies the project there's
some hokan's for build environments as a
build task and some other things of hook
into it and then it creates that pseudo
language file i was talking about
earlier you see that i have a
highlighted it's a new extension that
you're not familiar with and that's that
x lift one dot to industry file and what
i can do with this file here is i can
right click it and generate pseudo
translations now pseudo is basically
just english with different markups on
it so you can see where your program is
showing the different languages and
whether maybe have a hard-coded dream so
i'm going to go ahead and just do a su
to generate on this and I've got 27
resources they got generated I'm going
to press the f5 key and we're going to
start up again now the phone can't
switch to sudo as a phone language so my
little my little ability to switch it
over is a nice feature so
I don't have to worry about how do i
display pseudo so i can come in here and
just say show me shoot a language now
what i've done is there are some really
fancy gymnastic trips you can do to make
this switch automatically I decided just
to go straight with toolkit and alls I
do is store the language that want in
isolated storage and then when i load
the app next time I load up that
language instead of the default one so I
exit the app and come back in for this
demo now this is interesting I can't get
whether it was just working so something
changed when i applied localization that
i want to debug because it was working
in english but now maybe an italian it's
not going to work so we'll dig into that
a little bit but right now you'll see
that i have i have zero one of the
things you'll notice on the pseudo is
that we've expanded it quite a bit now
in the phone environment truncation is
actually part of the design so it's not
necessarily a bad thing but you want to
know how much of it you're going to have
excessive amounts is probably a bad
thing you also have unique ID so you can
actually have a tester log this bug and
even if you keep generating this will be
the same ID as long as the resource
string doesn't change so you can go find
it quickly in your system oh this is
obviously not a localizable.stringsux
pretty straightforward my location
actually let me pull that back up sorry
my location buttons yeah down here these
are suitable so now I know that I'm
actually sue to locally to my app bar
which requires code behind because it
doesn't work when you put it directly in
the sam'l another thing to consider that
you would notice right off the bat look
we got location that's looking like im
sue to localizing everything and and
we've also got our controls here and it
looks like i'm doing a good job on that
so I'm going to go figure out what's
going on here now the one thing I do
know about my application is that I ask
it to return the weather data
a particular language and I told it to
sue to localize the entire file so
what's happened since they're wasting
time debugging is the language code that
I told it it put those hash codes in
front so now I'm telling it basically
junk give me back junk language and it's
gone I don't know how to talk about
language so let's go into our pseudo
file will pop up our editor this is a
standalone editor that allows you to
work with people who aren't in visual
studio so if you have a friend who speak
sudo well in this case it'd be Italian
you could send them your ex the file
which I'll demonstrate in a minute they
can use this free editor which is the
same install point but it won't install
in the visual studio components if they
don't have it installed or if they
choose not to through a custom install
they can add this file and send it back
to you now I know that my pseudo problem
is right here because it my demo and
I've worked out before so I'm just going
to reset this string and I'm going to
tell the weather service on what do you
want for language back from our Weather
Service Italian going to be stuck on a
challenge in it so I'm just going to
give it the language code for Italian
save this and then run again
and now our language services return in
Italian as the language right if it
doesn't understand the language I would
actually change my code to produce a
bitter error result rather than couldn't
get weather because you want to tell
them to have a different preference but
now you can see I can actually have my
app in pseudo and have my consumer data
in Italian so that gives me all kinds of
flexibility for mark target audience
maybe I want my language in spanish
because i'm learning that even though i
am a native English speaker that would
be an interesting scenario to add in how
do you want your weather today maybe
gives me the opportunity to look at my
cell seus degrees rather than Fahrenheit
all the time there's all kinds of fun
stuff you can do with it again
configurable for your customer but also
required because you're talking a global
market into global services the other
thing we'll look at down here is my my
sunrise and sunset those are expanding
quite a bit so it's probably going to be
pragmatic in my design I've got an
interesting area here where I seem to
have some type of wrapping and my feels
like but notice notice on the time the P
and the bracket afterwards right here
this is not this is not something we're
suta localizing because we don't have
the codes on the top so that's actually
coming from the operating system so the
Windows Phone very limited amount but it
does have pseudo language in the
operating system so now what you're
seeing I have content from the internet
I have content from my pseudo version of
my resource file and i also have pseudo
content coming from the OS controls
themselves which is interesting when you
want to start working with calendar time
and dates those type of controls it's a
good way to test to see you're actually
using the calendar controls instead of
formatting your own strings which would
be very difficult to do and go into
multiple markets properly so again I
still got my my day my day problem there
I'm getting Celsius that's from the
service I'm telling the service to give
me default so that makes sense again I
have a few more controls with time on it
and they're still doing the pseudo and
then scroll over to my week and my
thursdays also suit a localized but
and I don't have my identifiers in front
so that means these days are coming from
the operating system which is very
useful when I do switch to Italian
finally because now it will actually say
it in Italian rather than English so my
app will automatically adjust as we move
forward so let's go ahead and I've got
all my things here let's switch it to
the switch defect let's force this thing
to Fahrenheit right so now we're getting
our degrees in Fahrenheit again I'm able
to give customer preference I'm able to
tell the weather service well it's not
necessarily localizable data is
customizable data that's on the same
scale as what language and what degree
system do I want okay so that's pretty
straightforward but no one really wants
to ship pseudo right the other thing
I'll say is I did test my up recently I
put sudo in it and shipped it through
the store it passes certification you
may not want to add the resources just
because you know the useless but it
won't block you from being certified if
you forget to take to uncheck pseudo so
let's go ahead and add in some more
interesting languages so I'm going to
right-click this used to think I am
there we go here and I'm going to select
add translation languages now we opted
not to put it under the standard add
menu and we've gotten some feedback that
we might want to reconsider that but
this is not something you're going to
use all the time so we didn't think it
made sense to go and then we thought we
wanted it easy access add once and then
not worry about it so let's go ahead and
add in Italian okay and we can do the
different flavors but a lil Italian
Italy just for a sake of argument um how
about Japanese Japanese is always
interesting you'll note that there's
some little icons to the right of some
of these says Microsoft translator if
you can read that and so what we're
doing is we're grabbing the available
translation languages and then
populating this so as the translator
team adds them your list will continue
to
changement grow and you just know what
you can get machine translations for
when you select those so you can get
those translations suggestions pretty
easily that way thank you another good
point on that is since it is machine
translation its language agnostic means
it's just going to be in this case
Arabic not targeted at saudi arabia
right so it'll be like just German
generic German not German you know
Germany or German Austria so when you're
thinking about the language aspect of
that that's interesting a cavy on that
is that also means i can support a
limited set of language fall back so i
can select german and then i can tailor
for german germany maybe five strings
that are particular for that country's
version of the language and if those
five strings aren't the ones i'm using
just go to the generic german that works
for everybody so you don't have to
translate all of your different flavors
of German to get a good German
experience just a few that you want it
there's ways to control that and say I
don't want to look lazy as ever and it
will just go into the system this is
pretty good hit list let's go ahead and
take this so again you'll see that it's
adding the extra files to the system now
there's one thing i want to show you
that Miss might mess people up if you're
familiar with how to do localization you
know you make a res X file that has the
language code in front of it well if I
open this I'm going to go but where's my
strings because the only thing there are
the two strings that the windows 8 SDK
puts in and that your your language code
to help you load the right fonts
automatically as well as your flow
direction we take care of that for you
the resources are stored in your ex lift
we pop we populate the res X file for
compilation so you don't want to go
modify your resume as we're going to
overwrite them so if you see this is
empty there's only two reasons why one
you haven't built or two you said I
actually don't want that string
translated so we leave it out of the
file to enable fall back ok that's a key
point to remember as we move forward so
I'm going to go ahead and actually I'm
gonna open these on the editor because i
know i got my language issue or I'll do
the wrong wrong language
so let me go ahead and load this up
pretty sure I double click that I did ok
now I have the ability to say translate
all the other things that I can do is
since I know I have this language thing
i'm going to change this one to be AR
dos SI right off the bat because that's
the language i want and then i'll just
say translate all when you translate all
it knows the translation state and it
won't mess with anything that is
anything other than new so even if its
needs review it will assume that you're
just in a work flow statement won't
override it so the fact that you change
that change the state if so it didn't
overwrite it when you said translate all
yeah because my little icon here which
you can sort on says that it's
translated and so since it was
translated a process to said oh that's
already been handled i'm gonna i'm not
going to machine translate that for me
which is interesting because it gives
you the ability to do some translation
and then some machine translation not
wear that they're going to collide ok
there's a pretty sophisticated workflow
embedded in this little tool set that
actually could scale beyond that
informal user along with the the pseudo
hashtag and the ability for tests to
hook up automation start building some
very interesting scenarios if you want
to scale this up a little bit yes i will
make italian here and get to a japanese
no forgot to localize that one oh that's
that's an interesting part for my
dummbell then apparently i've already
done the japanese one must have been on
disk and it just pulled it up so we'll
just stay with that now one thing I
forgot to do is actually do translate
all when I was in Italian so now that I
know I marked my strings so they're
already marked as translated for the
ones I need to be a particular way I
just go ahead and generate from what
site visual studio because it will again
ignore the ones been translated again
just run who here is actually done
multiple languages in the res ex model
of net
ok so this look a little easier yes good
good answer that's the right answer and
with checks in the nail so we'll go
ahead and do our languages any language
preference Arabic I knew it yep Arabic
is always a fun one isn't it again I
need to exit restart because of the way
I haven't overridden the language
manager but you could and yours Arabic
notice when I scroll actually I'm scroll
in the wrong way because I'm should have
gone the other way to get to my week
first again I still haven't fixed the
day one that's a pretty easy easy one to
fix now here's something that is a bug
my buttons aren't mirrored and the
reason my buttons aren't merde is
because their code behind and so I just
said if you're familiar with how to add
buttons it good behind you basically say
you know application button control ad
ad ad well it's going to list them in
the order you added and I don't want to
say it's a bug in the phone sdk but it
doesn't change the order based upon the
locale so you would encode just
basically say what is my what is my flow
direction and if it says right to left
or left to right you would then just add
the buttons in a different order it's
pretty easy workaround but it's
something you'd have to consider again
who here can read Arabic ok but here's
an important part it doesn't matter if
you can read it or not because you know
approx what's going to look like if you
ship it with machine translation or you
can if you haven't professionally
translated you can look at this and go
you know what things look like they fit
or they look like they don't fit I
should make some design adjustments so
not only does machine translation give
you the ability to get into a market
that maybe you wouldn't have gotten into
before because you have no language
services there it also gives you the
ability to make that language your
target market languages your test
languages easily so now I can fully test
Arabic I can test my functionality just
like i did with sudo and I can make sure
we don't have any issues and you can do
some design work off but as you can see
what it's going to look like in the
final result and the translations are
probably close enough
length that your layout you can look at
your layout and decide what you're going
to do about that and if you are going to
talk to a translator you can give them
specifics and say hey you know what for
this string I really need to be a little
bit shorter what can we do is there
another term that we can use and have
specific conversations it will help
fine-tune something if that's indicated
so Carol chir Oh Cairo's yeah that's why
I see a no age yeah hey I ro and see if
that pops up yeah Seoul's good at
Nebraska let's pick this one that looks
like it's not in the US so here's our
weather service from a for Cairo and you
notice the most of us coming back in
Arabic but we still have some data
that's coming back from the service in
English not much I can do about that
except maybe pick a different provider
this is this is damaged and provider
amazon provider but all that works
pretty straightforward pretty easy
I think that's about it for how the
toolkit works the things I really want
to emphasize is the amount of time we
spent dealing with language issues is in
how the program responds to it not how I
get translations are how they manage
translations I know in my app I mean I
have English and Russian and this is
before we had the toolkit for the phone
I made the mistake of my resources into
the Russian language and not Adam in the
English language and I was testing a
Russian everything was fine and I went
and switched over to English and I was
like there's something missing and my
English resources had no fallback
because English is my default language
and i literally just had gaps in my UI
where i should have had english because
you need to manually modify the files
you need to manually move the resources
between all your exes we take care of
all that for you staying you're staying
you're in your native language let us
manage the rest and it will just work if
you already have an application and I
don't have a set up to demo that but if
you haven't had an application that has
multiple res X Files we actually provide
the ability to right-click and I don't
it won't show up here because it knows
the scoping of it but if as X file was
here I could right click and there would
be a menu right up here that would say
convert to X lift so then you could roll
your existing language files into our
management system preserve the languages
because it will do a string and source
and target compare against your language
neutral to this language file if the
strings are not identical it will say oh
you've translated this and will mark it
is translated and will be preserved so
now you can use Matt add convert your
existing ones to the new to the language
system and then add new languages on top
of it so we've tried to weep red to
approach all the different avenues on
that let's show how we export and import
good point so I'm not really comfortable
sent into the Japanese market machine
translation so what I would do with that
is i would simply right-click it and i
would say same two translations again
it's an industry file so i am just going
to do a file folder because i don't want
to split up my email client and I would
just put it out to you know wherever I'm
going to put it I'll just throw my
desktop for now or maybe on your
SkyDrive and you've given that
translator notice i could go to my
SkyDrive you think about how that might
work yeah go to go to a skydrive go to
your translators shared folder drop the
files in shooting off an email saying
hey these are ready for you let me know
when they're done right so i'll throw in
desktop for now and then as a translator
get out of the demo as a translator i
would find this on my SkyDrive account i
would have mr. i shut about this client
up when you email we put the the URL to
actually do the download of the toolkit
it's been bed than if you just click on
it and it will install just the editor
for a localizers yeah it'll look and see
do you have visual studio installed you
don't ok we're just going to give you
the editor and so we don't burden them
with you full installation of express
say but yeah just what they need yep so
and if they just hit next next next they
don't configure it will do the right
thing we've done a lot of work to make
sure that happens so here's the file in
SkyDrive I just double-click the file
I've installed the toolkit I'm editing I
make my make my changes and that would
then result in this going from knees
translation to translate because it was
human as soon as you keyboard it it
knows the humans working it and it knows
that it it's works into a translation
state you still may want to go to find
off final final and signed off but just
senator translated would give you an
indication that they've touched it again
anything it's not new we consider
translated because we believe the most
developers who are writing apps just
don't want to get caught up in the
workflow but we know there's some that
some that really care that really really
work on the language maybe they have
multiple friends with multiple languages
and they're they're producing maybe a
higher dollar app and they want to make
sure that only college of translations
go out this would enable that workflow
for them they can they can quickly do a
filter and they could simply say you
know show me everything that still needs
a review right and boom here's
everything still needs a review so they
can they can filter in again we kept it
light weight but we've also given them
some tools to dig through there's a nice
lockstate also
we should probably show all right so
let's say like climate observer that
didn't get machine-translated cuz all
caps and the translation service says
all of us all caps is probably want to
be left alone but let's say I didn't
want to leave the whole thing alone
let's say I have weather location that
when translated and one wasn't
translated why didn't that translate
okays no I did now so let me reset this
maybe I only want to trance translate
location I want to keep weather so what
I do is in the source I would say for my
source don't translate whether these are
again this is the X lift standard and we
we show the markups because people who
are familiar with it would know what to
do with in people who aren't wouldn't
use it but this would this tells our
machine translation engine don't touch
it whether we're sending it out for
professional translation or machine
translation or our pseudo it says this
is critical that you don't touch and if
I translate this now it will only
translate the location portion of it now
we're not pretending that if you do if
you do languages where you have verb
switching like Spanish that is always
gonna be in the right order when you do
this type of markup that's when the
professional translator or language
expert knows how to manipulate and move
things around but if you have a product
name that you don't want translated this
makes it really easy you can just mark
it as don't translate my product name
because I want it to be it's represents
my company not the app so i would want
not want to translate the other option
that you have also is you can say this
particular resource for this particular
language should never be translated and
what this will result in if i would go
back to save this and go back to the
project build this would not be in the
res X file in my Japanese rose X file
and the reason why is it's not in the
file it enables fall back so since my
neutral language is English on a
Japanese phone running this in Japanese
I would see sunset in English because
I've said sunset should never be
translated so we have granularity of in
string and then just the entire string
we do provide a way to manipulate that
around so again we believe the pseudo is
the best file to start working on you
can do all your debugging work in pseudo
so what we've done is given the ability
and I'm not going to demonstrate it
except for bringing it to you I we've
said let me ply all my all my locks
while my internal those markers eggs
that we put on let me apply that to all
my pseudo get my program debug mark
these don't ever translate these like
the weather code I want for the language
to come back in and then I can just say
okay what what languages do I want to
apply that to and I can say if I put a
lock on a string and that strings
already been translated other languages
either overwrite that language in other
words lose the translation to get the
lock put in place because it was wrong
anyway or if I've already translated it
I'm going to assume I did it right now
what i can do is i can mark up a few key
things like my product name and then
distribute it across all of my language
apps all my language exit files to say
everybody conform to this now rather
than having one global one that that is
less flexible and that I can go in and
to date and depend okay I wanted to on
top of that so again really tried to
keep a workflow minimal but available
for people who wanted to go farther we
figure most won't use the workflow and
that's perfectly fine with us but we
wanted to allow to go farther if they
wanted so we started out saying that
this had a common relationship with
Windows Store apps as well so that's a
great question so it's like you know
what I've got this really cool tool my
phone works great but I've got this I
got the same app for the Windows Store
and I really don't want to have multiple
res JSON files or multiple or as W files
because it's painful so let's not so I'm
going to go ahead and just do a real
simple demo app now we've call this one
wolf is it's kind of an older app that
we did just as we were originally doing
this but wolf again is a program that is
written to be localized it's already
localizable we've put all the resource
strings in we actually have written it
in both visual basic JavaScript and C
sharp just to show it works with all the
languages any language that uses the
res X or the res X or in the store the
JSON or res w formats we work with even
C++ apps even though those are more
challenging they just are the project
structure is really strange so what I
have here is I have wolf and wolf is
basically a really kind of a simple fun
app and make sure I'm in English sure so
how many people are familiar with the
language selection in Windows 8 I wonder
wise so the way the weather windows 8
works is you have language preferences
rather than language selection so with
the preference I can say please show me
this language all my apps in this
language first if they don't have
resources in that language show it to me
in the next on my list in the next one
on my list so what I'm going to do for
this little demo here is I'm going to
put English not at the top let's do
let's do German because the Germans love
my machine translations because it makes
makes their day for a good laugh before
we leave this screen you've got English
q PSP look there and I think it's an
interesting point you brought up in the
Windows Phone that there was some
limited pseudo localization in the
windows OS there's actually extensive
pseudo localization it's been shipping
in the windows OS for several releases
it just isn't something that you find in
the list you have to ask for it so
that's a good point i'm going to remove
it temporarily to show how you find it
yeah thank you you're welcome so in
Windows 8 you just say you go to the
control panel you go two languages
similar you did windows seven only now
you be able to you just say add a
language and that brings up a new UI
that lists all the languages that are
available on your particular machine up
here as everywhere in Windows we have
the search key well I can't search for
sudo and be successful but I can look
for the language code so memorize this
it is documented but get a memorized it
QPS p LOC got a debit right
when you type that it will then show a
language that's not normally displayed
sir yeah no thanks and the reason why
this doesn't normally show is pseudos
not a good for standard user unless
they're really you know feeling like
they want to have martyred ism so I'm
going to go ahead and add pseudo back in
and now what I have is I have pseudo as
one of my available OS languages so my
application is going to display pseudo
English which means any from the
operating system will show up and pseudo
then German and then English now for the
wolf app it's a really simple app I'm
just displaying images and resources
from apps so I'm not really accessing
counter controls are not accessing the
internet so i won't get that variety we
had in the first door app um but let me
go ahead and run this I love it when Del
machines actually work the entire time
so far so good that was a hopeful
statement
so again this application yeah I was
afraid that was going to happen all
right let me that's a screen resolution
issue let me let me fix my screen sorry
if this messes up the recording I need
to go up or down straight going up
I think maybe we're going to go down so
what that message was is that it wasn't
a resolution that Windows apps support
so let's go down a resolution and I
believe that supports this one just fine
so we'll go ahead and go back to the s
and we'll run this again there is today
so that wasn't mad so here's a really
simple app just kind of a fun showing a
bunch of dogs running around you know
the team was teasing me one day so I
came up with the dog AB pretty
straightforward nothing real fancy you
know standard tile Windows 8 app
everything's in English no surprises
there so again we would go back into our
app and this is a this is a c-sharp
Windows Store app what many do we go to
to enable Matt tools menu right so we
Nabal Matt under tools menu with the
project selected there's our pseudo file
and this is that one case I was telling
you about with Windows Store the pseudo
file is empty until you build we
synchronize during the build and then we
inject in so it all happens in one step
but you always have to do the build then
localize and then one more build it was
a it was a design choice you made that
has served us pretty well as long as you
remember that one gotcha so I'm just
going to do just a build so I'm just
going to build the solution and you can
see here we have successfully started
and finished our build with a
multi-angle app tool kit that's always a
good thing if i bring this up then I'll
have my my pseudo in my files been
populated pretty straightforward like oh
let me go back to the other I want to I
want to show one thing in particular i
am going to translate into sudo happy
dogs and unhappy dogs and that's it for
this demo
and I'm going to run this eyelid German
in in a minute because I want to make
sure we step through everything slowly
so now you'll see that we have the
language fall back working remember my
OS languages are pseudo German than
English this application supports two
resources in pseudo the rest in English
so that's what's being displayed is the
two pseudo because they're the preferred
language and then everything else is in
English so you can also then tell where
the same resources being displayed
multiple times see the code if this was
the same string but a different resource
it would be a different code so again
that helps you in debugging about why is
that string the same or why is that
string different to run in pseudo and go
a dent you can identify them and then
you can actually search on that code
against your resource file your pseudo
resource file and say oh it's this
particular resource name let me go hunt
that encode so it gives you clues and
let's go back here and let's head German
because I know I speak that so well yes
food gosh oohhhhh and we'll do german
and everyone we get complicated so let's
translate everything except ah see I
build first gotta build first to use of
the phone you don't have to build first
venue initially is doing the phone so
let's translate everything except
we want to untranslated augs and why do
you want to do that because we want to
make sure that we do actually still get
all back to english so again translate
build translate run so now I have happy
dogs in pseudo I have my content in
German machine translation quality
machine translation quality which is a
great suggestion actually the
interesting part is the Germans laugh at
it because there's gramma colère errs
but when I translate to French and show
it to from native French speakers they
actually go that's not bad and the
Brazilians go that's not bad so that's
kind of encouraging again if you use
machine translation I'd always put a
disclaimer machine-translated for your
convenience and then provide them a link
because they can download the toolkit
run your ex the file fix it for 10 grand
will show them and that loop and we'll
show them a little bit so here we go
this is still in English because I don't
have a translation for it everything
else has a German translation and the
two strings have soooo now let's back
this off a little bit just to drill the
point home if I bring this back up and
switch my order so I'm going to move
this up now i'm going to do german then
sudo now it should happen here is I
won't see in a suit at all because I did
actually translate the user to German so
it doesn't fall back so again your
language your language fall back and
your ability to do interesting things
like if i were to translate German
Germany it's just general German would
work very well in this scenario oh sorry
and I got my 1 English drinks toe
because it's still not translated
alright pretty straightforward any
questions on that all right um and you
want to show the input um hi with the
suggestion coming back how people could
actually give feedback on whether or not
the quality of the translation was good
ok um give me as far as your localizer
yeah ok so let's bring up our German
file what if I have it in this one
actually let me back up for one second
ok I'm going to deviate from my demo and
hope it doesn't bite me so I want to
actually add some oh I do have comments
on here all right so you'll notice in
here that I have comments on my
resources these are very useful to
communicate to the person who's going to
localize for you because what we do is
those are comments that we call from the
developer so they'll show up right here
this is a comment to look like a pretty
generic comment we threw it is to the
test but you can write in here that this
string represents this or it's maybe
it's a button so please keep the
translation short some type of what
you'd want to tell them in person if
they're asking questions about it now
what they can do to you is they can
actually type back and that is you know
you know this translation right I spell
translation can't type on these small
keyboards it is perfect right and they
can send this back to you and when they
do you can open this up and you can look
at the translation ago you know what
I've got I've got different translations
on here and okay great so this is good
or they can say I don't know what this
meant right is you know the classic
example we've used for years is the bat
in the field right so you just say you
had a resource that said the bat is in
the field what you look like and come
back with are you talking sports or
mammals right and you can go oh yeah
sorry this is a this is a baseball app
right so this this would be sports
instruments so you can communicate with
that way which ideally would be a dev
comment you have scented them initially
so you can round trip this and it will
during builds during imports they'll all
be preserved and they'll continue to
grow you'll know one that changes
dynamically on you is the one that you
have in your resource file if you change
that we will change it elsewhere because
you've made an adjustment to how the
system works but that's a great way that
you communicate back and forth without
having to do an email they can sing you
back the file and say hey add some
questions on these resources and you can
go you can go find out like that
I think that pretty much covers
everything yeah the resource ID check
box to the top is that enable the good
is enabled the GUI displays in the UI
for testers is that shown here by
turning on the resource ID check box um
it's the goo it only shows in the the
code you mean the resource tracker code
that only shows in the pseudo one we
could enable it we haven't but we could
say what's the good what would be the ID
for this resource because it would it
would generate to be the same one here
we just haven't put it into the editor
yet again this is more of the translator
one and we didn't think they'd be
working with pseudo but it might be
might be interesting to reconsider if I
if I showed my pseudo file it would just
show it as part of the string and you
could then search for it right you could
then search for it if you wanted and it
would show it up
or even filter on it
the other thing I didn't really call out
is we indicate whether it was
machine-translated or not as soon as you
start touching it not only did we change
it to a translator state we take the
machine translation flag off so you can
filter and say hey what's what's
machine-translated I can I can quickly
just say you know show me all my sort by
column here's my two strings that are
still machine-translated and pseudo is
machines we mark it as machine again
that's that workflow that people may or
may not use but we want to enable it so
I'm a gonna write an app that now has
more than one language you also you show
Japanese is there some sort of support
for Lynette accor yummy designation not
directly in the toolkit if you want to
do if you wanted different things such
as control the sizes of maybe a dialog
box or windows and like that make it a
localizable field and then then you can
put it then you can translate it and you
got to be careful because you don't want
to translate a number with you know to
something else but then you could
transfer the translation would be grow
this from 100 pixels to 200 pixels for
this particular language obviously we
prefer your auto size but that would be
how you do fonts and other stuff through
the localization model
I've seen websites that
resources
is there I've never localized
is there that's something that's easy to
integrate with those types of websites
and maybe they export the political next
ex oh ex Livia so I'll take most that
answer offline but right now the way we
integrate is through the send and
receive functionality you can send it
through email they can send it back to
unique and import the import will
actually do some validation so that's
currently the way that we support that
we will have an offline conversation at
the end of this talk yeah okay
everything we've shown here is publicly
available this is version 1 dot to
eating download today and do exactly
what I've done nothing nothing here is
internal Microsoft at this point
alright well thank you for thank you for
listening appreciate your tongue feel
free to contact either John or myself
will give our email alias offline and
ask ask us any questions i wonder if
you're going to expand into doing to you
for this for the store or for the phone
we definitely provide some help or for
both preferably for both alright thank
you very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
