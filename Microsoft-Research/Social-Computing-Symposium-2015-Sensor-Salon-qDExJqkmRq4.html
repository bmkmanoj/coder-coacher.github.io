hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
so jenny is up a last formal speaker
before the drinks so I guess there was a
while back we did a so cozy on the
design of cities I think tom was
instrumental in that so this is gues is
a little bit this session was a little
bit of you know the design of cities and
to jenny hat blast the last presentation
of a nail salon rethinking the nail
salon and just an awesome project so you
go hi everyone to my name is Jenny Rodin
house and i'll be presenting sensor
salon the project was current was done
last year at media design practices
which is a graduate program at Art
Center College of Design and it really
looks at utilizing design process and
design as a practice within research so
this was an Intel sponsored a wearables
project and when we first began my
collaborator and collaborator and I
Christina Ortega really started to
acknowledge this growing population of
not only devices data but also wearers
and was really wondering what are the
implications of this growing population
and started to kind of think about you
know what are these new systems or
services that might start to exist in
order to support them and so today kind
of through this up presentation I'll
take you through our general research
process and end up where with our
insights towards the end when we began
we really started looking at existing
services with in Los Angeles so nail
salons we're thinking oh here's a
service that already exists where people
are getting things installed on their
body we went to lots of different salons
and went through the nail art
installation service so if some of you
aren't aware of it bears gel nail which
is essentially a plaster
that you can get installed on your hands
and within that you can embed lots of
different objects so we set through an
over to our installation process and
that begins with kind of this
negotiation and then it's fascinating
for us to observe how our dynamic with
our nail technician changed so here you
start off with small talk and then
eventually it's gossip and then it's
almost like a therapy session so it's
this collaboration between you and your
technician where you're saying what I
want but she's also an expert and can
say she recommends you know yellow
instead of pink so that's kind of that
overview of this two-hour break down and
you do actually go through the nail
process of the gels go through a baking
session so you're putting your hand in
UV light and what we discovered through
our research was that this nail art
community is super passionate and really
experimental so we really started by
blending these two worlds together so
both nail art and sensors and wearable
tech and kind of pushing it to the
extreme on purpose so we started
exploring these new aesthetics and new
interactions thinking about you know
what are these programmed sensor
personalities to you know what are these
3d forms in which you could extend off
the nail to host additional electronics
and through this we developed kind of a
whole range looking at power district
powers so how to generate power from
just like simple watch batteries
embedded on the nail to using
piezo-electric so that you could if as
you tapped your fingers you could
generate a small enough electricity to
light up a led to then power
distribution we made a breadboard nails
so you could host additional sensors off
the nail as well as develop circuitry
nails and then of course looked at
different sensors from have feedback to
like sensors to give people this general
new maybe touch sensations and then we
wanted to
first install these on people we are
testing them on ourselves but went
through an entire installation process
one day where we invited two individuals
in and not only did the whole nail
installation of two hours but then it
goes through installing the electronics
so this was incredibly helpful for us to
kind of learn through this process and
see how people sort of reacted to these
will be our calling sensor extensions so
we asked people to kind of go through
just some simple task just to see what
would happen and chrissy's wearing um
she was wearing nails that were giving
her haptic feedback as she would
approach a certain object so sort of
towards proximity sensor and she said
her comment after was I would use these
nails if I wanted to stop smoking
because as she would reach it sort of
startled her at the time um like an
incredible breakthrough for us when we
heard this we r like oh this isn't it's
really not about the nail so much it's
really that by installing them on the
people they kind of help them speculate
on what they really personally in their
wearable device so from that it was
really changing it from the nails to
what our RV services to support these
personal wearable tech and so from that
we completely kind of shifted I mean it
was great to have these nails I think
that's the nail extensions really became
this wave for us to Center it within
reality that you could actually make
them but then the installation service
became much more of like this
speculation based on our initial
inspiration so we really thought about
what are these new roles skill sets what
are these tools that you need and what
is salon as a physical space so what
space would you need in order to
essentially make what Chrissy wanted of
nails that would help her stop smoking
so we kept thinking okay well all right
you need a nail artist they would sit
next to a developer an interaction
designer you need an industrial designer
okay well maybe a doctor would sit there
too because they would essentially want
to be
eating this data and helping her achieve
her goal so it became this really
interesting blend of roles and different
tool sets so kind of this blend of salon
culture and maker lab so this summer we
installed it in my apartment taking
inspiration from LA kind of salon
culture starting in people's homes and
opened it for the first time hiring all
of those individuals that we initially
listed off and the space really took on
this aesthetic of bridging both
something from like reality and then
taking the aesthetics of maybe a
wireframe and to kind of indicate this
more speculative space of saying you
know what if this did exist so it kind
of blended and to create this more
prototype space so the place really
became we were hypothesizing this around
this like place that would became a
platform for both speculation debate and
collaboration this was our client Sarah
she came in for the day we hired Whitney
she was our nail artists she travels
around and does nails for celebrity
photoshoots and she wanted to learn how
to put an LED on a nail so we helped her
figure out how to do that we hired five
developers and designers and also hired
a sensor ethnographer which was kind of
this new role of listening to both the
client's needs and trying to interpret
it into sensors and code the day started
off through kind of this brainstorming
process where Sarah was sharing about
herself then the design and development
would share what sensors were available
and then that was suddenly this great
learning opportunity for everyone where
we realized you know sarah has no idea
that you can even like code in Le LCD
screen and how she could have it say
whatever she wanted and then Whitney at
the very end kind of shared her nail
tool kit so it was like this process of
everyone kind of getting brought up to
speed together then the room separated
so you have design and development goes
on to one
and starts coding and printing different
forms that Sarah kind of just off the
top of her head was like I want to lie
in and so you're like okay sure let's do
this and we'll scale it will fit it to
your finger and then on the other side
you have Whitney and Sara starting the
install process so kind of like the base
of the nails for which once all the
other parts are ready we can then place
on and then other things that you know
it's just we're not there yet certain
things are too big to put on the nail so
we're like okay well we'll just make
them and then show them to her so she
wanted to see what a GPS would be like
so we hooked up the GPS and had a walk
around the neighborhood just so she
could experience it and kind of think
about what she might want in her next
appointment so in the end this was
Sarah's first install and the most
interesting thing that came out of this
was that more about this documentation
aspect of you know you can see what she
got on her first appointment but then
thinking about you know when does she
come back for her next appointment so
nails have like a two-week life cycle so
that concept really inspired us to think
about how wearables could have both you
know maybe they're just two weeks or
maybe they're more of a permanent insult
or temporary so how could that lead to
more of this documentation of mental
physical and digital transformation of
Sarah and from this we were so one we
were like really inspired by nail art
culture but I the through this process
it really became about like more of a
platform for all wearable technology so
how could you have this physical
location that people could come in
collaborate with people who are experts
in their field and then be able to edit
and alter their wearable technology on
the fly so from this we kind of some of
our outcomes where what are these new
cultures and aesthetics of blending the
two worlds together what is wearable
tech disruption so thinking much more
about beyond just a one device but
thinking about it as an entire system so
a network of people sensors day
and devices and then also we love that
idea of like a wearable that can be
altered edited and updated and upgraded
and then also made to order so thinking
about how you can help drive kind of
this personalization and be more
transparent about the process and then
of course this new service model so
thinking about a shop around the corner
that you can visit to you know edit and
upgrade and install your wearable device
on your body so thank you
um so that was just we did it in a day
but we kind of talked about different
models where you know maybe a tattoo
shop model as you come in for a
consultation then you come back so maybe
the team would then you would meet with
them then they get an idea and then
they'd actually build and make so we
like the idea that I could kind of its
dependent upon maybe what the client
wants it was a full day we start in the
morning and then I I mean we ended at
about three but depending upon we kind
of think of it as like depending upon
what the wearable is you know so we were
like oh you could exchange a nail
technician for a tailor and then she's
changing or making a shirt and said so
it would just depend on for that for the
time to make the wearable
yeah I mean I think that's what was so
interesting to us was yeah some a lot of
it became just around like simple
sensors that we could install now so a
lot of it was more just like haptic
feedback but we see it as like oh where
can we go with this but I think the
interesting thing about prototyping on
fingers is that it kind of indicated
this more model of accessories that you
would be wearing multiple different
wearables on your body so the hand kind
of became this moment for us to realize
that each finger could host something
different which reflects much more where
we're kind of going with wearables is
that you're you're going to have may be
assured and then a necklace and
something else so thinking about them as
this ecosystem I think was really
interesting for us and that's what a
learning came from kind of installing on
the hand itself
um well we were sourcing all of our
sensor is just that like simple
electronic stores so I mean it would
depend on what the client was interested
in
I mean I think that's the great thing
about being stuck in one room together
is that you would just if you didn't
know people were just kind of I think it
was because it was set up as more of
like a sharing environment people were
just willing and I think also the
atmosphere and we're really trying to
push that like idea of like salon
culture where it's about like chit
chatting and hanging out and that's much
that's a part of it so i thought we're
hoping that we ever one kind of learn to
so if you didn't know what that meant
people were sitting next to each other
who could help you thanks daddy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
