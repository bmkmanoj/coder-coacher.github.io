lectures freely available
you
so welcome back after lunch
I enjoyed it I hope you all enjoyed the
lunch
and I can see you're here for a special
treat we have a very good topic this
afternoon it's called the strategic
importance of e science
we have three very distinguished
speakers all of whom
involved in research in a broad set of
areas and
and including funding of the research
which gives them a unique perspective on
this overall topic
by strategic we are thinking about the
impact that a science research and e
science results may be more broadly can
have upon society and everything from
what happens in the medical fields to
what happens in the humanities and I
think actually we're very lucky to have
three such people here on the panel our
approach will be that we will give each
of them a few minutes to give some
general comments and then we'll be open
for broad questions and answers and
hopefully we'll have 45 minutes to an
hour left for that because really the
intent is to have a dialogue together to
raise issues to ask questions for those
of you who are participating from the
audience to make your own points and
contributions to this so that's what we
have in mind we will have a wireless
microphone which Mariah over here will
bring around at the right moment so be
sure and arrange for that as well that
allows us also to record recording the
session to capture some of the questions
for people who watch it in the future
so with that we have three distinguished
members of our panel Chris menso who
works for the Gordon and Betty Moore
Foundation out of palo alto california
Jason rody who were very happy to have
has joined us from Washington DC works
for the National Endowment for the
Humanities and then carlos enrique de
Brito cruz who's involved out of appt SP
is the senior director i believe his
title something like that but in any
case he has a lot to do with the
research that takes place in the state
of são paulo so I think we'll start in
this order and let Chris come up first
and if you'll switch the power point for
him we would love to have that thank you
good afternoon
my name is Chris Menzel I'm a program
director in the Gordon and Betty Moore
Foundation the more foundation was
started in 2000 by Gordon Moore the
founder of Intel and famous for his
Moore's law about the doubling of
transistors density every 18 months you
may have heard of him You certainly have
his processor in your computer right now
almost definitely he started the
foundation with the mission to make a
positive difference on the planet and
specifically in environmental
conservation and science and in the
science program we focus on non
biomedical life and physical sciences so
things like microbiology of the oceans
up through cosmology astrophysics and
what we started noticing hopefully this
works
is that no matter what
discipline we were funding we would
receive requests for handling data
whether it was extra compute or data
management data analysis tools and as we
saw this pattern emerge over and over
again we decided to start looking at
some of the root causes for why this was
happening and so I may have I may have
skipped this in the title slide
but what became clear was that the focus
for us should be not so much on the
technology but rather on the people who
bridge the gap between the technologies
that were being demanded and the science
questions that were trying to be tackled
and so so modern scale science data for
us is not just big data volumes of data
but also the highly heterogeneous data
and the fast-moving streams of data and
actually there's a fourth dimension that
I've been hearing lately about the
veracity of the data how much you can
depend on it
in any case these people sometimes
called pie-shaped which was coined by a
Jim Gray Award winner Alex xalay an
astrophysicist out of Johns Hopkins
University you could also call them East
scientists or data scientists I think at
that point we're just talking about
marketing terms and but we're talking
about the same thing and we're talking
about not just individuals but also
collaborations between folks that have
methodological skill in the statistics
and computational sciences as well as
life and physical sciences in our case
although this really does as ice talking
to Jason over lunch have a much broader
scope if you look at the trend towards
all of research including humanities
Social Sciences so I'm just coming at it
from the lens of the Moore Foundation
in case of the people became very
clearly the strategic focus point and I
believe this is a something for all of
us to consider beyond what new
technologies needed to handle data it's
who makes that technology or transfers
that technology for use in science
questions
these so from now on I'll be referring
to them as data scientists but again you
can call them e scientists you can
whatever term you find resonates the
data scientists are interdisciplinary
they work in between disciplines and
there is a definition I found candy
which is the something that was coined
by Drew Conway at NYU before he moved on
into the private sector he coined this
intersection between statistics computer
science and a domain or a subject matter
expertise and it's that at that Nexus
that something special seems to be
happening that handles and leverages
data for new knowledge and I think this
is broadly recognized in science at
least the need is recognized but the
skill set is relatively undervalued and
it's undervalued broadly across almost
all scientific disciplines and here's
what I mean
so when you were coming from computer
science or statistics the people who are
at this nexus are often seen as doing
applied work and sometimes maybe if
you're in an applied statistics
department that's okay but often if
you're in a computer science department
being applied is essentially the kiss of
death you're not going to get a
conference paper with your end iteration
application of a novel technique from 10
years ago even though maybe that novel
technique didn't actually work and you
made it I think a lot of you some of you
are nodding your heads but I think a lot
of you can appreciate that not fitting
the standard model for what it means to
be whatever discipline in the life and
physical sciences folks that are doing
this work are often seen as being too
computer science ii or just programmers
and this is unfortunate because these
folks as i mentioned before desperately
needed and there's a phenomena that
we've noticed over the years of funding
these folks as well as just hearing the
constant challenge that they're under
is that when submitting a proposal and
you may recognize this in your own work
to a particular discipline say
oceanography
the oceanographers will point this way
to the computer science departments or
to the computer science funders and say
well that's clearly computer science and
so you submit your application to
computer science and they'll say well
that's clearly oceanography and some of
you are nodding your heads and you
notice this so where does this great
idea that we one likes and you can see
the scientific impact for but it doesn't
belong
so we're trying to to handle that and
one of the ways that the data-driven
discovery initiative at the Moore
Foundation is tackling this is through
really trying to build a home for this
kind of research across the campus so
our first foray into this is a large
collaboration partnership really between
three universities in the United States
NYU university California Berkeley
University of Washington along with a
funding partner with the sloan
Foundation what we're calling data
science environments these are intended
to be not just centers but really places
on campus that can support this
interdisciplinary work of e science data
science what have you
and so there's really the crux of this
talk is about the blueprint for these
homes what what do these homes consist
of and I think you'll recognize many of
the themes here but these are the these
are not unique themes many of you are
working on areas that that will resonate
with this and its really the sum total
of all of these themes that I think is
something for all of us to start paying
attention to so first and foremost
career paths what does it look like to
do a science in a classic traditional
discipline if it's astrophysics do you
need to have the same career path as
your pie as your as your mentor or is
there another career path for you and
this is particularly important
when we start folding in what industry
wants from the workforce and there
paying quite handsomely for this skill
set so career paths within academia an
ecosystem of software so that we're not
just building one-off solutions but that
we're thinking about how the solution
fits with other solutions education and
training that's not just the formal
tracks or the professional master's
degrees which are popping up in the
United States quite rapidly but the
informal training things like programs
like software carpentry which is a
nonprofit that does short boot camp like
trainings for not just new scientists
but also scientists who are trying to
fine-tune their skills open and
reproducible science is another theme
that we're focusing on how can II
science help with a growing crisis in
all of science not just computational
science to be reproducible reusable
replicable collaborations and this is
particularly interesting the use of
physical space for collaborations so as
we move more and more virtually for all
of our work we do still find value in
coming together in sessions like this
but even with our collaborators in
person we still tend to be productive in
a different way in physical proximity
and each university is looking at how to
use that to its advantage across the
university
and finally studying what we're doing so
if we're still emerging and evolving
e-science or data science for all
disciplines we need to understand how
this movement is going and so one of the
things that the partnership is committed
to is studying in real time how this
partnership how this conglomeration of
different themes can move data science
forward or data-driven discovery
again pick your marketing turn
so moving forward some suggestions is I
believe this requires us all no matter
what discipline were coming from or
whether or not we think we're
interdisciplinary to remain open
particularly to remain to recognize
multiple forms of impact moving beyond
just recognizing the scientific article
that comes at the end of the research
but on earthing the rest of the iceberg
of effort the code and the data
particularly that goes into creating
scientific results measuring that and
recognizing it
obviously we're very committed to
supporting building supportive homes but
many of you are building support of
homes in different ways and learning
from each other about how what's
effective and in which ways is I think
very important
and then finally to look for those who
don't naturally fit so again if you can
look for this and recognize when it's
not just that the persons not doing
quality science it's you have to of
course get over the bar of doing quality
work but once you've passed that bar to
really look for when when is something
just not fitting in one particular silo
and take a second look be open to it
there's another way of not naturally
fitting and it's one of diversity and I
want to just mention something I just
saw yesterday on a wired article it's an
opinion piece by Claudia perlick and
it's a great piece I recommend it I've
linked it here hopefully the slide deck
would be available but one of the things
she said which was apropos of this talk
was that the problem with data science I
mean academia is it's not where the
magic happens and I think it's not so
important to think about whether or not
this is true but I think what is
accurate to say is that this is a belief
held by many young researchers coming
through
whether you call it research or data
science or computational science there
is quite a bit of fervor around that
skill set in industry and there is
certainly amazing fundamental research
to do in industry but it is not the case
that it needs to be unmagical in
academic research I think many of us are
committed to exploring ways that we can
support the best people to stay in
academic research and for that we need
to again stay open and think about about
homes for data scientists the last thing
I'll say about this is that this was not
just magic as in the problems are
magical but specifically with dr.
perlick it was the acceptance of being
female in research
the acceptance that in this case IBM had
of her as a researcher first
it was quite remarkable so again I
recommend
this is a point of reference so abregado
thank you very much and look forward to
your questions later
hello everyone I want to thank
burrito and the rest and Microsoft
Research of the invitation to be here
just thank you Chris for that wonderful
toga there's so many things that
resonate I think with a lot of the stuff
that we're doing in humanities again my
name is Jason rody i'm in the office of
digital humanities a Senior Program
Officer at the National Endowment for
the Humanities
and neh is a independent federal agency
in the United States it was formed in
1965 so we're coming up on our 50th
anniversary array for us and we fund
research in the humanities and Social
Sciences you might be familiar with
state of the National Science Foundation
and we're sort of like them but we also
find things like history literature and
so forth this is defining the humanities
according to the legislation that put us
in place and you can see it's kind of a
capacious definition it's not even
really a definition at all if you look
at it it just says what the humanities
might include but is not limited to
things like language both modern and
classical linguistics literature history
jurisprudence philosophy archeology
comparative religion ethics the history
criticism theory of the Arts some parts
of social science and basically anything
that says history uh it's part of the
humanity so you can imagine that most
things do fit in here in some way now
when neh first was created 1965 we had a
funding call in 1966 and among our first
call for grants was called for projects
that were quote for development of
humanistic Lee oriented computer
research and if you look at our first
one of our first grants in 1967 this is
a mcbee card by the way this is how we
kept a database an analog database of
our file records in the first 20 years
or so of our existence and and this was
an neh grant to support a conference to
explore potential application of
computer science to the
of research in the humanities now this
grant was for a whopping sum total of
six thousand three hundred and twenty
dollars that's in 1967 and if I had more
time I'd chart a slightly longer history
for you I feel sort of compelled at from
any age to do that that would have we
would have discussed discussed as we're
digitizing their old records were
finding the involvement of IBM and
fostering sort of the earliest
components of using computation
alongside the humanities it was thomas
watson jr. the chairman of IBM at the
time in 1965 who was on the commission
that helped form the National Endowment
for the Humanities in IBM was central
and for several conferences and even one
of the first publications of what we
might consider digital humanities work
so it's much later where acls the
American Council for learning societies
released in 2006 our cultural
Commonwealth which was a report on cyber
infrastructure needs in the humanities
and Social Sciences modeled some of you
might know that in SF had a similar
report
couple years before that led to their
development of the office of cyber
infrastructure and it had a series of
recommendations for what in this time as
with the rise of information technology
resources what humanities and social
science researchers would need and we
use this in part to help create the
office of digital humanities to foster
that those programs so odh goals
developed you can see here some of the
recommendations develop and support
expertise and digital humanities which I
think you can match a lot of times with
e-science develop new and support
existing humanities and social society
sciences computing centers the
development of tools for the analysis of
digital content and of course promoting
collaboration and we created a lot of
programs that tracked along these needs
I'm only going to talk about one in
particular but so why the humanities in
why data why and maybe even big data Roy
Rosen swag back in 2003 historian at
George Mason University and one of the
founders of early did
humanities center of the Center for
history new media wrote historians in
fact may be facing a fundamental
paradigm shift from a culture of
scarcity to a culture of abundance and
you have to understand in humanities
research oftentimes we're looking for
the exceptional right the exceptional
novel the exceptional person the
exceptional historical moment and so and
and so we would tease those out of a
select group of date but now we have a
greater removed from this culture of
scarcity to abundance and now we have
all this data how does that change how
we think about history literature and
culture now in 2011 in science magazine
this nice little statistic where the
Google Ngram books in Graham corpus
contains over 500 billion words the
corpus cannot be read by a human so
we're moved beyond that point the
sequence of letters is 1,000 times
longer than the
genome and if you wrote it out in a
straight line it would reach the moon
and back 10 times over so this is more
than what a single scholar sitting in a
single archive or a collection of
archives could actually handle right
that's just eight years later what are
the projects that we funded in the
program i'll talk about digging into
data was mining a year of speech and
they did a bit of comparison about what
is big humanities because you would
typically not think along these lines
well on a small scale and big science
you've got the human genome at three
gigabytes but the digital archive of
southern speech 350 gigabytes okay or
something right hubble space telescope
images about half a terabyte a year the
year of speech archive they use is about
a terabyte 9 terabytes uncompressed in
archival format but you get up to
something like the University of
Southern California show up archive
which is a collection of oral histories
of Holocaust survivors of 200 terabytes
or even if you consider once we digitize
all the worldwide analog audio at least
12 if not to 100 petabytes so there is
big data in the humanities so what our
strategic needs when we talk about
important strategic importance we talk
about needs and values so what are the
strategic needs we've noticed abundance
we have our capacity for digitization
has exceeded our ability of scholars for
analysis so there's a question of
dealing with
there's the question of scale how does
scholars know what questions can even be
asked of larger data sets it's
transforming the ways in which we're
thinking about scholarship and then that
brings with it a need for skills need
for collaborations across disciplines
because no one scholar can hope to to
have expertise and all the skills that
are necessary to pour through this to
collect the data and so forth in an
adequate amount of time and that brings
with it a need for training not only
technical training which is something
that we work on but also social training
how do we have conversations across
collaborative boundaries
so one of the programs that we created
was digging into data neh is the lead
agency on this and the idea between
digging into data is to address how big
data changes the research landscape for
the humanities and Social Sciences one
of our first round our first round was
in 2009 we had a second round in 2011
and a third in 2013 it is 10 funding
agencies across four countries the US
which has us the neh the NSF and I MLS
Canada which has a few funding agencies
including assess HRC short the
Netherlands and the United Kingdom and
we funded about 40 projects that require
at least one or more international
collaboration so you have to have a team
of partnership across at least two
international or you know across one
international border and it covers a
wide array of media newspapers sound
files text images moving images all
sorts of things so what are they doing
this is data mining with criminal intent
it analyzes the history of crime using
the Old Bailey online archive that has
extensive court records of about 240
years of criminal history in Great
Britain and it has about 197,000
transcribed trial records and so the
team is composed of scholars from George
Mason from the University of head for
higher and the University of Alberta and
they were able to do a couple of
interesting things so they did some
analysis where they were looking at
co-occurrence and so they discovered for
example that there are frequent
co-occurrences with the words poison
drank and coffee whereas poison eight or
eaten were not as frequent and so what
we've learned is that coffee was the
poisoners medium of choice and 18th and
19th century London so keep that in mind
when you go to your coffee break this
image here plots the length across the
200 years of legal history of
of the archive and what is trial length
in words and so the scatterplot what do
you see move I have a little laser but
if what you see is you see the
scatterplot sort of splits about the
first and second quarter of the 19th
century and what that represents they
discovered is the increased use of the
plea bargain because trial links either
got longer or shorter because if someone
will be out they'd have a very short
trial and as opposed to going on too
much longer trial so they're getting a
sort of sense of intellectual history
and of criminal records of the UK
another project mapping the Republic of
Letters is a body of 53,000 18th century
letters and they're analyzing the
correspondence networks from various
people during the Enlightenment so
people like Voltaire John Locke Benjamin
Franklin it's a collaboration of
humanities scholars librarians computer
scientists from Stanford University
University of Oklahoma and Oxford and
among the surprising findings where that
figures like Voltaire and lock bolt in
France lock in England who you see as a
humanities scholar they're rare letter
that goes out to a foreign dignitary and
you think oh this is must be how it was
we had to exchange correspondence across
vast spots of land but in fact what
they're discovered is that they are much
more nationalistic in their
correspondence than previous expect
previously expected so it's changing our
view of what the Republic of Letters
even look like one final example the
impact radiological mummy databases
because everybody loves muggles right
this is a collaboration across
anthropologist medical imaging
specialists cardiologists and so forth
and what they were looking at they were
looking at they collected in mind whole
body CT scans of 137 mummies
from Egypt Peru South West America and
the new teen islands and the team found
signs of the hardening of arteries heart
disease in thirty four percent of these
mummies and also discovered that it
afflicted mummies not just from one
particular area but across all of the
different geographical groups that they
were looking at so what that does is
actually reveal that heart disease of
this type is not a modern affliction
because we eat too many cheeseburgers
necessarily but actually has a genetic
disorder and it's actually transforming
the ways in which people are going about
medical science it also has the added
benefit of increasing knowledge for
Egyptologist and anthropologists to your
studying engine
and this is where we get into cross
domain value this question of need and
value so what are the strategic values
of this kind of work one is impact how
can historical knowledge impact future
research and knowledge creation as with
the moment this is a scan of one of the
mummies in CT scan
another is openness and you see I'm
basically reflecting a lot of the things
that Chris has said data availability
the creation of a pis and tool reuse and
platform development so that people can
reuse those tools the mapping of the
Republic of Letters project went on to
win further funding from neh and they're
developing platforms one's called
palladio so that the methods can be used
across multiple domains not just with
18th century letters correspondence but
any kind of data set that you
and upload it into sort of a Google
spreadsheet and poured it into the tool
and start playing with mapping
correspondence networks and we've also
been able to use the beginning to data
challenge to leverage people who are
holding private collections in order to
open them up to researchers for further
study which has been a great thing the
third strategic value want to talk about
is productive collaboration so what does
that mean it means fostering
collaboration that respects domain
knowledge domain methods and individual
research questions one of the things
that we've discovered in putting
together programs like this is that you
can't ever look at collaborators as
service providers you have to look at
collaborators as researchers with their
own interest and expertise and be able
to come at a problem maybe with
different research and questions
entirely but put that together into a
collaborative package one of our other
projects the poem viewer this is a
project from the University of Utah and
the University of Oxford and they're
looking at a corpus of poetry and sound
the idea of sound and catherine coles
here you see in the picture says we
discovered early on that we and the
computer scientists have very different
approaches to the material they're much
more systematic than we are and they
really want to be able to pin things
down and it's not the instinct of the
poet to want to pin things down we want
to open things up and so there's just a
fundamental difference and sometimes in
how people have approached cultural
heritage material and material in
general but knowing that understanding
it creating those community
collaborative ties allows you to move
and answer both sets of questions so
this is just a small view of one program
that we run to support innovation in
humanities research with his cross ties
with the science and I'll invite you to
learn more about our projects you can
see our URL up there in eh gov / o th
and you can also access what is here the
first report is a two-year report and
development from the Council of learning
and information resource library and
information resources clear that they
did on the first round of digging into
data they have extensive commentary both
on the overall process and also on the
individual projects and I invite you to
check those out well i also have a
second report that's funded by the UK
partners on the second round sometime in
2015 but for now thank you very much
good afternoon thank you for the
opportunity to participate in this
discussion I will my contribution here
will be 33 parts first I will
give you an ideal what we do at this
Impala Research Foundation to reach the
point at which you will understand why
is that we've got involved with the
science and with beta
we've
the subject of this conference of which
the simple research foundation is one of
the of the promoters the simpler
Research Foundation is a public
foundation in the state of some polymers
funded funded by the taxpayer in the
state of são paulo
it has the mission to support research
in all fuse so it is a Research
Foundation it's not a science foundation
section
term so we fund research in the arts and
the humanities and philosophy and
psychology bio chemistry and chemical
engineering astrophysics physics and if
research
as I said the foundation is funded by
the taxpayer in the state of some power
which is one of the 26 resilience states
but is a especially relevant one because
the state of são Paulo response for
about one-third of GDP and the way the
foundation is funded is that the
constitution of the state has an article
that establishes that one percent of all
state fiscal revenue
to this one day so
that gives the foundation sizable degree
of autonomy and stability
for example we never have to negotiate
with the governor
the state Senate a budget for now
one percent and actually the
Constitution mandates that the
government is
moser to transfer the money to the
foundation every month it's a legacy of
the years in
huge inflation and getting
was completely new for
sin
all proposals that we receive and we
receive a 25,000 of those in 2013 all of
them are peer reviewed many times we ask
the scientist to submit the proposal
in English viewers anywhere in the world
we have some pride that for best when
the fact that between receiving a
proposal and sandhya
a decision to the proposer took us last
year on average 65 days it might not be
the letter the researcher want
it is a decision
request our expenditures in 2012 were
close to six hundred million dollars we
use it that money to support fellowships
for students and postdocs every month we
pay between 11 and 12 thousand people to
work in research in the state of some
bomb some are undergraduate summer
graduate students and about goes to two
thousand are postdocs
persons who received fellowships from
capacity not have to be Brazilian they
only
in a research organization in the state
of someone so everybody in the world is
entitled to request a fellowship of data
stuff that
as long as they are doing research in a
university or research institution here
in the state of some time then we also
fellowships use about thirty-five
percent of our money the largest chunk
of our money goes into what we call a
Democrat which is investigator-initiated
research research in which we do not
tell them what they are going to
research on their decision we fund that
through to year grants five-year grants
11-year grants and also to a program
which is for a young investigator person
who has been opposed dog for three four
five years can submit a proposal to us
and be funded to start his or her
research laboratory in the state of San
Paolo with a grant for four years
frequently those are multi-million
dollar
grants because the young investigator
doesn't have anything in their stomachs
they need to
the stuff and fellowship
and so on then we have a program in
which we fund research together with
companies but for best partners with a
company on a matching fund basis one
dollar from Corpus one dollar from the
company to fund research performance at
a university which has results
interesting for that company some of the
companies we associate with are listed
there Microsoft Agilent got scammed
Petrobras Umbra hair and so on we have a
list of more than 100 of those
partnering companies that research is
from the dealer to two-year grants or
five year grants or ten year grant for
what we call engineering research
centers which are centers which for
example
life has been pagosa plan is for working
on
fuel basic automobile engines and we
have a program through which we fund
research in small businesses last year
we approve it free grants every week to
a small business is unpalatable research
in anything for pest has been other than
working with investigator-initiated
research when we want to emphasize a
certain topic we organized a special
program which has a those in parallel to
our open-ended entry for research
proposals and we started doing that with
a program that we did back in the 90s
which was a genomics project which was
when we became aware of the need of
connection between certain domains of
science and computer science because for
that
next project it was necessary to have an
intense contribution from computer
scientists to analyze
they were working with then we have we
started a program back in 1997 on
biodiversity which is our biota program
which also had several very important
interconnections with computer science
because for example part of the work of
this program is to map all the
biodiversity in the state of somehow so
it means they needed to
jus reference it to have the maps to map
the evolution of certain species in the
places and so on that's a program that
today involves around 300 p is thousands
of thousands of graduate students then
we had in 2009 a bioenergy program
bioenergy bioenergy is very relevant for
Brazil because about eighteen percent of
all day energy user in Brazil every year
comes from violence comes from a plan so
dirty so it's very important
you to study and know and understand
well about sugarcane and through this
program we ended up with challenges
related to the sugarcane genome which
resulted in a research project which is
being developed now between researchers
here in Sao Paulo and colleagues at
microsoft research because the sugarcane
genome has several characteristic that
makes it especially while especially
complicated to to determine then we have
a program which is our global climate
change program started two thousand and
then again with several connections with
computer science with large data sets
with processing of data one of those
challenges is in developing a global
climate model which there are some of
those models
seven or eight but the one which our
scientists are the scientists funded by
farfetch for developing is one that
includes the global features and at the
same time is able to look in detail at
features which are relevant for Brazil
which do not appear in other global
climate models again a strong connection
to computer science in it and because of
all that and because we have been
involved with computer science for some
time and with certain aspects of digital
scholarships for example fast is the
organization that brought the internet
to Brazil back in nineteen eighty seven
nine
forgan knighted in 1997 digital
repository of open access journals you
see 1997 open access journals was an
expression very seldom spoken in the
world we were doing that back in 1997 to
our CLO repository which became today
one of the most excessive scientific
repositories in the world I mentioned to
you the genomics project I have to
mention to you that the Brazilian
Society of computer science organized
that i think it was in 2007 call you
sometime ago 6 a workshop very
interesting workshop about challenges
for computer scientists and their
came up with this idea of connecting
computer science to other domains and of
course we as funding agency we are very
conservative so whenever a scientist
comes to us with a new idea we say well
that's difficult I don't know have to
look into that and so on but they kept
coming and coming until they come visit
us that it was a good idea and of course
we had a lot of support and stimulus
from our colleagues with whom we have
been collaborating especially at
Microsoft Research Tony hey is a person
that helped us a lot that Harold Juliana
Darren so that we launched it this year
the focus program on a science to which
we wanted to foster connection between
researchers in computer sciences and
colleagues in other domains we had a
first call for proposals we receive a 27
proposals they are being selected as we
speak and we are looking forward to have
a number of proposals selected from this
fall that will start our
in science fraud is the last slide that
I want to mention is just to list some
of the opportunities and challenges that
we see in this is science strand of our
activities of course there are enormous
opportunities that we can see new
research using data analysis
visualization data gathering processing
and several other activities at the same
time there are challenges because
in our view of course the first step
towards developing any science
activities for you to have collaboration
between scientists scientists in a
certain domain scientists in computer
science now the thing is that
even for collaboration
have fruitful collaboration between
people who do not have some words in car
it cannot be one
computer science and I mean they leave a
yellow note that night to the computer
scientists and the other data computer
science appears with with a nice
solution to whatever they want doesn't
work like that they need to understand
each other and this is one of the one of
the important barriers that we feel in
our system here in San Paulo
it might happen elsewhere in the world
but it certainly is present here the
fact that there is a on the one hand a
super specialization of the scientists
the scientists tend to become
what would be described by describe it
by a Dirac Delta function you all know
what a delta function is right when you
know everything about nothing that's a
very very successful scientist and we
would like I think for this kind of
collaboration to have scientists who
look more like a Gaussian function which
there is a tale that can overlap with
the person they are talking to the
problem is that it adds to this
difficulty the fact that many times when
hearing with you and people are choosing
their
undergraduate courses part of the
decision in many cases is made by the
following reason well
cannot take any more mac so i go into
something related to life sciences or
the amenities and then it's difficult
for those persons to connect your
computer science and at the same time
people who go to engineering or physical
sciences
understand all those
complicated work so at 17 years of age
they tend to be split apart and then
when they are at age 30 we want to
reconnect them and it's not so easy
right so there is a challenge which I
think relates to the whole
supply chain with the educational system
with the way education is done for the
for the youth and we are thinking of
ways to to to work around that so that
we can actually foster collaboration
between people who talk more or less not
the same language but who have at least
some common language between among them
and of course that requires us to look
for new ways of educating training for
an integrated approach because it might
be good at some point to have persons
some persons who would be able to do
both things to know to have the two
gaussians in their mind the Gaussian
about the specific domain and the
Gaussian about computer science because
then
need to have the communication because
communication is a difficulty right
unless people have the
the Vulcan page mr. Spock uses to read
the minds of other people it's hard it
takes time to communicate to tell people
about what you need and so on so one of
our i think it was grease that mention
about analyzing large datasets when you
are analyzing most of the time in my
experience you do not have all the
questions before the questions of beer
as you are doing that but you need to be
doing that you cannot be sleeping while
the computer guy is going through the
lines and the data and so on so that's a
challenge that we see and we hope to
contribute to that through our science
problem thank
so now before we take any questions from
the audience I'd like to just ask our
three panelists a short question which
hopefully will have a short answer as
well when we talk about strategic
importance one way of thinking about it
is what impact for the world would be
missing if you didn't do one of the
activities you have I think I'd like to
start with Jason in the humanities area
you have a lot of things you talked
about you talked about digging into data
and other things if one of your major
focuses was not pursued by some agency
or by researchers what would we be
missing as human beings and then the
same question will apply to Chris and
Brito as well well I think I would
answer you know I mean we're not curing
cancer right so but I think I would
answer along the lines of what burrito
was just talking about which is to say
that as our information economy
continues to change it's impacting the
ways in which all of us are working you
know we have had this hyper
specialization and will continue to have
hyper specialization but the ways in
which e-science is allowing people to
engage in cross-domain a
cross-discipline collaboration I think
it's going to be very important across
just about every single domain if it's
impacting the humanities of the study of
history and anthropology and archaeology
then it's certainly going to impact the
economy and its
impact biology and medical sciences and
so I think that would probably be that's
my short answer Chris yeah so with not
so much with my data-driven discovery
official hat on but I think it's pretty
clear that data driven decision making
is right across almost every sector so
we're seeing it in advertising in a big
way in places like Bing but it goes much
much beyond systems like that for
deciding how much to sell and I
that message and we're starting to see
the conservation
really anywhere where there's a
financial impact for making a decision
and with incomplete information I think
this is an area extremely ripe for human
impact certainly there's a whole science
question but societal I think decision
making is up there Rita well my my
choice would be a grant a project that
we found a center that we funded for
pets which works with public policy and
through processing large sets of data
about Brazil about the municipalities
they can learn they could discover
relevant things and recommendations
about for example the relation between
inclusion and exclusion or poverty and
the environment and how people are
distributed in cities and how that
connection relates to the number of
years of education of the persons and
how they participate in society and all
that becomes relevant information for
renting public policy in several levels
in Brazil thank you thank you so with
that we'll open it to discussion with
all of you and please wait for the
microphone start one back there and then
her okay we'll start here
okay so that okay we switched the order
my question is like a general question
to all of you and I'm an astrophysicist
I'm a scientist and one thing that I
usually find while working you know like
in this a science and interdisciplinary
field is that it's difficult to find a
partner and the computer sciences
especially because what is a
breakthrough and new research for us
it's not necessarily you know like new
for them usually they already have the
solution but it's not going to turn into
a publication for the you know like in
in computer science so I don't know what
are you thoughts on that and Buddy
cookies that assigns proposed are still
open no not the one called we will have
other calls I'll take a crack we've been
thinking a lot about this and there's no
easy answer to this someone mentioned i
think you know computer scientists don't
want to be tech support for domain
scientists fair enough but that said
there are plenty of folks with computer
science skills computer scientists who
do want to use their expertise to make a
difference to make an impact to
contribute and sometimes that is more
pragmatic than their careers allow so if
they're going to publish in computer
science I mentioned this already they're
going to met published in computer
science conferences that conference
paper may not count for your
astrophysics publications so its
reciprocal to write like your your paper
doesn't help then their paper doesn't
help you so the long answer is we need
to really work at this middle and start
looking at contributions to science that
are not just papers and that are not
just papers in the one discipline what
you can do as a as a scientist emerging
in this
bass is a little bit more difficult
finding finding like-minded folks is
your best bet and asserting over and
over again to funders like us that this
is important even if it doesn't lead to
traditional measures of impact but sorry
I don't have the clear answer but check
back in four or five years and maybe you
can maybe these guys do that right I'm
jubert poster LOL map and applied
computer scientists at the Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory and my I
want to ask a question about open its
open data open access tube methods in
software we scientists that are doing a
science work we can do a grassroots kind
of work and work the bottom of the open
is issue we can work with individual
scientists trying to convince them that
the that openness is is a good approach
for them but what are the approaches
that funding agencies can take to foster
that kind of open approach to data
requiring a data management plan and
allowing budgets to do data management
where are simply things that can can
work in that but what else what else can
be done in that respect well we are
requiring even in the humanities now the
data management plans you're seeing a
lot more of data management librarians
showing up as you various universities
and you know we have them on speed dial
for all of our applicants and allowing
for you know I I mean openness is a
balanced against sustainability right i
mean openness is a great idea but it is
an ideal and there's some stark
realities about sustainable models out
there and so you get different degrees
of openness depending on the levels of
sustainability that one is able to
support i think also openness can
sometimes be an ideal for certain kinds
of institutions that maybe have the
resource
to account for sustainability where some
other kinds of institutions are not able
to do so I mean it's a very as you as
you know a complicated matter what we
try to do is one in our grant
applications we express a preference for
openness we don't require it along in
our major grant programs not only do we
require at least in the office of
digital humanities a data management
plan but we also require a
sustainability plan this is required
this allows people to to justify their
decisions for openness right because if
they can present a model in which some
of the materials they have they have to
restrict either for cultural heritage
reasons you know it could be indigenous
knowledge right that they don't have a
right to make open or it could be
archaeological data that cannot be open
because of lutein it also can be data
that you know we're not out of copyright
I mean we have a whole 20th century of
basically missing scholarship in some
kinds of data science because of the
proprietary nature of things so we
expressed a preference for openness but
give an opportunity for the applicant to
make the case that's based on what they
know and what they think is the best
case for further material thank you yeah
yeah in our on our side we we we started
to to tackle this challenge by first by
creating this repository of open access
results of science which is CL then our
second step was to put in place a policy
requiring that all researchers funded by
past must make available their
publications in an open access
repository at their institutions this
policy is in place however we are not
enforcing it tightly so far because many
institutions are still divided
being their own institutional
repositories and now we are in the
process of discussing data management
requirements for certain proposals in
our science program the call required
the proposers to submit their data
management procedures for for the
results but we are with what we are
going to learn from analyzing those
proposals we will perfect it to using
all of our problems but we certainly
consider this to be a very important
route towards developing science in the
state of something so I just want to
pile on I think the requirements are
absolutely necessary both and you often
hear about the two levers the two
incentive levers of science the
publishers and the funders and but
having both of them on and requiring
data sharing plans is clearly part of
the answer but I again I keep digging at
this problem because it's not it's a
necessary but not sufficient step
because when you start thinking about
what constitutes a funder generally
speaking particularly public funders of
science of research but what drives
funders and publishers are peer review
almost universally so peer review then
are making decisions about what to fund
and what not to fund how good the data
management plan is if they're even
looking at it and so I keep coming back
to the peers are essential that's the
sufficient step you need the
requirements but you need the peers to
see or to agree universally that
openness is a signal of impact and what
we're beginning to see is a recognition
that's just staying on publications for
a second not so much data yet but we'll
get there is that open access articles
have higher impact right there cited
more there's some study I wish I could
quote it off the top of my head right
now but that's that's an interesting
finding and we're going to see more of
that I predict over the future and we'll
see that for code and we'll see that for
data and ultimately impact is what
matters to everyone in this room and so
that's the thing that's going to tip it
over the edge I I predict but we can't
do it without the requirement but you
need also the peer-review community that
p is to agree that's important thank you
so we have two questions over here Dan
and then the cats thing so I think
you've you've actually sorry I'm Dan
Kent University of Chicago I think
you've you almost answer the question I
was going to ask but but i'll try to ask
it slightly differently anyhow so I
think the if I summarize what I've heard
it's that there are things that the
funding agencies want people to do
differently collaborate across
disciplines collaborate between computer
science and other disciplines other
things like that and the mechanisms for
encouraging that primarily has been
funding and then secondarily has been
mandates data management plans data
sharing things like that and then the
third piece which there hasn't been much
discussion of until again Chris's
comment just at the end has been the the
community incentives that make people
want to behave in this way without the
funding agencies requiring them and so i
guess i'm curious from the point of view
of the three of you as to what you think
the agencies can do to change the
culture so that people will behave in
this way without you having to give
the money or say that you must do this
must be a good question I'll go I'll go
I think that there's absolutely a role
for funders in this conversation but we
can't be the only voice which was why
frankly I was happy that this was
organized as a panel discussion and not
just a bunch of funders talking to folks
about the wisdom that you know the
magical wisdom that funders have I can
say from my perspective and I imagine
it's similar for my panel my
co-panelists hear that that it's not so
much that we want things to be
collaborative but what we're seeing is a
demand for collaborative collaboration
and so for instance in my program we're
very much responded to the demand from
the community that we were serving that
the thing that was missing were the
people that were being that were working
interdisciplinary that we're bridging
the gap and and so in addition to
mandating and incentivizing with money I
think also convening folks and coming to
convenings like this with folks that
generally are part of this early wave
this early movement to have e science or
data science or data driven research be
kind of firmly established in the
Academy writ large but that's that's the
instigating rule that we can play I'm
happy to be on the stage but many of you
have greater wisdom in many areas and so
being in a dialogue together and finding
ways to gathers is something that option
funders have a little bit more breathing
space to
do I would say that we mean we at an EHR
field driven and so most of the work
that we do it's rare for us to have
thematic calls like digging into data
most of our calls are fairly open but
most of the decisions that we make in
the even the formation of the office of
digital humanities in the creation of
something like taking you to data were
based on field driven articles
discussions convenience and so forth
Greg Crane who was a classicist well
known for the Perseus project the the
phrase what do we do with a million
books which was an article he wrote for
d lib was was in fact one of the key
articles that led to the formation of
digging into data and so I think Chris
was hitting the nail on the head in the
end of his comments for the last
question which is that peer review but
in pure motivation and field driven work
is what really leads us in the
directions and then what we try to do is
create opportunity to fulfill what it is
that the field wats yeah I would follow
on that perhaps by stating that the well
at least for us here and some bottled
the agency is it's connected to the
community it's not that the agencies in
a castle and it creates inventions even
though most of the researchers sometimes
think it is like that but the things
that of all the programs that i have
described it there they only we only
started thinking about them because some
relevant part of the science community
brought those ideas to us so that
applies also to the two in what pertains
to the to the values however it's I
think I understand your question in the
sense that it is much more difficult to
change the values of a
unity Dan to offer than money to do this
or that research and to have these are
that criteria and that is something that
we see when we when we have a program
like forcing each science project we
send the proposals out to reviewers in
many cases the reviewers will come out
with comments like well why is that you
need to have a computer scientist with
someone else why is that they it would
be better for them to hire a company to
develop whatever because the reviewer
didn't understand what was that the
basis of the thing but you have to keep
working with the community until those
values are are heavier in there they're
thinking so I am Kathy McEwen from
Columbia University and I'm a computer
scientist and so I'm somewhat dismayed
by the sort of negative comments about
being built the willingness at the
computer scientists to do
interdisciplinary work i served as
department chair at Columbia in starting
in 1997 and at that time was doing
interdisciplinary work with the medical
school and I certainly saw a lot of
interdisciplinary work going on within
the department including quite a few
tenure cases that went through during
that period of time so I think computer
scientists I mean my view is that a good
number of them are interested in doing
interdisciplinary work and so the
question would really be for people who
are looking for computer scientists how
to you know how to make that happen and
a better in an easier way on the one
hand i would say that just about every
field is looking for
or scientist so when we look at you know
sort of bringing people together it it
can often be that the computer
scientists are overstressed in terms of
the number of other people who are
asking for collaboration I guess one
thing I would recommend is sort of to in
order to avoid the the pitfall which is
which chris has mentioned which is that
computer scientists don't want to be
seen as technicians you know doing other
people's you know an interesting sort of
work is to leave open the scope of
possibility you know so for example if
you throw a data and a sort of issue
that you're working over the side of the
fence and then begin conversations I I
think that often things are opened up
that perhaps that our directions for the
computer scientists that the person in
the domain might never have thought
about and of course it goes the other
way to where the person in the domain
can sort of open up problems of the
computer scientists had never thought
about one last thing I would add is
publications so I think this is briefly
mentioned mentioned but certainly having
venues for publications that are far
more open to new and different kinds of
work would be helpful
thank you have more questions this one
right there actually dan hanson i am in
dress on unicamp and my question about
the thing i see that you are investing a
lot in the idea of is science but still
it seems to me that is science is
something of computer science and
science and in my view is much more than
that I think that probably the science
will be the future perspective of
science in the sense that you take the
science as an object of study and try to
improve it the view and so on and so
forth and I want you to ask to the board
what you see as the future perspectives
of investment and looking on in science
it's how you see that we this will
improve or grow in the future can I go
first here well that is that is
interesting because the way when i
finished my my slides there had one line
I've in the last line which was like
training people to understand each
other's demands and domains and so on
but actually what were I the next thing
that I had in mind but I was not bold
enough to write there is that in some
cases we would like to have at some
point in the future those two persons in
one person that is a person that was
would be able to think about science
using themselves the instruments of
computer science because then you would
be more into the realm of doing a
different type of
science and not only adding two things
but I think there is a long way to there
and I do not think it it would be a
something that you should try to convert
into a pattern to be followed that will
happen in some cases you have some
person who will be able to do that or
will be willing to risk that and will
feel happy about doing that in many
other cases I would say you will be
talking about the repair the
collaboration the domain scientists and
the computer science and then of course
we are supposed to to spend time and
effort in lowering the barriers for this
connection I think along those lines
we're seeing increasingly there's a lot
of humanities scholars you want to do
some kind of work with computation but
they don't need the skills that a
full-blown computer scientist would need
you know they need to be able to write
scripts to clean up the to do data
curation they need to be able to to you
know write basic algorithms in order to
do some simple searches they need to
program in are so they can do
statistical analysis right and these are
not things that they need a computer
science degree to do and so what we are
seeing are transformations and education
not necessarily specifically in graduate
programs although sometimes but I'm
thinking of at the University of
Virginia for example there's a lab
called scholars lab and they're drawing
humanities scholars PhD students from
across their disciplines and they run a
six-month to a year-long program and on
top of their regular study in which they
do training and basic scripting and data
curation in project management in our or
something like that and they all build a
lot of times a project together that
would be considered a digital humanities
project right using some components of
the science or data science or computer
science but you know not requiring again
the full component the full tool kit the
computer science has and I think that
that's an opportunity for us to explore
new educational models where we're
training people to know enough right I
mean knowing a little bit as a dangerous
thing of course but it has a two-fold
effect one it allows them to do some of
the basic work that you know is maybe
some of the work in the past we would
try you would see a scholar maybe try to
hand over to a computer science
colleague that they may not be
interested in but it also opens up these
opportunities for conversation and
communication when they are at a point
of collaboration right they know enough
to be able to have that conversation so
that when they're really up to speed
when they really need to move forward
with the project in which a
collaboration would be a fruitful thing
both the computer scientist and the
humanities scholar have the vocabulary
to make that collaboration possible I
think all all that was just said is
spot-on though the only thing I'd add
just because we do at least the Moore
Foundation think about this is data
driven research data driven discovery is
I just include in the conversation
statistics often overlooked some nodding
heads it's foundational that's part of
the three-legged stool that we subscribe
to and I think it's just important that
you know the answers were spot-on and I
would just kind of sticky note
statistics on to that so question here
hi my name is Anderson from us p my
question is for Carlos you mentioned a
lot about genomics and the partnerships
you got between the PSP and the
companies but my question is I have you
got any actually partnership between fab
as being any other company that works
with metabolomics not at this point no
we have the partner the collaborations
we have with companies refer to other
other topics known in metabolomics
specifically no
um thank you ah this is a really
interesting and I was kind of thinking
about your ethnography issue of when you
mentioned that it's one of the
dimensions that you were trying to
foster an understanding did I get it
right and understanding how data-driven
science and these collaborations go
about or did I get to go I mean I mean
this is not the end of my question this
is the beginning of a question but at
least that's what I understood and based
on my understanding of what you said
okay I was thinking of what the the
panel mentioned about education training
and ending up with British mentioning
that may be ideally a person should tend
to self-sufficiency up to a certain
point to be able to think with two heads
or three heads or four heads and
complimenting what Jason said about
training people to use tools now what
about diversity and when I mean
diversity I do not mean a gender or
culture or race what I mean is about
diversity in conducting science and so
that different kinds of people with
different profiles and different views
would develop maybe better science and
in this sense the self-sufficiency or
the use of tools would not be enough so
did you wonder what Oh was it will
attempt yes it and partly it's it's how
to get a simple answer to a fairly
complex question but maybe here's a way
to think about it at least the way that
one of the ways that we're thinking
about it and the reason why I think
ethnography is important so it turns out
if you talk to enough people this
phenomena that we're describing sounds
very familiar to a lot of us this is not
the first time that we've dealt with
different academic cultures coming
together computational science comes to
mind as well not emerged as an area
where two very different cultures needed
to come together bioinformatics emerged
and really kind of developed its own
culture but what we keep saying over and
over again is culture an academic
culture and communication and we're most
of us a bunch of scientists not me
particularly but most of you all are
scientists and yet we don't often apply
science to how we work and so there is
there's a science of science and there
is a there but the practice of
ethnography allows us to observe and
record and try to understand how it is
we work live produce and I think it was
really the discipline of applying I mean
this first emerged as we were designing
this partnership is the data science of
data science you know let's not go forth
and not collect data analyze it and use
it for improving ourselves but let's not
say that everyone else should do data
science but we shouldn't use it on
ourselves and so it really is a
recognition that that there's and I
think Paul mentioned this that there's a
certain amount of social engineering
going on that we're all involved in all
of us really and that if we want
something to change its not
enough to just put a carrot or stick out
but that you really should understand
how people work I don't know if that's
sort of I thank you so I'm going to ask
one final question and then claudia has
an announcement if you want to give the
microphone to her my final question is
do you have a dream an area in this
whole field we've been talking about
that you could see in the next 10 years
could make a huge difference I asked you
the question the other way before if we
didn't do something what we would lose
I'm now asking you the question in terms
of talking about the strategic
importance of East science is there one
thing and it's okay if you all come up
with the same thing that would be
interesting is there one thing that
comes to your mind that really would be
fantastic I don't know who goes first
I'm a real quick answer Oh support
misfits repeat that so misfits misfits
people who don't fit find those people
who keep getting told to go over there
for funding and yet have the most
brilliant idea start working with them
finding them but also supporting them i
think if i had a dream it would be in
five years that there are a lot of
misfits being funded and in line with
that that's the people sided in the
subjects domain side I think domain
overlap supporting domain overlap is a
very complicated thing but you know I
mean we funded a project called makuu to
which is content management system that
respects indigenous cultures cultural
protocols about individual objects so
certain people within indigenous
cultures have a right to see certain
kinds of objects or do not have a right
or maybe that a culture does but the
rest of the people don't but they still
need archival practices and this same
project is going around and working with
indigenous tribes and talking not about
sort of just cultural practice but how
it impacts
like water water waves and the science
of water in their communities right so
you have these multiple overlays of both
cultural practice pure science of like
just water and cleanliness and health
and all these sorts of layers and I
think supporting that kind of cross
domain research is an area that it would
be nice to be able to foster even more
well my my shot here would be to see
researchers interacting much more
intensely across domains not only
computer scientists and scientists from
other domains but across all domains
physics with life sciences and so on
because of course data is an important
part of that but it seems to me that
most of the big challenges in energy
health public policies environment today
our challenges which cannot be tackled
by one discipline they need many
disciplines and whatever we can do to
lower the barriers for the interaction
of scientists across domains will help
so my dream would be to have them
interacting much more intensely in the
future thank you so this is just the
beginning tomorrow morning we have a
panel session on the subject of going
native which actually is a very good
continuation and was partly covered
today so we will continue the discussion
with a different group tomorrow and with
that I would like to thank our panelists
for spending time with us and sharing
their experiences and knowledge
