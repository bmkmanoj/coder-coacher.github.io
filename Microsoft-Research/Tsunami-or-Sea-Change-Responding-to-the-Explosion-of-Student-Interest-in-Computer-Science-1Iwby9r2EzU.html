hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
so our next speaker is a professor ed
Laszewski from he's the Bill and Melinda
Gates chair in the computer science and
engineering department at University of
Washington he under his stewardship the
department actually became the world's
first and foremost one of the first and
foremost research institutions in the US
and in the world but in onions technical
lives one of the things that he's been
were that he worked on a long time ago
is again in your hands right now so
imagine the 40 years of 40 years of
computer revolution that has happened
and how the systems have changed from
vacuum tubes to mainframes and so on and
the the one thing that has enabled us to
scale to these sort of devices that we
don't have in our hands is the fact that
these operating systems these Kernels
have been able to manage the orders of
magnitudes of new resources that are are
available and some of the algorithms
that Professor Oscar and his students
and his collaborators have designed are
fundamentally part of each and every
operating system from windows from Linux
to iOS to even things on your watches
and everything and so with that let me
welcome professor let Oscar to the stage
well thank you very much it's great to
be here you've already been sitting here
a long time what doesn't everyone stand
up for 15 seconds and then sit down okay
just stretch great good thanks so I
asked Sean do what I should speak about
and gave him several possibilities and
he asked me to talk about the burgeoning
enrollments in computer science in the
United States and I searched my brain to
imagine why that he thought that might
be of interest to any of you and let me
try to couch it in this way interest in
computer science in the United States is
increasing dramatically now and that's a
good thing but there is and I'll talk
about why and I'll show you some of
these trends but there's still an
enormous gap but
Queen the things that need to be done
and the number of jobs that are
available and the number of people that
we in the United States will ever
graduate you live in a country where the
smartest young men and the smartest
young women want to be engineers and
computer scientists okay we live in a
country in the united states where the
fastest growing undergraduate major is
parks recreation and leisure all right
so kids who grow up in the US want to
work in you know the cruise ship
industry or something like this right so
there is going to continue to be an
enormous gap between jobs available in
the u.s. in India in the world and the
number of people who are educated to
take advantage of those jobs and so this
opportunity is going to be enormous for
the foreseeable future and I really
think this gap is going to grow so what
I want you to take away from what I have
to say is less that there are many many
many more students in the United States
interested in computer science than was
the case a few years ago and rather that
the gap between the work to be done and
the people available to do it is going
to continue to grow and this is just the
greatest field in the world for you so
that's really what I'd like you to take
away so again i'll talk about trends in
student demand in the US I'll talk about
some reasons that I believe that this is
going to persist rather than just be
another one of the cycles we experience
all the time I'll talk a bit about
responding with demand and I want to
thank Eric Roberts from Stanford and
Jimmy Carosa from the University of
Massachusetts and the National Science
Foundation who've helped me gather this
material so let me quickly show you
what's going on at my institution in
Seattle Washington the University of
Washington and with all of the data that
I show you I want to ask you to focus on
the slope of the line rather than the
numbers because to you here in bangalore
and in india the numbers will not seem
that great the important thing is the
change in the numbers that's taking
place so and you may not be able to read
the legends on these but i'll describe
them to you this is incoming students at
the University of washing
and their intended major among
engineering fields okay and it covers
about a seven year period and what you
see is that the interest among entering
students in computer science is
skyrocketing compared to any other field
of Engineering and that was not
traditionally the case we were sort of
in the muddle with everybody at constant
interests so what's happening now is
interest in various engineering fields
is increasing slightly but interest in
computer science is going through the
roof this is interest in our
introductory course again just take a
look at the slope of the line not at the
absolute number although these are
pretty big numbers for an American
University the blue line is our first
integrity course that's cs1 and the red
line is our second introductory course
that's cs2 and these are annual
enrollments so what you see is that one
year looking backwards we taught 3,000
students in our CS 1 course but
importantly that's more than double what
we were teaching 10 years ago right and
same in cs2 so that's the University of
Washington picture and that's what
interested me and looking at at national
data so first of all across the country
introductory course enrollments are
really increasing enormously this is an
article from the new york times a year
ago about the introductory course at
harvard the enrollment is shown in the
chart on the right it leveled off
briefly it's actually up again this fall
i understand here's the interesting
thing at harvard students at Harvard
want to become successful typically in
traditional business with the exception
of Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates all
right so for decades the largest
introductory course at Harvard has been
the introductory economics course the
sort of traditional business economics
course and this year computer science 50
the introductory computer science course
is the largest introductory course at
Harbor so more students are taking intro
computer science at Harvard than intro
economics or any other course and that's
quite a change but this is not just
happening at Harvard it's happening at
stanford at the University of
Pennsylvania and at MIT right and it's
not just happening at elite private
institutions it's happening at the
University of Washington and the
University of Michigan and UC Berkeley
at all of these schools interest in the
introductory course is climbing
enormously and it's it's putting a
strain on us in terms of our ability to
handle these students come the
enrollments are exceeding previous highs
I'll show you the cyclic trends in a
minute but in the United States we had
relatively a surge in enrollment around
1999 or two thousand and then we had to
decrease in interest but interest now is
greater than it's ever been in the past
by a long distance a greater proportion
of students are taking the second course
so this shows at my school the
University of Washington the proportion
of students who take the first course
and continue on to the second course
which is up from about half to
two-thirds in just the past few years
right so people are continuing in the
field at least in some instances the
participation of women is increasing I
see a number of women in the audience
here and i'll come back to this theme in
a minute but this is the percentage of
women in our first course RCS one course
and again in 15 14 years it's gone from
twenty two percent to about thirty six
percent still not great but a greater
interest in women in the field in the
early days of computing if you look at
photographs of the programmers on e niak
you see an amazingly diverse group of
people and that seems to be the case in
the u.s. 10 years ago 15 years ago and
we're making some progress headed
backwards now that was introductory
courses demand for the major is also
increasing at stanford there are now
more computer science majors than all of
the humanities combined that's not
unusual for india india has tremendous
enrollments in engineering it is unusual
in the united states same at MIT same at
the university of pennsylvania same at
harvard
so tremendous increases in students in
the major this is the top 25 majors at
Harvard about seven years ago you see
economics government social studies
psychology computer science is fifth
from the bottom this is the top 25
concentrations at Harvard last year
right so the only one that has changed
significantly is computer science which
has gone from somewhere in the 20s to
number five among popular majors at
Harvard again the numbers are still
small Harvard is a small school compared
to most schools in the US are here but
nonetheless interest is increasing
Carnegie Mellon many of the people at
Microsoft were originally at Carnegie
Mellon including Jeanette wing you'll
hear from later and of course Raj ready
Carnegie Mellon has a very small elite
undergraduate program that only takes
about 150 students a year and last year
they had more than six thousand
applicants for those hundred positions
right so just an enormous enormous
interest another thing that's increasing
in the US is demand for upper division
courses by non majors and I've got I'll
explain the reasons for all of these
things in a few minutes or attempt to
explain them but the chart on the Left
shows non-major demand for the third
course at Harvey Mudd College and
undergraduate engineering school on the
right is upper division undergraduate
enrollments at UC Berkeley a big great
public university by students who are
not in computer science so what you see
is more and more students who are not
computer science majors are taking upper
division courses class sizes are
expanding again the numbers may not be
so impressive so look at the at the I
don't have trends here but typically
upper division courses at smaller
schools like Harvard and Cornell were 50
or 60 students and they're now in the
hundreds Andrew Inge a widely known
faculty member at Stanford taught a
graduate machine learning course lat
year that had seven hundred and sixty
students in it again that may not seem
like a lot to you but this is a course
that you would expect to have fifty or a
hundred students in its Stanford
certainly does not have 760
undergraduate or graduate computer
science majors so people are flocking to
computer science to learn what they need
to know for other fields and that's the
point I'll come to in a second so there
have always been these cycles in demand
what this graph shows is bachelor's
degrees granted in computer science in
the US over many many years so you can't
read this but on the left is 1966 that's
when we first started granting
undergraduate degrees the first peak was
in the middle 1980s right and then we
suffered a decline in interest the
second peak was around the year 2000 or
2001 and we suffered another decline in
interest and interest is now increasing
again so again the numbers are less
important than the trends this is a
field which has cycles of demand but I
actually believe that it's different
this time and I'll cite several reasons
and then hopefully this is something we
can discuss during the
question-and-answer period first
Jeanette wing has been an advocate for
many years of what she calls
computational thinking and I believe
that students are finally figuring out
that in the 21st century everybody needs
to have facility with computational
thinking computational thinking maybe
isn't even computer programming it's the
way we think in computer science we
think algorithmically we think logically
we know how to decompose problems into
pieces that can be solved independently
and we know how to combine those
independent solutions back together into
a solution to the overall problem we
know how to debug debugging is stepwise
fault isolation we understand models and
modeling and former models we understand
grammars right so there are a set of
things that constitute computational
thinking that everybody needs to know
and I think of programming not just as a
valuable skill but as the hands-on
inquiry-based way that we teach
computational thinking and I think
students are honestly figuring this out
and understanding that they need to take
at least an introductory programming
course not just to become a computer
programmer not to go work at a great
company like Microsoft although that's a
possible outcome but rather because
programming is the way we learn
computational thinking and everybody
needs to know that even if they're going
to be a lawyer or a doctor or something
like that okay secondly every field is
becoming an information field right
linguistics is becoming an information
field biology is becoming an information
field back in the 1950s Watson and Crick
discovered the biochemistry of DNA the
ACGT double helix business okay and what
they really discovered was that your DNA
as a digital code and that digital code
can be deciphered and modified and
rewritten and from that day forward the
leading edge of biology was an
information science and the ability not
just to think computationally but to
actually compute was important let me
give you another example from when I was
an undergraduate many years ago it shows
how long this has been going on I took a
graduate linguistics course with a
friend we were both computer science
majors and historically in the United
States the main criterion for becoming a
graduate student in lewiston you spoke a
couple of languages right and at that
point though when I was taking this
course linguistics through work by
people like Chomsky and hodge Ross was
becoming a computational science people
were dealing with formal grammars okay
and computing against for that day large
bodies of text right and a couple of
computer science sophomores second-year
students in computer science could run
circles around graduate students in
linguistics who couldn't compute and
couldn't think
mutational e right so this is happening
to every field and if you can bend the
computer to your will cause it to do
what you want it to do you're going to
have an advantage in almost any field
the third thing is I think the
reputation of the software industry is a
place to work is a lot better than it
used to be and not just the reputation
but the reality we have this cartoon in
the United States called Dilbert Gilbert
is this poor boring guy who works at a
poor boring technical job and has bosses
he hates and I think this Dilbert
reputation of computer science that you
sit in a cubicle and work in a solitary
way staring at your screen all day has
really both the stereotype and the
reality have disappeared right this is a
field where even our students who work
at hard port infrastructure jobs at
Microsoft and Amazon and Google all of
which have large installations in the
Seattle area claim that they only spend
one third of their time actually writing
code the rest is working with teams and
with customers in design right so so the
field really is not an insular isolating
field it's a field in which your ability
to work with others and communicate with
others is of tremendous and increasing
importance here's the job situation I
want to spend a bit more time on this
all of the jobs in STEM fields are in
computer science to first approximation
so what's stem in the u.s. we talk about
science technology engineering and
mathematics and you hear people talk
about the value of a stem education and
stem jobs and the need for more students
in stem and that's in fact I mean
there's lots of value to studying any
field of science to studying physics or
chemistry or applied math or computer
science but the fact is where the jobs
are in stem and where the job gaps are
is in computer science so every year in
the US the bureau of labor statistics
sorry every two years projects job
openings going forward a decade and they
only do this every other year and they
lag by a year so the newest
projections that are available are for
2012 through 2022 and what I've charted
here are all of their predictions for
newly created jobs in the decade twenty
twelve to twenty twenty-two for the
various STEM fields so these are jobs
that will be newly created in the US in
this decade and what you see is that
seventy two percent 71 percent of them
are in computer science right so that's
the blue part of the oval the circle the
red part alright fifteen percent is
newly created jobs in all other
engineering fields so that's electrical
mechanical civil chemical aeronautical
industrial right all added together is
fifteen percent of new jobs whereas the
computing occupations are 71 percent of
newly created jobs in this decade in the
US all of the physical sciences are
three or four percent all of the life
sciences are three or four percent all
of the mathematical sciences are three
or four percent all of the social
sciences are three or four percent in
the United States where are all the
degrees all of the degrees in the US are
in the social sciences alright people
majoring in psychology or sociology for
some reason certainly unrelated to job
opportunities now these are newly
created jobs we can also consider all
available jobs whether they're newly
created rather than available to
retirement due to retirement and
computer science is a smaller percentage
here because we're a younger field and
we're retiring less fact rapidly than
other fields but even if you look at all
available jobs in this decade in STEM
fields computer science is fifty-seven
percent of all available jobs
engineering has now grown to twenty-five
percent if you look at computer science
and engineering added together they're
80 or 85 percent in both of these okay
so once again the physical sciences the
life sciences the mathematical sciences
and the social sciences
buying contribute only fifteen or twenty
percent okay so all of the available
jobs are in computer science or in other
fields of engineering so there's just a
tremendous opportunity in terms of newly
created jobs and available jobs in the
field that you are studying here's the
situation in Washington State again this
is just one place in the United States
but it's where I happen to live and it's
also where there's a really robust
software industry Washington state is of
course the home of Microsoft it's the
home of Amazon it has substantial
installations engineering offices of all
of the major companies from elsewhere in
the country Facebook Google Twitter
Linkedin Alibaba now are all present in
the Seattle area and there was a study
done a year ago that looked at the gap
between jobs available and degrees
granted in Seattle across all fields and
what the study found was there were only
four fields in which there was any gap
at all in the state between jobs
available and degrees granted and only
two of those fields had a gap at the
bachelor's level those were computer
science and secondly all the rest of
engineering added together in this chart
the gray left-hand part of each bar is
the degrees granted in the state each
year okay and the blue bar the blue
portion of the bar is additional
available job so the total length of the
bar is jobs available per year in the
state now these are predictions
measurements they're not gospel they're
not precisely accurate but they're the
best we've got and what you see is in
the state of Washington at the
bachelor's level there are only two
fields that have a gap between jobs
available and degrees granted one of
them is computer science the other one
is all of the eight fields of
engineering added together and the gap
in computer science is two and a half
times as large as the gap in engineering
right so across the United States and in
the state of Washington
and around the world the opportunities
in computer science are absolutely
enormous and all of us want to encourage
you to pursue this field whether it is
to use computer science skills in some
other field or to use it as a software
engineer or to become a researcher at a
company like Microsoft the opportunities
are just extraordinary no matter what
you choose um here's one other factor
that causes me to believe that that this
interest in the field will persist
although they're always going to be some
cycles there's an organization from
Seattle called code.org how many of you
participated in the hour of code or know
people who did oh great right so Hadi
part o be on the right is a former
Microsoft employee actually twice a
Microsoft employee who two years ago
decides to take on the challenge of kids
not being exposed to computer science in
schools in the United States and around
the world in fact and he created this
organization called code.org and last
December and this December ran something
called the hour of code and his goal
right was that every child would spend
just one hour learning to program in a
drag-and-drop programming environment so
they're not writing Java or C or C sharp
but they are learning algorithms and
loops and conditionals debugging the
sorts of things we deal with all the
time and between last year's hour of
code and this year's hour of code 95
million students have spent one hour
coding that's a very big number compared
to all of the kids in the world it's
really just extraordinary all right so
this has made a tremendous dent in the
field they are now developing materials
to help people teach computer science in
from elementary school to high school
and I really think this is going to
cause a significant change in student
interest by the way in the first hour of
code the first year about 25 million
students participated in the hour of
code but it was more women and more
minorities than in the entire history
the entire 50 year history of computer
science right so
this has affected a broad cross-section
of the population in ways that we
haven't reached them before so I believe
that cycles will continue there will
always be ups and downs but this trend
of interest i honestly believe is going
to continue to grow and let me talk a
little bit about how universities in the
US are going to respond and then i'll
conclude and believe the next speaker a
bit of extra time at universities in the
US a relatively small percentage of the
faculty are in computer science but a
growing percentage of students are in
computer science and plus there is
growing introductory course demand upper
division demand by non majors graduate
non-major demand universities are not
going to be able to respond in a way
that scales their programs to correspond
to these this increase in interest and
we really have seen this happen before
and it didn't work out very well I
showed you that in the middle 80s and
the middle 2000 student demand increased
what happened in the US was class sizes
grew we had more and more courses taught
by teaching assistants instructional
quality decline faculty left
universities for industry jobs industry
jobs are great but you need faculty to
teach the students and it's not clear
that we're going to do much better this
time there are set of possibilities of
course you can restrict the size of the
major you can exclude non majors from
upper division courses we can retreat to
the core of computer science and leave
the rest to somebody else we can have
gigantic classes and decreases
instructional quality we can hope that
it all works online all right I want to
talk about my concern about diversity
and then I truly will conclude let me
explain why why diversity matters in
this field first of all Raj said to you
that computers are used by people that's
pretty obvious but each of us has our
own perspectives that we bring to any
design problem
I am going to design systems that are
best suited for use by 60 year old white
north american males because that's what
i am right so if you have systems that
are designed by only one part of the
population then those systems are
unlikely to meet the needs of the whole
population right design of computer
systems is inherently really creative
this is something our colleague bill
wolf has made very clear it's a creative
process and everybody brings their own
perspective to a creative process and if
you don't have the full diversity of the
population represented then you're going
to get a worse solution so the reason
for wanting a diverse workforce in
computing is partly well you'll have
more workers and partly it's more fair
but I think the most important reason is
you get a better outcome at the end if
you have a more diverse population
contributing now here's my concern in
the u.s. most academic programs in
computer science or any other field want
to have reasonably sized upper division
classes and we may not have controls
over who takes those classes so the way
we limit the size of the upper division
student population is by having a
hostile introductory course we call them
a weed out course okay an introductory
course the goal of which is to get you
not to continue to choose some other
major to show that you're good enough
right and so let me show you some
statistics from the University of
Washington we do not do very well in
diversity and our undergrad population
we do do better than others this is
computer science degrees at the
University of Washington which have
grown from about sixteen percent to
about thirty percent women in the past
five or six years this is the list of
all computer science departments percent
female in the US and this is
undergraduate programs at graduate
departments so you see that the
undergraduate programs at departments in
the US that have graduate programs have
just a terrible representation of women
right now here's the interesting
statistic whenever a student takes our
first course at the University of
Washington
we ask them to fill out a survey okay
and one of the questions on that survey
says what's your interest in becoming a
computer science major on a scale from
one to five one is I have no interest at
all three is I don't know I haven't
really thought about what it one way or
the other and five is yes I want to be a
computer science major right and then a
year later when students choose a major
right we go back and look at what box
they checked right what did they say
when they took the first integer of
course and nearly sixty percent of the
women who become our majors did not have
that intention when they took the
introductory course right so they either
didn't have prior exposure or they had
negative prior exposure and they took a
welcoming introductory course of course
that really tries to help everybody
succeed and they discovered they enjoyed
computer science and they were good at
it and they chose the major and that's
true of only about thirty six percent of
the men right so women much more than
men discover computer science through a
welcoming introductory course and
succeed at it so if you create a hostile
introductory course to control interest
in your major because you don't have
enough faculty to handle all the
students the people you're going to
deselect the people you're going to
drive away from the field are going to
be predominantly the people who are
already underrepresented so i have this
serious fear that the
under-representation of women and
minorities the under-representation of
diversity in computer science is going
to become worse in the next five or ten
years because we're going to face these
expanding enrollments and we're going to
try to deal with it by having we doubt
introductory courses that get rid of
people and that's going to be terrible
for the field terrible for the solutions
we produce we're going to have more and
more solutions that Raj will be able to
give talks making fun of and that's not
going to be good for any of us um
finally and I really will conclude here
this this is my view of the field of
computer science and this has been
unpopular with some of my colleagues but
I think they're finally coming around
come in the middle is what I'll call
core computer science this is compilers
and operating systems and programming
languages and networks and database
systems it's all the things that we've
been doing for 50 years it's where I've
spent almost my entire career right and
this core of computer science is still
extremely important and we're still
making advances and those advances are
really necessary but around the outside
the colored labels those are the things
that really affect people's lives right
the speed of a microprocessor the amount
of memory on your computer the precise
internal organization of your operating
system that's not enough not something
that makes a sort of direct impact on
how happy you are maybe an indirect
impact what matters to you is whether
you have efficient transportation
whether you have cost effective and
sustainable energy whether you have
decent health care whether you have
decent education right those are the
things that matter to people and what I
want to argue is that advances in
computer science are essential to all of
those societal grand challenges and
what's been happening in recent years is
advances in the core of the field
advances in systems and architecture and
networking are being coupled to these
grand challenges by a set of newer
fields okay by things such as machine
learning human-computer interaction
computer vision robotics mobile
computing big data and the cloud right
so I think we're in a position now where
if what you care about is changing the
world in ways that affect people's lives
these were these labels around the
outside where you want to be is in
computer science because the future of
healthcare the future of transportation
the future of energy of Education the
future of scientific discovery the
future of all of these things depends on
the future of our field
okay and what we have to do is embrace
all of these things as part of what we
do all right that is the future of
computer science is not just better
operating systems or better compilers or
better programming languages the future
of computer science is tackling all of
these grand challenges in partnership
with others playing a role in making the
world a better place and that's what I
