slides which is always a traditional
thing in an art context this is
particularly bad as a couple of days ago
I became the only person to switch from
mac OS wire to Debbie an unstable so I I
did this all by hand and wooden
implements Richard store 1 this is 0 and
1 stupidly a midnight last night I went
wouldn't it be good if I actually
scanned in my hand written notes and
that which will probably nicer than the
front on this install which men are
porting a proprietary library to
download them from my point pen and so
this is my slides right this is this is
pretty much what you get out of what
you're going to have so there are pretty
much done ok so eight years ago I wrote
a blog post called the register and it
was eight years ago as a very very long
time ago that's what you were using if
you were incredibly rich for eight years
ago and it was a well posed about the
public in the private space of course no
one in the history sociology had ever
touched on this before and you know I
looked at as a blogger I look to the
previous literature on technorati and it
seemed to be an open space and I
two friends a tribe not yet and they've
never heard of these ideas so I just you
know wrote probably the first piece on
this topic and an executive summary of
my damning new ideas well we have
different registers we have different
ways of speaking when they're talking to
our friends the public at large and also
what we're telling secrets and this is a
limiting an important division right
that most people think when we ship
between private and public on the
internet there's a revelation going on
and after this one of Revelation going
on after you say the same things in a
private registry to your friends like I
kind of think I guys are dead and then
when you're in the public and you're in
a public space like this you don't see
those things you just say well you know
I kind of disapprove of or disagree
respectfully we thought that person to
say it's the same essential content
right when you speak publicly people map
that bad you know I guess it did yeah
yeah because you don't want to be on the
front page of New York Times say Daniel
Bryan says but whoever he was referring
to is is so so so this is the problem we
have on the Internet is that frequently
things were written in that content chat
logs little conversations between people
and lift it out of that context with no
translation process and then dropped
into the public and it's actually one of
those things that it's one of those
unregarded things that journalists do
this is a whole way here of off the
record right off the record isn't I
can't report what you're saying and it
is an even kind of icon is strongly
indicates you say it's that i'm not
going to quote you word for word i'm
going to translate what you say in this
intimate moment into the public register
and in october two thousand three the
problem that lots of people were
struggling with was that that there
wasn't a stable place that right
you would have these private
conversations but they would be
instantly translated in the example that
I was talking about it was actually a
journalist colleague of mine arm had
discovered the secret foo camp wiki and
it was all very much that's going on and
like change world and it looked terrible
right there look terrible it looked like
you have got here in probe people in
vibrant and he said this to me very
happy because I was like a a muckraking
journalist at the Tigers we can't look
at this man then he ripped then he found
the invitation list and I was on it and
so there was this moment of tension and
I still don't have to go you know this
is as bad as it looks don't write about
me so so I also made some predictions
where I foolishly in 2003 to come with
this problem I think that's why it's
sort of interesting to go back and look
about now one of the things I thought
was well one thing I notice is that the
ntp is that as TV became more
distributed right reality TV shows are
just beginning to emerge this sort of
thing people were dropping into the
public register on TV very fluidly right
there that you turn a camera on someone
and then suddenly go into press release
mode and you see this in reality TV
these people are very conscious of the
role that they're playing it increased
increasingly so but I don't think that
was going to become any more incentive
and again reality TV show kind of
thrives on that difference that moment
of the private register being blazing
out into public and silly salaciousness
of them instead what i thought was that
they said that primary system will
regain a foothold well and we learn a
kind of tolerance for seeing that
private conversation cut and paste it
into this new context and we want freak
out in the same way as as perhaps we
would have done
the past when we were more used to these
gatekeepers I think I think the thing
that I didn't predict and I hope that
I'm to give them for doing this is what
happened four months later which was the
launch of the facebook.com a marker
Zukerberg production and a lot of the
language around the facebook as we call
it the young people I believe call it
that oh is it is centered around kind of
the privacy violations that go on
because of Facebook right then the idea
that Facebook is is is gathering all of
this data or redistributed and mining it
and so forth but I think you don't have
to give credit to this rise in the
social network is that it did very
successfully reclaim that private space
recreated a place where people could use
that register and sort of essentially
escape the ravages of the Google bar
right there was like a hiding place that
you could go where it wasn't easy for
your private register conversations to
be suddenly thrown context us out into
the arm there Eric wastelands of HTTP
HTML so I kind of tighten up it was
handed so this is this is one of them
right so so we have this move back from
the public into the private and Facebook
post but it doesn't that's not perfect
and you know people people's our private
conversations still come up like this
but but there are protections against
there are most social protections you're
sort of relying largely on the
understanding of your peers that this
has been flying because something is for
your friends after your item that this
thing that the guardianship of the
intermediaries right where we here in
this crazy situation where our most
private conversations that we don't want
to share with all the people in the
world we decide to hand over to us a
faceless multinational corporation right
but it will also explain some of the
oddness of facebook's as someone who
comes a TED Fromme sort of a traditional
internet background right one of it one
of the things that's interesting about
Facebook and Twitter and things like
this is they have a very profound lack
of search right have a very profound
lack of being able to like cut through
and find things and I think that this is
this up here since David Bowie's teeth I
can explain that so that Ison for me or
somebody you know from a tree Facebook
page this is really weird that might
search is essentially broken on Twitter
and Facebook you talk to the tank is
there and that kind of apologetic to do
that can i well you know we really
should get search working better over
this whole thing but they don't and I
think that's because there's no
incentive to do this because I actually
people want to preserve the context of
what they're saying um and so the Dave
of those teeth thing is is like it's
like when you're you know if you're a
smooth nightclub singer and David Bowie
turns out all you can think about this
is terrible teeth and how can you become
successful this article if you like
search is like David Bowie that's the
one thing you that's the one thing you
will remember about this talk prego
it was great he did he did indeed how it
fits a traitor to his country reference
so so there is that but there's also
like another shift and this going back
to like the prediction I may I think the
really interesting thing is the
acceptance of the private voice and
twitter is the thing that's been most
successful in allowing people to speak
in the private register in a public
space right and going back to my earlier
produces swearing I think Twitter
celebrity swearing is the biggest
indicator of this right is the celebrity
even you know a quite comic you know
countercultural celebrity but they come
on swearing or dissing someone something
in public it would be means right it
would always be used for something to
use that I see celebrities using the
square tonight will not talk about on a
Microsoft presentation and and you know
it's fine it's fine because there's a
set of an introduction to that little
space when you go onto Twitter and of
course that's one of the reasons why
people love Twitter right is that they
get us a here intimacy with celebrities
and that their pilot the conversation so
they're not shocked when the register is
is not the traditional public register
and there's another thing that the sort
of my cause is a great deal of heart
unfriendly at the moment and that's the
sort of rise of the commentary act right
these are people who comment at the
bottom of a formal public registered
documents and you know the cash and the
pain and the acts of this that the
people I can ill is written about I
think a lot of its put down and framed
as this discussion of of anonymity and
pseudonymity and circle actually I think
it into cash
registers right the discussion is in the
private register what you're talking
about and the framing of it is a public
register so you don't have comments
instance I don't believe the New York
Times does is on a picture is rightly
they learn that right because you have
like this high public register their
terrible death of pollen and politician
and if you know the comments are going
to be they're going to be well dad is
dead and I got what that's what you know
and so when people say but the comments
make me despair about human race right
that's because they assume that what
they're reading there is like basically
horrible filthy people whom they would
never be right well in fact what this
it's in there is the private register
they say people say things in comments
you and I would say here and now and it
doesn't sound outrageous two hours
because we understand that sort of
registration hour difference swearing
Tom Friedman i like to call it okay so
so so has there been any moves the other
way have there been a moves into the
secret what they have from from right
with you one people are more um there's
that five years ago right okay I will
bang through this ur so train triggers
things because people have become more
sensitive about things that will
suddenly elevate them into the public
sphere even if they're not particular so
I think the bill example here is
teachers right so teachers suddenly have
a sensitivity about even stuff that they
put on facebook because they know that
there are sufficient of a public figure
there's suddenly something they say
about something that is it secret this
is a private conversation will be
reframed and taken
like that so they take this offline they
take this I'll tell you later they don't
use the computer to have those kind of
conversations also we have the sort of
move from the secret okay to the very
public we have things that people keep
on their computers and suddenly what you
have is like the strat full explanation
of these documents moving over to here
and so we have a greater fear now of
keeping even our secret conversations on
the forum that we use to communicate
which is the personal computer and I
mean I stick this in my job right which
it because I tech journalism in places
like Iraq Syria and China and what you
see now is that syrian activists for
certain conversations and just don't use
computers at all and that's a change
right but if there's something more more
cautious about the use of technology at
all right and this this this generalizes
people don't trust the computer anymore
to keep their secrets and there's
another thing here which is the given
that we have this new this new register
which is the register of things that we
say or do that are recorded by our
computers that we don't tell anyone
right at my search history is not
something that has any register or
context to it at all there is no tagging
of how private or a public that is and
there's no suitable context for that and
of course except all of that kind of
data like which websites they visit
so forth is being spread up to these
different areas without any kind of
context which is why you get the kind of
shocked a tour of our Facebook beacon
and you have this sort of worry and
concern that the stuff is just leaking
out of this space so so now we have this
new generic conservative like things
that are moderated at all things that we
want to keep it a personal space but we
don't know whether their own personal
space or whether they are on the cloud
where they are nor users just a very
unconfident about even using technology
to protect that kind of thing so as you
can imagine ever since and predictions
now I do believe there will be more
swearing in the public space and I think
that's a good thing because because
people get it swearing so and I think
there's going to be a lot of panic I'm
this is a no-brainer right there's going
to be a very manic action to try and
protect data that's digital but but so
can be so easily revealed I think there
will i get a backtrack for my Drew's
prediction and say i think it's going to
be growing fluency negotiating with
Public Register and I think that the I
think that you know the most serious
thing the fact that I concerned about
both vers are sort of Internet freedom
activist and you know
human being and you know data and I and
others have talked about this is that
one of one of the worrying hearts about
the fluidity of the movement between the
secret the private and the public is
that people move very quickly up and
down the celebrity square I don't know
whether any of you've seen the 13 year
old video of the video of a 30 year old
girl talking about shaming which
it's just going up the viral register
right now I just gotta end about it and
and this is something that you know she
put out her friends in the private
register and now it's going on this
course repeatedly happens you know
Rebecca Rebecca Black and so forth and
our and concern right I'm concerned
because we know that when people are
pulled out of my contacts lift it up
into the public space and then dropped
without kind of protection the
protection of the fame of the famous and
the celebrity have gathered around them
and no training or football or
competency in that area it gets very
hard when they fall down and as a
activist one of the areas that South
Korea has always been going ahead of us
in what happens right and South Korea's
Internet freedom was credibly hard
impacted by stories of our pop stars
committing suicide as a result of what
was what was said online and it was one
of those things that just tricked people
and they immediately went into we have
to stop this from happening you know if
I'm you know Rebecca Black you're
committing suicide something that some
event like that is what causes civil
liberties to be children control endless
it's a tragedy in itself so you have to
get better at this and we have to under
and those cultural changes oh okay thank
you very much this is my public forum
the committee to protect others this is
my secret twitter it's not really secret
if you go there and and if you want any
real secrets in the wake up oh yeah
right better actually said that right
well so I this this is what interests me
right is the dialogue use a dialogue and
conveying what level of intimacy you're
sharing information with the computer
alone right it's a way of trying to
understand the best example of this is
that the feature that all browsers now
have which is privacy mode right which
is a way that you explicitly flag to the
browser that I don't want you to know
about us right I don't want my personal
business big highlight like has
rearranged the importance of things so
something that I'm just going to make
sure that it's somewhere to help
buried somewhere now facebook is
rearranging what it is if I it looks
like i have intentionally promoted some
things but in a private way right path
invented the wake up message right the
time to make a pot of coffee sounds like
something that i might have actually
said but i didn't actually say it oh
right like what i said was i woke up
right there by the public action but
this thing is not being said it public
at your face it as if I it said a nice
friendly little nothing reference
but that's their different every more
such I don't stuff like I said that's
really interesting that it's an
extremely interesting on yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
