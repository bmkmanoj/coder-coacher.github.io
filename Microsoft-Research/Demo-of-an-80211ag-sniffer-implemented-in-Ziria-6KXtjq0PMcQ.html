you
you
so let's record our little demo of zero
Wi-Fi sniffer on blade RF so here is the
sniffer running on a desktop PC down
under is the blade RF connected to USB 3
port of a desktop PC and over there is a
netgear router which is configured to
send at six mbps so bpsk one-half coding
read and write so what we see now here
we see a continuous stream of beacons
and will show later that these are
because coming from netgear address from
from a nokia phone and so on and now we
will start connecting another Nokia
phone to this Wi-Fi router so we'll see
a more interesting message stream yeah
so you'll see now some other messages
popping out part of a connection
protocol and currently our zero stream
is not linked to Wireshark directly
because there is a driver bit missing
but we manually copy paste these outputs
into y shark and we show you an output
here you see a stream of protocol so for
example these are all the because we've
seen from a netgear router to a Nokia
phone or some other equipment around
there and then we said we see the
sequence of actually the phone
connecting to a network thank you
