big data lecture series this is the
result of a joint effort between
Microsoft Research &amp;amp; Ching hai
university as a good example of how
Microsoft collaborates with academia to
advance the state of the art of computer
science research and a faster talents of
this industry now let's hear what our
collaborator professor Andrew Yao of
Ching hai University says so Cavill yell
could you tell us how to come up with
the idea that chinua and medicine
research can jointly develop this
beginners at super University we always
had a great tradition of collaboration
with Microsoft Research Asia and
therefore because Microsoft Research
Asia is one of the few centers in the
world that really covers a whole range
of topics in big data in research it
would be a wonderful idea Microsoft
Research Asia to develop a lecturer
serious in Big Data jointly with our
Institute so that the students not just
for China but perhaps later over the
world will have a chance to have a set
of good material to learn from so do you
think the students really enjoy the
course absolutely the students really
enjoy the course tremendously and they
even say that actually the less you know
about big data the more you get out of
it it will take you really fast from a
beginner to appreciate the richness of
content and the future opportunity
or big data now we have added a part of
the course and going to publish online
do you want to say a few words to the
audience this is a wonderful course it
covers the area of big data in a both in
depth and comprehensive way it covers
topics ranging from internet search
urban computing social computing
software analytics even visualization I
highly recommend all the interested
students to take this course it is
absolutely going to change your life
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
