bit about the design thinking behind our
concierge bot her name is Gigi so by now
you guys probably have seen a TED talk
or two so I probably don't need to walk
you through what a TED talk is but the
confident side of TED conference might
not be as well known so once a year we
all gather together we have like 50 to
70 speakers alongside as Brady mentioned
about fifteen hundred attendees and we
go to Vancouver we spend five days very
intensive and basically we get to know
each other we watch the talks and so on
so forth the idea of the bot came about
because we want to introduce a white
glove treatment to the people who are
attending to ted conference and the
email method for like which wasn't fast
enough and the vancouver convention
center which is a space that we were at
was really big so if you have a question
you want to ask and you're on the third
floor and it's like a 20 minute walk
it's really kind of annoying so we
talked what I was actually supposed to
be building in a nutshell was not
necessarily the original intention
wasn't really to build a bot it was
actually to build a messaging platform
that can manage instant queues for all
of these people who have questions and
to be able to support it immediately for
24 7 over the course of five days so
that was the task um what we ended up
with was GG is the bot should it be a
bot she certainly feels like a bot and
looks like a bot but you can decide
later so here's a quick screenshots of
our conference app called Ted connect
it's just a generic conference app that
we built homegrown has your typical
scheduling wayfinding and things like
that and this is sort of like the
interface for talking to Gigi not that
different from you know regular
messaging I won't go into too much
detail about how the app work or
anything like that because I want to
talk specifically around the concert
itself
and the five lessons learned from
designing GG so firstly on we moved away
from you know a nameless faceless icon
that is just like the Ted concierge and
we created and personified a character
called Gigi she's actually an Australian
hand puppet um somebody made it for her
and was just in sitting in office
actually it was like really no real
history behind her except she was cute I
commissioned an artist to illustrate her
three different state even though she
was supposed to be available
twenty-four-seven one of the lesson that
we learned is that some somewhere along
the way something probably will fail and
so we design a sleeping mode so that
people would forgive us we personified a
character what we found was that people
were intrigued and to get someone to
start using a feature you have to have a
reason right and intrigue was one of our
starting point we tease out Gigi was
available around the conference base we
never quite reveal whether or not she
was a bot and so we made her cute and
friendly and all of that stuff and what
we said we saw were that the increased a
conversation that comes in were more
kind of like more of a inquiry a
conversation as opposed to atom man as
or like what is wrong with my ex or
whatever that may be and so that was
really delightful here is an example of
a tweet that we found of somebody trying
to figure out whether or not Gigi was a
bot so she asked a question hello how do
you unicorns procreate so of course she
gets the answer now over time people
became more warm to chatting with Gigi
and got helpful answers now if if she
wasn't really a character we probably
won't get this kind of conversations
that was pretty good learning lessons
the second learning lesson was a
narrative framework the snow white
narrative framework was a method that
Airbnb is used to pivot their company
from whatever there were two a full full
end-to-end service design company a few
years ago it was written up in some
article the idea was borrowed
how Disney creates storyboards when they
could build animation and the core idea
for that is that every scene there's
what's called a moment of truth and you
then design the characters the scene in
the storyboard around these moments of
truth and we use this particular model
to map key moments of an attendees
journey throughout the ted conference
experience and within each of the moment
we would consider both what they need
and how they feel I want to underscore a
little bit that understanding and
empathizing are two very different
things so we understand that the first
time Ted attendee needs a personalized
schedule that's easily accessible we
empathize with the first time Ted
attendee that he or she might feel
intimidated by all of the things that
are happening and that might be an
opportunity for Gigi to suggest
something like might you want to go to a
first time or dinner this is how I map
out the moments so like you know
attendee is the first timer a moment is
on arrival this is what they need is
what they feel and these are the things
that did you could potentially be doing
once we identify a couple of these
moments we can then use them to further
build out which messages do we want Gigi
to initiate first in an unsolicited
manner and what time that should be in
order for us to be able to be more
helpful without waiting for the
attendees to actually engage first we
can also use the same data pool to do
things like figure out who who has
answered what question build out the
knowledge pull and also identify
escalation paths in the end of service
design tier so let's talk execution for
a bit the Ted Connect app is so we built
that ourselves the messaging platform
itself is super lightweight push
protocol nothing to tell really fancy
probably a whole lot less fancy than
some of the stuff you guys saw today we
use a product called live chat it's a
software that allows us to queue
concurrent increase and match them with
appropriate set of staff and there's a
pretty cool API there that we can plug
it into our event man
system so we can sink in like identity
with within the live chat platform and
our our event management system
relatively easily GG so the so-called
bot is actually a team of about five to
ten people there are mostly engineers
and designers and this was a deliberate
choice I purposely forced the tech staff
on to the GG duty instead of the
conference staff or a customer support
staff for two reasons one this is a
brand new process and tech people will
be able to identify problems more
readily because they know the tools
really well and we didn't really get it
right the first time empathy by virtue
of living through the process failure
really kind of teach the team to be able
to identify problems but also in
secondly they can collect meaningful
data points so that they can optimize
the opportunities later on now the
surprising aspect of this point though
is that it turns out because we staff
Gigi with humans we are able to inject
what we like to call the surprise and
delight factor in ways that the smartest
bot probably won't be able to do right
out the gate and this one is my favorite
and this is an article from LinkedIn
they picked it up so one night an
attendee wrote about like 2am it's not
really a request it's more like a
confession he says I was drunk hungry
and at 1am I ate a club sandwich and a
chocolate cake so ashamed so to us this
is equally an important moment as the
moment we resolve things like your
agenda problems or your schedule because
it's a human moment that's yearning for
a human response and to his delight you
know he got a pretty satisfying answer
from Gigi and we learned a bit of a
lesson there stepping back towards the
larger picture a bit the business model
for this project is tied two to two
factors one is our operational cost how
much does it cost to actually run a
service like this and also the quality
of the service in return
because we went in with an eye towards
measuring practically everything we
found out in a quantifiable way what is
the throughput of things like staff /
question answered average converts a
conversation length heat maps of busy
times when people are asking a lot of
stuff how many people talk to Gigi and
so on and so forth this is pretty
important because what it allows for us
to do is to really quantifiably figure
out how to optimize TG operations in the
future and figure out you know maybe if
we are going to introduce things like
automations or bought what are some of
the areas in which we want to actually
use utilize bots for and what are some
of the areas in which we want to
continue to use humans for and what
where that lands here is that in order
to retain the delight that's so crucial
to gigi is is a character within a tech
ecosystem I can't necessarily take the
next step by virtue of building about
the replace Gigi but what I can do is to
look at how to optimize the people who
are behind Gigi using bots in a way that
can do things like reduce the conversion
times in the messaging wins response
time for example or finding ways for the
FAQ or the knowledge base of what's
going on around the conference base to
on the one hand be easily accessible for
the people who are GG on the other hand
be something that can be grown over time
by the conference staff and so on so
forth so I think after just being here
for the just prep the past day or so I
think what we're probably going to do is
use slack bots for it so when we come
back in October for set woman there will
probably be a couple slack BOTS so we're
going to be building to help the GD
operations out so I'll be pretty
interesting to see how that pans out um
so now the takeaway is maybe that may be
applicable to you guys as you're
thinking about designing bots is that
you don't necessarily always have to
start with coding like you know complex
AI or anything like that we didn't
and sometimes starting with really
simple solutions can reveal really
interesting patterns and opportunities
and you know ultimately if GG becomes a
bot later on that's really great but as
of now I'm just taking small incremental
steps and using human knowledge to
really kind of hone in and learn what
what is the best approach to really
convert GD into something that's
automated and scalable but also retain
her character that's it thank you hi yes
you
you
oh how do I consider enhancing humans
capability how do I measure that I would
say that I would measure that by two
folds right i mean we have a survey that
that we sent out towards the end of the
conference and we talked about whether
or not GG was helpful in any way shape
or form its quantifiable and you can
write in as well so that's kind of like
our metrics for measuring the quality of
GG as a service in order to enhance that
the the humans ability we know what we
found out was that not everybody knew
everything about everything that was
going on at the conference and so if
there was a slack bought that you could
type and get information like where's
the afterparty at you as the person
who's working as GG could then find out
that information and be able to kind of
tailor that particular response much
faster so the time for a time to
response would be reduced and that would
be the quantifiable metrics but also
accuracy of some of the answers that
goes back so that would be I would
measure that now ultimately this is like
on a mid step right you can invent
envision like maybe at some point once
GG has an ability to obtain like
personality and character and stuff like
that that human element could
potentially go away think we're good all
right thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
