BOTS actually was on the killer use
cases of bots not really apps as an old
anyway um so we've kind of went around
we went around and we discussed and
argued about things that were not killer
apps and everybody basically proposed
something that they were doing that
someone else would like shoot it down
and say that's not a killer app I
wouldn't use the bought for that so that
was sort of part of the conversation um
I think when we we then also made a
distinction between sort of bots for fun
boss for fun entertainment to those kind
of things and then boss for function
where you want to get something done and
are these bots in tempting to kind of be
faster better cheaper basically some
good increment on what we have today or
are they kind of 0 to 1 doing something
that you couldn't do will be very hard
to do without thoughts and now you can
do without with bots we're trying to
make distinctions around that and I
think we came up with well one one thing
I think we talked about in the end was
that customer success customer service
was probably a very strong entry point
now for for BOTS basically I've made a
prediction elsewhere that all brands
within five years are going to have
their own bot and in fact people have
many different depending on function so
I think that's really a very interesting
on ramp and users are going to expect to
get through basically to talk to start
with bots and then ultimately get
through humans an interesting issue that
came up is that if you make it too easy
to get to people then there's you know
everybody wants to just click right away
and get to that person and then you get
the overload that we've had which is
what drove these hierarchical phone
trees and sending users away so I think
there's a attention there in terms of
the economics um but that was one
category there were people in the group
who had onyx have a little a little star
trek communicator which opens up the
power of a voice-based group chat to
everyone who joins into this thing and
has the devices and then you can have
BOTS basically listening they made a
whole bunch of bots listing in context
and then triggering um I think another
category of things we talked about was
interesting is basically not typical I
asked the bot for this and get back some
response but basically proactive BOTS
you know bots that are pervasive bots
that are doing things passively in the
background
so you know examples are the things
watching for when when there's a
discount on your Amazon product you just
bought and then they'll go and
automatically file for a refund or
things which are basically knowing
when's the right time to buy this flight
and they're just watching it happens or
I want this kind of department and it's
watching and proactively for you so
thinking outside the bot box not
something that we're always necessarily
having a 1121 dialogue but where we set
something and then the right actions
happen and then it can take action not
just learning us but possibly go through
the context that was the form of things
that people would think it would be
really killer for them but I'll say we
were actually short of just like this
wide variety of amazing killer apps and
maybe that's because we only had sort of
eight or nine people in the group but
there was a lot of rumors ideas and
excitement what BOTS could do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
