hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading

academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
he has been an intern twice and has
worked in between that and he now is
still hanging on and helping us out with
a lot of tasks on code hunt and in
particular his main thing has always
been what he calls the hint system but
he has a vast knowledge of what goes on
as well so we can fire all sorts of
questions at him where you go Daniel
yeah so I'm going to be talking about
the hint system which is currently in
code hunt which is not fully operational
at the moment but was in the past so
code hunt uh well okay we already know
what code hunt looks like I go to a
level send code gives you some feedback
which is already is sort of hint that
it's telling you okay some pads are
collectors here's some values here's
some things that are in collect here's
some values which is something that
would probably know would be considered
a hint in another why and if you were
doing like homework or something and
changes in different ways um so I'm
something wrong with the lights okay um
so for more complicated puzzles you
probably aren't going to be able to look
at these numbers and immediately figure
out what this is actually computing for
the very first puzzle you can just
glance at it and it's pretty obvious but
here we want to be able to give some
additional feedback about just something
who knows you in the right direction
when you're totally lost and do
something like say oh one of the
expected results was forty thousand
three hundred and twenty oh I should try
turning that and see what
this is close to the solution the answer
is that no there's nothing to do with a
solution it's completely misleading but
there's other things we might be able to
tell the person like the solution
involves a loop you should probably stop
letting stuff that doesn't contain a
loop this probably should have been a
giveaway that this problem is in Sector
3 which is titled loops but maybe you
need an additional hint this hint also
don't know about the sector names but
also we can sometimes be more precise
and say oh this line is where your plow
home is change just that line blessed if
it's okay which is a one way of saying
that you're close to a solution this is
a sort of as we had been discussing the
last talked this is syntactic way of
saying the ER close to a solution which
is very different from the sort of more
semantic way we were talking about
earlier and the other thing is this is
the other version of the scent is maybe
you want to less than or equal to in
this puzzle H dot and putting in the
less than or equal to I know line for a
Sox puzzle i'm giving away a solution
now so it presented these a few
different types of hints that the system
can produce they look at line forward
capture the code which i call line hints
and then those positive recommendation
hints which means try some construct in
this case you may find a loop useful on
this level and lastly negative
recommendation hints of the expression
forty thousand three hundred twenty
years will we used to solve this level
probably try something different so I'm
going to talk about how I generate all
of these and unfortunately I oh and a
little bit of data on how useful they
are so
first the line hints of my primary
research is on program synthesis and the
line hints of work by applying my
photosynthesis research to to coat hunt
we have the solution as an oracle of
what the actual bhushan is and we want
to start from the Student Code as the
basis for what was synthesizing from and
try to mutate it so that it is a
solution in some sense sort of the
programmatic version of what the student
is doing except we're only guided by the
test cases from PACs and not by any
amount of insight the student might have
which it's the life of them since this
technique is not attempting to be AI and
into it the solution anyway there's an
important point that this is only a
meaningful thing to do when we're
actually syntactically close to a
solution because if I tell you that your
10 line program you should probably
change lines one through ten you're
gonna say okay that tells me nothing and
it's a little discouraging it's not a
useful hint in that case you'd have to
find some other way to notice this year
in towards a solution of course if they
are completely way off then that's also
probably a son you want to give them a
hint so question is there actually a
usefulness of this that if the users
almost got it they then they already
know what's going on like they probably
don't need a hint so I did want an
experiment which I'll show more debt I
later but here I the students that
actually saw him down a puzzle so we're
figuring out my measure of whether the
close to a solution is whether or not we
were able to actually
I generate a hint and we can either show
them the hint or not show them the hint
we say that eventually people usually
solve the puzzle if they got close
enough that I was able to generate a
hint but if there was shown the hint the
salford a lot faster I mean so this is
showing that they found the hint helpful
and for the pedagogical standpoint it's
still not obvious that this is that the
hints are helping them alone but it's
hard to get that information as the data
but this is showing that at least that
just because the student is close they
might not necessarily lies they're close
ok this mean that whatever hint was
given all these 83% people use that hint
or did they do something else um I did
not actually check that in this data
mostly because getting these numbers is
very simple and figuring out whether
they actually use the hint is much more
difficult did you have a question of it
ok so yeah they might have solved it a
completely different way there's also
the point that sorry yes if you're very
close to a solution the in general
actually often generates four or five
different small changes it will choose
it chooses the one that's smallest but
it's still the fact that it might the
one it gave might be one small change it
might be a one character change and
there might be a two character change in
our different line in which case it's
not like meaningful to say did the
student use the hint or not sorry
no deals were based on the problem
because this problem seems to be really
easy like I'd a sense all this
ninety-eight percent of the people who
got close enough that my synthesizer was
able to find a single line change try
this man is so easy and difficult
problems I did not distinguish which
problems look at but that would be
interesting to see us putting it out by
problem change this and change this
received or such a tease yeah yeah so I
think I sort of mixed them together
because this was a moderately small data
set so separating by problem would have
given me till a few attempts but yeah if
I had enough data than that would be an
interesting thing to look at see if that
he has once again the hints are probably
more useful and harder platforms just
don't know you were getting at yeah so
what is this magic so complicated
diagram time so this is the flowchart
version of what code hunt walks like
there's a cycle where tax generates test
cases user modifies the program they ask
they've asked if they uh no not that
either attacks give some new test cases
or and they look or they won the level
and they're done ah we change a few
boxes on this diagram then we have
something that looks like the flowchart
for my synthesizer where the synthesizer
is designed to work on some iterative
process where it handles one new test
cases it handles one new test case at a
time modifying the program and iterating
on that
so basically what I design the
synthesizer one of the things we did
that did with it is sort of like just
for silly landon thing to try to learn
it on we landed on text for fun and
using some somewhat contrived metrics we
showed that on some undies up so that
opposes we used it was able to complete
the puzzles and approximately the same
time as the students on text for fun
well this is a sort of quality wine with
the bottom is how long it took the
average student so puzzle and the y-axis
how long it took the size of the puzzle
hand-wavy hand wavy hand wavy like a
actually about as good at students at
solving these simple coding problems
maybe we can give them hints on them so
yeah I had that tried Foley said um so
particularly in order to generate the
hints we mind the all these solutions
from the students including the Laughlin
solution for what functions and
operators etc that it actually uses and
the synthesizer uses that set of
functions for what for what is trying to
light into the program and so and then
as to where to modify the program it
just Numa late every sub expression of
the program and new malades every new
expression it can build out of the
pieces of the program and the pieces of
all the other solutions and it does some
intelligent things we're numerator them
but that's the essential that's
essentially what the algorithm is so if
we had this example that I had shown
before then it's just going to go have
all of the operators like less than or
equal to and thought and probably some
other things that will use in all the
solutions
it will go through every sub expression
and considerably placing it with a bunch
of different things until it hits upon
something that passes all the test cases
yeah I said we okay yeah we do try to I
build expressions out of what the user
is already using but we also try to
supplement that in case there's some
expressions that they needed out of some
other solutions tricky like I guess
before there was the example where in
the previous track someone had written X
minus y when the solution was X plus y
they the plus has to come from somewhere
so okay so there's a few as I'd
mentioned before this it's going to come
up with multiple solutions here there's
a few different solutions that all have
sort of an ast difference of replacing
one ast node with another ast node we
can put in we can multiply by basically
we want to multiply by upper bound but
there's a few different ways to put to
do it we could do it there we could do
it there we could you change that there
and to computer these at first glance
looking at trees these all look like
basically the same amount of difference
change but to a human this probably
looks like a much smaller change because
you only changed one character so I
actually filter that I get multiple
solutions out of the algorithm and take
the one with the lowest number edit loss
at a distance just by characters um yeah
this slows down the algorithm a little
bit but it's not a big deal so sort of
larger problem is that especially if
we're looking at the attempts but
balanced by the number
of attempts in the APCs universe the
first sector to basically everything is
one line so if I tell you that the
single line your program has a problem
then I have given you absolutely no
information you already knew that so
this sense obviously with the
synthesizers actually generating is a
death of some subtree if your program we
can try to pass this and give that as a
bit more information but there's the
balance of between simply giving away
the solution and giving a hint said as I
common hue one way is you could the user
could add newlines to add a little more
detail what we actually do is give hints
like this say oh look at numbers online
for to try to say oh this is what you
should we place to give a focus more
precise in the line when there's only
one line to talk about yeah so that ends
what I had to say about how the line
hints work there were any questions on
that section so the other type of him
sigh have which is a more or less
completely separate hint system which is
almost entirely unrelated other than
sharing some of the parsing code is the
recommendation hint as I said before you
have both positive and negative
recommendation hints of you should add
something or you are using something
which is a terrible idea don't do it we
generally these hints via a relatively
simple mechanism of just looking at
every single attempt and summarizing
what structures were used in each one
and then doing some statistics on how
common the structure soil solutions
versus not non
tuitions for the second one how to
interpret this hint is like is rarely
used in your prey or cold or is rarely
used among all the players to solve this
level what does that mean so I was
trying to have the wording was trying to
avoid saying oh this is don't do it and
this can't work because it's possible
that there are solutions that use it and
just trying it's just trying to suggest
that this probably shouldn't be done I
mean as to the semantics of how it
actually decides to generate that hint
it books for expressions that are used
that are used by enough users to be
statistically significant but are not
used by those users and those solutions
um so that's what it that's what this is
actually mean I'm not sure if I actually
answered your question yeah so sorry
here the concepts they can offer my
boobs branches um so I walked down a
list of like 15 like 10 or 15 concepts
like loops if statements and stuff like
that and then any expression is also a
available concept a like that's how it
came up with 40,000 320 that's not hard
coded that's just it's an expression um
is there a defined rice yeah so I just
predefined a few of them that I thought
of they were fairly arbitrary and maybe
there was better one this is so do
concepts correspond to the control for
the necessary um I
the syntactic so I think I i think i
might have included week ocean as a
concept a those nested loops is one of
them so there's a few things that are
not just is this a syntax item in your
program but the approximately that level
of complexity i sort of wasn't really
sure what else to put in there and if
other ideas are welcome i can find a
list somewhere in the source code this
is not documented um so yeah so the
algorithm is we count users using a
solution we can't I users who use it but
not in a solution and I we prefer
telling people to not use things that
that they are using then to use things
than they're not using because based on
the general concept that saying you
should use this thing that you haven't
thought of is sort of giving more hit a
stronger hint to someone Diaz that
something like here's that's introducing
a new concept to the awareness as
opposed to saying this thing you know
what you're doing right now is a bad
idea which is not which is sort of
giving less awaited so that I feel that
was sort of my intuition once again this
is hand wavy and has no actual data
behind it um so other opinions are
welcome so they're doing to try to get
some idea of how useful these hints are
I was wasted when evaluation which I had
preconditions for some of the users we
just always showed them hint some of the
users
we switched off which puzzles will show
them hints and for some of the users we
never showed them hence so such as I
compare and I forgot to shave that I'm
so down to date I'm here yet after the
user so here we have three different
lines try showing how many levels a user
one where the blue line is the people in
the OS and condition the gleaner lies
the people in the sometimes st.
condition and the lead line is people in
the neva hint condition well the line
being at a given point means that that
proportion of users got blue at least
that many levels so you can see that the
neva hint line is lower than the other
two lines by a little bit so they didn't
continue playing as long so they were at
least somewhat less engaged in the game
and the other two about equal and this
metric the I'm not sure how much we can
actually get out of this so what more
interesting is how long leah players
played this is also a clue motive graph
of showing what proportion a number of
players played for least some number of
hours well number of hours played just
defined by time of last puzzle
submission minus time of first puzzle
submission I assume they didn't play for
48 hours straight but I didn't actually
check for that in my data this
interestingly shows that the people in
the sometimes hint condition played
notably more than the people
in the always hint to also who also
played more than people in the other
hint so seems to show that the hints do
in fact make the game somewhat more
engaging that we have a difference of a
third of the people at the sometimes hit
condition were still playing after two
days as opposed to a tenth of the people
in the neighborhood condition since we
had been talking about did I distance
from the distance from the solution
related to what hints we can give this
is in attempt to try to measure how well
my hint system can give hints for a
given distance from from the solution
this is a very love syntactic measure of
distance of solution and that I have
nearly done syntactic edit distance to
the newest I known solution of a
syntactic I mean actual kyosho by
character vancien edited distance and
bucketed the numbers the post two colors
are the center of the line hint the
first blue color is the line hints with
the answer was it was a single line so
the I precise so it had to say like
numbers on that line or something like
that the next color was work could
actually specify a line the yellow
section is hints what said some concept
or expression was unhelpful and should
not be used the blue section is where it
recommended some new concept and the
section is where it wasn't able to
produce a hint at all I'm not sure how
informative this graph actually is I
just threw it together this morning um
so uh yeah I yes yes yes so you're your
largest far audience you regard as
unhelpful um so no the it's not that I
think the hint is unhelpful the hint is
telling the user that something they're
doing is unhelpful and that's this the
it's the hint style of this expression
is unhelpful don't use it possibly
poorly labeled in my back and I'm not
sure if this is a more informative way
but here's the stacked bar graph version
of this so we can all hit the proportion
ignoring the ignoring the amount of each
to sort of like basically the point of
trying to look at this as trying to
argue that I expect so in this line to
go down because if I'm generating the
generating the line hints by syntactic
similarity then I expect a syntactic
similarity decreases that I'm going to
be less able to generate those hips
which is possibly verified by this graph
not sure we also see that as the
solutions are way often the system is
less able to produce anything meaningful
at all that's the purple sections are
getting larger at the top which ones I'm
assuming that just because those little
enough data that
it's not meaningful that it's just L but
I I will have to look into it as this
graph was made this morning so I haven't
delved into this data that much and that
was actually the end of my presentation
so which was learning a bit short if you
have any questions or wanted to delve
deeper into anything then kind of
related to what really and talked about
in terms of problem on progress
indicator or behavior similarities
measurement I mean hint generation is
another very important harbin based on
experience working on the previous
problem our progress indicator one
barrier for us to really make research
progress is on the ground truth so I
think here we would have similar orbits
so I think that son of this scrub our
kind of a somewhat indirect measurement
on the quality of the hints yeah all
could say it the rep but just like I
mean and I'm thinking about where the
their copies and dedicated efforts more
like building up Gwangju for example as
a human achievement right if we want to
help students or he'll prayers in really
trying to make progress what kind of him
would will begin right and then when you
have this data then you can call for
more different kind of variety of
solutions so for that type of ground
hint I believe I've repose co.org that
was soliciting that type of hint it was
one of the one of those warning websites
was asking educators to say Oh in this
situation light down they were crowd
sourcing they were doing basically hint
generation by crowdsourcing and trying
to seem simpler I mean be downhill I
mean because he is a live it we both the
engineering especially talk about i mean
the the codeine dues I mean without
expression requirements right
it's different one like you have a
particular expression requirement given
to student and then the students
struggle couldn't get it done and then
you give guidance it's different kind of
guidance I would say yeah I mean we also
have had sort of floated the idea of uh
I mean I sort of call these personalized
hints because the based on what the
student is actually wishing as though
code through in a fairly strong sense
the line hints are more personalized
than the lack of an Asian hints but he
could imagine being less personalized of
oh here's just a general hint that
anyone on this level might want to see
if they were struggling and you could
imagine cloud you could imagine quads
hosting those of course on that level
the internet sort of does that
automatically by people writing blog
posts about or having comment threads
which you'll find a few Google questions
about coat hunt but yeah I I guess I
haven't thought too hard about what the
ground truth of what the best possible
hint would be partially because I'm not
an educator sorry will you Tom were you
asking you have a question no
yes yes it was maybe just completion
I'll afternoon not necessary I mean
basically the data would HIGHLY I mean
center around the hints being generated
by some i generate another different
kind of hints the data couldn't tell me
whether my hints are actually taking
good effect right or even better than
the hints that the Daniels features
would generate right so that's what I'm
talking about of course there's no
single grand choice but at least we have
some kind of like somewhat reasonable
set of this useful but very hard time
I'm only thinking about hint as that I
can get a machine to generate to
probably work very different than hints
that I can get a human to generate and
there's a fairly reasonable assumption
that the hints that we can get a human
to generate up how are we going to be
better more like grand challenger I mean
like that it's a gwan choose and the
human could do like this how far can we
get yo sir right i mean i think that's
the kind of thing you had community
bewteen different people jump in with
their contribution of the solutions
right so but it's a very literal way to
think about the papal yeah and the in
the Jewish arisen difference between the
line based things and the other ones is
such um no I did not uh partially
because I guess sort of as you can see
on this chart the line based hints are
often not available so I was sort of
worried about having that as an option
in the experiment because I was worried
about people just never seeing them were
lambasting 49
with the pollution um so I mean this is
about the line based hints show it can
be generated about about twenty to
thirty percent of attempts there are not
solutions this is proportion of attempts
are not solutions obviously the attempt
is a solution then the responses you one
and the other hints can be and some hint
at all that is I guess can be generated
in about seventy to eighty percent the
solution so basically another forty
percent fourteen fifty percent and the
line hit the system prefers giving a
line hint if it can so so that it says I
have interval but you have to actually
click it to see it um we did when we
consider that you I but it was vetoed as
just being too on OS I think that was
actually the original you I I lodge and
it was just like this just seems
obnoxious no one's ever going to always
get it sometimes in one yes yes this
team this seems like a very reasonable
assumption and trying to work that into
the you I would is probably something
worth considering that it is known that
in educational games giving people hints
constantly is not the right choice but
you need to have a new I word actually
works for coding do basically you have
like two phases are discovering the
functionality or requirements and the
second one is implemented correctly the
functionalities yes Michael feeling said
for the hints that you are generating
they are more for the second phase is
that hypotheses um I would say that is
definitely true of the line hints okay
I'm not convinced that's true of the
recommendation hints especially in
things like as Judith had shown in her
presentation division is hard because
individual division put can create
patterns that don't look like anything
you expect
I mean your reverse engineering so if
you get a hint saying you know you
should consider a division operator
you'll be like oh da why didn't I think
of that I don't know if the people one
coat hunt contests have anything to say
on that oh you didn't have any trouble
division a fight with a puzzles that
wouldn't be the content on diesel we
wouldn't be here if they're all right
sorry um someone else ever
okay well thank you very much Daniel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
