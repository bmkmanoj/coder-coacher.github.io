hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
our next speaker is to buy space now
from the University of work will be
talking about quantifying economic
behavior with big data thank you good
morning everybody it's a pleasure to be
to be here in Cambridge thank you very
much for inviting me I'm going to talk
about a recent research entitled
quantifying economic behavior using big
data and if I talk about big data and
then one yeah main source of information
is all collected by the information we
produced by interacting with technology
like our smartphones like like notebooks
in the audience and this produces huge
piles of of information and one part of
this information is shown in the
background here so that's a map of
photos taken and then uploaded to Flickr
in 2012 so nothing else is shown in the
background so you can clearly see the
continents and that's one form of
internet data which opens up up for us
the possibility to develop new and
adaptive models of human behavior and if
I talk about human behavior then I
mainly mean decision so decisions we tag
and in the in the real world so the
decision to to buy or sell a certain
stocks or maybe Microsoft and how we
actually reach this decision and maybe
how we can also track this from from a
scientist point of view traditionally
these decisions are a record at the
exchange place so when all these
exchanges became electronic marketplaces
and in the 90s and early
is then we had the possibility the
opportunity to study huge amount of
information financial transaction locks
when he decided to buy microsoft stock
so then the order went to the exchange
place got executed there and then was
one data point in the huge database
maybe at ny's e or some other places
around the world and this is then also
one very early form of a big data and
information we can study in order to
understand human behavior in particular
economic behavior so that's one part of
big data we study but we try to
complement this information by looking
at huge records of internet data
collected by the fact that our everyday
life is impossible to organize or yeah
to organize worries aspect of our life
so whether we would like to go to a
restaurant we look up so it maps online
or whether we would like to look up the
maybe manual of this restaurant before
so there are various types of
information requests and surges we sent
every day and one search engine which
actually records this information is
Google and this was the first internet
data set we actually looked at and we
got involved in this kind of research in
2010 when we analyzed information
provided by Google by the tool google
trends and this is just an example from
a publication published in in that year
in the philosophical transactions of the
royal society you see three curves for
the different terms subprime lehman
brothers and financial crisis on a
weekly basis so that's the that's a
granularity of this data set the google
trends offering this honor on a week by
week basis of very frequent terms you
even get a
daily information but the majority of
keyboard comes on a weekly basis weekly
updates and it's dark in 2004 so what
you can see is that very surprisingly
are not very surprisingly in the third
week of sep tember 2008 many people got
interested in the term limit others
which at that time cost a huge financial
shock wave when they filed for chapter
11 protection in the United States on in
this week and yeah at the same time the
financial markets over in a quite
stressed state based on this information
we looked at the question whether we can
use surges on company names in order to
say something about financial
fluctuations and in this early paper we
discovered a correlation between how
often people Google for company names
like Apple and how many stocks of this
company are exchanged in the same week
so this one is now casting for incidents
in the same week we have an increase in
search volume and we find that in the
same week it's more likely that more
stocks of for example apples or AAPL as
the ticker symbol of Apple I exchanged
an icy and that's a pattern we find for
an average for all 500 components of the
S&amp;amp;P 500 and this was for us to the
starting point to dig into this data set
and the question to which extent these
online resources can tell us something
about financial behavior the obvious
question you might ask now is okay
there's a there's a link there's a
connection between how often people
Google for company names and how many
stocks are exchanged so is there
something we can maybe tell about the
price fluctuations and this was the
question we started to ask roughly two
years ago or even earlier and in order
to
lourdes questions we constructed a very
simple strategy based on search volume
so if we are looking at the number of
Google searches for a given keyword and
this is yeah this happens in weak tea
and if the search volume is lower than
the average over the latter the past
week so in this case the past three
weeks before then actually we buy one
financial asset and in this case we
apply this to an index and the index is
a very commonly known index it's the Dow
Jones Industrial Average if you buy the
index in the coming week so this means
we are opening a long position buying
the index at the first trading day of
the coming week and close the position
one week later that's so it's the first
part of the strategy and vice versa if
there are more people interested in the
keyword in question and I will tell you
in a minute which keywords we looked at
then we take the opposite action so on
increases in search volume we sell the
index in the coming week meaning we are
opening a short position at the first
trading day of the coming week and we
keep this position for exactly one week
so if we do this and we do this on an
ongoing basis from the start of the
database in 2004 on a weekly basis and
you see in blue what what happens or
what would have happened if you applied
this this strategy and apply it based on
a term and the term is culture so we
looked at the fact how often people have
good week for culture week by week if
there were more searches for culture we
sold the market if there were less
surges for culture then we bought the
market if you do this then you end up in
this scenario with the return of roughly
five
% and that's not really that much in
particular if you compared to a
benchmark strategy and the benchmark
strategy in this case is just buying the
index in the very beginning beginning of
2004 and holding the position until the
end of the period we look at
buy-and-hold return is sixteen percent
so then you have just two numbers and
you know okay buy-and-hold is little bit
more than then the google based strategy
so that was another maybe not really
meaningful in order to evaluate the
situation what you're really really
looking at and for this reason you also
see 2 dashed lines here and the dashed
lines visualize the plus minus one
standard deviation of completely
randomly investing so this means every
week just randomly you buy or sell and
you do this in 10,000 different
portfolios then you have a distribution
of returns and every given week meaning
that you can calculate the mean value at
the plus minus one standard deviation at
every week in this time period so that's
a term culture and probably one one
possible conclusion of this light could
be that culture has not really that much
to do with stock markets so let me show
you a different example what would have
happened if we have you would if we
would have used the term debt instead so
now we know we had the financial debt
crisis in recent years and if we have
would have used the input on how often
people have googled for the term debt on
a weekly basis and we would actually
have outperformed the market and reached
three hundred and twenty six percent
return in the same period so compared
again to sixteen percent buy-and-hold so
that's something we published this year
in scientific reports and that's open
access it's freely available we gave a
number of interviews afterwards the
three hundred and twenty six percent
were quite exciting for many many people
including also the Financial Times which
Rick reported this is finding on on its
cover some some weeks ago but it's not
only about one keyword it's not about
about three hundred and twenty six
percent so we looked as a number of
keywords so that's a set here showing 98
keywords and these keywords were generic
keywords rather than company names what
I have explained before and here you can
clearly see that the term like debt
turns up very prominently so this was
actually the best keyword in this set of
keywords now at a different scale so
this is normalized by the standard
deviations of random strategy returns so
meaning that that results in 2.3 times
sorry 2.31 times more than one standard
deviation of random investment so you
see that they are financially related
terms or stock portfolio inflation
housing dow jones and many others you're
also real realized very quickly that
terms like like color something is
something which which turns up very
prominently and so it's not really clear
how to evaluate the situation but there
might be a certain bias towards
financially related keywords in this in
this top part of this ranking that's
shown here on the left for the entire
time period 2004 until the end so that's
februari 2011 and on the right hand side
here qualitatively similar results if
you just use subset of this time period
the main question we asked then was can
we actually find a way in order to
quantify what the factors or what but
what's the quantity which makes a
keyword successful and in order to do
this we used our instinct that more
financially related terms might be might
be the key issue and so the question the
next question was can we actually
quantify how
financially relevant one terminus and in
order to do this we created something
like a financial relevance index by
counting how often a word like like that
color or others are used in the issues
of the Financial Times which is one
major outlet for financially related
news and normalized this by the fact how
often these terms are used in general
literature and general literature's 11
proxy we used in this case was how many
hits Google finds if we are asking for
this term on on Google by building this
ratio we found a very sick very strong
and significant correlation with return
in this ranking here showing that indeed
financially related terms tend to
perform better than other keywords now
you can extend this approach you can ask
okay what what Google or Google users
and their behavior maybe however this
may be relates to the trading of stocks
so I explained you that we use the
strategy that we sell an increase and by
on decrease so this was just an
hypothesis so we didn't know in advance
that this is actually the key but it was
guided by the idea that information
gathering is actually time consuming and
you might invest more time in order to
make it more difficult decision rather
than making an easier decision and
that's backed by my concepts and
behavioral signs that link to to loss
aversion that you're more afraid about
losing 55 pounds then actually missing
the the opportunity to gain five pounds
and we then directly compared these
strategies for a well-defined set of
keywords and these keywords set who has
the Dow Jones Industrial Average here's
one example shown that's until
and the top panel shows the result of
the original strategy so an increase in
searches for the term int'l we sold
int'l stocks in the coming week so again
frustrating day of the coming week and
holding the position for one week and
this results in five hundred and
forty-nine percent which is also just
one example so not really i'm telling
you much and obviously if one strategy
is positive and you are reversing this
strategy so on an increase in search
volume for int'l then you buy stocks in
the in the second scenario then
obviously you have to lose money and so
given that this is not symmetric due to
the logarithm of the return you end up
with minus eighty-five percent that's
one example if you look at a complete
set of 30 stocks forming the Dow Jones
Industrial Average then you see that the
mean value of all these returns is
significantly positive in the left's and
REO supporting the idea that information
gathering and taking the time for
looking for um on the right hand side
obviously if you have one one positive
mean return for one set of of this
strategy and you're using the reverse
strategy then then this has to be
negative so this is the information we
used based on the fact that Google
searches capture human information
gathering behavior but that's not the
only part of of information or
information resource we can use in order
to look at financial fluctuations so we
moved then to the question whether may
be other resources capturing similar
behavior shows similar patterns and one
major part of information as Wikipedia
which provides also the
information on our article usage and
compared to to Google where we had only
access to a very limited number of times
because Google is restricting the
download bandwidth of the number of
downloads per day per hour and then also
per IP we have the advantage by looking
at Wikipedia that we can download the
entire database so this means we can
look at the entire wikipedia corpus but
also at the entire usage data base for
these articles and if we run exactly the
same analysis so using the information
whether people have visited Wikipedia
articles and if this number increased
for a given article then actually we
sold the underlying asset and again here
in order to make this comparable we use
the Dow Jones Industrial Average if
there are less people interested or less
people viewed a Wikipedia article then
we bought the Dow Jones Industrial
Average the blue distribution here shows
something similar as the rankings which
have shown before so this is the
distribution based on category which is
defined by wikipedia itself so it's the
category on financial topics which
roughly compact con contains 285
financially relevant articles and the
distribution depicts the outcome and
also the mean of course what would have
happened if we have we would have traded
based on the fact how often people have
viewed have accessed this 285 articles
so they mean is significantly positive
that's a very exciting fact and in
particular if you're compared to the
random strategy distribution which is
shown in grey in the background
wikipedia gives you not only the
information on how often these articles
have been viewed so you can also
construct time serious based on the
information on how often this article
have been changed over time so that's
something we call the edits Wikipedia
edit and so this is something which is
not significant so not distinguish
distinguishable from from zero the mean
value but this might be interoperable in
two ways so maybe there's not really
that much information in Wikipedia edits
or the second possibility is that just a
number of edits is not that that high
compared to the number of use that we
can really see a meaningful signal his
in this historic analysis so now I have
shown you many examples where we can
actually say something about subsequent
stock market moves at least historically
so let me maybe show you a counter
example and a counter example is for
example if we look at another very
unrelated category on Wikipedia and
that's the category for actors and
filmmakers so the nice thing about
actors and filmmakers category is that
they have a similar number of articles
combined in this list a little bit less
than 300 and this shows that in this
case we are more or less obtaining
random behavior as well as overlapping
with the random distribution random
strategy distribution in the background
so this was the starting point
supporting our original findings in the
Google case but then we went further so
we had the possibility to look at the
entire database and so we build we build
our our own category so thanks to our
students in particular Chester curve
with the first author of this paper we
used lda in order to get up to 100
categories from the entire wikipedia em
coppers and then looked at search volume
generated on google for this article
titles which fall into these categories
so for each of these roles we collected
search volume of roughly 30 different
articles showing that many of them
actually
consistent with random behavior so
they're mean value is not significantly
different from from random behavior only
three categories showed significant
behavior taking into account that we
actually multiple performing multiple
tests here so these three categories
were categories on United States
politics finance which confirms our
previous finding but also politics and
we didn't label these categories based
on this 30 entries by ourselves so we
went actually to Amazon em turki &amp;amp; M
Turkish actually labeled these
categories so it's a quite surprising
fact as these three topics historically
have had the impact or the viewing
behavior so the historic behavior on how
often people have looked for for these
terms have hadn't had impact on on
subsequent stock market behavior let me
go back to to Google and an example
where we didn't look at search volume in
for example in the u.s. in order to link
this to the Dow Jones or to global
search volume we wanted to make make use
of the huge variety and the possibility
to look at all these different countries
and Google is operating in more than two
hundred and forty countries and we asked
the question how we can actually make
use of this information in order to
quantify something like future
orientation of inhabitants in in the
country and if we go back to to our
Google example where we use company
names or use general keywords then you
always have the problem that if you do
this cross-country and you would need to
translate all these different cube roots
and one very simple idea to overcome
this language silo structure was to look
or to identify first to identify
universally used keyboard
and in order to to do this my co-authors
in particular Susie mode now also at
Warwick came up with the idea to look at
Arabic numerals so yes numbers in
particular we are which are kind of of
universally shared in all languages and
this is one example so that's actually
the global example you see the pattern
that in January they are still a certain
volume in 2008 for search terms so for
all possible search strings including
the term 2007 past year and vice versa
so in 2008 how often people on a weekly
basis have looked for search terms
including their next year already 2009
so that's something we'll increased over
time so throughout the year and December
there was a huge increase many people
were interested or looking for
information in particular search terms
including the next year's the next
year's number and what you can see here
is that that's a kind of here general
pattern in 2009 you find the same for
2010 and looking back to 2000 then eight
in the year after again that's something
which seems to be over a universal
pattern and not only on a universal
scale not only on a on the react global
scale that's something you also find if
you look at individual countries so if
you would look up the same figure for
the you Cade and this would look similar
and other European countries in the US
and so on and so forth we got interested
in the question whether we can really
quantify and make something out of this
quantification of the ratio so in order
to define a future orientation index we
built the ratio of all surges for the
next year normalized by my searches all
searches for the past year so basically
it's the blue area divided by the red
area and this in every year and if you
do this for all can
trees for which we have data then and
then you have to restrict us to the
countries or if you have reasonable
internet usage so this is restricted to
all countries with more than 5 million
internet users then you'll find a very
striking correlation between the GDP per
capita in these countries and the future
orientation index where one means
there's the same number of surges for
the next year compared to the past year
and by interpreting this you find that
if there are more people in the country
looking towards the future then it's
more likely that this country in
question has a higher GDP per capita so
it's actually a 0.8 correlation if you
use GDP data of the same year and that's
something which was extremely exciting
but on the other hand also yeah opened a
bottle of new questions so what's
actually the underlying behavior driving
this this pattern and when we publish
this this paper lasts last year and
scientific reports together with Susie
mode Jean Stanley from Boston University
and Stephen Bishop from UCL then we also
provided two hypotheses for for this
pattern and hypothesis one is a very
interesting one there might be indeed a
relationship between our behaviors our
tendency to look towards the future and
how yeah economically successful the
country is but also very striking second
hypothesis that this has maybe something
to do about the Internet infrastructure
in the country we live in so in the UK
we have luckily a very good internet
infrastructure and we can organize our
everyday life by using our smartphones
using our mobile devices computers and
so we can look for information in the
future we can book flights to go to the
next conference to work holidays we can
also and that's the important part we
can find information because it is
mation for the future rather than in
other countries where the Internet's
might be only be used as a kind of
historical lookup system and that's the
reason are there is a bias towards the
past yes you mean changes in GDP yeah so
that's something sobei this is the these
are the findings which were published in
this paper April last year so based on
this we are working on several
extensions one extension is obviously to
look at changes in GDP but also to look
at other observables so economic success
is one one dimension but many people
pointed out that also religion is
another aspect which might be my drive
this this phenomenon as in different
cultures there are different attitudes
towards future and past and that's just
one another one other examples there are
many other possibilities the preliminary
finding is that actually the link
between GDP and future orientation index
is the strongest that's what the it's
the version we originally looked at and
all other quantities can connect Li not
not explain that much variance but
that's that's working progress so
another and yeah probably closing case
study brings me back to the to the first
slide hora or flicker map and given this
this is GPS information of all these
photos taken all over the world and in
2012 yeah generated many research
questions how to link this to real-world
behavior how to use this due to the
traces so one very early example
actually ignores the fact that there's
GPS information but we analyzed the
takes the titles and the text bodies of
of messages and in particular try to
link this to a recent natural days
hasta so we looked at the the fact how
often how many photos were were taken
last year between october twenty and
november 20 and got labeled maria's
raised by three different keywords and
the key words were Huracan were sandy
and hurricane sandy and if you activate
this curve over time and the resolutions
actually hourly so hour by hour you you
know how many photos hurricane related
photos were taken and the the very
striking fact is that the maximum of two
the peak of this curve coincides with
the with the hour when hurricane sandy
made landfall in New Jersey last year so
backed by by the fact that if you look
at the atmospheric atmospheric pressure
in the US state New Jersey which
obviously goes down if you have more
more wind speed then you'll find that
there's a very strong correlations of
Pearson correlation of 0.95 in this area
between how many photos were taken and
later uploaded to to Flickr and what
what actually do the atmospheric or
environmental estate in this country was
I have hopefully demonstrated some some
evidence based on our recent research
examples that large technological
systems have become a central part of
our society and that we can actually use
it as a worldwide distributed sensor
network in particular if you're thinking
of this this huge flickr map and this
this tells us something about human
behavior on a scale which was actually
yeah not not possible to reach some some
years ago and we are we worked and we
are working on measuring what's actually
happening in the world
no and in some cases we are might be
able to also tell you something about
the subsequent behavior of complex human
systems thank you very much for your
attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
