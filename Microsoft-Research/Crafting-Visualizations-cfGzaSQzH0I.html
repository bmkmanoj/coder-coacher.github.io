you
alright I think we'll we'll make a start
I'm very pleased to welcome Boris
similar from the university of applied
sciences in Potsdam boris has a really
interesting history in interaction
design and he's also at the center what
seems to be a growing kind of community
of designers focused more more on data
and on data visualization so I think you
can offer some insights around what's
going on over there and earn his own
thoughts about data excellent okay
thanks Richard um well yeah thanks for
the invitation and as richard has
already said I'm Boris from plots dumb
and funny thing is we share actually
kind of a common new history both been
to the other went to the RTA
computer-related design in the 90s and
I'm in Potsdam now for 10 years and were
actually one of the first interface and
interaction design programs in Germany
so we have already kind of a bit of a
history there I just want to talk very
very quickly about the about the cause
of what we're doing and pasta I'm just
kind of to frame the debate of the
presentation here today Potsdam is just
down the road from Berlin actually quite
nice we have lots of castles and stuff
and we actually also have a brand new
building we just had a chat about new
buildings here today how they kind of
discipline the users and suddenly erect
really different to two buildings so
anyway yeah we have new buildings we
have lots of labs where the students can
really build various kinds of design
products big multi-touch lab we also
have which is really interesting on a
full dome full dome lab in collaboration
with the planetarium in Potsdam it's
basically really a planetarium that is
also a digital screen and we we we kind
of configured the system in a way that
you can display any kind of digital
digital content in the dome the cool
thing for us really is we use it a lot
for data visualization and we call this
whole thing kind of immersive data
visualization this is a great example
from
one of our students from mark Tiedemann
he basically visualized his entire
facebook network there in the dome and
he navigated by by basically kind of
pointing his iphone into the dome and so
he can kind of fly through this through
this network but obviously we also do
classic UI stuff we are essentially a
design department so our students really
start off with you know life drawing
color theory and so on but they really
also learn how to design how to craft
software and hardware this is for
example an email client this is a kind
of multi-touch application I'm just
running through it but we also do
slightly weird stuff this is a bit more
coming from the let's say come to the
RCA angle critical design angle this was
a great great thesis project by lino
Toyota Berg digital post materialism and
he was dealing with a whole notion how
do you create physical objects that
they're envisioned kind of that
represent trust and that allow you for
example to to back up your data when
you're traveling through the world and
he's his Swiss so he basically kind of
designed this digital passport that
would allow you to really have little
object in your network and it would
allow you to also to directly access
your the the embassy and get really
secure secure backup of your data so
here's really also very much about kind
of how things look and how you can how
you can kind of establish trust with an
object we also do big exhibitions like
here in Venice in 2008 we did a big
installation at the architecture
biennale the centerpiece will see an
interactive table that visualized
networks between architectural projects
that was done as part of a big new
project which run from 2006 to 2009 we
collaborate also with a couple of
research institutions in Potsdam I don't
know if you're aware of it but Potsdam
is really very much it's also a
university town with big University and
several really big research institutes
especially for climate
for geographical geological sciences and
this was a thesis project in
collaboration with the ghia forums
gentlemen put some the geological
research center and it was all about
visualizing data from the project and
was all about visualizing the the water
consumption in Central Asia the
Institute they have sensors all over
Central Asia and they've done it now for
over 20 years so they have really a huge
set of data which is really really
finely grained two different rivers
different legs and they can really tell
the amount of water that's coming down
the mountain see the amount of water
consumption in different areas and and
this was actually the first attempt to
really visualize it and it was quite
interesting also for us to collaborate
with them because they really a
scientist they're completely different
questions they were concerned about
completely different things and we
directly came up with things like you
know you have to create an app for this
or you have to really visualize it you
have to kind of put it on an iPad you
have to give it to NGOs who are
operating in the area and so on and so
on so it was a really interesting debate
based on these research projects and I
think it's also an interesting role that
design can really play in part of these
big research projects but the main thing
I would like to talk about today is data
visualization data visualization is is
actually really one of the big emerging
fields in design and nothing also
obviously in computer sciences and it
may be many other disciplines what I've
personally find really interesting about
data visualization is that it has this
very very strong aesthetic site you know
it is about image making but it's also
based on algorithms it's based on data
so it's a great intersection between
between design and sciences mmm
obviously we've all done data
visualization up to a certain point
excel is I mean it's pretty simple to do
bar charts or simple graphs in excel or
in any other software package but this
is kind of the
standard data visualization were
confronted with every day another kind
of data visualization were also
confronted with every day is this google
maps Bing Maps here maps whatever and
what I find really interesting about
these maps in quotation marks it's that
there are no longer real maps are really
really data visualizations and I find
actually i'll come back to that later
find it quite intriguing that we take
them really for granted i think one of
the reasons is people know how to handle
maps they know how to read maps so it's
kind of easy to kind of sneak in a layer
of data that would allow people to
really make decisions on better have
breakfast or to really kind of create
new insights about a problem they are
currently working on and this tradition
of maps i think is really the starting
point for all visualizations this is not
the oldest map in the world but one of
the oldest and I like it a lot because
it's still you can still see that it was
useful about 2,500 years ago this is the
map of the south of Italy it's a very
tipsy that's this shoe and you can see
kind of all see this little kind of
notions here of water this is the ocean
and and there are a couple of cities
here etched into the into this little
shard and this is not a great piece of
art but what I really like about it is
again this usefulness somebody did this
in order to explain to somebody else
look we're here yeah and if you want to
go there you should take this direction
and so this is for me also one of the
many starts for for for data
visualization the most famous example of
let's say scientific data visualization
is probably the cholera map by by Jon
Snow these days always get confused a
fish-safe Jon Snow for people think I'm
in the wrong movie here the the cholera
map was really in many ways a starting
point for for empirical data collection
and data visualizations
what happened was that in the 1850s
there was a cholera cholera epidemic
disease in Soho in London and at the
time there are two different kinds of
theories regarding how cholera would
spread the first one was that it was
spreading through air polluted air and
the other one that its first spreading
through polluted water and dr. snow
believed it was actually water who also
creating this disease and what he did
was something very very simple he just
went through soho and he went to every
household and he just kind of wrote down
how many people had died because of the
cholera in the last few days and he just
kind of really literally marked it here
on the map and you could see that he
just made a little dot for every person
who died and you could really see that
there was a very very strong focus here
on Broad Street and what he also did if
you're on the map is he he marked all
the water pumps in Soho was his little X
for example here and you can see that
right in the middle of broad street
there was a little X which also marks a
water pump so what he did was seven he
simply kind of turned off that specific
water pump and he really managed by
doing that to reduce the cholera in Soho
so this is again kind of I think one of
the also many starting points for for
data visualization the interesting thing
is in terms of methodology to go from
here to here is just actually a little
step this is another really famous data
visualization um this is the crime map
by stamens a minister design office in
in San Francisco they're really
specializing on data visualization
especially on map visualizations and
what you can see here are crimes that
happened in Oakland Oakland is in the
bay area on the other side of the of San
Francisco it's a bit of a socially
challenged area and what you can see
here are different kind of types of
crimes and where they actually happen
what I find really interesting about
this example is not only that it has a
high that's a high impact on your life
if you happen to live in Oakland you can
really kind of see what happened last
night here in the area but it really
provides you with an interesting set of
interface elements that allow you to
really drill down the visualization and
try to find patterns or try to ask
really specific questions these
interface elements down here this one
here is really just about a setting of
time frame so you can just see all the
crimes that happened in a week or on a
specific day but you could also fine
tune it and just say just show me crimes
that happened at night or during the day
so I think in terms of the visualization
principles there's not a kind of a huge
jump from here to here but what makes it
really interesting is that the interface
design elements allow you to really ask
or ask questions to the to the
visualization another example and scones
quartet these are four different small
tables of data and they all share the
same statistical properties and this is
just an example that's always brought up
when you talk about data visualization
this is just to show how powerful data
visualization can be because if you take
these four different tables and just
plop them onto an x and y axis you give
30 sorry you get four completely
different patterns and it's sometimes
really difficult to see how the how the
easy that the plot will actually look
like it better or you can't really tell
just based on the numbers what will
happen if you put them on the x and y
axis except maybe here for the 19 and
table number 4 which is clearly also
jumping out here in the visualization
the point I want to make here it's again
it's a very very simple basic algorithm
and it's wildly used for example for get
minder that is also I think one of the
visualization classics the get mind a
project which is run by hans Rosling
arms it's really quite it's quite fools
around for quite a quad
years now basically uses the same
mechanism you just have an axe in the
y-axis and you just plot points but and
here's an interesting thing about
Gapminder they also add more more
dimensions and this is also thing that
intrigues me in data visualization here
you basically have two dimensions and
Gapminder you have an additional
dimension which is for communicated by
the radius of the of the dots the
largest dot is the bigger is the
population of the country oh yeah every
every dot represents one country on the
planet the size of the dot represents
the size of the population there is a
color code which tells you fridge from
which continent the country is coming
and you can kind of attach different
values to the to the X into the y axis
but the basic principle the basic
principle is again very very simple and
allows you to really make very very
complex very complex statements about
the world and the thing that for example
hands rosling is always really
emphasizing is that gap minder is really
against preconceptions it's it's really
about getting you know tools out there
that allow people to understand what's
happening in the world and he's always
arguing against this kind of
preconception that you know Africa is
poor and people don't live there very
long and that the North America and
Europe people are rich and they live
very long and he can really kind of show
that very very nice in the data that a
lot of these kind of preconceptions are
actually not true especially if you run
them over time because there's also time
slider down here where you can really
run the data from the 70s till today but
there are also obviously more let's say
kind of complicated visualizations I
would always say this is our basically
simple ones these are more complicated
like the map of the market it's also
classic by Martin Wattenberg which
allows you to see kind of how the the
the stock market has changed in the last
few days um if the
the specific stock went up or down and
so on I don't want to go into the
details here or really more almost kind
of poetic visualizations like this one
from arch the fan on the eigen factor
visualization and it's based on
quotation sorry citation patterns and
big scientific journals so what you have
here is different big different as there
is a big scientific disciplines like
geosciences or medicine or psychiatry
and in the inner part of the circle you
have the big journals like for example
here nature and this visualization
allows you to explore the citation
pattern so here you can see that nature
the journal nature is really covering
all of the academic fields academic
disciplines but for example if you go to
the New England Journal of Medicine you
will see that it's much more focus
really around biological science
medicine bit of chemistry so you can
really explore if if certain academic
disciplines are more inward-looking and
are only citing papers from the same
discipline or more outward looking or
reciting also other disciplines hmm so
this is a bit quick run through some
classic examples of data visualization
there's a great quote by ben shneiderman
ben shneiderman is also one of the well
heroes of the of data visualization he
did some he also co-invented the the the
tree map algorithm that was just used
for the maps of market and he just set
this really great thing he said like
Galileo's telescope hooks microscope or
Z at the x-rays the information analysis
tools are creating visualizations of
never-before-seen structures Jupiter's
moons plant cells and skeletons of
living creatures were all revealed by
previous technologies today new network
science concept and analysis tools are
making isolated groups influential part
participants and community structures
visible in ways never before possible
and I totally agree with that I really
believe that visualization techniques
play a very very similar role they
really enable us to make things visible
that would otherwise be invisible
however I have a slide what a problem I
have a slide comment on this quote my
problem is that the underlying
assumption here and the comparison where
is microscope and the telescope and the
x-rays is as all these three
technologies are all based basically on
physics and an optics so what happened
500 years 300 years back to and years
hundred years back is people invented
these magnifying tools like the
telescope microscope my microscope and
they would reveal structures in the
world however these magnifying tools
were all based on optics and so there
were kind of deterministic I mean I know
is we could have a big debate about that
how deterministic that would be but
still it's based on physics and my
problem is that this approach also
implement to a very very deterministic
visualization approach and you still
find structures or diagrams like this
with simplification in in textbooks and
they basically say well we just take
wrote a term you put it in a table you
just have a bunch of visualization
algorithms run over them and then you
can generate your data views so it
implies that there is a deterministic
approach to visualization let's kind of
put in your data check it in and you get
an image at the other side and coming
from a design background I don't quite
agree with this approach for me data
visualization is bit more like this
obviously this is not a data
visualization this is carlo rovelli this
isn't the actually if you have a chance
to see it it's in the National Gallery
in London it's very beautiful painting
and it is not a data visualization but
what we see here is that calico led the
painter used certain algorithms to
create this image
in the Renaissance painters really
discovered the perspective and they try
to understand the rules of perspectives
so there was a real research thing at
the time and in a way it's really an
algorithm how you can display how it can
visualize three dimensional spaces on a
flat surface and so he uses this
algorithm but it's not he's not
presenting the algorithm he's not even
presenting data he's obviously creating
an image and he's telling the story and
I think again this is not a data
visualization but I like the approach
the underlying message in here that it
shouldn't be just kind of about the
algorithms but that they were just
facilitating data views and stories
another example from the time that I
also really like a lot of filippo
brunelleschi did basically the first
augmented reality app 500 years ago he
tried to he was very very scientifically
minded and what he did is in order to to
really get a feel for the correctness of
a perspective drawing he took a mirror
and well he held it up like this
basically and he painted the scene there
this this tower and then was the mirror
he tried to kind of fit it in and we
wanted to see if the image is really
kind of fitting in what he's seeing with
his natural eye so the point here again
is it's not that you know perspective
wasn't just kind of around people really
discovering it and really played around
with it in order to facilitate paintings
and storytelling and just to illustrate
that point again we always take the map
of the world for granted and we say yes
this is the world the world map and it's
kind of objective but when you think
about it obviously it isn't objective
you know this would be also an objective
and perfectly correct view of the world
it's no I mean the one thing here is
this is a Mercator projection which has
certain advantages if you're kind of
navigating the seven seas
but it was the incorrect when it comes
to when it comes to displaying the the
landmasses of the different continents
for example here Alaska is huge you know
it's almost as big as there's Australia
which is simply not true and this would
be a completely different projection and
you can see Australia's much bigger here
and then again kind of see that the
meridian is going through through
through Greenwich is just was just
decided by somebody there is no kind of
physical law that forces us to do that
and also kind of the north is on top is
also just a convention so my point here
is simply that data visualizations are
actually cultural artifact and and I
think it's really important to read
treat them more as s such as design
objects and not necessarily as a product
of just um technology actually helped
you serve me writing all those examples
which you trying to use to justify
distinction between raw data and the
logical production of a visualization
from that data turn around visual
certitudes for example perspective for
example the visual form of the world
seen from afar surely you should be near
you need an example where there's a
reflexive relationship between how to
see stuff and what's constituted as the
stuff that is seen none of those
examples satisfy the criteria I would
like to go on for now and I would like
to show some some projects from the from
the University I mean your point is what
is your point my point is you were
saying that you're concerned that
visualizations shouldn't just be treated
as deterministic yes all the examples
you trying to say is a cultural artifact
turn a turn around in fact confirmations
at the victory artifact that that's
visual it is it something which is
available it's not reflexively
constituted so the examples of the
worlds are seen are still it's just a
visual artifact is it upside down is it
constructed and so other ways the visual
still remains the anchor so in a sense
all those examples are affirming the
validity of the deterministic one of you
and you're sure your thesis is you can
use visual
to do something other those example some
shown that no my thesis is that this
this way I mean the way the world is
presented here is extremely culturally
biased the north is on top London is in
the middle and the the continents are
actually not in the same I mean the land
masses are actually physically not
correct but we use these kind of
visualizations in school books you know
we use it in World News and so on and so
on so we generate here an image of the
world it's extremely cultural biased and
the point I would like to make here is
because this is seems to be kind of an
objective image of the world we don't
really reflect critically on these
images and I'm just really a bit bit
worried when it comes to data
visualization that people would see them
as you know the absolute truth because
you know there is true data that I mean
this is kind of proven algorithm so the
outcome must be true in a sense and this
is simply this simply isn't my point
that I don't agree with that well no I
think you found the owners isn't only in
agreeing with our disease I'm sort of
saying I do these a good example so
you'll see since that's one to
understand okay I disagree but we can
discuss a later or cup of coffee I like
to go on so my point is yeah
visualization is cultural artifacts and
I would like to spend now maybe 15
minutes or so to jus just show a couple
of project that we did in Potsdam this
is a master thesis or one of our
students culture ography and the
interesting thing about it is that Kim
is taking also a dataset from a very
well cultural context he's basically
taking the data from internet movie
database and he has is obtained a
specific data set that allows him to to
explore the references between movies so
you can say that for example
the Star Wars Episode six also refers to
tartan and the ape-men well I don't know
why but so there are a relationship
between the movies and this is all
basically crowdfunded crowd-sourced what
happens is that the users can kind of
participate in the internet movie
database and can themselves create
connections between different movies so
you can then use this kind of data to
kind of explore the movie landscape and
what he did is he just began with two
with a number of different visualization
approaches for example it took generic
visualization tools just chucked in the
date and just kind of see how many
references would a movie get for example
Star Wars or The Wizard of Oz were
highly influential movies so they've got
a lot of references within the system
but this visualize it visualization just
shows kind of the amount of references
and not duration ships so what he did
you really took this as a design
challenge and these are all different
design iterations we're really try to
explore how can you visualize the
relationship between the different
between the different movies and every
single box here is kind of one approach
and again I think I know this is also
important if you treat it as a design
challenge that it just don't say okay we
have one algorithm and we take it but
you really try to explore a visual
language that allows you to make a very
very specific point in the end he came
up with a rather simple solution and and
again it's a bit like a scatter plot
where he says we have time and we have
the degree of incoming and outgoing
ideas so how many referrals are
connected with this movie and this here
between basically the the inspiration
the length of the line can be used to
map other dimensions and what basically
happens then is if you have a timely on
the left and you basically look into the
future and look into the past you can
see movies that are either this movie
for example here
us use well it's used as an inspiration
for this central selected movie here and
the other movies here on top also refer
to this movie so what happens you get
something like this for Star Wars highly
influential many many other movies are
referring to Star Wars while star was
itself didn't refer to so many other
movies and if you just apply that
principle to to the big set of data you
get these networks and and you basically
get kind of a network of the movie
history what's interesting Kim is also
collaborating with people from the
digital sign to digital humanities with
film historians and yours actually
having interesting debates about post
modern cinema based on these
visualizations what he also did and I
thought it was also interesting there to
use the x axis in different ways for
example to split it up into different
genres and so you can really kind of see
how if certain genres are really staying
more convince the same category or if
they're linking to two movies from from
another category or he applied and again
this is an algorithms he tried to to
generate clusters based on similarities
between the movies and you get these
kind of patterns it's actually already
out on the web if you want to explore it
it's cartography that come the password
is only you and it's all interactive and
you can try it out another project I
would like to show is deals with
questions of being in a personal and
local and this is something also I find
as a prospective really interesting that
data visualizations could be much more
tools in our everyday lives at
supporters in in decision-making that
just kind of show us where we are in the
city and where we've been and so on and
so on and I would like to show one
project that was supervised by two
nagger colleague of mine and it's
dealing with the whole problem as she's
dealing with two things a couple of
years ago there was a scandal that all
the all our geographical data was stored
on the iphones and and it was really
interesting there were a couple of
visualizations at the time where you
could kind of chuck in your data and you
would see where you've been in the last
few days and this was basically a
starting point for liquid data and the
idea here was to use geographical
visualizations and interactive tables to
create a personal view of your history
in the city till is working on the
unfolding unfolding processing library
it's part of his PhD and this library
also allows you to make really very very
flexible very very good maps straight
out of processing and again another idea
there was some came into the project was
the Siri by Beauty bore the Naked City
the whole idea that that you will never
perceive the city as a whole it's much
more really fragmented and we have our
neighborhood you know where we live
where we do our shopping we have another
neighborhood where we go to work and we
have certain channels that allow us to
hop from one neighborhood to the next
and they basically wanted to really show
how these kind of little fragments
asylums would look like and I'm just
going to yeah and this is basically how
it looked and I'm just going to show a
quick video
the music is just background music
so the basic idea is I think it's quite
understandable ism that's all the
location data that's stored in your
phone can we just kind of pour it onto a
table and you see different places on an
interactive map where you spend some
time the last few last few days they're
all occasions like cars sorry cafes
restaurants or bars and you can use an
iPhone app to control to the content of
the of these kind of little little
bubbles for example you can add
additional content by by pushing over in
your photograph you can kind of explore
the content here if you just kind of tap
on it and so what I find interesting is
about are two different things one is
that you can really use your mobile
phone to manipulate to manipulate
visualizations on a big multi-touch
table and that you can kind of see where
you've been and sorry and the third
thing is becomes really interesting if
you add several phones to the tail end
you see the intersections of where
several people have been doing a time
the next project i would like to show is
not necessarily in a university project
but i would like to make one point that
I find really also important also coming
from this kind of more design
perspective I think there are many many
interesting visualization projects out
there from designers who create
beautiful images but very often there
are not really that useful and what I'm
really keen on right now is to really
get the intersection right between an
interesting visualization and the right
user interface design and I think that's
a real challenge because only if we get
the interface design right we're able to
kind of ask specific questions to the
visualization and I would like to show a
big project that I did in collaboration
with the Battlement foundation which is
a big media foundation Germany and there
are currently discovering visualization
projects and they have one project
that's all about global economic
dynamics or in short GED and they
created wanted to have a visualization
tool that allows them to visualize the
relationship between different countries
and this is basically the core
visualization what you can see here are
five different countries in the world
and every country has a little magnet
attached to it and what you can see here
are the inflows and outflows of trait so
for example you can see here the amount
of trade going on between United States
and China and all other all of the
countries and they're also unilateral
uni literal data attached to the country
here for example the population or the
BRP boutons product I don't know the
German English word for it sorry and I'm
just going to switch very quickly too
to the visualization and what I think is
really important about this project is
again the it's the interface design we
spend really a lot of time really to get
it right to you two to have a real tool
that allows you to change the
visualization very quickly and also to
work on stuff like animations that you
would really kind of jump from one view
to the other view you could for example
so do stuff like at countries you can
just kind of add for example the
eurozone said ed eurozone it's group you
would immediately get the eurozone
because then later on ungroup it and
then kind of split it up and so on so
you can do kind of a lot of different
operations here within the visualization
tool that will allow you to create very
very unique configurations of of
countries and also important kind of you
get kind of these rollovers that
immediately give you a very very very
very explicit meaning of this connection
for example here it's a bit small now
but you can really say that 382 3382
billion dollars was exported or was
traded from china to the united states
so that there is always kind of a verbal
layer connected to the visualization
that you would allow you to really read
the visualization it's also kind of
possible to switch for example different
have different data sets like bank
claims and so on and so on so this is
really kind of treated more like a let's
say kind more like a software package
and not only as a visualization to jump
back
to the presentation again I would like
to talk a little bit about the process
we did I think was interesting to really
get going in the project if we started
to use generic tools like Fe um we just
chucked in the data that we have and and
just kind of watched what happened jeffy
is a open source tool for graph
visualizations and we try to to find
visual encodings that would at least
kind of tell us led us to dare to see
certain trends within the data for
example that obvious things that for
example United States really had a huge
depth this is kind of things the depth
relationship of various countries
worldwide and you could also kind of see
kind of who owed money to whom and so on
and so on but it was quite clear that
this is not really a visualization
approach that would work for for a
general public so we did lots of
sketching really a lot of sketching we
came up with this idea of magnets as
idea that you had to really organize
these little magnets in certain ways mmm
also the the idea how do you what do you
do if you only have two or three or four
different countries because sometimes
you would get really really weird shapes
if you just kind of stuck them onto onto
a circular exit so we did a lot of
experiments also in processing and see
how they would fit together how much the
spacing should be what kind of rules
could be used in order to really create
a very pleasant and very very readable
visualization and we basically created a
style guide before the whole thing was
programmed so you could really kind of
see how the different user interface
elements kind of play together how they
work together and it also did some user
testing that also showed a couple of you
I problems for example this was the
first the first shot at the country
selection and was quite clear after a
while after some user testing that it
simply didn't work and that we had to
come up with a new version that you just
saw I'm not going to India into the
details here
another thing that was also really
crucial for for the project and that I
also criticized that I find what
problematic with many other
visualizations is they all sit in their
specific frame in their browser and what
we wanted to achieve is that you can
create data views that you can create
slides you know that you literally can
generate your own data views in order to
support a certain story and then you
have a set of slides maybe five or six
slides and that you could take these
slides and embed them directly into into
another block so it basically works like
YouTube or like Vimeo you can create
your own data views here and if you
click on the share button basically this
in window pops up and you get an iframe
code and you can just just chuck it into
your chuck it into your into your block
and I think this approach is also really
really interesting to to get the
visualizations out of Sarah you know
their original context and allow them to
bring them into a new context so that
people can really use these
visualizations in order to frame a
debate and to support certain points
they want to make in blogs and other
publications and so yeah we saw in
German I didn't bother to translate it
but the idea was also the whole idea of
embedding visualizations was also
crucial for a communication strategy
because we thought that people like data
journalists or like scientists or like
NGOs they would like to use the data use
the visualizations and but in order to
tell stories of their own we can't
generate all the stories that are
connected to the data so we have to
create a setup that allows them really
to create data views and vet it into
their content and then publish it to
their users the last point I like to
make here today is a bit of the final
point it's more about communication and
artistic expression kind of how can data
be use to to create beautiful images and
yes this is a bit of a contradiction to
what I said before but I think this is
also part of it it's as designers we
can't just say okay
and there's all to be about
functionalities I think as designers we
also have to understand that data can be
a material for artistic expression and
for exploring different kind of visual
visual structures so what I would like
to show very briefly is a project I did
for over 10 years this is it's called
poetry on the road I did this for 10
years and these are all posters for a
literature festival in Germany and all
these posters look slightly different
but there are all based on the same same
principle because all these visuals are
completely generated by a piece of code
what happens every year is we take all
the all the poems that are read only in
the festival we tuck them into a
computer program and the computer
program generates these graphics this is
one from 2010 and I would like to talk
very briefly about the one from 2006
there's probably the most famous one
I'll show that later the idea in 2006
was to was to encode all the all the
words of the poem using a very very
simple structure that I mean everyone
basically knows that you can just sit at
a CH assign a number to every to every
letter in the alphabet so a is 1 b's 2
and so on and so on so in the end you
could just kind of add up the numbers
and get a number for every word what
would what I did next was said okay
every poem will be on its own ring so
and the radius of the ring will depend
on the size of poem so this out here is
a very very long poem and in here rather
short poems so what happens next is if
we isolate one poem here and this is
kind of the poem or this is a part of
the poem on on this ring here you can
see that there is a weird um kind of
emphasis on these connections here and
what actually happen and I wasn't
anticipating that because I didn't have
the the final poems were when I did the
code that the author of the Perelman
always started
each each line with the same phrase so
here is really the the the this
basically is the phrase always eat huh
bamboo house kappa which is basically
here's a hub I'm boo and if you see it
here is basically a harp whoop whoop I'm
boo Oscar part and so on so what happens
here is that because there is always the
same structure in the text you get this
kind of emphasis in the in the
visualization itself now why am i
showing this is why am I saying this
this piece actually kind of kicked off a
huge debate between Robert kisara and
Enrico bertini about kind of
visualization techniques and it was
quite funny because a couple of years
ago when you put saris as Google now
when you put visualization to Google
this is actually kind of the first
visualization that popped up I mean the
other two sorry the others are lost okay
they're not much better i have to admit
and it was quite interesting say it was
really at an impact on the idea of how
visualizations also from a design
perspective are perceived I'm afraid
nowadays it's no longer pops up and the
visualization but it still pops up under
bad visualization at least kind of a
good point number 16 here from from from
that so it's still kind of part of that
debate and I find that rather curious
anyway so where are we heading I think I
know we're heading towards I think the
next big step and visualization will be
more severe gaps and with civic apps I
mean apps that are really visualizations
that are very very local that are
personal and that are actionable so that
they have a real kind of application to
our everyday lives there are many
initiatives like where does my money go
where we take open data we put into
visualization and they really tell us
about how money is spent that we that we
paid that we usually kind of pay us
taxes so all this is already really
interesting but I think it needs to be
also kind of more personal more related
to your kind of direct surrounding so
coming back to the idea of math
visualizations I think the next step
will really be to show everyone where
you
are basically on the map how much you
know Texas spend in your area what is
the noise pollution of the area how is
it schools in the area I was quite
intrigued the other day when I found out
that here in the UK there is this
website called lock rating that allows
you to really explore the quality of the
schools in your in your city and that
you really have this highly detailed
data that really allows you to see kind
of the quality of the school also things
like how many pupils have english as a
first language and so on and so on so
it's quite powerful and it's already
quite powerful to have this kind of data
accessible on a platform but i think
it's even more powerful if you just put
it on a map and allow you to really kind
of see it in your context and if you add
more data layers like for example this
is a noise map of berlin we can really
kind of see how noisy is a certain
neighborhood it can really lead to a
different kind of decision making and a
different kind of perceiving the world
around you and acting in the world
around you so and they're also for
example here is here maps already number
of tools that allow you to really build
your own apps build your own map
visualizations and explore the your city
with different kinds of data this is
also interesting this is so metal wood
info actually the wrong order it's a
nice visualization it allows you to get
little slider you can move over the the
the underground nevin London and you
only see only see the stations that are
actually accessible for defer disabled
so that was really also good example
anyway closing statement I think it's
really important from my point of view
to understand visualizations as cultural
image-making that it's non deterministic
the other thing is visualizations should
be considered as visual arguments this
is also i find really interesting
otherwise a good example the visual the
poetry on the road posters there are low
visual argument there are just pictures
but when we talk about the mmm the the
gate vis project from battles mum it's
really about kind of finding interesting
data constellations that allow you to
make
visual argument when you build
visualizations it's really the design
process that should be applied so
prototype iterate and explore the data
and good visualizations and this is
really linking to the Civic apps should
empower your audience and I think
there's also really important to think
about who you're doing this for and good
visualizations should create insights
great inspiration or should support you
in decision-making what book
recommendation this just came out and
they should one of the best books on the
data visualization that I've seen in the
last few years so this is a really good
good starting point if you want to
continue so that was me thank you very
much I really like the color around
because it allowed me to answer specific
scientific question quite good have you
had any experiences stories of that sort
but wishes ases you build experiences
about sorry have you had experiences
experiences with building visualizations
that allow scientists to answer specific
questions I noticed you had a magic wood
watershed someone yeah yeah good example
it's a collaboration with Aggie of
fortune central in potsdam and the where
they did the water monitoring for
Central Asia and it was really
interesting that the it was worked
really well the collaboration with the
scientists when we're just really
talking about the visualization they're
really interested in really crafting
good images to really have good good
geographical maps and have very very
make the the the different positions of
the census really accessible you could
directly click on them they could kind
of see how much water went through and
so on that was really good it became
more interesting when we started to
think about how we could kind of applies
it to two I can make it more practical
or more actionable and we know that
there are NGOs in the air
really trying to to work together with
the farmers you know to talk about water
consumption because the water
consumption is too it's basically too
high in the area do they're doing lots
of cotton plantings and and they
actually need to save water because
otherwise you know they're getting
drawers and water it's a big political
issue in the area and at that point the
scientists really backed away internal
is getting too far you know this is not
what we're doing here and I thought it
was interesting I don't want to kind of
qualify that in any sense but I think
and it's a first step is really that was
really really very successful just in
terms of making the data more accessible
creating really more just kind of better
picture better visualizations and better
interactions with the sensor data and so
on but when they when we talked about
the end of making it more actionable it
went kind of bit hazy very scientific
questions that you help them answer by
making the visualizations different they
well what our visualizations provided
them to do is and that was really kind
of an improvement to what they had
before is the the we could really kind
of map I don't have it with me now who
could really kind of map it down to two
the visualizer water consumption in
every level of the of the rivets you
could really kind of see how much water
went off before that it were just
numbers and when we created this
visualization they could really kind of
see patterns and where it would go and
because it's a huge political issue
there are lots of kind of different
borders go in that area it was actually
really interesting for them to see kind
of at which stage how much water kind of
left the system and when diges different
different fields so I think at that
point the visualization really made a
difference in terms of also findings how
the water is used students have to have
fluency in code to be successful with
data visualization
it depends it certainly helps but we
also did it depends we did a few classes
for a couple on policy visualizations
and many students didn't do an
interactive version they collect the
data and created infographics basically
so I think if you take out the
interactivity and really try to view
data visualization more as a creating a
certain point of view on a specific
subject like autumn oil hot or something
you know that you want to have make a
more political statement I don't think
it need a lot of code I think from my
point of view there are really two
different ways to treat data
visualizations one is more really about
communicating a certain aspect of the
data and the other is really providing
the users with with an opportunity to
explore the data and if you go into a
more explorative approach then obviously
the students need to need to be able to
program if you just want to make a point
and and maybe just kind of craft one
specific image then not necessarily
visually room apps or they were networks
where was not a project and try and look
at how machine learning is functioning
which is either a mile or network
there's funding what other kinds of
visualizations are out there is that it
um machine learning I took but it's an
example of something that's neither a
mouth nor network in yet every whenever
I look around that's what I see maps and
networks what what are the kinds of
visualizations of people do I mean I'm
aware of a couple of visualization that
really based on self-organizing maps I
don't
David do you need kind of examples or
didn't do I looking for example or are
you in front of how care how they can be
how they can be applied or what you can
do with it I've never seen anything
other than a map or network yeah I have
to look it up so I don't correct the
point we're at a red and green gradient
and kind of skipped over it one more
complex create visualizations and how to
red to green Oh man's pocket yeah yeah
and it just showed a kind of a flow or a
different but wasn't necessarily a map
or a network in that sense I think you
mean just kind of different
visualization examples in terms of how
you can just kind of visualize data
except for kind of scatter plots and
then maps basically or yeah okay okay
sorry now get out for you were 50 mega
tree multi-dimensional problems it can't
be visualized in the 3d way 10 10 if
there it is three dimensions there's
more you gotta put another way of doing
that yeah well that's why don't I find
some time well I'm of course it's around
old eggs would potentially find some
time to talk specifically about this SMS
may be right thanks a lot okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
