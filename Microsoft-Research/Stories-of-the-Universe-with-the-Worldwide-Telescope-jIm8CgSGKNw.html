for us is it will enable us to tell the
stories of the universe in context it
really gives us this unified perspective
on the university allows us to see the
relationships between things what's near
what's far what's the size and scale of
things how are they related wherever
you're browsing you never lose context
of where you're at so as you're zooming
in and zooming out you're always aware
of the scale where you are and what
you're looking at you can zoom out to
the whole sky practically and you can
see how puny even that so-called giant
molecular cloud that's forming stars is
compared to the size of our galaxy you
can zoom out again and see how puny our
galaxy is compared to distant other
galaxies that themselves contain
billions of stars I want to see the
whole picture how does the universe
relate to me is there something here for
me and then also when I look up in the
sky where is this stuff and what is it
and how does it work and why does it
work that way you can anchor yourself in
a particular part of the world through
the system a place you're not even in at
the moment and you can go almost real
time in this construct to another part
of the universe and find what it seems
like from there it makes it very easy to
find all the beautiful Hubble images
that they see all over the place but
they don't know where they fit on the
sky it's really easy to be able to find
them zoom into them see them and
understand all well this is in this
constellation this is in that
constellation the amount of data you can
look at is so unlimited it just blows
your mind worldwide telescope allows us
to share the data that we use for
research in astronomy it allows data
sets from so many observatories to be
served up right under your fingertips
there have been hundreds and hundreds of
terabytes of imagery
have been created in the past what world
wide telescope will do is allow all of
those images that have been stored away
be viewable by the public and provide
these thumbnails down below that change
depending on your field of view and so
as things come into view that look
interesting you can look at a thumbnail
and say wow what's that click on that
and it takes you to that object in the
sky any object or set of objects in the
sky can be linked outside the program to
other information and so it's almost
like the browser itself is a web browser
for the sky where instead of Internet
content you have sky content it's so
seamlessly integrates all these
different telescope images not just in
visible light but also across the
wavelengths of light that we can't see
with our naked eyes and I think that's
huge it's a it's a view of the universe
that we haven't technically been able to
have to be able to really understand the
nature of the universe and the entire
electromagnetic spectrum is just
something that's unavailable and in any
other form the world wide telescope
invites us all to be explorers and
that's fabulous there's nothing like
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
