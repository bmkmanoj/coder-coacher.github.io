what if furniture was interactive
showing different colors and patterns
depending on the situation furniture
might even have its own emotions for
example showing happiness when someone
put flowers in front of it or being
angry when kids are fighting on it to
study how people react to the concept of
interactive furniture and how they
interpret emotions conveyed through
lights patterns and vibrations embedded
in furniture we built a moto couch a
motor coach has custom cushions
containing strips of individually
controlled LEDs we embedded a voice coil
in a cushion and played subsonic audio
files to make the cushion vibrate we
hand drew the patterns for the couch to
facilitate rapid prototyping while
experimenting with ways to dynamically
show different patterns on fabric by
changing the color of thermochromic
pigments through heat emitted by thin
nichrome wires we conducted a mechanical
turk survey to learn what emotions
people associate with different colors
and patterns as well as their
combinations and how consistent people
are in identifying six emotions angry
happy sad calm excited and afraid next
in our lab study with 14 pairs of
parents and children we gathered richer
qualitative data as participants
interacted with the emoticon study
participants suggested many different
situations in our couch might express
emotions from excitement during a party
to being happy when the family is
together the concept of interactive
furniture intrigued most participants
however opinions varied on whether the
couch should automatically express
emotions based on its surroundings or be
set manually to a desired emotion
