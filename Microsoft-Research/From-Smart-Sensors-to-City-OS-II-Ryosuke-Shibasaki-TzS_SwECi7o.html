you
you should use a lot of good application
Celeste where's Becky thank you very
much for your very kind introduction I
just wish she was a key from the center
of special information on the University
of Tokyo after I let me also start with
some solos introduction of cities I
found this valuable in the scientific
american or DK scientific that is a nice
japanese translation version and anyway
this picture is very attractive where
knowledge is created is that is city and
also probably the power 0 cities
actually does it in the place where the
people get together to create knowledge
and also the few queries but at the same
time by attracting so many people in the
imitative race actually may encounter
some kind of elaborate like a traffic
jam air pollutions and also and also
some sort of the vulnerability to the
point of the digesters actually refer to
be allergies equals japanese with the
hope we have a very high risk of the
very devastating natural
that's just typically earthquake or and
also the ultimate enemy I believe the
with a big data from cities have a very
good contribution to support the digest
responses when the body is and real
examples here actually see the movie oh
the generous people movement on the day
when we had very Cedars first quick
march eleven two thousand and that
distributes data operated within over on
aviation services include 1.5 million
people in the Japan and the location is
measured in every five mins so you may
feel two people go to any way to decide
from Tokyo after the morning rush hour
is over you may see after this
concentration is Tokyo Disney around and
also you can see it is hungry airport
and the actually the earthquake struck
japan 246 okay then the ancient is
really the father of tokyo we have no
physical damages but still the order
railways love you stopped so that means
we have to walk from office to home
usually 10 or
20 kilometer so you may see a row two
people marching along with your
transload aunt is a very late at night
or even the very early the only time
it's next day by looking at this yes of
course various different kinds of
organizations agencies can even
understand the severity of this kind of
disaster and probably that provided a
good motivation for collaboration and
also these informations might be useful
for a better informed decision-making
even for the rest a the citizens
and also this kind of data covers entire
Japan again very are in the morning so
in the morning is will start like but I
need you to reputation time let me just
stop yeah and also the coastal radius
that is closer to the edge Center
actually was struck by tanami this is a
center International Airport of the
coastal zones it's completely inundated
by looking at the GPS data actually
William we could monitor house in on PA
or evacuated from the devastating
tsunami this is the morning of
eccentricity and the taste is a cost
rinds and actually due to the tsunami
those areas are completely for example
inundated again be the earthquake struck
this region 2 45 46 a.m.
winters quake occurred all the electric
power supply and stopped and traffic
signal is gone so you may see that the
speed with people movement throw down
and when all right that's not instruct
the regionals you may see some people
evacuating from nothing and amantha's
nany strike you can see the crustal
points after this is occasional the
terminal building will set the
International Airport and you take
evacuated to the building human Lydia is
almost no points in the evening on
thursday when it snaps truck is regional
and the those kind of later actually are
quite almost the real-time basis for
every day so I believe that the data
will be very very useful for most of all
things emergency responses governmental
organizations police and the fire
departments and evil for the individual
enterprises will come back
people and as I mentioned this is a kind
of long term to this data so we can even
see how the people move their recess
from the fukushima nuclear power plant a
year's to the other cities to answer
them all the people within this circle
have to move to the different process so
that means we can able monitor how they
live their lives after the long term
evacuation from that very energetic
nuclear are connected so anyway the
visualization and also some sort of the
Immigration Service could be one of
important basis for the smaller
management of city for the Duster or for
the involvement or a way the
transportation attentions away the
something but is by accelerating is kind
of psycho plan to see
and also be adjusted and this is almost
like a common sense but actually i could
find another very interesting an example
again same scientific american the
article is titled how New York beat
crimes haga probably I have nothing has
time to talk about this but to stay up
the for the past 20 years the criminal
crime rate has decreased very much but
on the other hand the many people
believe that the poor drug addict have
much higher tendency to create a crime
but then during the illios those kind of
statistics yes by drug abuse of poverty
ratio have not so much a decrease or
decline but on the other hand according
to this article the one of the kind of
monitoring system that it goes comes
that it's a kind of false reading some
sort of the real-time statistics on
crime including location and also creep
client eyes so by Shirley and also
visualizing such kind of data actually
team of the pursuit apartment in video
District Police Department actually sit
down in France and Israel and actually
they their performance are evaluated and
also compared investor discounted
process making different I years
can Tunisia are implementing and also
the very few such kind of cycles after
they finally come up with a very good
ideas as some sort of talks houghton le
and that neighbor the enemy is to
allocate more calm more cuts to the hot
spot where the people are tempted into
any price so actually it's some sort of
the process of making people or making
city management and smarter through here
but timely data with is your
visualization and also be see and
ancient you just visualize a shove the
GPS data we may say support the decision
making better through some sort of the a
little bit deeper analysis is it a kind
of raw data but by examining such random
GIS data we can have an approximate
expansion of the combination and also
of the activity as including the
transportation all day they use like
this and the ones the home rails
publication of equity actually we can
educate GPS points5 individual at the
mistress two boundaries based on their
home estimating home locations so in May
they don't such area by aggregating that
we could create a data mobile operation
the distance is in comparison Posey real
08 the former national census for
individual districts and also horizontal
axis corresponds to the aggregated
chibis data by congregation so you may
see a very good kinda corporation
although there are some and evolved
lightest actions of the iliad what we
call a nutshell where many people works
during night for restaurant or snack to
the bar 20 but again read through this
kind of analogies we could determine and
weight of individual GV sports that
means here by multiplying the GPS data
by eight points 86 point 165 we can have
some sort of the estimation of the real
number of the people of course in terms
of the night
operation so anybody through this kind
of analysis any help we can provide and
quantity to quality of the novel GPS in
yes you do that and we have a lot of
inventive sensors into the a social
infrastructure and that is for the phone
I see tickets and ready take it the
right way we have to go through this
candidate gate it's a automated gate for
counting the people so in your by using
such kind of people counting theta we
can have a better estimate again and
this is a kind of conceptual and
pictures why lacerations so by
integrating a different
we can have a better estimation and this
kind of data integration for the
estimation could be implemented under
the framework or something like dat
assimilation or the particle filtering
or or four dimensional variation of
humanization why do something like this
so anyway we are now trying implementing
such high biased here are the particles
are generated by the discrete shows
model of the human the reading of Inuit
is trying to describe how the people
moves within the 24 hours and the using
such kind of simulation models we could
create particles and those the relative
weight of those particles could be
determined by comparing with the
observational data to dance or such kind
of data assimilation process the ls
could be reduced very drastically in the
water stations I
none of the passengers teaches patience
and also we can have a better estimation
even for the road traffic etc by
insufficient data
and so far we have just talked about the
GPS data acquired in Japan but the kind
of mobile system of outside post or
Baltimore this is the kind of
visualization of the mobile phone data a
certain power data from the Dhaka
Bangladesh we are working for the
gramophone for fighting with flooding
because the Bangladesh is a passel
department store or very serious natural
digesters ranging from wrapping cyclones
draught and also sometimes their first
going and what we're doing is here on
this part sending the one information to
the cellular phone users actually
another sixty percent of the entire
operation para desh as salaam and
actually in sending this kind of
important information to them we have to
identify the location of the recipients
so anyway for playing such kind of
information we are working with round
form to analyze a CDL call detail record
data to have
educational video recipients and the
other day that include the three million
people are just of departments but they
may be honest and expanding in
cooperation with running home and anyway
if we don't believe in this case you may
wonder about privacy vibrations or
concerns but the in case of the
Bangladesh there is no other than sort
of correcting information for supporting
the deserts of rather than the cell
phone so this is completely done online
and also some so-called ever getting
data actually have okay so this is the
final slide and actually in country in
zis has going to data for Samantha city
management we have to take care of the
personal information actually when we do
baby these masti even expected that we
have personalized service a smart
services but for such edges services the
service providers may require
communication and all some sort of the
person information and in that process
we may have some privacy concern that
actually provide abilities limitation to
the studs only what we are anyway
discussing about is a wide having more
sandwich
just have your account of the first ones
of the disband will Lance data very
transparent and the trusting and also
mutual enemy principles and under such
kind of agreements it's information that
may provide personal information to us
so that means if you have greed we have
our account here in the back you can
have a kind of passports my city and
about showing that you have very pretty
eyes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
