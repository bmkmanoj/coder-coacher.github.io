Microsoft Research and I'd like to show
you the Bema Tron the Bema Tron is an
augmented reality concept that is using
a Kinect camera and a projector the
camera and the projector are mounted on
a very fast pan tilt head unit this is
the kind of thing you might find in a
nightclub where usually have a spotlight
that's moving around the scene what
we've done is replaced the spotlight
with a projector and the Kinect camera
and that allows us to basically sense
and project graphics anywhere in a room
and so as the head moves around it
actually builds up a model of the
environment using Kinect fusion
kinectfusion is a project out of
microsoft research cambridge and we have
a 3d model then of everything in the
room right here we just have some foam
core pieces set up and I'm driving a car
around this room now I'm controlling the
car with a wireless wheel from Microsoft
this is the next box accessory so we're
using the 3d data in two different ways
first to program a physics model for the
this little car so then as we drive the
car around an object it responds
appropriately so if I go over a ramp
maybe it it'll tumble over the side of
the ramp and I can't drive into a wall
the second way we're using the 3d model
of the room is to correct the projection
of the car onto the surface of the room
so for example normally when you project
graphics onto a flat surface you don't
have to worry about the shape of the of
the surface if the graph has just come
out correctly but when you project onto
an irregularly shaped object in the room
you have to pre distort the graphic so
that it looks correct by the time light
hits your retina so we take into account
the shape of the room or the shape of
the objects in the room their
orientation of the surfaces again using
all of the 3d data we're getting from
Kinect so that's the Bema Tron it's a
new augmented reality concept it allows
us to basically put graphics and sensing
anywhere within a room thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
