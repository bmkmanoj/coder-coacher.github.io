I have been leading a team of
researchers working on web search and in
the next in the last couple years one of
the effort my team has been trying to do
is to see if we can actually create some
potential disruption or even potentially
change the current study paradigm and
it's actually very difficult you know
people already get used to the current
search engine so in my talk mass I'm
going to share with you some less salt
and also the early thinking high level
direction that the team here including
the people in being him has been
thinking about in the next decade what
direction potentially we can look into
you to really fundamentally change how
people interact with search engine so I
went to stories a few high-level trends
which I think are very important
currently in the search area
I seen the first trend is about the
switch or the movement away from simply
just focus focusing organizing all the
information on the web and really draw
the focus and users in terms of what
they are looking for and what's their
information mean and then we know that
current search engine has studied with
submission to organize all the
information in the world this is very
powerful idea and also lead to a very
successful company but we believe this
actually this idea also comest sounder
weakness because as we all know that
today the web continue to grow very
quickly and better in all such energy we
start to notice that information needs
States or the users query or the number
of page and
judy has the chance to appear in a
search result it's actually compared to
the entire web is decreasing favorite
dramatically and quickly so noise
illness is just a single-digit
percentage of doubt the entire web will
have a chance to show up in a useless
search result single about the web the
search engine constantly crawling the
web understanding the content building
the index and seller but the LS more
than 95 percent or maybe in the future
in the next five years will be 99
percent of those ever most computing
those processing is actually not very
have effective in terms of really
helping user so we want to see if we can
actually better leverage the 99% of
computing power to really mind in a way
of organizing information really
directly targeting users information II
so I'm going to show you how this
direction is actually leading some of
the new research project in Microsoft
and the second once you start to turn
your angle from the document space for
all that argument all the web page you
want to organize to clear space or
information in space you start to as a
question can you understand users intent
better Kearney search engine only
understand cures and take those keywords
and trying to match which document
should be ranked on top and that they
don't actually understand the intent
behind the query deeply enough so the
first thing we want to actually know
from keyword matching to intent
understanding and a second given that we
are going to have a mail processing hall
or maybe Elohim a post processing how to
understand the web to extract the
semantic extract analogy extract the
data that the entity from the webpage we
can potentially organize the web
according to a predefined list of query
or even a predefined discovered
information in space and we call this
knowledge base and that we want to
to be able to present user no longer
just with temple links in a search
result we want to three more semantic
most structured data and then then
really help people to complete their
task or even you know to take actually
make a decision and remember to do that
we actually need to peel a powerful
advanced indexing structure which
actually understands cemented in the
query understand the semantics in a
document and to the very efficient
matching and also using a model similar
to tile or model to understand to Chi
user to gradually for the search engine
to really know what user is actually
trying to accomplish and then can bring
the user to the page that can help them
to really finish what they are trying to
do instead of just nibbling a whole
bunch of URL and then leave a job for
them to figure out whether or not those
page content is for information for them
and the next trend we are all the
previous three or four it's really the
web now we are actually seen the web is
moving from the past decade as a
platform to publishing information
publishing content my lab is becoming a
platform for programming providing a lot
of application writing a lot of web
services which you can actually now we
actually don't see this completely
happen yet but we believe it's very very
possible layer in the new visual we are
going to see a lot level might be
political at different from today's you
know the big in a vertical search or the
application know like a you see today we
are going to see a lot of huge inaudible
my preferred eco app focusing on all
different kind of information II and
help people to accomplish and that that
ad can be implemented by one or two
developer and it's actually this idea
lead to the next trend is this
emergencies of car platform it's going
to provide developer the resources they
need the infrastructure they need the
thing that they need and so they can
actually easily quickly one or two
people can peel an ad to fulfill a task
and those app because searchable so we
are very much thinking about how we can
actually research from currently HTML
page search to really app and task or
cell research and this actually this
direction I think clearly cannot be done
by just simply one company even being
today we can not simply cover all the
information mean we want to sing about
can we actually create an ecosystem and
let a lot of self Hartley to help us to
address deeply orbit uses information me
because they may have paid her contacts
or paid her terminology and even locally
to serve a specific user segment so I'd
like to take everybody back to maybe 30
years ago maybe some of you still
actually in the early nap you actually
when you go to the library for the 30
years ago when you try to fire a book
and you use that this library car index
and other kind library organize their
book in a very simple way right they
create inverted index and the document
order that the paper that high index by
author and title and select keywords and
then you want to go to library you come
out a few keywords and you actually go
to that invert the index and look at the
reverse document are located in the
library and then so today actually the
first generation of search engine was
very very much invented to the press the
library car index so the only difference
the web has a lot more document than the
book in the library so you need to have
a ranking you know because each key you
know you are going to actually get
lotteries or thousands and medians so
you've got you you need to solve this
ranking problem and the closer changing
has been you know layer of the LMS as in
more than 15 years the paradigm has been
pretty much the same without much change
the only changes we got now much much
more documents and also the rich type of
document many different type of document
and also the ranking become more
sophisticated and we need to use more
powerful signals feature vectors
extracted from the document using
machine learning to learn the ranking
function to all kinds of lock mining
data mining to extract the signal even
using human interaction to help us to
improve ranking but still is very much
about the production of timberland
ranking ranking ranking the peridot has
remained pretty much the same but we are
actually in her company new you are
because as I mentioned the information
expose you now if you you imagine only
1% of the page in your search index are
going to be seen by the people so this
is just another slide to show you you
know illustrate ID on the web thing
about this is a very small percentage of
the page you actually fulfill
information and also to engineer to
discover you know we call this index
index selection problem means we want to
fund for them but these treaties or
webpage one almost 25 PDS of page we
want to index and how do you select this
posture because if this nothing our
index user is not going to see it so you
need to collect a carefully slight
important part of web to peel your index
and then let's think about the problem
you know the human population is not
going as quickly as in a web and each
one of us still have 24 hours a day
seven days a week and the amount of time
is spent our search is still relatively
limited okay so this comes to Anu
mission being and also Microsoft want to
push forward and the ideas really focus
on user focus on people and really
enable people to gain knowledge ease and
also creativity from the web by first
computationally understand users
searched him the match leg in ten using
a semantic matching indexing structure
with the published content but also the
application apps and services and that
ever try the search engine I think what
more and more little more like right
here engine routing in ten coming
through this engine and to the task or
the series actually users trying to
accomplish can use the app to complete
their tasks so we are thinking penis
more like a decision engine or a routing
engine and they're very different from
the traditional searching energies want
to just like a library even there's a
book that in a hundred years only one
person is going to check out but he
constantly you know repeal the index to
serve only we still need to have this
part and the better we believe there's a
huge opportunity to start to shift the
focus to therapy singing about what
users are looking for so in our current
search engine we start to reorganize the
effort a little bit so as you can see
traditionally we have this is a core
team containing three different paths
the first one is really focused on how
we can P were indexing and this indexing
clean now also think about how we can
represent who even actually store the
knowledge and represent analogy in the
weather in our index so the query can be
can be directly Korea against this
knowledge base and the ranking now need
to take care of intent rather than just
producing a team building looking at
looking at the keyword distribution now
intent is a very important part from the
query and we need to do a lot more
pre-processing before the crew here are
search engine we will come with a lot of
metadata
a lot of structure and they're also
cemented to help us to this and bigger
the users in them
and along lab we have a user experience
team to ensure that we have a whole page
that produces a relevance that can help
candle I our user and this whole page
relevance also be used to actually
narrow down user search intent so we
call this a first page means for you
search this is the first page you are
going to see now if we can actually now
relatively comment about users intent
that we are going to connect we are
going to show you that to the second
page could potentially show that result
on our domains or even for less a once
develop directly connect to the task and
Imperial ecosystem and so means we are
not only one two are going to build a
second page we want to leverage the
developer ecosystem to help us to build
a so we need the providers our first the
other our internal developers and also
the ecosystem this search platform in
infrastructure providing their data to
or they need to peel this and on top of
that we are going to address Stephen
market language and also all yen
excetera so this are the basically
different type of page in now in our
being and sign a page directly just
showing still that you never Excel you
resolve but we actually had two
different type of page eco domain
specific result page and also
permissible Civitas extreme page
hopefully we were directly we will be
able to rightly provide salva excusable
or the link to help people to complete
us directly on the page and in order to
do that because a lot of those knology
are currently hidden inside all the web
pages so in the last couple years one of
the important initiative in the inner
layer ticketing MSR is to helping to
peel this search infrastructure and
start from building a storage that can
constantly actually store the knowledge
about the web we actually process and
this allows us to do deep mining in the
past actually our for very first
generation of search engine is more like
pipeline a process and that we don't
have like a a memory or a storage that
can store a lot of data a metadata and
that the new structure the new
infrastructure we bill allow us to store
now the data so we can actually deploy
some of the offline mining
infrastructure and allow us to actually
apply loosely Cabo in a loosely coupled
way to to analyze the web data and later
I'm going to show you an academic
research we build it's actually based on
this new type of concept and
infrastructure and hopefully this
infrastructure the ideas really
facilitate a lot of experiment the
researchers and an engineer wanted to do
because we don't want to mess up with
our production system but a lot in a lot
of hi face fell over when the owner data
all the data search engine currently has
including the page the metadata and all
the future current yield in use in
ranking and allow us to actually choose
experiment study for apply experiment
once we Felidae and the hypothesis the
idea we familiar before and then we are
going to move into a nice experiment and
the ones day idea fella you know fella
that by the real user by the traffic
then we deploy this idea into the
production system so this infrastructure
allows to actually move the innovation
in a much much faster ribbon and
actually prove the data certain type of
data can improve either our recording
our web quality policy or strategy and
you actually push you the data push your
metadata to the crawler you call it
become more intelligent or you can push
your metadata to that a processing to
actually help that analysis all those
web pages or directly put push you into
the index or even in a serving and
hopefully I think the long-term goals
this infrastructure building for better
mining of the web data have been and
what become system that we can
constantly collect the web the data from
the web store them together and analyze
them and then organizing the information
then even present the information in
that way that can support the future as
a service to take action account so next
I want to show you a demo and so this is
actually a term always a protocol isn't
it's not the entire general web search
but it's actually very interesting comen
I think all of us really care about is
really this academic research and the
forward believe academic search you
actually can be a first example to
illustrate this new type of search
engine because in academic research we
have a lot of even have entities
including people those researchers those
authors and those are those papers lay
they were the publish and also that the
organization either is a Research
Institute or the university or research
lab like Microsoft Research Asia and
there's a lot of conference general so
we want to consider this as a unit of
information rather than currently that's
the small smallest unit of information
retrieved for retrieval is web page here
in our new search engine is entity and
then we further extract information from
the web and also from a lot of
structured data we get from ultra poly
from AC and from a lot of other
publishers we get the free data and we
aggregate integrate the information so
the money you are going to see actually
we can show a profile view the Paris are
you all ready player one with the a
chemical search outside the room and
that we are weak that page you actually
is automatically generated by
integrating information we extract from
the web and this allows us to actually
start to mining a relationship between
people entity and provide a very rich
environment for people to visualize to
even navigate and even prepared some
sort of impact analysis so recently I
think a lot of actually people are
professor already come to us want to
actually collaborate on designing new
type
a ranking algorithm to rank for example
researchers or Research Institute I know
this is very sensitive topic but I
believe by openly maybe provide all the
data now people can start to deploy
their customized linking scheme they can
actually better nature the impact of our
research work and they're so we love all
of you I want to invite my colleague 13
and to show us this demo so she is the
type manager of academic research team
in Microsoft Research Asia Thank You VIN
yeah I use this room great so good
haven't met one so this is the academic
search UI as you can see that we mine
and aggregate and present several
important entities for the academic
world publication authors conference
journal and organization so right now we
focus on computer science and it's 24
subdomains but we are we have planned to
expand to mark the domains so a typical
scenario of academic search is really to
search a keyword for example let's see
data mining as you can see that we
return you the so-called temple links of
data mining papers but also we can show
you who are the active authors in this
units domain the conferences and then
the journals so this give you too much
research information so that you can you
can browse you can find related
information for example many people in
the audience is probably very familiar
with this conference with our web
conference and we collect the
information and we can either show you
the popular officers here and notice
that William is one of them and
publications also we call the
information about the next connects
event which happens happens next year
and we show you the location so that you
can better prepare for your activity
going forward and another similar
another paragraph they use a craze
really looking for researchers let me
just show you one example I want to ask
the audience question how many of you
and know and researcher called Michael
Cohen hence only two all right
about ten of them so filling if I like
with a popular search engine and search
for micro coulomb and what we care we
can we get something called MD Cohen and
EMF corn and bacon and for me as a as a
junior researcher what I'm going through
this fear I did but it doesn't make much
sense to me so if a let's see go back to
here this is the academic search result
as we can see that we actually we do not
treat the word microphone as a stream
but rather as a as a person as an entity
as you so that you can see that what
this Michael a call him Michael picot
hem and then all the way till X Cohen so
I can see the microcode fathers are
really active in our in our research
community so and I say oh I actually are
really interesting this Mediterranean
Microsoft and then you can see that nice
profile of this researcher the
publication citation and then he's you
list and of course you can also find out
his home page and all the other related
information and you notice that so this
is not just handmade tailor that
information but water is all aggregated
together so of course people some people
found out that there's a procedure to
recall problem some of the information
might not be correct right so we provide
these kind of wiki style feature that
you can actually provide
Meishan provide collections you can say
okay I know that this person changed to
another organization or I want to add
more papers provide PDF or I just buy
tax information so we can use the
Windows Live site service to sign in and
so that you can provide equity
information so we notice that microphone
is for Microsoft as we can see that we
since we know the rather accurate
information about the operation of
authors to organization so we can
actually see that if you look at the
organization's as a collection of
authors you can get their total
publication current and totals of income
also you can calculate their h-index to
really look at the impact of a different
way of course you can play around with
different subdomains and with different
years for example you if you want to
look at that last 10 years impact of an
organization you can you can definitely
do so another interesting feature is
that you can also check out the chorus
our social network of micro coulomb
because we know all the data of Michael
collaborate with other people so we can
show you that this nice graph and then
the closer a person gets to Michael the
more paper they take they colossal
together and now you can also drill down
to find more information here and then
you can also you can always see some
authors from a cluster together because
they themselves caught collaborate
together more I am confident that our
research tree from Cornell University
can find these is very helpful for their
alpha paper community research hopefully
right and so this visualization is very
interesting and that we we are so well
for them this is
social networks and also from a very
famous professor in Japan and this is a
very former professor you know in Korea
so you can see I wanna show you example
so freeze image if I want to know
professor amount from from Korea so I
can just type in my name and then I can
find out the the colossal path like I
call the is Frank we are just one paper
so but I know Frank and Frank most
another person and enough person to have
a collaboration with Professor so that
maybe I can figure out okay maybe I can
guess through
professor main by going to this kind of
a six degree of separation hops so this
is one of the features so again we
provide this as as a platform so that
people can build applications so as many
people have seen outside of this meeting
room we have two monitors shown one
application to to share the summary
information of a bunch of people for
example we collect about most of the
attendees to this conference and then we
show there the basic information their
social network and their where they are
from outside so that in this scenario
that many people can just quickly look
at check out who's who in a conference
setting and a movie aware that we are
not going to implement all the features
in the academic field but whether we
want to open this up as a platform so
that people can when they have ideas
about social network about ranking they
can come to us and use our data use our
web services and then to create and then
to verify much more many many more
research ideas so that's it thank you
thank you Thanks
so currently this academic research is
in beta and we plan to actually
officially launches next year in
February and that elect high epaulette
highest thing we are going to actually
look into this more collaboration by
providing data and also we working with
community and really many different have
a new idea we can enrich this academic
research so let me switch their appeal a
little bit in the multimedia content
based imagery retrieval view I
personally has been working I think one
of the interesting direction is given a
lot of actually touch base computers
nollie and nowadays people can easily
actually interact by drawing and the
wonderful idea is can we actually be a
new type of image research actually a
lot of people to sketch out that's such
an intent so that we will be able to
actually measure against our database
and the repeat if this will actually
become a very used for creativity - or
even design design tool for kids for
people actually trying to find useful
information from the graph but in order
to do that actually they are two
technical challenges although I'm not
going to cover the detail today but I
just want to share with you one word for
that actually that the P tag knowledge
would be the first ones because I see
the sketch if on a user is relatively
informal shape information or the age
counter we can reliably extract from the
image and that this would be the first
technical challenging and the second one
is how can you actually represent that
information in a very scalable way and
peer index lacking particular similarity
search between different shape and
really profound real-time search on a
very very large database such as meet
periods of imaging and the tomorrow in
our innovation day you are going to see
the real demo and the next in this today
I am just going to show you quickly that
the video will record it
so for example you can actually draw a
scheduled person and if the search and
you bring that and no phone currently we
have a belong like a 20 millions of
image and in actually about like a two
machine
so each machine can index about ten
millions the images so that's the way
now we can scale up to the billions
level and for example you search bicycle
star with sound on the circle then you
continuously refine and by adding more
detail in the sketch and you can
actually end up with the really the the
bicycle image you want and you can
potentially actually come by sketchy
with keyword and you can type a cure and
tour something and to help you actually
for example when you search with a cine
opera this is the result for us but if
you want to really get very nice view of
this place then you provide some
additional sketch and for them of this
is starfish and you may first retrieve
some of the release only the star shape
but if you want to read really retrieve
starfish you can provide combined with
some of the text and you can really get
the the disabilities all you want
so this is very interactive very natural
and they would believe this can be a
very public proper a public very popular
app for kids and make fairies fun and to
really unlock their imagination and also
the creativity okay
so however you are all go to see this
demo in tomorrow's innovation day so let
me quickly cover the last shoe trend I
want to actually talk about and then
this afternoon another cap really talk
about Michael so is all in now in this
car I think in addition to the first
three very important direction when we
talk about car talk about software as a
service performance service in verse
structure a service and there another
new direction which really very
important is now the data the
information analogy will also become a
very important part of the service and
it's almost like the intelligence that
the analogy in the car that we can
provide to all the developer to be a new
type of app even the the app we want to
actually host in our search engine so I
think the idea really open this up for
ecosystem rather than compared to other
such company right now is really
completely focused system we want to
actually think about can we build
something similar to like a crew is
still very similar to App Store but is a
crystal let developer can write or even
provide knowledge in whatever way they
can provide to serve a particular query
and this query store or you can see the
bar it's more like a task and instead of
just one company building it would be
deep if we can actually provide this
infrastructure all the metadata
necessary all the data develop with me
and there may be really enable them to
very quickly
feel something that can fulfill
different tribal uses information need
and in theory we can have a media so
even billions of such ad and that
because searchable and discoverable and
the search engine can start to roll
intent to toss so this is one of them
overall I think the RAC seen that very
much ally with Microsoft's cloud
strategy and so as you can see here we M
aside this ecosystem and really leverage
the third party to help with us and we
also see we did this alive everywhere
with the trend now currently on Web
today
trend has the web has been as in look
back the history star is really
providing all the HTML web page right we
call this really topical the content and
the document and then we see where the
toward that ratio really become a
preference for people to really continue
state contact with each other update
each each each their friends their
latest status and other profiles and now
we see a lot of geospatial type of
service the places and also the map and
the next would be D for the web's really
moving into this providing media
environment for people to feel all kind
of ad and service really helping people
with tasks so that's reason now when we
look at the search today would be live
in 10 years search will be very very
different for how we see today so
because of the time limit I think this
is just some de a more detail now we
will instead of just look at the queue
itself now I think the search you will
provide a lot of other context to help
us to understand the intent and similar
to the analogy and also this is probably
the first step to start really building
a really useful personalized search
because potentially does a lot analogy
and even the tasks can be running
locally in a visual we can possibly
provide a crystal that actually captures
some that uses information locally
because they know they were every day
they want to keep track set an important
topic and they want to constantly
analyzing the web for
an important trend they want to continue
follow so this may be more sensitive
related to privacy information can be
wrong locally and so this is also one of
the direction so the codes really make
search actionable okay so by doing this
we have the opportunity now to really
start thinking about how we can
reorganize the web instead of just HTML
page now website and really about tasks
and and also bring use a coherent
seamless experience when they are using
different type of device whether or not
it's a PC forum or TV so to really
quickly concur and in Microsoft we are
actually trying to see what search is
moving to one the new direction the
potential disruption we can actually
look into because if we just simply
follow the current trend we will not be
able to live wrong and so here is a few
ideas and direction we are looking at
and so moving for organizing that just
simply focusing on all the information
and the end result and the link we want
to start directly
I mean directly address uses the
information in this video user century
innovating and if we can actually know
uses information in either you provide
answers or tasks but this really require
us to better deeply understand decreased
space and also extract knowledge from
the document and organize in the dark
knowledge in the web that can help us to
actually fulfill users information name
and instead of just searching content
now we organize the information at the
entity level and they're also providing
really a capability in the future to
search apps and services moving away
from keyword matching to understand in
hem using of course a lot of more
sophisticated technology such a major
language computing and looking to the
users context and history to help us and
that you serve user data and this is how
we move away from current
simply just research to a decision
engine and also currently the search you
have very much I think look at the index
of that the archive web means the page
already been there but the more and more
that what really become a present for a
lot of real-time data since like the
data from Twitter's I think that become
very important part of the web and the
search engine also need to be able to
handle this real-time data better and
really also it leverage in hardware and
really provide open ecosystem to help
help us to peel the next generation
search and it's this actually we also
believe it's very possible to disrupt
current advertising business because
currently they the search yes is very
much impression base and people see a
link they click and that a search engine
will charge with this deeply integrated
task potentially we can actually do
transaction based advertising because by
deeply understand user intent and the
really help use a complete but whatever
they are trying to do either is looking
at a cake after arranging a travel or
buying us a Prada and it's actually a
very natural less mile to really charge
user and this potentially can
revolutionize the current advertising
business as well and that was the car I
think today very much the search has
been focused on information car here but
social car the images of social data a
lot of signal we can potentially extract
to further improve our search
communication car in the diamond car
even the productivity car commerce car
so silly about the web is now really
very different from it was many many
many years ago and that there's a lot of
new opportunity we can actually look
into to move the search to the next
level okay so we slack I want to
conclude my talk here so here is a few
very important trends I hope this
information is useful for you to think
about the new message
in search because this really opened up
a lot of new problem today we don't even
have all the solution so I'm not today
I'm not good actually I'm not telling
you that we have done all the work but I
just want to present you a lot of new
opportunity that in the next decade
actually we can completely change what
search is and the really help you sir -
no find all the knowledge they need to
complete their task thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
