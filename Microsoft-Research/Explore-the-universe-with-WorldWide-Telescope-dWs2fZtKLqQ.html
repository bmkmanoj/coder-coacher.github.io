think important we'd bring together a
really really rich compelling data
environment from which you can bring
other data into it as well the ability
to visually represent the environment in
3d to be able to show that data over
time to bring in other data and look at
that in connected with other data
sources the rich imagery of universe the
data behind at the ability to
orchestrate these paths through this
environment to easily communicate
insight about it the other benefit of
having this integrated simulation of the
universe is that we could bring together
imagery and data into one place that
would allow both astronomers to look at
data sets that were not normally in
their domain but by bringing everything
together it makes it really easy to
compare and look at imagery of the sky
across multiple wavelengths and perhaps
even notice other things that they might
not normally look at so we use slowly
telescope in many contexts in our
research you need to see what large
regions of the sky look like at many
different wavelengths and you need to be
able to zoom in and out to many
different scales just seamlessly and
fluidly so that you don't lose track of
kind of where you're looking with
respect to the whole galaxy and I don't
know of any other tools that can do that
while bringing so much other data other
than the data that are on the screen
available to you all at once we
connected behind all these objects in
the sky links to deep information
sources so if I wanted to get for any
particular object what are all the
latest papers that are published about
this particular object we instantly do a
query to the Astrophysical database
bring up all the papers that were
related to that object so it makes that
really simple they put a layer
a very usable layer on top of all that
infrastructure so that you could finally
get to all that data in this very
obvious environment which is the context
of the sky so later this year in 2015
world wide telescope will be open sores
and that provides a tremendous
opportunity for both the astronomical
community and computer programming
community we will come together to add
functionality to worldwide telescope
that can serve many many more needs than
those of us here at Microsoft could even
imagine well I think worldwide telescope
in the hands of the astronomy community
has just limitless possibility because
there is no other system that lets you
see online astronomy information in such
an integrated beautiful seamless
environment the project is going to
discover that there is a huge community
of very good people who are very excited
about improving it extending it bringing
into into new application areas there's
a whole range of things the world wide
telescope does that our value and lots
of other domains so image timing would
be a good example I think people are
going to break it apart and put it back
together in ways that we can't possibly
predict world wide telescope puts the
whole universe in front of any person
who wants to take the time to explore it
and students love that power they dive
deeper they explore more there's so many
different ways to you know look at
different aspects of the universe and
then you can capture it we have a very
powerful authoring engine within
worldwide telescope to create what look
like highly produced documentaries but
it's easy to create as PowerPoint
they're interactive at any time so you
have the power of what video can do at
any point you see something interesting
you can pause you can explore that
particular object access to data beneath
it or you can look at what's around it
or you can see other tours that relate
to that object and then branch off and
go explore there
we're using worldwide telescope in lots
of different ways worldwide telescope is
really acting as a virtual telescope a
virtual Observatory so we can take all
the best images from all the world's
observatories stitch them together layer
them together and zoom in and around the
sky and that's really the way we
describe it to our visitors we're
letting them know you're looking at the
same software that research astronomers
use this is a real experience we're not
making up a movie we're giving you a
window to the universe the best
experience ever is putting worldwide
telescope in the hands of a kid or a
member of the public where they just
cannot believe that this is real
astronomy data from real telescopes with
really the best resolution we could ever
have and that there are all these
wavelengths that your eyes cannot see
and the just general disbelief that
people have that this exists is just
incredible I love how inspiring world
wide telescope is for learners when they
see certain visualizations and world
wide telescope you know it just pops at
them you the moons of jupiter there's no
jupiter has over 60 moons and that's a
number that a lot of people can memorize
but when you actually show them that
this is what all their orbits look like
it's this crazy tangled beehive mess you
everybody goes wow i think for myself
the thing that always was important to
me was the role of WPP and inspiring
people after i give a talk about
worldwide telescope i had a dad come up
to me and said you know I was using
world wide telescope with my little
five-year-old daughter and she was any
of my laughs and we were exploring this
supernova explosion in a in a galaxy
that was just about the Big Dipper and I
thought nothing of it you know and then
later on he said when I walked outside
my with my daughter and she was said
look at it she pointed up at the sky at
the big differences that's where the
supernova explosion okay that's what
this is really all about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
