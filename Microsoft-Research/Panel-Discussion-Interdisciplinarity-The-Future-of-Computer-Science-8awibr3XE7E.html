hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
yes good afternoon everybody so we have
just this afternoon we have just heard
four amazing like outstanding talks by
amazing outstanding speakers so and the
theme of the of the event is
interdisciplinarity in this
interdisciplinary search so without
further ado let me just let me just
invite all the speaker's here on the
only stage so you know Giants of our
field I can't say it differently so
please welcome professor Connor Tate dr.
Lampson profits popular meet you in
professor y'all
so I have to say something while well
people walk on stage so I was preparing
for this panel and I was thinking of a
title and then I was I was you know
thinking I'm very clever bye-bye
thinking of this now and
interdisciplinarity because when i when
i type this so the the word processor
actually said that this now does not
exist it's actually a typo apparently so
interdisciplinary exists but
interdisciplinarity apparently didn't
exist then I found myself very clever by
actually making this a noun by just you
know making it anyway and then just just
now I saw that Professor Yahoo's talk
also uses this noun so I feel that you
know we co-create it is ok ok so then
word is wrong yeah yeah okay so I have
just prepared a few questions that
should sort of start let us go and then
in the end we can also open up for the
for the audience to to ask additional
questions so I'd like to start with a
personal anecdote know about 10 years
ago I was meeting a very famous research
or someone I admire very much maybe in
the course of this discussion we will
find out who this is and so at that time
this person was was doing research on
sort of a condo economics meets computer
science algorithmic game theory and I
was asking you know why why did you
start to think about this and then his
answer of course sort of somewhat
tongue-in-cheek was to say well you know
I'm a computer scientist that was
thinking how can I win a Nobel price
then I was thinking you know economy
economics maybe biology maybe physics
you know economics is maybe the simplest
one so so now let's take this as a
starting point and let me ask you know
moving forward where do you think that
say you know computer scientists will be
the first where do you think that a
computer scientist will will win a Nobel
price for the first time in how long
will it take
imma get an herb Simon already through
your dad is true that is true second one
yeah I have a conjecture so you know in
my biology in medical science there are
often Nobel prizes given from
methodology for example the inventor of
the polymerase chain reaction has a
double play who got another price soon
afterwards you not very not very long
after we discovered actually so I think
that that that shotgun sequencing has
changed the way Jim janome genomics
works in a comparable a similar way and
I mean I haven't done it by maybe nobody
somebody should they should nominate
jean meyers I think allotted line I
think the Nobel Prize last year 14 in
chemistry 1 by computer type of work
modeling the protein formation folding I
think that that the person that that it
could have been a computer scientist who
does it because I think that that a
computer scientist is perfectly possible
to get working together with the
specialist to have that distinction I
think the main the main thing is that
computer scientists don't seem to have
the patience to work over 20 25 years
because I remember I met one of those
person in Stanford at that time I wanted
to do protein folding and so I went to
you too to see him and say that is there
anything interesting than one can do end
up but I found out as after talking to
him and others I got discouraged because
it's more messy it's not the kind of
question that we typically solve that
can be done in maybe a year or I'm
usually without the rifle but by fox red
line so so I think that for computer
scientist to win Nobel I think that they
have to be more dedicated to have more
conviction about what they are doing
like the traditional disciplines but
lots of not bells have been won by
fairly short-lived work pcr as an
example double helix is an example it
doesn't have to be the output of 20
years of concentrated labor on one
problem
well I I think it's more troublesome
than the computer science could bear if
you think about it wasn't the two
Outsiders they have to endure the
cheering and the hostility of other
people they think that they are get
flies and and and that they have to
think about the various tricky things
they have to they have to navigate so in
order to be a good sign is there to
clean skin I think we have to Muslim
Christian skin really really i don't
know but i think that it's true that you
have to in order to do that you know
what what and it told us some some very
interesting principles about what is
interdisciplinary work what he didn't
emphasize as much is is the amazingly
hard work that you have to do in order
to penetrate so we know the way of
thinking the a discipline that has been
on its feet for four centuries and
running and also the effort involved in
convincing these people that you're
worth our time as i think i think dr.
Lampson had on you know he had a lot of
these quotes on his slides and one of
them was i think by niels bohr saying
that science is about it I can't quote
it but science is about sort of finding
it a notation to be able to talk to each
other finding a way to talk yes yes and
then so that sort of relates to this so
I mean obviously the question I asked
was sort of let's say a more general one
in the sense that lights if you think
about Jeanette talk about computational
thinking all right so so we have seen
today throughout the day we have seen
many many examples of how say
computational thinking is influencing
other sciences right
many great success stories you know I
mean another question I am sort of
having is you know with where's the
limit of that I mean can we get can we
you know some time ago I was reading an
article that said that for certain let's
say low quality jobs like say you know
make the people work in McDonald's for
example they have now they want to
basically create algorithms that the
input to which is a CD the output days
is higher or no higher and apparently
that's supposed to be more efficient
than actually doing an interview and and
so you know Candace or is this a
computational way of thinking Candice
penetrate even beyond say biology
physics you know chemistry can it go
even I don't know 22 can be ever win a
nobel prize in literature or you know
well actually this bouncer maybe a
little bit different well I in my mind
computer science is probably or even
engineering is the only field which I
think has separated physical
manifestation or physical realization
method with what is done obstruction
basically or virtualization and in that
sense actually when it comes to Nobel
Prize its disadvantage because if you
say okay I got say my field perfect
intelligence machine now when we say it
it may be the box but we know what is
inside is not important it's not a box
but what is being represented by that
box whereas in that sense if AI perfect
machine is realized its impact is
probably as big as blue LEDs but blue
LED is here is the thing
at that you see ya and then so with that
in mind I don't think there's any limit
because as long as we have the world in
which the physical thing is a reality
has the problem to solve then we have to
represent it we have to obstruct it and
the essence of the solution is how how
the problem is represented and I think
they accept a few things which you have
to deal with the thing there are enough
of things and I I don't think I'm not at
least it for my life probably i don't
i'm not worried about things two things
to do yeah well let me put a more
optimistic a spin on it I actually think
that now that you you ask this question
I actually think that that that the time
is on our side I think that if you look
at the nobel prize in recent years in
say in physics or in chemistry and it
quite open awarded not to not not
because of the octave the the deep
theories but its its impact so for
example if you look at the the nobel
prize of charles car so for for the
fiber optics and i think that the the
the physics theory it's it's I mean it's
not it's not profound but I think it's
mostly because it's it's so relevant it
changed the world and if you also like
look at other prizes they are open about
magnetic resonance and and that have a
very great impact in recent
years or new material which which might
have future applications or the even
quantum information processing I think
three years ago the face of pride one of
the winner one of the winners is it's
it's is baby one for his work on a
quantum information processing
technology is the ion trap and and so so
I think that that computer science has
already transformed the world and I
think with all this new promise of
machine learning and I will not be
surprised that we are going to produce
some really fancy box as you put it has
the intelligence in it and I think they
might just give the prize to a box
Edison ventures sorry in your mind is
there any any year say feel that
computer science or computational
thinking has not yet touched that is
waiting to be touched by us
one field stands alone in my mind it has
been touched by by computer scientists
by Newton but so it's brain science
let's valiant has done some some amazing
work varies every there are a lot of
people who were computer scientists and
I'll doing brain science in the sense of
imaging data and so on I believe that
it's it's a number you know there is a
bed there is a probably less than
fifty-fifty bed that there could be some
very interesting theoretical ideas that
will be needed to make progress I me
know the the problem is how do it does
this bag of neurons create the mind okay
you know and there is there is some some
chance that but this needs some in some
interesting with multiple sites but even
short of creating the mind there are
much simpler things that curves
collections of neurons can deeply and we
don't really understand how they do them
it's such a small number of cycles
that's right yeah so so it's yeah I'm
you know you you read you read the
standard graduate textbook in
neuroscience and in the sort of you know
the conclusion of the last chapter it
says you saw you read it all we know
more and more and more and still we have
not even started thinking about what
what what overarching reality is I
remember 40 or 50 years ago Jerry
Feldman tried to sell me on
connectionism and he didn't succeed but
he said something to me that has stuck
with me for all that time which as he
said we know what the cycle time of the
nervous system is it's a small number of
milliseconds
and we also know that in half a second
humans and many other animals can
perform a considerable number fairly
complex perceptual tasks and we have no
idea how to program a computer to
perform those tasks in in the hundred
cycles that are available in the nervous
system never mind whether it would make
sense or be efficient or anything like
that we just don't know how to do it so
I guess I think there must be all kinds
of opportunities in this intersection
between between neuroscience and
computation and my belief is that hardly
any progress has been made so far so
Tokyo may have more more information you
know it's see it seems that that's
that's a field that sort of it's the
food of the future or every decade okay
so go ahead well the interdisciplinarity
I mean this is the discussion now I'm I
don't know whether I'm a computer
scientist actually probably not I'm I've
been working on the robotics from the
beginning and to me working in that
field I have to work with work with and
on different disciplines from the very
beginning and one of the indeed one of
the very somewhat cynical statement I
tend to do is when I'm invited in
computer science so-called computer
science conference as a keynote or
something I often shows the slides which
says I hate robotics is classified as
one of the application areas of computer
science and in my mind it's opposite
robotics is one of the one of the tools
one of the application of robotics is
indeed computer science to me and then
one the way I say it is the world is
physical we are physical being and we
can't live by eating bits we eat
physical things we eat food and live in
physical so so dealing with physical
thing is indeed the core of almost
everything in my mind now as I said
before computer science that the one of
the greatest thing which is somewhat
separate the physical realization with
algorithm or whatever you call we call
and and that's the reason why I think
computer science is though so dominant
and we are because we are not limited by
the particular realization of the
computing yeah so so anyway because of
that I think from my point of view
things like physical science physical
things physical reality Internet of
Things and those things of natural
things and that's that's obvious the
direction that computer science has to
deal with more physical more real more
real world and that's the source of the
problems this is actually great
transition because because you know when
there's an interdisciplinarity there
also has to be a known
interdisciplinarity somehow and i was
thinking i think professor rosenblum or
someone has in his speech today talked
about the fear of becoming a mere sort
of service discipline for others and so
i want to ask you know is if if say more
and more like a larger and larger
fraction of computer science let's say
is dealing with physical or literal it
is primarily dealing with physical part
is that i'm primarily dealing with other
sciences to what extent should we have
such a fear you know i was i was joking
before you know my my i did my PhD in
computer science so I have a PhD in
computer science in 50 years from now
will anyone know what that is or or
people just study whatever biology or
and other fields and and computer
science just becomes a 0 and a set of
tools well we have a worked example at
several centuries old which is
mathematics and Bell wrote a book 50 or
60 years ago the title of which was
mathematics Queen and servant of science
well if we become the new mathematic
that's not too bad so I don't complain
just what I'm thinking but will we why
not if you believed in or we are yes if
you believe genet we certainly will I I
don't like to become a servant for other
other disciplines I think that that the
answer to your question is not
preordained I think it depends on a lot
on what computer scientists lemme we
decide to do I think that that that if
we have this conception that let's not
touch the other areas and we just tell
them what we know about computers and
let them work out that all the
applications then I think that will
eventually become I think it's worse
than a servant it's it's you know it's
it's marginalized to a degree that
essentially you will be it's just like
plane geometry that so my own preference
is that we actively promote the creation
of a greater computer science in the
sense that in computer science I think
that is sort of like Carnegie Mellon
school
resigned that that that we would
actively we would expand the computer
science department so that we have
people who are actually working with a
very heavy knowledge in other
disciplines and so we'll have our own
computational biologists who are
actually could be biologists training
and we have the physicists we have the
economists so I think in this fashion
computer science will forever be a
active participant and growing with all
these other disciplines I mean it's not
going to to to eliminate i I don't I
don't claim that we want to eliminate or
the other discipline I'm just saying
that let's have a method we need them
otherwise we'll be able to be
acessórios oh right yeah so that will
be my proposal and and and I one
obstacle is that I don't know how this
would be viewed in a typical university
because you are I think could be action
Kevin pushing it too hard I think that
that's that's why I actually thought he
China there's a chance to realize this
vision because I think that exactly
because the core disciplines are not
already so strong that that they have a
very strong ego that that it is possible
to push for this but I think that that
is going to be very hard so probably
going to repeat what Andy said except
start from there and amino I I think I
think that I AAS is an amazing example
of computer science placing itself at
the center at the geometric center of
the University okay so you know where
another center of courses of the
scientific discourse and I believe that
this is this is what should happen
everywhere in some sense you know
mathematics is are the intellectual
Center than
all universities because it has all
these all you know it because it has all
these tentacles teaching teaching
mathematics mathematics in this sense
you are becoming the new queen and
servant of science incidentally what I
think of servant I think of an old film
another amazing film that i recommend by
dirk bogarde which were servant means
somebody who radically transforms the
master by dint of being powerful and
necessary so so this this kind of serve
under you know although he probably so
and and I think in the United States
what we are seeing is that a lot of kids
a lot of other graduates want to study
you know one study computer science for
example in berkeley about one-third of
the 6,000 undergraduate that we have
every year take the introductory
computer science course and it's not
because they want they have the ambition
cam computer scientist is but because
they think that this is what they should
do jeanette mentioned that in hard
Harvard the most part of the most
popular course these days is not
economics introduction but the computer
science introduction so this a sea
change I mean oh it means that I me know
even if we don't want to place ourselves
at the center it the kids are placing us
I me know the customers are placing us
but the point is that I totally agree
with Thomas that it is very precarious
very risky it's not an easy task okay
that that while while being very
imperialistic and ambitious we should
also take good care of our core okay
because
you know but that the Corps exists it's
there you know our core values are
called concepts are core abstractions or
even know it's there and it's expanding
also okay so you know so so we should
also we should also and you know the
same OCC to twitch which and it was was
kind to mention is very conscious that
we have to offer our hand to other
disciplines but also with the same hand
support support the core the core
discipline this reminds me of Professor
yowls you know diagram you know the
initially diverted to to you know this
Venn diagram that is moving together
where now the course start to overlap
and I'm thinking of a third diagram
right where basically the one core is
included in the other or it just
disappears and then and then you know so
so let me let me turn this observation
into a question so I guess um what is
then the core I mean what like let's say
let's say historically I mean
simplifying a lot of course but
historically you could say that
initially said the core of computer
science to some extent was to try and
make computers work to be useful
increasing scale efficiency and so on
and and developing the theory the
algorithms and then you know theory
necessary to understand and reason about
these things but moving forward if if
say if say let's say more and more of
the key attraction of computer science
is to you know in like the
interdisciplinary nature of it then what
what of the core of computer science is
it still worthwhile really going deeper
and and really investing you know six
years of your life to do a PhD in and
expanding I think it will happen
naturally because people are different
there are people who are really
interested in some problems which have
very little to do with other disciplines
and it's just that for example there are
still people who work on complexity
questions saying that why why is he not
equal to NP and it is derivative I think
we should we should leave room for that
and and and basically I think that only
by having a very large ability to do
interdisciplinary work can we afford to
nurture our core value and and because
that's where the resource to justify
what we are doing and also I think that
that one of the things that that it's
it's a little bit so it there's this
phenomena that that because in computer
science we at least it means the area
computer sign we tend to work on too
many publish too many papers and so as
soon as we have done the easier problems
we cut often we try to move on to new
pastures and and now the heart problems
we just left behind and I think we have
a lot a lot of very exciting interesting
open problems on the step and let me
just mention one that everybody can can
sympathize with namely that at one point
say 30 years ago or 20 years ago I
thought that the theory of data
structure is the thing for the future is
going to be as interesting and even as
pretty as any mathematical field namely
that what's the best data structure
between some problem but it turns out to
be so hard that I think that by now very
few people actually have the courage to
attach such province it doesn't mean
that that
that you know that I I would love to see
many of my favorite urgency boobed Arjun
never gave up yeah so I think that that
if we structure our field in a nice way
and so that people who work on core
problems don't you let that if we have a
reward system such that would let us let
us keep our core instead of having this
fight which a number of years ago they
were ordered the fundamentalist against
the interdisciplinary and and and i
think that's it was a stupid fight and i
think we can and it is it enough room
for everyone to do and people should be
should be recognized place on their
contributions I think it's just the same
way to say that one it seems to me that
the core of computer science is dealing
with complexity there is an unlimited
amount of complexity complex engineering
that will do oh yes exactly and we're
not going to run short of complexity to
do you deal with any time soon and you
can find it in a lot of different places
speaking about complexity both both both
Matt and I dimension dimension
complexity so let me so there is a let's
take the p % me problem on your which we
which epitomizes complexity I think that
to doing that disciplinary work first of
all you have to be recognized as a
science okay and that's you know in
other words other sciences don't tell
you go away okay so no you're not
discipline okay so when I started
working in computer science when all of
us you know started working on computer
science this was not a given absolutely
it was it's not a big problem now X
precise time you know so if we ask why
is that okay there are three reasons
I can see okay one is that they watch
the solver amazing engineering problems
okay for real I'm speaking of designing
databases okay sort of you know
compilers you know so these are there
are a few amazing amazing engineering
successors okay that's one number two
and you can assign weight is the pivots
NP problem okay in other words computer
science is one of these disciplines from
which fine human questions of my human
interest come come oh ok so and we have
promised that are too hard for
mathematician person for example yeah me
or you know that also will stay with was
there you know of course I me know if an
amazing question comes up and then it's
immediately scores yes it's forgotten
right but but but we would say around
the third thing that put us that brought
us rage made us made us made us giant
from other giant disciplines was the
internet okay so I know that that that
the internet wherever it came from has
has brought computer science to the
people in other words now the whole
world is our subject okay so you know so
so and as a result we cannot be ignored
okay so all these things all right i
mean oh you know make us all so we
realized that this is a scary situation
you know it's precarious what what
Thomas asked to worry in 50 years people
know what what what computer science was
and we have to look at the other two at
the course or we know the engineering
course or you know the mathematical
intellectual call and that's where you
know that's who without a core we are
another right when I said complexity I
didn't just mean particular application
could only understand me no computer
science is about taming complexity so
you know all of its aspects
specifically the science totally totally
got Medusa I'm sure you did but I wasn't
sure that everyone in the audience did
sure why not including artificial
intelligence it is indeed that topmost
complexity of everything supposedly
Marvin Minsky said many years years ago
when he was asked what is going to
happen with robots aren't they going to
threaten all our jobs and so forth
supposedly he said yes robots will
inherit the earth but there will be our
children it's we're thinking it over but
I think there's another argument for
that computer science will survive but
isn't in a different set that that that
I have gotten into contact with quantum
physicists over the last few years and
and and so the quanta information theory
actually it's a fairly integrated
community and I found out actually the
oldest concept that we cherish including
some of the very deep end and recent
world I think the physicists have
learned it I think they I think it's
incredible that I believe that they have
learned everything that the computer
sign the Iranian computer scientists
have come up about quantum computation
and I think that they have learned all
away and they have exceeded us so so and
in addition they have the added
advantage in that they have a lot of
things that they know that we do not
know about they like many body
physically and so on so so I think that
even if the Darrell computer science
they complete this quantum branch if it
demises
and disappeared it will live kind of is
like in the yard I think what is this
the mitochondria and so I think it's
supposed I think we are happy for that
because it means that other people also
appreciate the concept that we come up
with it's also make me a bit worried
that that what if every discipline they
really get their acts together for
example the brain scientist or the
biologist they have found out that it's
indispensable for the interview with
large database and then and that they
have to do deep learning and so on and
that they are some you know some really
visionary biology so on they say that
let's just have a part of us that
actually is if they have to study
computer science yet actually just
combining with the biology training and
then and let's let's let's work on
computational biology is from the
biologists point of view and what if
every discipline does this I mean the
astrophysics they they they deal with
their their simulation and they design
the best data structure that should be
computer scientists have learned about
and I don't think he's totally out of
the question I think that that is
certainly conceivable that that but that
it turns out to be advantages instead of
computer science would supply the
intellectual capital to all the others
every one of them just find them it
turns out that is better with them not
to burn the computer that they have to
develop their own and and and so when
I'm saying this I'm this is sort of
independent and he's partially
independent from what we do that is if
you look at the physics of this is it
inevitable I mean just just from the
point of view of better researchers are
that we have to be
this is conceivable life I would say
it's possible if I were a biologist or a
evolutionary biologist I will try to get
my students to learn about what they
saying that well there's a tremendous
opportunity and way yes biologists we we
are one step ahead of them because we
know what that so computer son in
computer science that i'm not sure i
think the basic concept computer science
can be covered in just a few years maybe
two years or at most three years so so i
think there's a there's a thing you're
doing if I think about seriously I
cannot sleep
if I seriously think about it I will not
be able to fall asleep about the demise
dis in Burma hopefully computers us well
that's just joking I'm my Sarge optimist
I think I should change the topic in
order to not cause insomnia with good so
so okay so we've discussed let's say
what we so bluntly ok so we've discussed
what we can do to others what we are
ourselves let's ask what others can do
to us or what others have done to us ok
so so I guess we briefly had a
discussion before and then we said ok
maybe maybe computer science is somehow
coming from math and physics and
engineering these are say the three say
strongest influences that we have seen
other other like do you see other let's
say methodologies or ways to approach
problems or something that that we see
in other sciences that could actually be
very let's say fruitful in computer
science so we have we have heard about
rhetoric today you know that one I mean
it's a simple thing that that Andy Andy
talked about economics with with you
know within the global information
environment in some sense every system
design is also economic system design
you know Butler have to talk about time
to market
so and in other words every algorithm
that runs must solicit its inputs from
agents who would lie and sometimes its
gates agents who have you know so you
know in the way that that that time to
describe so incentives is paramount okay
you know when you have systems that
evolved from concern you know with a
return on my design then them incentives
are important and economics is the
science of scarcity incentives issue but
that's one go ahead Jeanette
human-computer interaction requires some
sensitivity to design which is not
really a science as I think all of us
would consider so there are even softer
areas of human endeavor that I think
influence computer science because
before one thing I learned from them is
the meaning of users we off I was I was
doing quality of life technology to help
people who need some hopefully we can
provide help for independent living and
computer scientist or a roboticist we
tend to say okay users and we say Oh
users want this on that and when we
began to talk with them they don't like
he told users because like all the
people who have visual you know
impairment and then we tend to think oh
this and that and then we give certain
small scenario or even
not visually impaired people and masks
and then see what we can do and they
said no no that's not you may be dealing
with the users but you're not really
doing with people and that there's a big
difference and at least I learned how to
deal how to do how to do a little better
job in dealing with so-called users so
so that that's one thing I thought I
learned right there only two industries
that call their customers users and
unfortunately we are one of them bit
better than the other one so I guess I
guess we we can open up to the floor
briefly but I have one last question
before we run out of time so to a new
student who can decide to either study
computer science and become
interdisciplinary by also studying
something else or studying something
else studying physics biology and you
know learning whatever he needs on the
fly what would you do and secondly what
will what will a computer scientist to
win 20 30 year 2030 or twenty twenty or
twenty ten or you can choose maybe a
quick answer and then we can have more
questions from the quiz transition for
me is that the last ten years when when
my advice you know have we here you know
I advise probably several dozen students
at Burghley computer scientists when
they ask me professor what should where
should i take i mean oh should i take
the second of the third theory course
insulative I I tell them take
linguistics take business learn
economics psychology okay so so in other
words I think that that we should we
should you know we should broaden a lot
you know it's a new courage of our
students to because because the world is
ours are such a subject of scientific
subject now for many years I've tried to
totally unsuccessfully tried to persuade
my academic colleagues that they should
not admit into a ph.d program in
computer science anyone who has taken an
undergraduate degree in computer science
undergraduates should study classics or
mathematics or physics or history or
something with more weight to it than
computing just not the computing is bad
but it doesn't have doesn't have enough
another way of saying this is I think
you can get a very good undergraduate
education majoring in computer science
but it's too easy much too easy to get
an education that's much too narrow and
doesn't have enough long-term value and
that's something that I think you
students really have to watch out for i
partly agree with that we your bodies
often we say the computer scientist pure
not as useful we tend to say because
sorry about this we say oh because they
don't know what the world is moving
round physics and we like people who as
battle is said have some little bit
different more physics oriented
background and then on top of it half
computation line now having said that in
computer science I think producing
interdisciplinary turrent does not
necessarily mean to me to teach other
other disciplines within computer
science I think we what we need is to
people who have the mindset to work with
other people what does that mean I think
computer science is a very special field
in the sense that if we
minimize it to say programming okay
learn how to program itself is not
useful because it has to be applied to
some problem which has which maybe
change from time to time so in order to
make it you cannot be expert for
everything but the problem is the
mindset of being able to talk to the
particular field and then work with them
and so I think that's what it means
interdisciplinary education that's there
will be different from very deep
research who has to be you for which you
have to be 50 50 or even 100 hundred
experts of good business and the you
know the field I think we have too
little bit separate undergraduate
educational aspect of interdisciplinary
and research aspect of interdisciplinary
by my view is that I think we should be
agnostic in terms of how to educate
students I think that we should offer
all kinds of options the student that
they want they can be narrowly educated
and if they want there is a possibility
for them to to acquire a very broad even
covering both humanity and signs I think
that if we have a good structure so that
the student can get advice from people
who know them well for example if every
student has a advisor in college so that
they get to know better and and and try
to give advice the best they can I think
that over the long run you know people
choose different options and you will
become clear what would be the most
expected outcome and I think that that
we should keep we should just give
infinite amount of freedom and see how
it work
narrow and deep is fine narrow and
shallow is not so good well but they're
going to be that's what I worry I don't
worry about I think they are going to be
punished in life yes but a lot of harm
will be done first it's their choice you
know it's it's am now we're back to
evolution so okay so I think we maybe
have time for a few questions like one
or two and then we remove to the next
there's a question in the back I'm a I'm
a roboticist my most of my work is
algorithmic I have degrees in the
electrical engineering and applied math
but I teach in the mechanical
engineering department and when I hear
the sentiment expressed throughout the
day about about you know the concern
about Kent computer science survive or
are we becoming a subservient discipline
to other disciplines I'm just amazed in
my mind is bobbled um someone mechanical
engineering colleagues also worried when
they were when they work with doctors
that maybe were just becoming
technicians to these these medical types
and we're not getting a proper credit
that they deserve so I think that
concern is really misplaced I wonder if
the real the root of that concern is
maybe has to do with education
specifically enrollment numbers I mean
this is probably not the problem at
Berkeley or CMU or Stanford but many
computer science undergraduate programs
from I understand the enrollments are
declining and in some sense that's
expected because you know students
companies want not people who have
operating systems expertise but somebody
who's computer savvy can program and
have domain knowledge so I wonder if you
can maybe address that point
he's programming system operating system
wow I don't think computer science
enrollments are declining right where we
know you you claim the computer science
at all events are declining at somewhere
somewhere in China they are well other
parts of the world for example Korea
where I'm from because we also have the
discipline of software engineering in
China so if you add them up together
maybe it's a different picture ok we
have a last quick question and then we
have to move on hi my name is thousand
one from national team hall university
in Taiwan so there's another common way
to divide this plan for small thinking
people in terms of theoretical versus
apply so theory versus application and
the that kind of a distinguishing since
you had to to say something about
interdisciplinarity so just once you
hear about your perspective on this kind
of divine
I always thought that this this condo a
distinction between theory and
application is is over emphasized in
computer science let me know if you got
an electrical engineering department or
or or a mathematics the or Arab
mechanical engineering department and
you ask where is the theory group they
would not know whether we are talking
about okay you know that they're
engineers and some of them work on
whiteboards and some of them work in
labs ok we know but but but there is
much more unity I me know and i think
there is much more doing in the united
states and we want to admit ok they're
very solid in computer science then we
go to admit having said that so you know
it's i believe that that that both
people who do who you know whiteboard
people and people love people can do
it's very productive in the
interdisciplinary work you know and you
know in different modes of course and in
different capacities but but in my as i
can see it so we know that there are
opportunities for both I me know that
the brain science example that I used
right now only applied people are doing
or not doing this kind of
interdisciplinary world
or alright so um we're out of time
actually it so and so thank you very
much to all the panelists has been
really a pleasure and an honor and thank
you everything each year microsoft
