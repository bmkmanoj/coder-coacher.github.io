you
like I said I'm Tyler furtwängler I'm
one of the developers of tapped attune
the mobile game and I'll go ahead and go
through some of the features of it if
you haven't heard of it yet but this
talk is about in-app purchase and how
you can sort of design your app around
in-app purchase and different design
considerations that we sort of went
through when we made our application
there's there's a lot of them so
hopefully it's informative to all of you
guys as well so I work on tattooed my
three brothers it's a game that sort of
started as a hobby for the four of us
two years ago and we've been updating
this game pretty regulator that he ever
since then and it's not our full-time
job though I work actually over in
office on the SharePoint team and two of
my other brothers are x microsoft
employees as well so you know it's just
a hobby but it's a fun one things were
going talk about today we're basically
going to go over what tap titude is for
those that don't know what it is we're
going to also discuss different
monetization strategies like a free game
versus a paid game different design
choices you might want to make around
that and then also some examples and
then we'll follow up with questions if
you guys have any questions throughout
just raise your hand try to get thrown
you can do it as we go all right so what
is tap titude like i said two years ago
we started making this game and to be
honest it was it was kind of crappy it
ha you know we released the game sort of
with the idea that we're going to
continually evolve to attitude to be
sort of the one-stop shop for all your
different gaming needs and when we were
first released it i think we had ten
minigames in it and it was they were
very very basic and you know the you I
wasn't quite right and things weren't
perfect but we had the goal in mind that
we're going to update it every single
week and we've helped pretty true to
that or maybe at like two weeks now
update intervals but we started out with
maybe 10 mini games like I said and over
the course of the two years we're now up
to I think 80 MIDI games and maybe more
now and tons of different upgrades and
different things within it so i'll go
ahead and demo tap titude so we can sort
of get through it let me switch it over
here we go should be good all right so
this is tap to the first thing you'll
notice is uh well we got an ad up at the
top it's actually a house at interesting
we do have ads in this game and it's the
majority of our money actually comes to
our ad still now I sort of get to why
that is later on but I'll just demo the
game so here's our main menu you can see
we have a store if you go into their
different things you can buy I'll go
over each one of these in-depth sort of
once we talk about why we why we chose
them but for now there's a store so you
go into play and what we made was a
tiered based system where you need to
unlock all the different games that are
available you scroll down you can see
here they start becoming locked we have
I think 80 games overall and that
includes a bunch of what we call retired
games two games that we thought aren't
really up to par anymore now that we've
sort of introduced new ones so we move
them over to the retired sector oops but
all of these different games are all
unique and we made each one of them sort
of as we went over the last two years
each week or each month we might
introduce a new game and then we go and
update that app with new content for
that game and sort of move on and we did
this we did it in this way instead of
making each one is a you new game for a
lot of different reasons but it's helped
out a lot over the past just because we
only have to maintain that one game we
don't have to go and update Bali madness
here on all the different platforms we
can just go update at once and push it
out to all the platforms I'm one I'm one
app so I'll give you an example of sort
of how you play one hears Bali madness I
don't have ever played the game peggle
but it's very similar slide this thing
aim and you can shoot bounces off blah
blah blah gives you some stuff and calls
it good now what we built into it from
the very beginning even was an upgrade
system that was pretty rich where every
game you can buy a whole bunch of
different upgrades in it and it's all
earnable you know like what I just did
there got me some coins and the coins
can go through and you can buy things
with them here you see here's upgrade
called double ball and explosion click
on them you can go buy it with the coins
which I don't have enough of or you can
buy it with these credits
and that's where the in-app purchase
comes in every single thing from the
very beginning even before in-app
purchase was had this system where you
can you can purchase the then with
correct with earnable coins and only
recently we were able to actually go and
allow you to buy them with credits so
here's where you can go and spend your
credits and actually purchase that but
we also have a whole bunch of stuff that
don't even influenced the games dynamic
but just make it kind of fun like this
here's a Santa hat you can put out them
I'm gonna cost a credit not a big deal
and then we also have leaderboards for
each one of these games we can go
through and see what the top scores are
in this game you can also go back in and
back-end is actually we started it out
it's a good question we started out
running it from some dudes apartment we
call it some dude's apartment where it
was just a box underneath some guys desk
and it happened to run you know sequel
and ahead some web services that we
wrote and hacked together most of my
brothers when we started this the we did
they didn't have a lot of server
experience so they wrote it you know we
all work on different things so it's not
the bet it wasn't the best designed
since then though we've actually moved
on to see collage or in Windows Azure
and so now we're a little bit more
scalable and we feel a lot better about
not having to worry about him
accidentally flipping a switch and have
our services go down and we've had
really good experience with widths
equalizer in Windows Azure basically we
just took our existing thing that was
under some guys desk and we just said
published and it went up there and
everything everything went well we also
stats we keep track of a whole bunch of
stuff inside at aptitude simple things
like how much time have you played and
tap titude all the way to like really
really granular things like how many
fish have you collected in our fish
feeding game and each one of those
actually if you go in there's a
leaderboard for all of them so here's
Bali madnesses play time which shows you
how many like I said see flasher is
great no so here's how much time people
have spent inside of this particular
minigame so he can say see that this guy
named tib Tibbs has spent 10 full days
just inside at aptitude playing this one
game so you can see that you know summer
games are get a lot of users a lot of
playtime and other games not so much and
we sort of use that information to judge
which one's go into the retired section
so that we can
keep the ones that are interesting
towards the top basically any questions
on just general tap titude or you guys
pretty good on that alright so that's
tap titude
there we go the size of a package so we
actually reuse as much as we can because
we want to maintain underneath the
over-the-air limit for downloads which i
think is actually pretty big now on
Windows Phone it might give like 50
megabytes I think our windows phone
version ships around seven megabytes and
then our wish upon all the other
platforms and because we're using mono
game in mono it goes up to 50 megabytes
I think on iOS so it's really close to
that limit on iOS you have updates for
the update so I believe and this is sort
of a Windows Phone question that not
sure if I think if the redounded
redownload the entire package we only
changed like a few core components
within it each time so so they probably
there could be some optimizations around
just downloading the 3d levels we change
versus you know all the content that
came with it you'll see that little like
here we have all these game icons that
scroll down all the way across and we do
try to reuse them to try to keep our
package sizes so small so like here we
really just have a single image plus all
of our game icons and we kind of threw
that into a game called mahjong you know
classic mahjong so we don't actually
have like the unique tiles like some
games would for this game but we use our
own in game art assets to reproduce
another game
alright so that's two aptitude next we
talk about is a free versus paid one of
the things that we we struggled with a
lot was happy make money off of this you
know it's sort of our hobby to begin
with and we weren't expecting to make a
lot of money we didn't plan anything
really from the beginning we just want
to have fun and make a fun game but as
soon as we started spending a little bit
more time on it we were thinking well
how can we how could start to make money
on this the very first thing is to make
a free game or to make a paid game we
actually released aptitude to start with
a paid game I think was a 99-cent game
if I remember correctly and that one
didn't turn out very well we had we had
a trial on the game so people could go
in and get the trial we just didn't see
a high download counts really and even
those that did download it didn't always
translate to a purchase of the game so
it's hard to sort of justify how much
money were making on it so we quickly
switched over from a paid game to a free
game and then we saw dramatically
dramatically large download or like
increase in downloads just from
switching to a free game and there's a
lot of reasons for that I think I think
paid games aren't to be like discounted
in that you shouldn't do a paid game or
a paid app I just think that you got to
think about how how the users are really
going to use your app or how like
knishes your market that you're working
in I think paid apps work really well if
you have something that maybe isn't out
on the market yet or you're the only one
providing it or even like you're the
best in some area people are willing to
pay for that type of thing but it's hard
to spread that around because people
tend to gloss over the the paid section
and what we notice this is even hard to
spread it by word of mouth like you're
in on a bus or something you hand
somebody of cards as hey download my
game and they go look at it pop up their
phone cost 299 they're not going to
think twice not going to go get it
because you told them to so it's a lot
harder to tell people to go get your
game when it's paid the upside is of
that is that you get the money up front
and you know pretty much after somebody
is paid for if you get enough downloads
you're making pretty good money if you
can continue up you know a good pace of
downloads on a paid app free games on
the other side are really good at
getting downloads like you can spread it
really easily you can do t-shirts i
guess you can also do like the the
tags you know different RFID tags or the
visual tags or whatever other things
hand somebody a card in the bus go tell
them to get it and that actually works
out pretty well we actually did flyers
at the very beginning spread it around
all the Microsoft buildings I don't know
how much that helped but anyways once
you get the users you need to be able to
monetize on them so you kind of have to
go a different route and so we did the a
drought and IEP fits in there as well
and it doesn't mean exclusively to use
IEP and a free gap it just tends to work
better because in a paid app you know
you're going to already have money from
a user they're going to feel kind of
like I already paid for this I'm not
gonna go buy more content unless it's
something like a comic book app or
things like that so everything we say
here is sort of our experience and it
may not fit into every app category you
know I can think of a lot of ones where
paper content inside of a paid app might
make sounds like a comic book so yep
yeah for me dejan free the users is
already paid
oh no I'm we had so few of them I don't
know how many could have angered but
they uh we it became a free app and I
think we I think we actually released a
separate app that was free so we started
to maintain the old paid one for a while
but we weren't seeing large amount of
downloads we weren't continually seen
downloads we ended up just taking it off
the market place altogether and then we
released a free version and another
thing about the when we experience we
had with free versus paid is when we did
switch to free we sort of tried to start
off and flood the market a little bit
and that we have a ton of games as you
saw and so we would release different
packs you know like Tier one would
become a pack of a game and that became
a separate game in the marketplace we do
that every once in a while it turns out
we think that that actually hurt us more
than it helped and that it spread out
our user accounts across all these
different apps and now we have reviews
for you know some tier one game that
weren't in our main game so it doesn't
look quite as nice as well as our
download counselor just spread out
across all these different apps so when
we finally condensed down to that one
final tap titude unlimited app that we
have today we saw that it like increase
the user accounts a lot more and we got
better reviews and we could focus on one
thing so the other thing to think about
what the free apps though is that we use
ads but the amount of money you can make
from a single user and ads is actually
pretty low like we we are lucky to get
maybe 20 25 cents twenty cents off of a
user for the lifetime of the application
and that isn't to say that we don't make
more than that off of particular users
like they saw the guy who spent 10 days
in a wrap he's making this more than a
dollar but the average user maybe 20 25
cents so you kind of want to supplement
that with maybe an in-app purchase or
two and so a single in-app purchase can
actually be you know equal to a lot of
free users time if you do the quick math
it's like something like we get 25 cents
for every thousand ads that we show
right we can only show an ad every 30
seconds so that's going to take 4,000 ad
impressions or 2000 minutes of time to
make a single dollar inside of tap
titude right
and so 2000 minutes is a lot of time if
we if we have a bunch of people playing
our game 4 30 minute periods it's like
60 users we would need just to make a
dollar and that's pretty significant but
there is a little bit of a sort of a
alternate side which is that it's
reoccurring and that like you saw our
big users spend 10 days or even more
inside at aptitude and so those guys
over the course of a lifetime might give
us a lot more than that but in that
purchases can do the same thing and so
we also incorporated those and so there
we go one thing we want to sort of talk
about is we have never tried to make
tapped it would be sort of restrictive
by using an app purchase and I think
that it's a bad bad practice at least
for our type of an app to try to do that
so we want to really enhance the
gameplay and not restrict it in any way
you know to frequently i downloaded game
that says it's free and it's like two
seconds into the game wants me to spend
a dollar on something it's like it's not
really a free game if the first thing
you have to do is buy something so we
make it so that everyone can earn pretty
much everything in tap titude there's a
few things you have to pay for like
removing the ads but pretty much
everything else is earnable and so it's
like we use let's do we use the time
that the user needs to spend earn things
to make money from ads but then those
who don't want to spend the time to make
things they'll go and buy it with in-app
purchase and so it sort of you get the
best of both worlds by doing that and
then see here the other thing about
excuse me enhancing it by making them
earn it and also providing the ability
to purchase it is that they can sort of
feel like they earn things and have
something to do all the time and if you
a lot mate excuse me forced them to earn
it then they're gonna feel much more
likely to go and purchase it so they
don't waste their time now waste but you
know they want to get to the next level
then they're going to go and purchase
something to make it quicker a few
different things we use to enhance our
game and make it a little bit more fun
is customization options are great in a
nap or in games people love to show off
you know like oh I'm the best look at me
you know and solo go out and buy
specific leaderboard effects or by icon
to make them stand out from everyone
else and they don't actually impact the
gameplay in any significant way right so
these things are really good to allow
those power users to show off you can
also improve the gameplay by removing
ads which is something that tap titude
actually does do the only problem with
that is that you can sort of need to
think about how your game is gonna be
played and so go back here so in our
game and we have a lot of different
options for purchases you know not a lot
but we have a few different options we
have started back and taps do Gold's
actually the one that will remove the
ads from the game if we price it at
about 2 99 so it's kind of expensive
it's not super cheap and the reason why
we put it up so high like it's now 99
cent purchase is that our power users
are really the ones that are making a
lot of our money and those are the ones
that are going to be also purchasing the
testitude gold and so you gotta sort of
find the level of where where do you
think your users are going to buy it and
then how do you make it so it's worth it
our average user like I said twenty
cents per user so if we can get them to
buy even a 99-cent thing we're doing way
better than we could uh nads but not
everyone's going to buy anything and not
everyone's going to be removing the ads
so it's one of the options you can do is
to remove the ads or to do other things
we actually included a lot more into
have to do gold which I'll show you in a
bit right here
alright so this is windows phone talk
about Windows Phone in-app purchase
in-app purchase and windows phone is
actually pretty unique they added a
couple things that other platforms don't
have which I really we adapted really
enjoyed one of which is key words on a
few guys I don't know who all here is
familiar with in-app purchase but they
actually added a few things that the
other platforms don't have like keywords
and a tag field the keywords are really
useful for if you want to say you saw
the in-app purchase we have coins and
credits and tax due gold all these other
things you can sort of tag those in-app
purchase things with keywords and say
this one gives you coins this one gives
you a hat and this one gives you coins
and a hat and then when you go to query
your in-app purchase using their api's
you can say give me all the ones that
have keyword coins so it's actually
pretty useful to have keywords into the
tag blob which is unique to Windows
Phone you can store any arbitrary field
or any data you want in there and int
aptitude we saw a full-on JSON data and
this data contains exactly what you get
for that reward so we call it you know
starter pack actually is a great example
of that switchin can take you on so
starter pack here gives you a whole
bunch of stuff you if you click into it
it's a free in app purchase that gives
you just some coins gives you a shovel
it gives you a mega drill a bunch of
stuff you can use with int aptitude and
all of that data is actually stored as
in that tag blob of JSON so that when
our client goes to pick out the in-app
purchases it doesn't know exactly what
each individual item is it just says hey
whatever it is this is the rewards that
are within it in addition you can store
other information like is this thing on
sale or what icon to use and we end up
using that over here you can see tapped
into gold says it's on sale that little
flag next to it so we store a bunch of
information inside of this tag
unfortunately the other platforms don't
support that so it's not on it's not
exactly the same thing on all platforms
but really useful stuff on what you
doing that and then lastly I want to
talk about is window or tab titude is
actually a windows phone 7 application
it's built on XNA to Windows Phone 7
application so I don't know if anybody
else out there has a windows phone
an application or is building one or
wants to support the old devices but you
can't do in app purchase on the old
devices and so there's actually kind of
a tricky thing we have to do in order to
ship a windows phone 7 application that
accesses windows phone 8 features it's
kind of a weird thing if you want to
know more about that let me know we
actually have an msdn article on a
channel 9 video talking specifically
about that point sort of how to light up
the the windows phone 8 experiences
using windows phone seven applications
and it's got code sample you can
download and other things but we end up
having to use reflection in two on two a
windows phone 8 dll inside of our
wondrous 17 app so it's kind of
interesting we are also cross platform
and let me switch back over we ship on
all of the major platforms we ship on
Windows Phone 7 Windows Phone 8 Windows
8 Android and iOS which is kind of
interesting because not everything is
the same you know works the same way I
mentioned the store is one of them you
know the tag and that keywords field
isn't the same on all the platforms that
isn't the only difference in an app
purchase you're going to find across the
platforms we actually noticed that
consumables a lot of consumables are
things you can purchase more than once
and it uses them right then and there
versus a durable which you can buy once
and you own forever if you go and look
at like Windows Phone 7 and Windows
Windows Phone 8 and Windows Windows 8
there's even differences between those
two platforms both Microsoft platforms
and one thing to be aware of is that
windows 8 doesn't actually have
consumables they have a similar model
where you can say here's a durable that
you can purchase and it has a expiration
time if you set that really low to like
a day you can repurchase it every day
but it's not a true consumable so some
few differences there most of the other
platforms have true consumables like
Android and iOS the other thing as
subscriptions aren't supported on
Windows Phone yet that I know of and
then also free purchases are only
supported on Windows Phone so you sell
that starter pack that we had is
actually a true in-app purchase that
goes through the regular purchase model
and is just free doesn't cost anything
so I click into it I can actually say
get this it actually goes through their
in-app purchase model so the interesting
thing with the different platforms is
that you're going to find a few
different subtle differences that you
have to work around if you want to ship
multi-platform and Windows Phone
actually has a really good feature set
that they've talked about or that they
ship let's talk about numbers for tapped
itude in general we have over a million
downloads on Windows Phone most of which
are actually windows a lot of which are
windows phone 7 devices and so in-app
purchase doesn't the numbers i'll show
you aren't directly translatable to 1.1
million is all 1.1 million all being
able to purchase things but we do see a
good trend that's starting with in-app
purchase and with windows phone which is
that our overall our overall in-app
purchases I've been increasing pretty
steadily and I think as more users start
to switch over to windows phone 8 and
you know whatever else is in the future
we're going to tart to see that number
increase as well and we see our users
starting to slowly switch over to two
windows from Windows Phone to Windows
Phone 8 overall we've made around you
know something not crazy numbers on the
in-app purchase compared to our ad money
but it's been increasing and it's still
relatively new for for even from tap
titude standpoint you know we just
shipped in app purchase a few months
back maybe maybe like five or six months
back now but you know the amount of
money that we actually make on Windows
Phone for the user from in-app purchases
low but other platforms that supported
from the beginning we see a little bit
better data on Windows 8's doing okay we
actually have only 65,000 windows 8
downloads it's a little bit different
market I think for a game like ours
which is just a mini game game on a
full-fledged OS I think things that have
more productivity or even I don't know
different different types of apps might
be have a different experience than we
have on windows 8 and we've been
generally just a full on a full-on
mobile app until now Android we also
ship on we have really low numbers
because we just
android and iOS in the last month i want
to say we have six point five thousand
android downloads only three thousand of
which are actually active and you like
still have the app installed but we do
see that we have maybe five hundred
dollars so far actually an in-app
purchase just from that which on android
is interesting because that's more money
than we make in ads so our ad money and
android is as much significantly less
than we make on Windows Phone but our
in-app purchase has been better
generally for the amount of users that
we have using it so that's an
interesting stat nope same same products
i think it's just that we're still
relatively new on Windows Phone as far
as getting users on to things that can
purchase the in-app purchases and so
we're going to see the trend on Windows
Phone I mean we do make more money
obviously I'm windows phone from a nap
purchase then and I Android or the other
ones it's the the amount of users that
we have total is so much bigger it's
hard to sort of justify what the how the
numbers really relate to each other for
a hash so we use Android moose motto and
also AdMob and it's we also ship iOS and
AdMob with iOS and we actually see that
our numbers on iOS or even better than
our Android ones using the same platform
so it could just be an Android thing iOS
we just shipped on this month I believe
actually yeah towards the end of May and
our downloads are still relatively low I
think we have 3.5 thousand downloads but
we're seeing pretty good in-app
purchases in iOS as well you know with a
new product I think they get in there
and they want to see what we have a lot
of the users that we have on Windows
Phone I have had our game for a very
long time we've been out for two years
and we've been constantly updating it so
they've already accumulated all of these
coins that they earned before and that
purchase was ever available and so they
don't really see a need to purchase
anything yet because we have all these
coins back compiled up and so I think
with Windows Phone we're going to have
to rely on the new users to sort of get
in app purchase so our old users don't
even matter anymore anymore and so it's
kind of a trend that we have to pay
attention to also you can't tell from
here but
each one of our end up purchases
actually this is a good slide to show
this our number one obviously is the
free starter pack and these numbers here
are a little bit subjective because this
is just like a month of may view we saw
when we first released windows 8 a lot
more purchases than then what is in this
view but we have approximately around
you know a 500 allers total and we've
made on in-app purchase on Windows 8
which isn't terrible considering the
number of users that we have but the
same thing is true on on Android and iOS
so going back to the examples the reason
why we chose a starter pack and why I
think is one of the most important ones
for us and for other people is the
starter pack gets you into the store you
know we sort of promote the starter pack
more than anything else just because
that's the one that's free and gets them
used to going through the workflow of
purchasing something it doesn't cost
them anything so it's like once I get
used to getting that free starter pack
now they're going to a know how to get
back to the store know how to go in
there and what the workflow is to
purchase something and so when they run
out of credits they can say well I know
where to get credits right it's in the
store because I just purchase something
from there so I think it's pretty
important or at least useful to have
maybe a free one that doesn't give you
that much but it's it's worthwhile to
think about you know do you want to give
away something for free and just call it
an in-app purchase our user or users
definitely use that one more than the
other ones the other one is tap titude
gold if you click on it it's the most
expensive one it removes the ads but in
addition to removing the ads it'll also
give you that customization that we
talked about and that all of your
leaderboard effects give you like a gold
wavy look to them and we get so many
emails from our customers saying hey how
do I get my name to be golden wavy you
know and a lot of them around windows
phone 7 sweep to say sorry nothing you
can do but you know those are the type
of users that see that and go how do I
get that and they go into the store and
find tap the too cold so it's it's
something that doesn't actually change
the game play in any significant way
like all it does is add some sort of
uniqueness to your name but people
really enjoy to show off and give them a
way to do that we're also considering
using tap to do gold a sort of a beta
customer program to where you know you
saw our tier system back here
we release a new game you know once
every month or twice a month and it's
almost guaranteed to have a bug or two
in it you know we're just for hobby
developers trying to make a game and so
if we release a game that has a bug in
it it looks pretty bad especially if the
person who just downloaded the game
doesn't know this is the game we just
made right so the top game you see here
is the new release that's the one we
just built and so what we're thinking
about doing the tap titude gold is
actually saying only the taps do gold
members can play the new release and
everyone else has to wait like a week or
two and what that would actually do is
it lowers the bar for us to introduce
bugs to new users and allows us to sort
of focus on making making gains and we
ship bugs we can fix them so in last you
saw in the store we sell a whole bunch
of credits and that's actually what we
make the most money on which is the
credits when you go play our game you
know there's all those different
upgrades you saw they all cost the
varying amounts of money that you can
earn inside of the game but also you can
just pay for them pretty easily with
credits and so we give you ten credits
to start when you play the game you can
spend them as you want and if you run
out you can come back the store and buy
more and what we see is that a lot of
users actually instead of earning the
costars to get through the tears to
unlock these later on ones they'll just
go right in and buy them using the
credits and so then they can bypass the
entire time constraint on earning the
stars and all of the previous games and
we what we see is a lot of users just
like certain games you know we ship a
lot we don't know what everyone likes so
if they really want to play a I don't
know what's a good one esta su doku a
lot of users just like to go in there
and play some puzzle game that they
already know how to play well they can
go skip down right to it unlock it and
start playing it and so once you run out
of those ten credits though you sort
have to go back to the store and buy
more of them and so our number one thing
is just telling selling credits it's
another in-game currency that we sort of
invented and then lastly you can do hard
to unlock things an in-app purchase for
instance where you know might take you
two weeks to go and do something to
create in the game you can just tell it
to them right then and there for a
dollar a lot of times users will go
ahead and do that if they don't want to
spend the time on it
and then any questions Oh yep so the
right to remove the ads Donna do you get
on that um I don't know if I have the
numbers with me right now but I know
it's our it's our number two seller on
iOS which is the one that's new the
newest one out and the one that we think
is the most comparable as far as numbers
just because like I said on Windows
Phone they have tons of coins already so
it's hard to use those numbers but i
would say that even on Windows Phone
it's either our number two or two or
three thing I think number one is still
at the 100 pack of credits and also
starter pack just pretty so we don't
really count that one yep delicious do
you any sort of other a/b testing that's
what experiments to figure out web horse
another great question for in-app
purchase we're still we're still trying
to work out the kinks definitely we've
switched around some of the pricing
models of the of the credits and we've
also sort of tried to experiment with
different things we can give them in the
game in the most thing that we're trying
to do is sort of push credits as the
thing that you want to own and we see
that our users definitely want them if
you go into one of our most popular
games the fish feeder that's what the
flames represent and you go when you
look at some of the upgrades you can get
no sorry my bed when you play this game
you can buy a second fish tank it's like
a whole other area where you can store
your fish and it's basically a
tamagotchi style game but you can't go
into that second fish tank unless you
purchase a tank and that one cost fifty
credits and so our first goal that we've
been trying to sort of pushes make it to
the people need to have credits and then
once they need to have credits then we
are trying to figure out how to sell
those and we have noticed that with our
recent change in the price model of
those we have gotten a better betterish
purchase rate but we're still pretty
pretty nu into experimenting with
different different styles of purchases
percent of users really good yep no we
don't do the same time definitely not
although I think that's a it's a good
idea to try out but something that we
sort of have been focusing more on the
games and less on the in-app purchase at
this time but we are going to as ad
revenue I don't know if you guys have
apps or have tried to rely on ad revenue
it goes up and it goes down as it sort
of is in the lulz we try to focus more
on how we get more in app purchase
because that's the thing that's more
constant our ad revenue can vary day to
day based on some market demand but in
general are our in-app purchases are
pretty stable as far as the number that
we get per day and so that's something
that who is more reliable than in-app
purchase but at our current Lee for us
it's less profitable but that's just
because I think our app is heavily
windows phone 7 users
research or per user as position to the
do this to the furthering of the games
someone place it a little off maybe
what's right justice we haven't yeah I
think it's another good idea to do but
we sort of used to have and we still do
in Windows Phone is you can go into a
game and pin it so if you really play if
you really play sudoku a lot you can
just pin this one to your start bar and
then you have sodoku as an application
on your Start bar and so a lot of our
users actually will see have a couple of
their games that they play and then when
you when you tap into them it takes you
right into that particular game and it
bypasses all the rest what's up keep
score of your senior everyone do you
know how many people game stuff now it
down and the other problem is that it
isn't available on all the platforms so
even windows 8 we can't do a deep link
in Windows 8 to a windows 8 sub sub game
and so we've actually a lot of those
those features where it's Windows Phone
specific we definitely try to support
and the very first thing we build is
Windows Phone and then you know as as we
see fit we try to incorporate as much of
that in logic into the other games any
other you saying that you're you get
more money from your ads and your
neponset safe example last month what
would you say is a ratio so for which
platform huh ok so windows phone is like
I said skewed heavily skewed in the fact
that we have a lot of Windows Phone 7
users and a lot of people that have too
much money but I would say it's a maybe
10 x we get Windows Phone can be pretty
profitable if you get enough users in
our game is actually very focused right
now on time based money and that the
more users we have we try to keep them
in as long as possible to get that ad
money and it sort of came sprouted from
the fact that Windows Phone didn't have
in-app purchase to begin with and so the
only way to make money was for us to
have that that time factor to it only
recently when they introduced windows
phone 8 and even after they launched
will be able to support in app purchase
and so we're starting to move more
further away from the force you to do
time things and to experiment more with
paying money to get more features and
things like that but I think as that
goes on
we we would see a difference and it
isn't always 10x some months are very
terrible and some ones are incredibly
good for ads anyone else
all right you know if you have any other
questions and then if there's any other
I'll send out the notes but there's some
links for code on how you can do a
similar thing to Windows Phone 7 28
transition if you have a windows phone 7
device and also it includes sort of a
rapper and how to use the API that they
provide in Windows Phone yep so is there
any way you could actually mock a
subscription using a map ads for in-app
purchases I think you know with enough
user input you can do that in that you
could you know you as the the developer
could easily keep track of when
something was purchased or at least when
a license was there and or even a
consumable and then require that after a
certain amount of time to repurchase it
and sort of block the content but it
still would make them go through the
workflow every single time that they
need to go repurchase it and so they
might not enjoy that as much as
something that's a true subscription
where they just get automatically charge
and can manage that in a separate area
for purchases like retained you know
this will upgrade to a different device
or
you lose your phone and if oh yeah so
for for the consumables not necessarily
and that it's up to the developer to do
whatever they want to do with the
consumable all they do is sort of get an
event that you purchased it for the
durables they actually have a true
license which will get stored on the
device and then when they switch a
different device it pulls that down if
you log into the same live ID and
everything else for the consumables it's
sort of up to you and we have our own
mechanism that we've implemented to do a
cloud backup and restore such that if
you bought you know eighteen hundred
credits and then the next day your phone
died you don't just lose them so did you
updated their BOTS every day a baby game
so see that more time obviously you know
you did spend cause that you have to
push that to cloud time yeah the
question I should be repeating the
questions the question was if they spend
coins we to push that to the cloud and
that's sort of what we do but not
directly what we actually do is per day
will we will we will once per day upload
just the entire data set their entire
sort of our memory that we know about we
upload that to our cloud and we store
that as a data point and then we keep
track of up to three of those in a row
and then if they need to they can go
back up to three save points and restore
from any one of them but then we also
have restrictions on how many times you
can do that and we let them know that if
you try to do that too many times which
would cheat the system you know you go
spend all your coins and then you you
can revert back if you try to do that
too many times it will just block you so
how do you check them between to devise
their to log in some sort of 42 devices
they would have to log in with the same
user and then we would get the same user
ID and we can do the lookup and
everything works fine for a for instance
Windows Phone to Windows 8 we don't have
a model for switching we don't have a
user identity that isn't tied to the
phone's identity so say so many from one
Windows Phone age another 1i he changes
as well so how'd you do that so I
believe we have a user ID that we can
use that we keep track of that the user
puts a nose it just generated I believe
is just generated okay I thought it'd
change put
put a put device but I might be wrong
now when I can ask so there's a user
identity based on the lab we decide
oh but there's an anomalous I need you
to use that stays safe matter what
device as long as state languages use
represent ID is available to any app so
I don't involve a writing yeah they can
there's like a device I
we can use that the track these are on
different devices
polluted gravity from how do we get the
guys yeah that's a that's a good
question we actually we the question is
how do we get the graphics and images we
originally just ms painted basically all
of them they're very very simple to be
honest the the original one that we
shipped was even worse on this if you
can imagine Rui we understand isn't the
greatest and that isn't really our goal
to have the best you I but we eventually
did when we had some more money paid in
our an artist to sort of go through our
existing graphics and just make them
look better and we can really have any
criteria besides make them look better
because I was really we're terrible and
there still are I mean if you go back I
can show you some examples if you go
back to our really really early on games
probably the ones that we've retired
since then we didn't upgrade update the
graphics on them and so even like this
one here for instance I can't see the
icon heads up here's a great example if
you look at the background of this
that's an icon we made clearly in
mspaint and so we just didn't update
that one just because we didn't feel the
need to it's a retired game we don't
really care anymore one interesting idea
would be to have sort of skins that you
could download from a server and then
sell that as an in-app purchase you know
like as a as a customization option
because you know if you wonder if you
have a easily transferable same image
but different sort of theme then you
could do that mmm later so you sit down
on the skin so you shoot the package at
all be
resources have to begin their right or
can you actually when you do the nfo
just going to get new content new
graphics so we don't actually do that
today we don't have any notion of it but
I don't see why you couldn't send the
data save it to the thing as a as a
document and load that up as an image
yes like right pass correct yeah
yes so you making at this game on the
captains and the windows 8 as well do
you do any kind of thing with the users
probably is maintained between the phone
and we get a lot of questions to be
maintained progress across devices we
get a lot of requests to do that we
haven't spent the time to build that and
it's actually a pretty complicated thing
that maintaining state between multiple
devices potentially logged in at the
same time can have a lot of problems and
we don't have a fully baked user profile
solution such that we could log somebody
out on a different device if they logged
in on a different on a on the existing
one so we don't do that it's something
that we would love to spend more time on
and maybe that's for our next game or
maybe it's for this one but it's it can
it can be complicated it's a pretty good
analytics using some people just start
and go straight to this level
so we originally wrote and this is
something that we're still trying to
we're trying to figure out how to
translate this to maybe a different
model or or not but we originally wrote
sort of a key event logging system when
we were running under that dude's
apartment a computer in that dude
Department we we sort of keep track of a
lot of key events and when things happen
we just log an event and that event can
basically acute up on the disk and
eventually we flush that up to our
server where we can do all sorts of
querying and different analytics on it
when we switch to azure though we
actually removed all of those logging
points so the recent transition to three
months ago we switched over to not send
as much data and we would like to figure
out a new solution that sort of can give
us on par level things maybe even better
graphs in different analytics we
essentially had a bunch of tables and
sequel or a bunch of rows and we have to
build these graphs ourselves that using
Excel or something else and so having a
better solution maybe would be useful
but we haven't spent the time to invest
in it but even just doing the point
based one was really useful at the
beginning to figure out how often do
people spend in different levels before
we had the stats even or how often do
they click on in-app purchase to view
them or things like that
how's your experience you know
Courtney's to highways so that's the
question we have what's the experience
supporting it we have we use XNA on
windows phone 7 and we also use X a
middle school and eight because it is a
backwards compatible game and then for
windows 8 we use mono game which was
relatively simple to just plug and play
instead of XNA use mono game they
implement the exact same API sets as has
XNA so it was really easy to just sort
of compile against mono game rather than
compiling against XNA and that was
pretty easy they actually use the clr in
that instance not some mono it's so it's
not modeled game its model game but it's
not using mono when we just moved over
to android though we had in iOS we have
to actually use mono and mono game and
then tap the tooth on top of that and
there were some differences definitely
in the different platforms but we're
able to ship around 90 plus percent of
the same code on all the platforms so
all the games you see we didn't have to
change a single thing most of the UI
everything is homegrown you know in our
own system and so we don't change any of
it the only thing we have to switch is
certain threading api's are a little bit
different like how do you kick off a new
background thread things like the store
you have to sort of we have an interface
that we use for the store but then
implementing that interface and all of
the different platforms to use their
system is different and then things like
accelerometer and storage or the other
things that are platform specific so
moving out using mono game was pretty
easy I think I mean it took my brother
who ended up quitting Microsoft to go do
this full time it took him a month per
platform and that was mostly to fix a
lot of the little bugs like it took them
a few days to get it up and running and
then the rest of the month to stabilize
it and sort of make sure we don't have
any other major problems / or things
like that
yep everybody really advertisement
facebook groups now we've experimented
with Facebook a lot for advertising but
it mostly it's like ten bucks here 15
bucks there we also used a duplex sure
if you're familiar with a duplex but
sort of a exchange model I'll use that
for a while and it's hard to tell
results but it seemed to be relatively
positive results the biggest thing we
noticed for for advertising is once you
get featured you're pretty much gold in
for a while because you get a huge boost
of downloads and so if you can get
featured you know you're in the gold but
for advertisements we're sort of looking
at you right now figuring out what the
right strategy is between Facebook and
sort of admob and you can you can
advertise in I ads if on the other
platforms just wear regular web page ads
things like that I think our next
approach is going to actually be to go
hit up the major review sites and then
get a review from them
yes we got it I can seriously anyway to
know what what is the source of you know
how people copyright game the stories
tell you that that's definitely
different for platform windows 8 one of
the best ones because I think they're
just they're able to do it right from
the computer it's not get a special
device or anything windows 8 will give
you like referrals who sort of referred
you into the store and so you can see
she's just run a Facebook campaign that
links them directly to the store you can
see that it came from facebook it'll
show up on a part pie chart and show you
your download so it's pretty Windows 8
has pretty good reporting and analytics
windows phone I think they're working
towards out as well but I don't know how
it works on they don't give you as much
details on how people got to your game
and same with the other platforms iOS
and Android are the same that you don't
really have much data I think it's
really useful to know if your marketing
campaign is working by using the
referral data all right
sounds good thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
