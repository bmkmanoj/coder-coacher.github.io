computers will no longer strictly be
used by graphical interfaces but
increasingly will be used in a more
natural way where the same human senses
speech vision hearing you know will
allow the computer to to interact with
us at a higher semantic level my goal in
life is to find out how to design
technologies that work for people and
which fold into our environments in a
way that's transparent seamless but
ubiquitous it's there when they need it
and how you want it the potential for
the for the natural user interface work
that we're doing here is in some ways to
liberate people from technology we don't
want people as interaction with
technology to be driven by the
technology but to be driven by the tasks
that they're trying to achieve we are
remaking the the way we relate to
computers and so there's a lot of
different choices that we can make so it
is very important to come up with
something that is fluid works well is
usable and is productive and fun at the
same time
Alberto plays an important role and
natural interface paradigm it allows a
user to interact with computers as they
do with other human beings I think it's
a very exciting time at the moment to
see you know just how human centric if
we can make them technology pretty soon
we're gonna see some of the things that
we've we've seen in science-fiction and
it won't be so hard in our vision we can
make the human computer in action more
engaging and fun the major change that
were and
into is the transformation where we're
paying attention to the device to the
gadget to the service whether it be your
phone your slave to your desktop to
where you're starting to see the
ecosystem because with ubiquitous
computing digital technologies invading
almost everything we have a way in which
people will interact with computers will
be more like they interact with another
human being and as a result we can have
a whole new expectation of what we can
ask the computer to do and the kind of
help they can provide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
