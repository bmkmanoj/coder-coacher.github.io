to to learn a little bit about it as
mathematics to celebrate his mathematics
as I'm sure most of you know he was an
amazing mathematician who who managed
with his mathematics to unify fields
that people had never realized had such
a significant and deep deep unification
and as we go through the sessions today
we will see some of the different areas
in which he worked and some of the areas
that he really he really created with
his mathematics so our first speaker is
a one of his principal collaborators
ventolin Verner who won the Fields Medal
in large part due to their beautiful
joint work on SL a sub ventolin I'm it's
a very big honor in the emotional moment
for me to be the first speaker at this
conference can him ok and I'm
before leaving you know I said to my
friends I'm going to this conference
honoring the dead mathematics and people
said oh that that will be tough you know
one year after and sad and and so on and
and my answer was no I mean you know
when you talk about dead mathematics
when you open his papers each time it's
just a pleasure and you you are happy
and I'm sure that these two days will be
just a happy moment that will be able to
share by just you know looking at
remembering his ideas and and the some
tricks he learned us and they teach to
us sorry and so he and for those about
somehow who were not you know in
everyday life contact with him we can
all I mean his absence is very much of
course felt but nevertheless the his
mathematics is really very vibrant and
present all the time and so before
actually you're starting my lecture
today and you know the the I spent some
time thinking about you know what should
I tell to this sort of audience that we
have today you have some specialists who
know very well everything about for
instance SLE which is the topic of my
talk and and some non-experts or some
people who don't know at all what SLE is
about so how can I you know do sort of a
give a talk that will be okay for
everybody simultaneously and okay you
valent David giver gave us the
instruction that we should you know
focus on some specific things so little
parts try to
show the beauty of some some arguments
and and somehow I felt imma said that
personally you know at those moments
during this past year where I felt you
know o dase absence very much what I did
was actually that I played soccer ban
which is one of dad's favorite games at
the time when i met him in 1999 and is
this type of game where you have to push
these boxes and if you don't the goal is
to put one of these boxes on each of the
red dots and sometimes it's very tricky
to find the route to do it because if
the boxes say in a corner say then
you're stuck you're not able to push it
anymore because you have to be behind
the box to push it out right and I
remember very well sort of the way Oded
was looking so dead would look at this
and and just find the way without just
by knowing find the trick and we you
know amateurs we just start pushing you
know move around and start pushing and
see what how this works if we do if we
if we're able to work our way we're out
and if you would see us find the trick
then he would smile and say okay here
good that's nice and but it's a very
nice feeling when you find the trick
yourself and i think when we did
mathematics with him it was a little bit
similarly so that he would he would know
you know he has some sitting above you
and looking you play and then sometimes
he gives you the time to find the thing
by yourself
and I recommend that you can download
these things for free on the internet
and and play this on the plane back in
service it's very it's fun okay anyway
so let me now sort of start with my
actual slides and I suppose sles or
which is basically a invention of Oded
are I mean arguably one of his really
most important contributions to science
and to our scientific life today and
that you know students in graduate
school will just hear about I suppose
that oh that trumps sles and so the goal
of this talk basically is not going to
be obviously an introduction to SLE nor
a description full description of SLE as
those of us who had to teach this know
that it's not know takes time to
actually so it takes more than one
lecture to actually give a real
introduction mathematical full picture
of SLE and the arguments used and
actually it's a great fun when you were
fun you can actually watch you know
there are some recorded the lectures by
Oded himself where he describes this in
his own words and own style so there is
this msri meeting where he which is
really nice to listen because he you
know everything is very clear in his
head but when explains it somehow
it probably are those who were present
in that meeting maybe remember that his
presentation of SLE was not the most
transparent one and that was really a
but actually if you listen now when you
know it and you listen everything he
says of course it's everything is
transparent but and the ICM meeting in
2006 for instance his talk has been
recorded and you can hear him sort of a
recent more recent times 2006 and as I
said last year you can once you switch
it on you you hear is you know singing
voice special tone and you feel very
much well it's very emotional and and
also he wrote several beautiful
introduction of service about SLE itself
so this the goal of this talk is not
going to be just to try to do this but
I'd rather focus on actually you know
you Val mentioned that you know there
were plenty of gems or around the place
in that although it planted but i would
say that one obviously one big diamond
in the entire mathematical production is
as the paper that has been later
published in israel journal of
mathematics in two thousand that he sort
of put on the archive in april 99 where
he basically explains what SLE is and
maybe I was so the the entire talk more
or less will be devoted to trying to
show you that how much in that paper was
already there that the global picture
was already the frame for everything
that happened later was already set and
and also I should comment that oh that
did not write so many papers single
authored papers you know he he loved to
share and to write joint papers with
people and but this one is a single or
third paper and in any single or third
paper somehow he puts more of himself
than been in the joint paper so when you
read it you feel like you know he put
small things
I believe I think that this is nice and
so on and this type P is not of
statements is not so nice is not so
often present in the joint papers
obviously and always when he gives you
know some this type of statement you you
know in retrospect 10 years later you
can feel how know perfectly right he was
and try to show you a set some parts of
them and of course I mean for me this
paper was when when the preprint came
out or more or less but actually sort of
one month before when he sent it out say
hi guys here as a preprint please send
me comments or at some point then I felt
oh now this is really important and
actually I in some way I felt ashamed
because when I met first dead that was
when he came to visit Rick it or say
some months before and I'm actually
almost one year before I think and where
he gave actually the lecture on SL EE
and the relation to loopy rights random
walk and at that time of course I mean I
guess Rick was one of his main main
people he wanted to discuss with because
Rick had worked out some computations
that enabled then in that paper Oded to
actually figure out what the parameter
right parameter was in order to
understand the scaling limit of loopy
rights random walks and I remember very
well that the two of them you know they
were very excited to discussions and I
somehow I didn't really understand what
was going on you know was the outsider
and I when when he gave this lecture on
SLE I didn't ok so good but didn't
understand live in this equation
basically and then like most of us you
know take some time to I mean coming for
a probability theory take some time to
actually understand well how this thing
works and and then basically in that
mail when when he says said also that
something okay and you will see that I
mean he explains also that is something
important is going on here in this paper
so I missed completely basically the
prehistory of how SLE was actually
created in his brain and how the
procedure went and I guess Stephanie ty
David Enrica probably the those who saw
it you know on by there and discussed
with with with Odette during that pre or
SLE formation period and i'm sure they
will have they have anecdotes detail
about the genesis of SLE actually stefan
wrote this registration okay this i
would say reviewing over memorial paper
or you know about and with full of
anecdotes some of which i stole from
from his paper and to put in my talk and
i recommend strongly that you read it
because it's a great so when you see
something slanted on the on on the slide
it means that it's just taken out of one
of all eight emails or of the paper and
basically in the the sort of the
introduction so he sets the frame of you
know what is the scaling limit of a
lattice model of course this you know
was already discussed earlier by
Eisenman and other people and one just
one little thing i want to mention here
is this last sentence here where he says
actually it's important to discuss what
the scaling limit is and his last
sentence he says actually i have a
somewhat different definition that i
will propose in the coming forthcoming
paper and I think the forthcoming paper
in question is still somewhere in
stassi's computer because it has
transformed into a joint paper or
stassen and odette but I remember
vividly that when I visited Oded few
months later he told me something at the
time I didn't understand either like in
actually the elegant way to look at
scaling limit of percolation would be to
you know there's a set of quadrilaterals
that actually crossed by path you know
there is some topological structure and
and this things are nice and and so this
was already somehow present there of
course then combined with the fact that
sort of so this was a frame for for
proving some scaling limit and now the
frame is also filled by statuses the
proof of controlling variants of
population so that's why I sort of he he
waited until the two before showing this
and and here there's also another very
interesting sentence where explains that
basically the first task and which is
actually fundamental is when you try to
understand the scaling limit of a
discrete model lattice model on the
large-scale oh I see you don't see is
that you have to answer the following to
question what kind of object is the
scaling limit what does it mean to be
the scaling limit and then and and
there's this nice explanation that
actually there's more than wide one
right answer that they are it's not that
there is one good way to look at the
scale limit and what bad way but
actually that there are several
different ways to look at things and
that all of them give shed sort of
different lights on this and and so now
maybe I start immediately with the sort
of the description so I mean would make
sense to still too despite everything I
said before to give a lecture I mean to
have these two days without at some
point spending five minutes about what
SLE is right so of course this will be
just five minutes
but nevertheless ins SLE we were you
know discussed it appear in many of the
talks during these two days makes sense
to to to to to say this and so in that
paper what he explains to us in a
extremely clear way is basically the how
s only shows up naturally in the
construct of context of looper rights
random walks so basically the idea is
okay what is the loop arise random walk
so imagine that travels very fine grid
here and in a very large disk and you
start a random walk at zero so simple
random walk you started from from the
center of the disk and you condition it
to get out yes sign the document so i
take blacken and green is ok so and you
condition the random walk to go out it
say this point here one so here i take a
very small fine mesh grid and and so
this is the unit disk and you have a
random walk or random and that moves on
your on your disk and it moves around
and you force and your condition you to
get out of the disk here which is not
such a big deal because it has to get
out somewhere you can always sort of
more or less rotate the disk to make
sure the trees that's that's what you
see so basically and then you have this
random walk and then this object here
gives a path that goes from 0 to 1 which
is the trajectory of the random walk and
you can loop erase it so along the way
each time you create a loop you raise
the loop and in this way basically
you're going to create ok now I'm some
sort of self avoiding curve that joins
the 0 to 1 which is the loop erase
random walk from 0 to 1 in the unit disk
which is a random curve that goes from 0
to 1 and there's a nice statement in
that paper that actually that you know
this model has been invented or created
or much studied by Greg Lawler as a
substitute for a self avoiding work
which was more difficult to
then Oded says I think actually that
looper race run amok is as interesting
as self avoiding walk because of the
connection to random walks and uniforms
Fanning trees and all these things so so
this is the type of statement that are
not so present in delay I mean you know
joint but what he says I think actually
that and looper rice random walk as was
sort of pointed out to us by ok many
people actually or oil I mean okay has
been had been studied before David all
those rolling pin mental Greg Laurie
David Wilson and there's one property of
the rupee rice run/walk that can be
pointed out immediately so imagine that
this so basically have a run this is
vaporized random walk from 0 to 1 in the
unit disk or discrete version of the
unit disk I could have another you know
shape and the unit disk and other points
than 0 and 1 you could adapt the
definition easily and the important
property of loop eraser on work that he
exploited was then that basically the
following that you look at the time
reversal so the new Paris run amok as a
path going from 1 to 0 so you take the
path looper race from 0 to 1 but lend
you condition you say ok I know that the
curve is going to finish like this you
already know the curve is going to
finish like this so that means that the
the remaining path I mean the thing you
don't know is basically the part of the
path that goes from here to that point
and the key observation for loop erase
run/walk was that actually if you
condition on this part of the curve the
law of the remaining guy is just the law
of the loop erase random walk from 0 to
that point in the domain in the slit
domain like when you take the disc and
when you cut this out here so in some
sense there was something preserved
preservation of some property when you
were growing instead of looking at this
path going from 0 to 1 as you wouldn't i
usually do you look at it backwards
if you start growing discovering the
information by growing the the slip
backwards some law is preserved so this
is the what is usually called the
Markovian property of loopy rice random
walk or something like that okay so that
was the first observation that that was
around before and the second observation
is lewdness equation so let this
equation is the basic tool in complex
analysis that has been used a lot in the
in the context of the beaver bar
conjecture so when important complex
analysis question so the idea is the
following goes as follows imagine now
that I have a curve gamma that grows
from in the unit disk from here to there
it's a simple curve so at time zero i'm
here at time T I'm here so I'm like the
idea you should think of it that you're
cutting open the unit disk like this
going from here to zero and the curve is
then going to be paralyzed in such a way
that so this is just you know coming
from Reema's mapping theorem that
basically if you define the conformal
map from the unit disk onto the slip
domain so basically we're here you have
the unit disk like this here and here
basically this unit disk is these
smaller circles you know uh transformed
into something like that when you have
this conformer map ft that you normalize
the mean the parameterize the time on
the curve in such a way that F prime T
of 0 so ft is such that F G of 0 is 0
and the derivative at 0 is horizontal
and that this is a to the minus T
aloofness equation just says that if you
have this picture like this here you
have something like which is a zeta of T
which is ft minus 1 the pre image of
this tip here
that for each fixed points here in the
unit disk the motion when time evolves
with which the thrifty of Zed moves is
given by sort of a smooth or ordinary
differential equation and F prime T of
that means the derivative respect to
space you so I don't want you to explain
your littleness equation there but
basically this is already written in the
abstract it just says that basically
there's a nice equation satisfied by
growing slits like this that can can be
encoded by sort of a via differential
equation in terms of the conformal map
and the key observation bye-bye Odette
was to say well actually if you think of
this and think of that together that is
very natural you you get fairly quickly
to the following consequence that you if
you assume the existence and conformal
invariance of scaling limit of loop
arrays random walk so that means you let
Delta go to zero the mesh size go to
zero here so this discrete random walk
converges maybe in law to some random
continuous function and that if this is
true and if the continuous function is
conformal invariant which everybody
believed was true and which Rick
partially proved to be true at the time
then the the law of this scaling image
should be that of the curve gamma D up
to obtain there by plugging in zeta to
be a Brownian motion moving on the
boundary of the circle at a certain
speed so there is a two remarks that one
should make at that point which is the
first one sort of historical remark and
it might be surprising and surprising
for most of us at some point that
to use ruthless equation to produce this
because this curve is a very rough and
fractal type curve no it's a scaling
limit of something so you would expect
it to be fractional type curve and on
the other hand what you have over there
is a smooth you know it's a smooth
ordinary differential equation so how
can it be that some smooth differential
equation you know gives rise to to a
rough fractal curve and and in a way
this type ok Stefan of course know the
story much better than I do in a way
also in the complex analysis community
usually Livni's equation was really used
for for smooth curves because in the
context of a bit of a conjecture they
were only using you know it was enough
to to use smooth curves nevertheless
sort of in the 60s palma rancor and and
and others had observed that you could
construct rough curves using lewdness
equation so and and actually he comments
at the end of so conjecture 12 in his
paper is that actually this the
conditions here are true right he says
actually this plausible that perhaps
soon they would be a proof of conjecture
1.2 and of course he was right because a
couple of years later the conjecture
turned out to be okay and so he
predicted that there was no big actually
conceptual obstacles on how to to be
able to do to prove to fill in the gap
that to make this conditional statement
into an actual statement okay so now
there's something I learnt you know the
if you are probable list and you were
trying to understand the scaling limit
of these curves and you see the picture
and somehow this is what i thought you
know for a long time and last month
reading Stefan's paper i realized that i
was completely wrong because i thought
okay you will hear the background of a
dead in complex analysis so obviously
you know he had all this
he knew all of this they're perfectly
because that's the background you have
in complex analysis and he was you know
he interacted a couple of years with eat
I and eat I you know persuaded him that
actually probability theory was fun and
that there was a lot to do there and
that look at this and let's do and each
I can be very persuasive and and and and
and and so a dead started to look at
probability theory questions and so he
ended up pretty quickly on those parts
of the probability theory were that
we're touching a little bit too complex
analysis and that of course then he made
the connection between what he knew from
connect likes analysis and what he knew
there and this is completely wrong
because this is an email he sent or dead
center three years ago to to to to to
Stefan a new route when they try to
understand you know how SLE was created
at all and so what oh that explains in
that email that that basically before
working on SLE itself he did not really
know what Livni's equation was he knew
vaguely that it had to do with that it
was important that it had to do with the
coefficient problems and that it
involves something with the
differentiation in terms but and then he
says well I kind of rediscovered Livni's
equation the context of SLE and made the
connection so and if you know really are
dead when he says that it's but it's you
know you can be sure it's true right
he's not claiming something so it's
obvious that actually he refund
basically all these formulation actually
there was this other linear equation the
half plane and that basically in the
process of creating SLE he went but all
by himself through the procedure to
actually recover basically this type of
theory that we have here and I remember
this paper of 66 by Paul Anka that he
quoted and that we quoted them because
it was turned out in the joint paper he
said well actually ok we need to reprove
it and by the way I let me write the
proof because I have a I think my proof
is maybe you know safer and so then he
reported his own
way of looking at this characterization
of what of learner chains in a geometric
way in that paper and I think this is a
very important thing about the dead that
it's not you know he didn't when we say
he you know he merged together different
fields or something it's not you did not
just plug in you know the missing thing
because he actually constructed
reconstructed all by himself both sides
as we will see also on probability
theory is the same and in the same paper
then he continues and this I i love this
sentence so the one that is going to
come then he says actually if instead of
putting a Brownian motion that runs at
speed two times T on the unit circle you
put something else and something funny
happens that maybe when when when the
Brownian motion on the unit circle moves
too fast then the thing you construct is
not a simple curve anymore you know
instead of constructing some curve that
grows here like this in a simple way
cutting something open like simple this
is not exactly true anymore when Kappas
too large and in that paper actually
proved that when cap is larger than four
indeed it's it's not so the phase
transition at Kappa walk before was so
he says when Kappas larger than for it's
not a simple curve anymore here's the
proof and i conjecture actually that
this is actually capo equal force the
right is actually the correct phase
transition and then this sentence given
some kappa even when kappa is not so
that mean even when this is not a simple
curve the process is quite interesting
and so i don't know if there's something
you know in the in hebrew that makes
that this translation you know what does
it mean to be quite interesting you know
because everything that happened later
had precisely to do with this quite
interesting object he creates of course
you know if you invent something you are
not going to say this is very
interesting but you know that would not
do that but he says it's quite
interesting and i remember then you know
i was remembered by
by this last year you know the last
email i got from from a dead is the
following that was after a conference we
are organizing in morale and he said
Chuck John and vendor Lane we were the
three who organized it thanks once again
for organizing this workshop I think it
went very well and it was quite
worthwhile so then I thought well okay
then quite worthwhile you know
especially that you know they thought it
was quite worthwhile to make a trip to a
conference and and I am very much
remember last year when I said quite
worth well I've seen this quite before
already in audits and actually sort of
her okay and then comes what sort of
made me tilt in some some you know what
when I said okay now this is really
going to be important because then he
says in fact I plan to show in
subsequent work assuming a conformal
confirm confirm a variance conjecture
and all August you could conjecture 1.2
that actually a similar process
described the scaling limit of the outer
boundaries of percolation clusters and
he also prior I mean he will so he will
describe it everything and actually in
the paper he actually already sort of
explains everything
more or less what what he planned to do
at the time and that this sort of
implied many things would imply sort of
at least explain many things that
appeared in the physics literature
having to do with this gaining limit of
percolation and so for those of you who
don't know percolation this is one of
the pictures that oded created and that
is used all over the world basically
which is this interface the scaling
limit that is going to converge to one
of these one of his SLE processes which
is basically you have these hexagons you
toss a coin each each one is called in
grey or in white and then you follow the
boundary of a big island or connected
islands of black hexagons you follow
that boundary and this is this black
curve that had been also ok that's the
percolation boundary which and
understanding sort of the large scale
property of this curve was a big problem
that the physicist gave us to bite on
and that we had at that time looked
pretty stuck we were very start ok and
just a comment and what what Oded was
was sort of aiming to prove at the time
I mean what he was promising to Putin is
later paper and somehow the later paper
you know got delayed because you know
since then Greg and I sort of showed up
and say let's prove this because with
with your thing you can you know you can
solve our problem so and and then and
then stash came with this proof of
conforming variants of the discrete
model and then sort of the conditional
thing was okay and so it didn't make
sense than to to to to write that paper
he promised but I just want to say that
how how did he knew that kappa pi equals
6 was the right parameter basically
there's the following thing is just the
following argument if you have a some
symmetric square like this or some
symmetric object like this if you look
at SLE sort of any parameter going from
here to here from a4a when it's a SLE
that bounces on the boundary basically
it will have probably but simply because
of symmetry it will have probability
one-half to hit this part before that
part you know it's just a black and
white are symmetric in the previous
picture so if you start with a symmetric
picture it has probably one half to go
more to the right then to the left or
vice versa so this is ok but then if you
do the what what would had already
computed at the time was something like
okay suppose down now that I take my SLE
that goes from here to here instead then
going from here to here wait I take the
curve that goes from here to here
remember the curve is defined but you
have to decide a priori where the
starting point is when the end pointed
and so we did the computation basically
in that context of what's the
probability first go hit this guy before
that guy and there's something very
special about percolation which is that
basically you don't the fact that this
guy is called in white or black or this
one is called in white or black is not
going to influence the curve that you
are going to draw inside the domain and
so therefore that for percolation or
population scaling them it the
probability that the SLE from here to
there also has probability one-half to
hit that before that this is only
happens only for Kappa equals six so
basically you could you know change
slightly you can move the target point
you are aiming at and certain
probabilities will still be preserved
under this moving of the endpoint you
look at and so basically this is for
those who know the story then that came
later this is basically that he actually
already had some pre locality
statement just looking at cardiss
formula that he computed for the various
values of kappa and so that it was no
surprise that when we said actually can
you prove locality of isolation yeah
this is I know this will be this is
doable right and and he he already had
this type of arguments in in that paper
also and at the end of the introduction
of that paper what he explains us is
that the following that well the big
picture the magic picture is that
different values of Kappa in the
differential equation that we wrote
their produce different paths which are
scaling limits of naturally defined
processes and that these paths can be
space filling or simple paths or neither
depending on the parameter kappa so
space filling is this has to do with the
uniform spanning tree model that i don't
discuss here simple path has kept us
more than four and then give this
intermediate phase which is this neither
corresponds to cap are between four and
eight so he has already said the entire
you know now you know the goal will be
to prove all these different things in
and and and now i want to emphasize one
thing what I mean experience of Oded
sort of also present in that from from
that paper which has to do with his
relation to probability theory and to
stochastic calculus and so in the proof
of that paper where he proves that
basically the code is it's not a simple
curve as soon as kappa's larger than 44
that this procedure doesn't does define
actually objects that are not simple
curve but that are still probably quite
interesting what he writes is the
following we now show that a certain
function satisfies the second order
differential equation inside e in an
interval using Ito's formula and then he
gives the following thing the reader
unfamiliar with stochastic calculus can
have a look at and then he gives a
reference for example
or he could try so if you are the reader
and familiar to stochastic calculus
can't dress try to derive it directly
yeah you can just you know invent
stochastic calculus on your own why not
and then he explains the latter is a bit
tricky but can be done right so so
basically what he did at the time is was
that well he just probably did on his
own you know the entire understanding of
how you get the second order
differential equation and actually I
remember now that since I'm at Microsoft
i can say that when i discuss with him
you know Apriori we were saying well if
you're working at Microsoft or if you
were going to work at Microsoft how did
you do because there's no there's no
library and at that time you know
digitalized things were not so present
1918 I said and obviously you know not
having a library was not such a problem
for a debt because he he would just you
know where the library was just more
there for you know to cite the
appropriate reference it and give credit
to appropriate people but he would you
know always derive things first and the
stem things first on by himself and
doesn't look like he would read them out
from from the book or stuff and actually
this this funny thing then that
continues a page later page which is so
he completes the proof of this equation
here that this should satisfy this and
so the way he does it is assume that the
function is c2 and then apply it was
formula and that's just for those of you
who knows the castle calculus and then
you end up immediately with with that
equation and and then he said well
actually there's a problem here if I
apply it was formula and you know if I
don't derive it directly that I haven't
proved that this function that is
defined by being a probability of a
certain events is actually see two and
then he says well I they should be a
reference so that's in this version one
of his preprint implying this but we
have not located one
okay so how does he do well to deal with
this here's the way so I'm sorry I
didn't find the appropriate reference
but here here's why it is C to write and
tell he explains the thing that well you
don't need to know that it's e to
because you just once you know the
function and you put it in you know the
solution to the equation is C to you
plug it in and you verify that indeed by
using the stopping and that's actually
the way standard way this proof so again
sort of you didn't know where to find
this but he said well that's the way to
do it actually is a better way and
actually I very much remember with when
with Greg at some point well actually
that's just a funny funny thing we just
discussed on the parking lot of
homestead studios with shoes to do with
Greg this morning and and we were sort
of saying well actually sort of when one
tries to discuss you know or our joint
papers that has you know the things
where you had to prove technically
things somehow it was not so interesting
to look at those because the you know
the proofs were improved later on and
simplification we round or so indeed is
those technical aspects but actually in
this paper basically nothing you know
you there's nothing that you want to in
this first paper everything is still you
know like it should be there's no real
update except of course that other
things were proved later on but you
don't want to really replace the
arguments that he he he produced and in
one of our technical papers later there
was a tricky question involving
precisely Ito's formula but you know
differentiating with whether you could
apply these things uniformly when you
had a family of Ichiro things and
differentiating with restore tough you
know I was scratching my head and saying
well I don't know any reference for that
is this true or whatever and and you
know what that said yeah of course it's
true you know of course you this is
going to be true because uniformly you
can differentiate okay and then you know
I was supposed to be the one you know
who grew up in stochastic calculus and
we are supposed to be able to swim you
know I'll speak the language fluently
and and and then okay then okay we
managed to say find the reference
actually that saved us of
having to reprove it but so he really
was a personal understanding which he
understood it and then just do two to
finish maybe I'm actually 22 too fast in
my lecture but again sort of when he
says it's a bit tricky but can be done
it's very interesting because in one
email exchange that he had with Stefan
and that Stefan forwarded me he shows
basically how he thinks about the it
shows it's not that the the you know the
content of what I'm going to show you is
ISM as importance it's more the the way
sort of he understands it and the style
with which both the style of
mathematical and gentlemen type of style
with which he explains it in email and
I'm sure all of you who interacted with
him had this sort of email exchanges
where he gently you know explains to you
on the email an argument and so
basically they were discussing the
relation between the generator and you
know the differential equations that pop
out and the stochastic differential
equations that you had before which is
hard to do with this which then you know
turned out to be these equations I wrote
later and Stefan says well is it easy to
see right so you say and and here's the
answer of over dead so you'd probably
look up some book on the relations
between pdes d and operator semigroup
because my background that this stuff is
not as strong as i would like so that's
something very funny because i always
felt that he had this he would have
liked you know to to be really you know
or 22 22 and he always felt these guys
you know doing stochastic analysis and
probability theory maybe they know
something i don't or you know they so he
would have would have liked to have a
strong background there but i'll give
you my understanding for the little that
it's worth and then he gives you he
gives two ways to look at this so and
that's the way sort of he was looking at
this type of objects in the
time where he was that's not you know
it's just at the same moment where he
was you know working out all these
things by himself so of course you know
later on he would have explained it in
completely different way but it more
shows how you know he the way he created
this thing so you don't have to read
this but then he says here's one way and
so he explains this and he says you know
you have this density total mass is
conserved you differentiate here and
assume it's moved you can differentiate
you substitute and you on your hand
waving argument and that that's what
goes out of of this in a way i would say
this is more in the stochastic calculus
version and then so much for this
approach now another one and then
basically completely says well anyway
this problem is a linear problem so we
can do you know / no sort of a
step-by-step so let's first look at what
happens if if you know there's a uniform
density to start with let's first you
know look at what happens if i have a
drift to the left on the one side of the
domain or two on our plus and the drift
to the left on r minus well then the
single type rise up and this will have
to do with the derivative and so he
basically explains all the e to calculus
just by you know it's linear and then
the you all the terms are coming out you
know just by looking at them one by one
and that's what it is so that's the
reason for that term for instances and i
like very much the third one also which
is actually i had a third way oh that's
everything that's this answer right so
sometimes you got answer which is very
which are and to think of it through a
proclamation approximating the motion
you know which is a diffusion of a
random walk on a grid which was not
evenly spaced but i don't think it will
be helpful for you if i try to recall
that so of course for those of you who
know where is you know so he had all
this picture and everything it's
interesting that he doesn't he works
with his entire you know his own object
so simple random walks i understand i do
this right so he always has some
feelings
for the object that that he he plays
with and then okay and then of course I
like that you know gentlemen touch so
that I hope this was at least a bit
helpful right there's a type of thing
when he explains you something obviously
you know it took him I don't know 40
minutes to type this long thing trying
to explain you gently and and he did
this you know were we currently in 42
probably all of you who interacted with
him and always you know just saying this
is the way try to explain that maybe I
didn't succeed sorry if I didn't and
actually here okay and so I hope so that
there's really one thing important to
think that I understood in a way I felt
it when I interacted with him and and
then when when basically I was
understood that even learn this equation
he basically really we crafted on his
own and now of course I mean ok I should
not say that I mean you know he the fact
to use Livni's equation in the context
of dla and other contexts was no in the
air there was a Carlson and Makarov and
so but but basically the way he wanted
to understand it was just by re
understanding or reproving everything
himself and that this was not just you
know I I saw it on my with my eyes that
this is the way he proceeded in
probability theory and stochastic
calculus but looks like you know that
was like the same was the same way in
actually all areas that he touched all
many areas that he touched and and again
so so I want to emphasize really that
it's just a pleasure to read his paper
in the pros on and when you know this
type of sentences that I showed you it's
quite interesting or or I believe
that this is worthwhile something you
can you always smile when you read these
things when you know a dead and what you
knew or dead and you you you you read
his papers and you smile and and
actually sometimes you laugh so the the
I told you you know I said you know for
instance to my family I'm going to dad's
memorial conference and I have to
prepare actually my talk so and so I was
just sitting in the sofa of my of my
living room reading his papers and the
very same so for that i was you know
where last year devastated when I
learned you know that oh that fell from
from the in the mountains and and I was
just reading this and I was just
laughing you know I was just smiling and
laughing and then my daughters came
along said well what is what is it that
is so funny I say we want to tell us you
know and say well actually I'm reading
just the paper of a dead and it's just
nice and no they we're looking at me
like you know something is going is
wrong you know the he tells us he's
going to a memorial conference this is
going to this is looks okay sad moment
and he's just laughing by our smiling by
reading his papers and but really i mean
it's it's just I just recommend to all
of you sort of two when you fly home or
that you just print out the Israel zone
of math paper or rather the version one
of the preprint on the archive and or
actually Oded sort of a ICM paper is
also a very nice thing to read because
he's just you know gives plenty of
problem to the community some of them
have been solved by now because that was
2006 and now it's 2009 but sort of he
you know just wants to give problems and
also explaining things in a gentle and
simple and transparent way not hiding
anything you know there's not there will
never be something that you know you
haven't
that he didn't want to share and and
also really if you want to feel a little
bit like a dead probably felt every day
when he proved or found found the tricks
because it was that's one other thing
when you interacted with him that Stefan
rights which is was that you can just
see how fast you know he found the
tricks or went around you know there was
some let's try this way it doesn't work
ok and the rest of us we just feel you
know okay this proof breaks down
completely we don't know how do we we're
stuck and you know two hours later
actually here's another way you know
where maybe we can you know go around
the mountain and climb the other and so
the speed with which you would you know
find the trick and solve the the
concrete problems that we were working
on and I you know if you take one of
these sokoban things sort of a that we
have here and if you move a little play
a little bit around and then you find
the trick and say oh you have first to
push the boxes and that way too and
that's and then the moment when you find
this then I guess you feel a little bit
like a dead and probably felt you know
you smile you're happy and and and
that's it you don't make a fuss out of
it you just because you are in front of
your you know and you're happy to
actually also maybe then share it with
somebody who had went through the same
thing and
and I guess that's okay my
recommendation you you you you you
download it and you play it on the plane
back and it's fun actually it's
interesting because soccer ban in a way
if you start playing with this it's not
completely unrelated to the entire lunar
story and so on because you know once
the box is or even with the you know or
the other kuber problem or something
because you know one once the sink once
the box is on the boundary somehow you
can't push it out of the boundary
anymore and you know yeah something bro
it's not completely unrelated and maybe
the time you know would that spent
playing like this soo kaban was very
useful for all of us to in the way he
crafted then SLE sorry ok and thank you
very much
I'm not sure that if there are questions
or what the comments may be comments or
if you look know if break or David or
Stefan or you die want to say something
about them I want to say this about your
first comment so in 97 a bunch of us
were going to conference in Italy and
shortly after we work with all the tide
and rust liars on the uniform spanning
trees and then the edges goes up using
women you want to talk about something a
bit speculative innocence 97 being
presented a large part not everything
but a large part of what was eventually
in his Israel journal paper already
but then you're more peaceable using a
new described to me and I if they sound
like total science fiction years do talk
about something more insecure did accept
that if I them
you had and the picture the other thing
thats related to the stochastic analysis
story at some point this is between 97
99 again you know from chodesh English
asking actually pretty basic think about
about running about brand emotion and
its characterization so Pallavi add
characterization that women would it
just
if you didn't know this visitor key we
discovered is that you know and because
they are arise exactly in the story that
Wendling was saying that physics and and
then he asked them what what's the
reference for this properties of Ryan
register so it's not that he combined
these known things he realized okay we
need some problem characterizations of
running motion in order to prove what we
need for you
the other comments or questions
maybe I'll just one one other comment
that when somehow ok the my first
experience with a day was sort of when
we had this hike with Rick and in
Fontainebleau and maybe that was one of
my first experience of a mathematician
that would actually love to do
mathematics on a hike right so that they
were the two of them were just it was a
bit frustrating because I you know I
didn't understand what was going on and
so they were discussing maths during the
height in a very and I remember sort of
all so that probably Greg also remembers
that somehow the the proof of loop race
random walk convergence in the end was
just took place this msri conference
during a walk when we decided let's walk
down you know from SSRI down to Berkeley
and when we started on the top we
started discussing this and down it was
okay yeah looks like it's doable we knew
nothing is preventing from from us from
anything so he he loved and I guess yet
to talk really mathematics also you know
why you know why walking or by you know
being sitting you know really like him
in his chair well in this sort of know
so far guess at Microsoft you have
plenty of those with just you know like
hands in his pockets and then say well
actually I don't think that and then
providing you the argument by sorry for
my handwriting is not good but I will
try to sketch it on the blackboard and
then yeah and so things were went always
pretty quickly it was not like he was
you know world the ideas were not you
know took hours for them to short was
like interaction and discussion which
was also ignition for for his
creativity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
