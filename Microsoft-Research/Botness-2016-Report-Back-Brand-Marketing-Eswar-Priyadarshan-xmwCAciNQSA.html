marketing conversation we should observe
that the evaluations of Twitter Facebook
and snapchat are largely driven by
brands so brands are a other than the
VCS are a great source of money for an
ecosystem such as ours and so I think we
collectively need to start thinking
about ways to bring them into the
conversation because they have no idea
what we're talking about half the time
so the kinds of stuff that brands think
about are the cost of doing this stuff
the good news is every brand I talk to
is very uninterested in doing another
app because they understand what it
costs to build them and what it costs to
market them so this is a good time to
walk in the time to build it and to
build something interesting in terms of
a conversation and what does it take to
maintain it so when you think of brand
marketing you might think of just
advertising I don't think what we're
talking about for a while anyway has
anything to do with advertising I think
there's a lot of brand things that can
happen and one way to think about it is
to think of what chat as an alternative
to email and social media so if you're a
brand and you would like to talk to your
customers on a daily weekly monthly
basis the platforms that we're building
are a great great way to do that and so
I think there's product notifications
there's people with abandoned shopping
carts there's lots and lots of scenarios
which people want to track packages
would be a great UPS or FedEx box so
that's what we think of that's what I
think of when I think of brand marketing
maybe marketing is the wrong word but
it's how do i maintain a continuous
relationship with a brand and we happen
to be sitting on a most amazing
interactive platform to do that with all
these modalities of talking
direct natural language although two
buttons to voice etc etc so this is
potentially a very exciting time for us
and so I think as we're building the as
we're building the railroad we should
think about the true the true client
which which are the thousands and
thousands of consumer brands around the
world thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
