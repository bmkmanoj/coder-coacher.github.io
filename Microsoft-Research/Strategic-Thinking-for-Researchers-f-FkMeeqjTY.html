hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
we'll come back from the tea break
everyone I hope you feel a little bit
refreshed
just to recap before I introduce our
next speaker that after this we don't
have a break but everyone who's staying
for the agile tutorial will just remain
in the room whereas those people have
signed up for the Gadgeteer workshop
just have a couple of minutes to leave
and go over to the flexible meeting room
and then I'll see we have about 40
people who have signed up for the coton
contest tonight that's great there is a
few ad hoc spaces available as well as
other people changing their minds and
that will be again just here in the main
lecture theater after the Asura although
we'll take a break before you properly
get started and we'll treat you to some
pizza and cold drinks including beer to
kind of encourage you to perform at your
best in the coton contest tonight okay
so few more people coming in so I'd like
to introduce our next become that's my
colleague and Dee Gordon nd is a
principal researcher here in the
Cambridge lab he has a programming
principle and tools group and he is also
a part-time professor at Edinboro
University
okay thanks scarlet it's great to see
everyone and great to see lots of
graduate students this is a talk about
strategic thinking in research really
aimed at grad students I like to start
with this quote from Alan Perlis who's
an all-time great in programming
languages he heard of the Turing award
he was the first ever recipient of the
Turing award back in 66 and if you read
the quote you can see that you know
there was a sparkle in his eye that he
was passionate about computers and
passionate about having fun with
computers making them do new things and
and that's this is a quote that got me
excited about a career in research in
computing back when I was a grad student
so I like to start with it so this talk
is about strategic thinking so I like to
think that
you know you're learning about the
technicalities of your your chosen
subject you know at this this summer
school we've got various training
sessions I think this morning you had
sessions about how to write PowerPoint
had to give good talks and on Friday I
think sign painting Jones is giving a
talk about giving a couple of talks
about writing research papers and an
indeed about writing research talks so I
kind of assumed as a given that you know
sooner or later you're going to be great
or writing individual papers and giving
great talks so you know what's next
that's the subject of this talk I want
to talk about that sort of long-term
goals that you have as a researcher and
how to set them and strike strategies
and tactics for it for achieving them
about choosing research problems about
investing in learning about other
research areas so that you can get ideas
to combine them to make progress in your
in your chosen area and also ultimately
towards the end of the hour I'm going to
talk more about the about the pressures
I've always like to be a researcher you
know it's a long-term game it you know
you you know doing it should be
sustainable we can't sort of work you
know every night for forty years you
know it's you could you're gonna burn
out so some some strategies to for time
management for researchers and avoiding
and burnout as as researchers and I
think you know everything everyone here
we're all passionate we wouldn't be in
this room if we hadn't signed up to do a
PhD or you know already have got your
PhD and you're a postdoc or you're
further on so you're passionate about
research so you're really devoting your
life to it I mean you can't to be honest
you probably can't make progress in
research if you're not really pretty
wholehearted about doing it so I think
it's important to step back from the
details of your technicalities and learn
strategy now this talk I love giving
this talk because you know normally when
you step up and give it a research talk
you're you're very conscious gosh what
is new about this what is important
about this and so forth and this stop
there's nothing really original I've
stolen the ideas for various places it's
a sort of compendium of tactics that
have worked well for me and so right
this is no particular evaluation either
so you can
this opinion you know I've got no
particular theory or empirical or
usability evaluation to back up what
I've said I think what I would say also
is that there's you know I'm gonna
present a bunch of strategies I don't
think there's any one particular one and
in fact I don't think that there's
really anyone who follows all of this
advice all of the time but I would say
that some people have successfully
forward some of this advice so you're
not wasting your time you know I think
this will be worth it and how come I
mean am I doing this well a few years
ago we got together some of the
researchers here and thought we you know
we would indeed step back from thinking
about writing papers and think about
impact about the sort of you know the
difference that we could make by
research and we had this that this great
sort of get-together one afternoon here
with with a bunch of the researchers in
the building and our goal was to gather
together to ask how to have impact
through research to think about the
strategies and we had Bob Williamson
from
inria from from INRIA from the from
Australia that got the name of the
Australian Research Center
Nick Toth that's it nicked out he's from
NICTA so he gave a nice a nice talk
about strategies so I've stolen some of
his his ideas and but the point was to
stop and think how a work can change the
world to get us talking about how to do
that and to generate tips are setting
bigger goals need more effective and you
know what it was a huge amount of fun
organizing it because we could get to go
there was a searchers and and talk we
had a you know with a shared sort of
agenda we all kind of grappled with how
to have impact how to make a difference
inside Microsoft how to make a
difference in our research communities
so much fun it didn't feel like work so
we did it again but this time round we
made it simpler and it was the MSR
speed-dating Society which was a huge
success I mean it was let me see it was
here was the sort of format it was in
fact well let me see so the idea was it
was to generate social links within
within our lab so we got people together
and everybody had to stand for a minute
or so and put up on a slide something
surprising about them themselves so I
think we heard that byron cook claims to
in the first-ever spammer that back in
the 80s or something someone employed
him to you know send spam email build a
bit of software for that so that was his
claim to fame and and everyone else had
something surprising to tell and then we
had the speed-dating part where we just
you know mixed up researchers yeah we
paired them up they were 24 people
Cawood 8 speed dates and they'd 5
minutes each and really trying to get
people across the lab to talk to one
another even though they're from from
from different technicalities and it was
a great success you know one one one
visiting researcher was a bit shocked
about it all and see didn't want to come
because he was a you know a happily
married man and he sort of misunderstood
it and then we we didn't get married
reports of sort of you know bad next
morning's but you know he was
nonetheless it was a great success from
the researcher point of view so that's
this is the kind of thing that has
propelled me to get to take some of the
insights we got from from those events
and and to talk here about strategy so
the first thing I want to say is know
what you're trying to do this is a key
thing so here's some luminaries be
honest rooster up inventor of C++ he
stays the most important single aspect
of software development needs to be
clear about what you're trying to build
but there's not the Saturn 5 behind him
you know a man with a mission a man who
achieved something put something on the
moon he stays with searches what I'm
doing when I don't know what I'm doing
so you could say Andy is a bit of a
contradiction there beyond erstes you
need to know what you're doing and
Verner series research you don't know
what you're doing the key thing is you
need to know what you're trying to do
that that's research I mean if you knew
exactly how to do it then it wouldn't be
research it would you know the
engineering you could you know hand that
over to a product team to do it the
point is in research where we're we pose
some questions we don't quite know how
to solve them but we got a clear idea of
some sort of direction that we're going
in we're not just randomly you know
milling around so here's a job interview
question that I got asked once first
part what's the most important problem
in your field so in fact let's have some
answers come on
ah got a roomful of PhD students yeah
fantastic any other answers at least one
more yeah and tastic second question is
what are you working on and is that is
that the most important problem in your
field okay so you're in fact going
towards that and you okay so that builds
towards the general agenda so this is
the kind of its kind of thing you can
ask yourself you know what's important
in your journal area are you actually
you know moving towards it and hopefully
you are but it's worth thinking about
that you know you're advising me well
upstair to look at this problem and this
is good you know they're gonna help you
on it but while you're looking that
problem think about what maybe what the
next thing you might do you know that
the third and fourth chapters in your
dissertation you know trying to orient
them towards you know what is what is
really important now people say to me
auntie but what about serendipity you
know you know in fact you say Andy
you're actually you're saying that we
should get together and have two speed
dates and try and have you know stuff
bubble up you know serendipitously
aren't you contradicting yourself and I
say no I think the crucial thing is that
you should know what you're trying to do
serendipity is real but as pastor said
chance favors the prepared mind so you
know certainly you know let's generate
chance encounters I will keep coming
back to that that's really important in
terms of creativity but nonetheless you
need to know where you're trying to go
so that you can you know set yourself up
so you think you've got to work on
important problems so Hamming i I really
recommend this go away and search for
you and your research there's a great
essay by Richard Hamming who was a
luminary at Bell Labs for many years and
and he's got a long essay about
conducting research and I don't have
time to go into it in any detail you
know please go and read it it's it's
fascinating but he had this strategy
that he I think fighting afternoons he
committed 10% of his time to try and
understand the big problems in his area
but what was important
that was in parallel with his sort of
main job and then every so often he'd
ask himself well if I really learned
that this other problem is much more
promising than the one I'm working on
you know it's switch direction that
could take some courage and maybe it's
not what you want to do during your PhD
but you know as a postdoc say you should
be thinking ahead what am I going to be
doing once I get my PhD at that point
you might well think well I've done you
know X I think Y is more important
because I've spent time thinking about
it
maybe now is it time to do a switch and
the corollary is don't work on
unimportant problems you know it it's
it's i mean so i used to be i guess i
try to be opportunistic you know and you
meet someone at the conference or
something you get some sort of idea you
maybe realize that technique you have
was solving a problem that they're
working on or you think you can just
come excuse me you can just combine them
anyway so this can be good in terms of
generating papers but it can also be a
bit random so when i look back at some
of the papers I've written I think some
of them were a wee bit random and I kind
of wish I hadn't bothered spending all
that time on it you know you can spread
yourself too thin that's a peanut butter
strategy you know just spread your
talent all over the bread you know
you've much more focused if you kind of
find the bit you care about and you've
pretty peanut buttered there I'm sure
that metaphor entirely works but you get
that you get the point um Steven Johnson
has written a great book that I
recommend on idea generation he's got
several books on that I want to share
some of his strategies that he's
discovered with you so the the first
thing is about recycling and we come be
combining ideas so this is the
Gutenberg's printing press so this is a
really excellent example of a really
significant impactful invention you know
that really you know changed so change
the world by making you know mass
production of books possible that was
very much a combination of existing
ideas his sort of big moment was to
combine them rather than to come up with
with something so you know the printing
press is based on movable type ink paper
and the press itself now ink and paper
being around forever movable type had
actually inventing previously by a by
Chinese about two centuries before but
that guy didn't make the connection with
with a press and so
you know it didn't take off so they had
movable type and and Gutenberg used
presses that have been developed for
wine and so established this thing and
produce books and you know it had a
phenomenal impactful event effect and
here's another example this is Willis
carrier who in at the turn of the last
century invented the air conditioning
machine and he had this in I mean so I
mean the really important thing about
air conditioning is to reduce the
humidity in the air it's not just about
temperature and he had this insight
where he was looking out on a foggy day
I think in Manhattan over the Hudson
River was very foggy and he had this
sort of idea that if you could if you
could lower the temperature of the air
that the the the that the water vapor
would condense out into droplets and
that would be a way in which you could
remove water from the air and so he was
able to build this the first air
conditioning unit and this had a
spectacular effect now in Britain we
don't think air conditioning is
spectacular
but in America they're always great
tracts of the Midwest and Florida were
sort of you know just impossible to work
in and and the air conditioning system
had a huge effect on the American
economy particularly the start of the
last century now these are examples
according to Johnson of two different
sort of paradigms of discovery this is
shear individual insight this is like
you reach a moment you know you know in
the bath and this is combining existing
ideas now what you think which are the
more common he's so if you go look at
his book he's catalog about 200
significant inventions that have really
you know changed technological history
and he's classified them as being either
one or the other so what you think is
more common combinatorial yes indeed
that it's much more common so if you if
you fret about whether you're going to
have this genius moment frettin or war
you know if you want to be productive
and in fact follow the path of you know
most at most inventors in the past what
you really need to know is about lots of
technologies or lots of ideas that you
can combine together so it's important
to sort of read around don't just be
focused on your your individual research
area Johnson also speaks about this idea
of the adjacent possible when this comes
from a philosopher Kaufman and his idea
of the adjacent possible is that it's a
kind of
no future he says hovering on the edges
of present of the present state of
things a map of all the ways in which
the present can reinvent itself it's not
a fancy way of talking about the sort of
next ideas that somebody is going to you
know come up with and Johnson has got a
bunch of ideas for how to get at them
that we'll go through so this idea of
liquid networks just talking with people
so like the speed-dating thing you know
going to coffee houses if you're a
scientist it's a really good idea to
live in a big city you know where
there's lots of parties go to parties
talk to people about about their ideas
and and you'll be amazed you know how
much I mean how many inspirations you
can get to connect things the slow hunch
so this is this is super interesting
again this is going against the idea
that there's one Eureka moment where you
where you you get the idea I mean that
does happen but he gives the example of
Darwin so Darwin you know discovered the
theory of evolution and if you know in
his memoirs he claims he invented it on
a single day so Darwin had convinced
himself that on September 28 1838 he had
the idea of evolution so some start
historians went back and tried to test
this to try and discover there was any
evidence that this had happened and they
looked at his notebooks for the 18
months before arriving that period and
you could see that he had sort of you
know went in his in his writings he was
sort of groping towards this idea he had
this sort of slow hunch about about
evolution but he didn't really
articulate it really clearly and it's
not and going on it's not even like a
few months after the particular date
where he thought he didn't know that he
still seems to be doubting it so it
really isn't the case that there was one
sort of particular moment apart from you
know in you know in his sort of faulty
recollection where he'd invented it so
again you know the common thing is that
you you have these hunch and I've had
this in my own experience in my own
research lab this hunch that I could
combine this or that to solve the other
but not really understood how to do it
you know you know for months years at a
time so that's that's a common situation
that you'll you'll find yourself in back
to serendipity
so Johnson's lots to say about
serendipity and he gives these examples
so LSD so LSD originally came from
investigations of fungus that grew on
rye and they thought maybe
find some sort of therapeutic purpose or
drug that would come from this fungus
and and then it was only the years after
they had done this that we've discovered
that it also had these interesting
hallucinogenic properties I'm Teflon we
know about you know with the the moon
landings and so forth and I sort of
byproduct and same with Viagra vigor was
originally intended to to help with
hypertension so in in in in the blood
but it has this other impactful effect
let me see and then ever don't be scared
of error I mean if you discover area of
your calculations you're learning
something but more substantive like
there's there's just dillion's of
examples where great inventions have
come where the inventor really didn't
quite understand what was was going on
so so this is this is a leader Forrest
who is a one of these fabulously
colorful figures who makes it fun to be
in technology so he he was around the
Turner that about a hundred years ago
and you know he's a colorful businessman
an entrepreneur he had four wise wives
he was a fraud story went to jail people
defrauded him you know big opinionated
man but he invented the the Audion which
you see here and and and and it was the
the first electronic device that you
could use to build an amplifier think
about amplifiers you know that what was
that enabled you know fantastically
impactful invention and he thought that
it worked with my sort of molecules
moving around in in the sort of rarefied
gas when in fact is not that at all its
electrons moving so he was completely
you know mistaken about how it worked
and yet he you know managed to you know
build it and you know get a lot of
mileage from it so you know don't be
scared of error now so I'd be talking
about quite abstract examples far from
Microsoft and it's at this point I've
got some fun to talk about you know one
of my distinguished colleagues this is
Don Simon who's a principal researcher
in our group in PPT and he's had a very
impactful career at Microsoft
and he he's had this strategy of garlic
going all-in to make transfers with
product teams and let me tell you a bit
of the story he his first big in first
big project was adding generics sort of
polymer polymorphic parametric types to
the dotnet runtime which was this
runtime that was developed a Microsoft
round about the year 2000 and the
initial version of it didn't have
generics and the initial versions of
programming languages like C sharp that
compiled to the CLR didn't have generics
Dom was convinced from good experience
with generic types in other
circumstances that it would be a great
addition to the platform so he led the
project to just take the source code and
just add it to two dotnet and it was a
big push to actually get it adopted
which and they eventually prevailed but
it did require him to go all-in
and sort of forego writing papers and
you know doing other sort of research
activities he had to really sort of
fully concentrate on the on the effort
and then subsequently he developed a new
programming language called F sharp that
was derived from earlier languages like
ml and he you know pushed on that and
then eventually also had to go all in it
and you know stopped doing other
research to make it popular and that's
now been you know supremely successful
in that the F sharp is now part of
Microsoft Visual Studio and it's also a
very successful open source community
that he's also created but you know a
lot of effort into fostering a community
not just into the technicalities and so
these are this is a slide he produced
with with his tips on you know being
successful in a tech transfer and this
was this was within Microsoft but I
think this would also apply if in other
companies or indeed you're trying to
sort of make an impact in the open
source world is that as a researcher you
know you've got a different background
maybe from the engineer's who have
bachelor's degrees or master's degrees
that you're working with so you
shouldn't come across in some sort of
ivory tower sort of professorial you
know academic who you need to really
respect the the practical problems that
the team is working with he advocates
doing research at the base you know
where you're going to have the most
impact so something like the dotnet
runtime is just widely used lots of
things build on top of it so if you
could add
just to that it's going to be widely
impactful across you know all the user
base of that of that systems and he
advocates you know looking at the actual
industry problems that currently exist
or the shared vision that company has at
that point it was net maybe today will
be a sure you're going to be hearing
about a sure the reason you hearing
about a sure is that azure is very much
the future of Microsoft and we want to
get people onto it so you know things
linked up so as a researcher you should
be conscious of what was important for
the company and you know and address it
and so his you know his you know clarion
call really is that can you know if
you're in that sort of situation you can
go all-in go for it
you know it's not going to be easy but
it'll be a lot of fun and you know he's
been certainly successful and I'm and it
was announced recently that he's going
to be a recipient of an extremely
prestigious medal the the silver medal
of the Royal Academy of Engineering
that's just just happening this summer
so good on dong checklists can be useful
so I advocate this this is fabulous this
is what's known as the haislmaier
catechism haislmaier himself was an
engineer and he was at DARPA in the 70s
when they were doing inventing the
internet amongst other things you know
they were doing highly powerful things
he himself as an engineer I find
incredibly inspiring in that you know
he's an electrical engineer and he
worked on the the liquid crystal display
he was you know he was in the the team
that he led the team that invented the
LCD think about that when you're all
carrying devices that have got LCDs you
probably have more than one LCD device
on you I mean it's hugely impactful but
what comment had done and I so he's a
thoughtful engineer engineers like
checklists and I think this is a great
set of questions and you know what are
you trying to do who actually cares
about it if you're successful if you
actually achieve you know the technical
problem that you're trying to solve what
impact would that have you know it's
worth thinking about what are the
midterm and final exams to check this is
a bit abstract so let's you know
back in time imagine that we are Don
Syme in the year 2000 and dotnet 1.0 has
just come out and he's thinking I'd like
to add generics so so I'm going to
answer the ten questions what are you
trying to do well he was trying to take
the benefits of tight functional
programming and enable them on nets or
things like like generics so he's got a
simple statement that would be
intelligible to the engineers you know
in the company who would decide whether
or not to adopt it so we use doesn't use
any jargon any academic jargon that they
wouldn't know about you know he's using
technical jargon but you know it's
jargon that your audience would know
about how is it done today and what are
the limits of current practice ie
what is the motivation for your
invention for your project
well she shot 100 had no generics is no
functions if no type inference so but
all those things are useful to have
there was evidence of that from other
languages so that was a good motivation
what's new and your approach and also
why do you think it's successful so the
question is looking at it's not simply
try something new do you think it'll
actually work and so you know he was so
this is sort of blending I guess F sharp
as well as C sharp so it has a lovely
simple since succinct syntax and the the
he thinks that it was if he puts
generics at the CLR then the B lot then
generics will then be allowable in lots
of other languages that want to target
it and who would care well this is
interesting so one point all of of C
sharp and net was really at that point
aimed at people building web servers I
mean that was a huge growth industry you
know in the dot-com era year 2000 and so
Microsoft wanted C sharp as a as
competition to Java to make it easy to
write websites and I think even at that
point dawn realized maybe it's not so
useful for building websites but he was
thoughtful and found customers who
really could benefit from generics in
the financial industry and then if
you're successful what difference would
it make well and then here you go to
think a bit like a business person and
you know Microsoft is a particular
platform and every computer company
wants to build a platform that draws
people in draws customers in and and and
from an ecosystem where maybe
Bella purrs come in and you know people
will write you know the developers would
produce apps on your platform and the
customers will use them and there's a
nice a virtuous circle and you get to
sell more copies of Windows so in in
this case the argument would be that by
being attracted to the financial
potential industry you've been getting
it going to get more of them and board
with the platform and then you need to
consider risks and payoffs
well one risk is that the product group
doesn't you'll go along with it and in
fact they were very resistant for a long
time and they also kind of played a very
hard bargain and put a lot of the work
onto don and his colleagues so that they
they they basically said well we'll take
it but you need to do the work so that
was a risk that he decided to put up
with and how much you really cost well
as I say Don had to go all-in on it and
you got to ask what his Don's I'm you
know enough of a resource to do this and
it turns out he was he's a great
programmer and it's not such a big
programming task you know it's a sort of
thing you can do you know the basic
thing was done in a few months and then
there was a lot of stuff around the
corner around the edges to sort out but
it was a sort of thing that one or two
people were able to do and then how long
will it take
history basic system was done in less
than a year and then what are the sort
of milestones along the way and he had
various ones like getting the thing to
compile itself get customers using it
and so forth so that's a harbor
catechism he's coming so I mean I've
spoken you know through the eyes of or
imagining myself in the eyes at Don's
sign but I mean I I recommend you you
take this catechism and apply it to your
own research it's very helpful to think
about your PhD work in in in in in these
sort of terms what are you trying to do
how is it done today
you know what's new and your approach do
you think it's going to be successful
and so forth it will help you clarify
your mind about what you're trying to do
in your in your work okay so more
strategies seek criticism and I can't um
I kind of emphasize this enough most of
us hate criticism I hate criticism you
know if you do give bad feedback on this
this lecture I'll be gutted you know be
most most upset however what you might
do is give constructive criticism you
could say and it was great but you
shouldn't walked around so much you know
if it stood in the one place I'd have
been able to pay attention or whatever
else I remember you should stop the
quarter past the hour to give us 15
minutes to get your coffee you
constructive criticism
and that's the thing but if we're
thinking about your research proposals
at all levels you know your first-year
report you know you're the sort of draft
dissertation you produce or draft
chapters you produce you should take any
opportunity that arises to get feedback
from others it's a bit painful but it's
much better to get it early than later
you know and you're turned away when
you're trying to get your PhD or your
grant proposal gets denied because
nobody really proof read it and that
does require timing so you know you
ought to time things so that you're your
draft is available you know a few days
or a week before the actual deadline so
you can get feedback to make it better
reviews so this is more a formal thing
so this as people get more senior they
have sort of management chains heads of
department or you know management
changes you know companies like this and
you have reviews where you present your
project to your your boss and your
colleagues and you know argue about what
you're trying to do and at Microsoft
nobody really forces you to do this or
only very rarely and universities it's
not very it's not often really you know
forced but actually I think it's a good
thing I think you should volunteer for
it in fact Don Simon is remarkable in
the heat regularly volunteers who
reviews obvious his projects and it you
know it's for these reasons it's it's
often easy to fool yourself it's just
the psychology you know you have got to
have a certain I'm certain almost
arrogant compulsion to sort of go in the
direction you want to go in to be
researcher you kind of brush aside
criticisms so you know we have that and
I guess we're probably not going to be
successful researchers if we don't have
that sort of bullishness about things
and but at the same time you can delude
yourself it's very easy to delude
yourself so it's really good to have a
review speak out like what you're trying
to do and and get feedback and let me
see so this is a picture of
well obviously Bill Gates meeting Roger
Needham who was the first director of
this lab and who which was founded about
15 years ago more than that where 97 oh
it's 18 almost 18 years 18 years ago now
actually July yes 18 years ago right now
this lab was founded by Roger with a
small group
and what gates said to him was that he
should hire the best people who could
get he said three things hire the best
people you can find let them do what
they want to do so trust them their
judgement about what the important
projects are but thirdly he said if all
your research was project succeed then
you Roger her field and what this means
is that what that would mean is that
Roger had been too conservative you know
he'd said well if you guys don't manage
to achieve what you're trying to do you
have gone if you don't manage to get
generics internet you know in six months
you've failed I'm going to give you a
bad review and I'm gonna cut your pay or
show you the door if Roger had kind of
given this impression that that failures
were not tolerated then people will be
very conservative they would only pick
sort of relatively easy doable projects
that maybe didn't have you know much of
an impact but would clearly would
clearly you know you know be achievable
you know like Chris Bishop likes to say
he'd much rather he ever just a
researcher come to his office and say I
want to go to the moon then someone to
come and say I want to go to Sainsbury's
it could be sure they're gonna get the
stains bruised but that's not very
interesting you know going to the moon
even if you don't get to them as far as
the moon you know if you get halfway
you're going to learn something you've
seen much rather people try you know
shooting for the stars shooting for the
moon and maybe not fully off completely
but get some interesting results and
doing something boring you know so it's
this sort of idea that any researchers
never failed it's not you're not taking
big enough risks an analogous thing is
with if you're selling things you know
if you you decide you're selling cakes
how much should charge for the cakes I
don't know charge two pounds for a cake
and you know people always buy it you
know you never have anybody complaining
what you really want to do is charge
twenty pound for the cake and have some
people coming along it's a great cake
but I don't think it's worth twenty
pounds but lots of other people do buy
it you know you're trying to find the
price you know trying to maximize your
your sort of benefit so you know
basically if you people don't ever
turned you down you're not asking for
enough it's the same sort of idea okay
moving on you know you know in academic
research life there's lots of metrics
that people will will parade out on
their CVs lots of papers zillions of
papers big count number of citations if
you got a bit of software number of
downloads
maybe memberships or your various esteem
factors like the number of times you've
been on a program committee or or
something else now you know these are
evidence of activity but you shouldn't
make them the main focus of your life
you know you as I said half an hour ago
you came into this room because you are
passionate about research about making
some sort of dent in the research
community in the world as a whole and
ident you you know when you started you
want to have fun make a difference
rather than have you know twenty papers
the papers aren't the thing the
difference that you're making in how
other people behave is it's fun is
interesting so you know I think there's
a tendency to worry about these sorts of
numbers but I can tell you I've sat on
zillions of interview panels for
postdocs for researchers here for even
professorships in universities and I can
tell you that the senior people present
always I mean they look at these numbers
but they'll always say okay those
numbers are high but are these really
good papers you know what was what was
the difference they made you know I was
at a panel recently and one person had
way more citations than everyone else
but we dug into and we said well what's
he actually done you know what what is
the you know what impact has he actually
had in the community you know he's lots
of papers but it doesn't seem to be you
know the authority on anything in
particular and so I'm trying to reassure
you don't go after these sort of proxies
think more about the impact
it's a fair point you need to have
something it's but it's like some people
some people try and publish like a dozen
papers a year and you know I've seen
that at postdoc level and and this is
sort of a bit ludicrous I think you know
people have burning themselves out and I
can't believe those are all really great
papers it's better the published you
know even one you know two or three
papers two or three strong papers a year
is much better than you know a dozen or
something
okay collaboration collaboration is is
super awesome super effective it's kind
of you know it's kind of built in
serendipity you've got someone from
ideally another field that you can you
can work with so this is Dykstra Edsger
Dijkstra great man in formal methods and
in program logic and he said only do
what only you can do so that's really if
he's saying you know if you're the
expert on logic and you're collaborating
with you know find someone if you were
trying to apply that to a particular
programming system and you're not only a
programmer you know let the other guy
right through the programming and you do
the logic you know focus on where your
talents are rather than kind of
squandering them and doing something
that you know you know you know maybe
someone with far less qualified and
talented the new could do your team
needs pigs not chickens so this is an
interesting observation that in in
collaborative work and it's really about
you need if you've got to go to
collaborative project you really want
people who are committed to the project
so why the pigs and chickens thing Andy
you might say well it's an analogy with
your breakfast plate you know you've got
your eggs and you've got your bacon and
you can you can observe that the pig was
fully committed to this plate
whereas the chicken is involved you know
I can you know walk away so if you're in
a group project you really want the
chickens people who are you know
committed to it and then there's working
across discipline so this is this is
this could be you know supremely
effective it also can be difficult so
this is Walter Scott famous Scottish
19th century novelist 1/2 the world
thinks the other daft you know we you
know people break it in all levels
people break up break up into groups and
think the other group is daft you know
in my field in programming languages the
it's not completely true but there's an
element to it I don't know occasionally
logicians think the practical compiler
guys are a bit daft because you don't
care about rigorous proofs or the
practical compiler guys I think the the
the logicians are daft because they
don't care about how fast the thing runs
and they never bothered measuring it all
they cared about was the theorem so you
know people have different values they
they think eachother daft so that's the
kind of risk if you try and collaborate
with other people another hand
subjective just convenience is for
administrators and I totally believe
this you know universities divided up
into departments you know chemistry is
different from physics I never
understood that it's the same stuff
right chemistry builds on physics it's
all about atoms and lower-level things
you know and material science is somehow
different from chemistry and physics
right there dis conveniences you know it
would be awkward for the university at
every few years the chemistry department
kind of merged with the physics
department or they bifurcated or or
whatever you know you know it but it's
not as if science is really divided up
that way so I think we should be bullish
and we should try and ignore these
divides as much as possible and try and
work across them I'm a big believer in
that
but what I would say to you is wait
until you forgot your PhD because I
think interdisciplinary PhDs is really
hard you've got to sort of learn your
trade you know get you understand the
core competence competencies of what
you're trying to do first and then it's
a postdoc or more senior maybe one
should got tenure do the
interdisciplinary stuff and finally
don't have more than one specialist per
discipline this is advice from David
Patterson the great David Patterson at
Berkeley and he irregularly
had very successful interdisciplinary
projects but he but he would never get
to logicians to say what he's the
systems guy you get to logicians in and
you know they'll argue about whether
it's a big step semantics or a small
step semantics so if you don't know what
those things are they're really just
equivalent ways of doing the same thing
but they're different right and you do
one who do the other right so you know
people will argue you know fruitlessly
as far as you're concerned so you know
pick one person to collaborate rather
than with a bunch so now I've got some
stuff aimed at theorists and then sort
of all practical people and then I will
kind of move towards talking about how
to the more if you like even spiritual
side of things about keeping your sort
of head in shape as you as you proceed
as a researcher okay so theory so this
is Robin Milner so Robin was a huge
influence to me personally I was an
undergrad Edinburgh I was around at this
lecture that he'd already launched this
Institute within the informatics school
up in Edinburgh that was back in 86 I
was a grad student and he had this he
had this double thesis that you can't
design systems without theory and refer
you can't understand what's important
about a theory unless you ground it in
practice and that's been very
influential influential in me and I
guess I would call to you if you're a
theoretician don't just worried about
the proofs and the categories and the
logic think about how it's going to make
a difference in practice and you know
Robin was very careful about that so he
had various theories here things from
the 70s things called LCF and CCS that
were sort of logics there were series of
concurrency and later on he was
thoughtful about how he could apply
those in practice and encourage other
people to do that so the programming
language ml came out of this work it was
a byproduct of very theoretical work of
getting a computer to do theorem proving
and that's ultimate have been super
impactful so coming back to dawn sign
the F shop language is ultimately based
on NL and so that came out of
theoretical work in the in the 70s
looking at more practical people I think
we can learn from this guy this is Eric
Ries and he's a entrepreneur and and he
is this is an outspoken theory of how to
do a start-up so his theory of a startup
is that it's an organ
designed to create new products and
services under conditions of extreme
uncertainty so that sounds like a
research organization to me so I think
we can learn from what he says and his
view is that learning is the essential
unit of progress for startups that when
you're early on in the startup you don't
know what the market is going to be and
so the activities you do early on are
all about trying to discover what people
want you know you can think about it in
the abstract and could yourself the
point about a startup is it's a it's an
empirical investigation it's like a
scientific investigation he says and he
talks about validated learning about
actually getting real customers and we
have some examples so here's this
concept of a Minimum Viable Product so
this is this is something you can
produce it's not the final thing you're
gonna deliver but it's a bit of software
or it's some sort of practice that you
can go through that will let you talk to
actual real customers and learn what
they want and it can be it can be
incredibly simple and my yes and my
examples are three so Dropbox you know
Dropbox of course so Dropbox they were
they were trying to do their file system
their shared file system and they
weren't quite sure what people would
want so they made a video that maybe
they had various concepts that they put
up a video that had some of the concepts
in it and they didn't immensely working
they just kind of figured out some sort
of mock-up they could put into the video
and it was hugely popular you know they
had suddenly had like 50,000 people said
I really want this so that was a kind of
idea of a Minimum Viable Product that
they got information they most 50,000
people didn't sign up you know I chance
they really wanted what Dropbox was
offering the canción so this is a
startup that was trying to figure out
they wanted eventually to build a
website that would let you order that
would let you recommend ingredients to
be bought locally for meals that you
were going to cook it was the sort of
menu advisor and they they weren't sure
what would be popular so what so what
the the founder did was he found one
customer who was prepared to give him
money
- I mean I think was $10 a week to
provide this information and what the
CEO what is that what the founder did
was just go and meet this this person
sat down with her at the kitchen table
and he basically went through the
dialogue that he imagined his website
would deliver and got her answers and
then used that to understand what she
wanted and then went from there started
doing that with more people and so
refined the what was going on the web
going to go on the website by having a
sort of end to end interaction with an
actual human so the alternative might
have been he went and built this website
that would take ages to get right get
the bugs out of it
and would have some fixed questionnaire
that was totally wrong so he and that
would you'd lose a month or two if you
did that route so instead he went
straight to the the the actual
individual and and learnt from them um
so this is the so the thing to take away
is that if you're you're doing research
and you're you're trying to understand
what actually useful to humans then you
know don't be too concerned about
rebuilding things what you want to do is
get in get into an interaction with
actual humans who would be potential
users and work out what they actually
want so you know here's the book as well
well well worth reading working with the
system
huh okay so this is really important
advice this is very pragmatic so there's
a system you can fight it or you can
work with it and my advice to you is to
work with it so there's lots of
resources at your disposal
obviously this funding bodies science
research council and so forth there's
also what Clay Shirky calls cognitive
surplus that so this is like the open
source community this is professional
educated people who have time on their
hands who would like to contribute so
scientists have discovered you're
astronomers have discovered that you
know there's lots of amateur astronomers
who would like to help classifying and
galaxies that requires you know human
human vision and so they built a system
called Galaxy Zoo that lets people sign
up and in a playful sort of way they get
to identify you know objects that have
been discovered you know in the sky and
and label them as you know one of a
number of different when it when a
different star or galaxy and so they're
able to get much much faster in this
than if they did it on their own so
think about how you might you know
enable the open source community or
other interested parties to help with
your research if you do fight the system
pick your battles very carefully you
know having the guy I mentioned earlier
he said which do you want to be the
person who changes the system or the
person who does first-class science so
for example I I know about friends who
you know the new office building in the
university and it only had whiteboards
didn't have blackboards in the chalk
they love chalk and so they battled with
the administration for months to get the
blackboard and I guess eventually they
got it but what a waste of time you know
it's it you know go with it are
whiteboards too bad most people manage
to work with whiteboards you know
there's lots of examples of that where
the system annoys you it's not really
worth putting trouble into that you
should you know work on your science and
finally invite yourself places so this
is the young Andy just after finish my
PhD and I had a paper in a conference in
Boston I tell the story people and no
one seemed everyone seems to find this
remarkable so I see what you think so my
friend said and ER in Boston why is this
go and give talks all around America and
Canada and I said I don't think that's
possible
no one ever told me that would be
possible and my friend said well they've
got lots of money Andy I mean you know
they will pay your flight they will in
fact they will put you up in a hotel
they will pay for your meals if you come
and visit they like to have visitors
coming talking about research and so I I
was in Boston so I mailed people at Yale
University
actually that was a private trip at
University of Chicago went up to Canada
and Karger II got the bus over to
Vancouver I was chased by a bear in
Calgary it was great fun went to Berkley
gave a talk there went to Bell Labs in
New Jersey in some places they didn't
just pay my expenses
they gave me an honorarium think about
that you know I took this research talk
that you know based you know from my PhD
gave it and they gave me $100 fantastic
no so so people don't tell you this but
but seriously if you've got if you get a
paper into a conference do consider you
know visiting universities roundabout
and you won't need any money
you know they will they will pay for it
they pay for you to go
okay so maintaining balance let's see
research is fantastic you know it's an
amazing opportunity but it also can be
very demanding and anxious making I mean
there's there's times of great
creativity it's also rough the papers
get rejected and it's rough you know in
in you know if there's too many
deadlines at once and ultimately once
you passed your PhD nobody's going to
tell you what to do and in fact to be
honest you've probably found this that
even as a PhD student no one's going to
tell you what to do
so that's stressful ah so I have a few
thoughts one thing is cheering you might
know this but cheering was actually a
remarkable long-distance runner
and it said that he he was working when
he was and during the Second World War
when he was working at Bletchley Park
and he was someone to see Churchill in
London he'd run 40 miles to to London
you know to give his presentation so you
know he was great marathon runner a long
distance runner you know and that you
know I think I said exampled all of us
you know we should get out of the lab
you know get some exercise you know that
really helps try to remember that you
got started because it's an awful lot of
fun you know and ask yourself you know
give yourself some space you know to
have fun and finally this is Kathleen
Fisher a colleague of mine and she's a
great deck on maintaining balance in
computer science that's at this URL and
these slides will be on the web at some
point so you'll be able to get it and I
had I don't have time to go through this
but she's got a lot of nice or useful
things to say about managing stress so
she talks about how deadlines often come
in waves we're in a short space of time
you've got to do an awful lot of things
and she's got wise words about how to
manage that and in particular I would
make sure that you chill out when you
know when it's not a whole bunch of of
deadlines and finally well not finally
but it's still in this topic of coping I
find these quotes very useful so this
this lady here is called Bronnie ware
and she was actually a nurse in a
hospice and so she said had a lot of
time with with men I think was a man
only hospice who were were dying of what
were their regrets so what we won't read
all
he's out but I find this slide useful to
look at every sloth when to sort of you
know take the pedal off a bit again we
wouldn't be in this room if it weren't
driven people and that's good you know
that makes us successful but you know
you're not gonna be successful if you
burn out at 30 so you need to you know
keep in touch with your feelings keep in
touch with friends don't work so hard
all right coming back to another
checklist and I'm always done so this
guy is Matt might herb and he is a great
blog and he's a programming language guy
and he's got a great set of resolutions
for grad students so I write this as a
recommendation I have to you a call to
action go away put in your calendar to
do one of these every month so in
January you look at when the important
deadlines are so you can be planful and
chatting in February look at your
productivity look at your office see if
you can arrange things look at your
commute to see what you can arrange tidy
up embrace the comfortable uncomfortable
in March what that means is if you're a
theoretician write some code if you're a
theoretician prove a theorem upgrade
your tools in April you know maybe you
get some new latex macros tidy stuff up
a bit you know take a little bit of
downtime to get stuff together
stay healthy follow the lead of cheering
go to the gym run to London whatever in
June update your CV think about
potential jobs think about internships
networking in July
so maybe just think about who you're
going to reach out to I like this one I
think August say thanks so if there's a
paper that you loved why not send an
email to the author saying I love this
paper you know it actually it'll feel
good and the person receiving it will
love it volunteer for a talk many of us
don't like giving talks but it gets
better with practice you need practice I
better to do it earlier in your career
than later practice writing so maybe
take up a blog do something know I do
sort of non-technical writing such as a
blog checking with committee or the
people are going to examine you
you know the your supervisors your
supervisors
you know just understand where they are
maybe get their feedback on where you're
at and keep an eye on the job market and
I put that here because if you're grad
students one thing you should know is if
you'd like to come here to do an
internship so this is now is the height
of the internship season you know all
the interns have arrived
I think if some interns in the room our
deadlines are usually in January
February I think it was Valentine's Day
this year but that means that if you go
to chance if you want to have a chance
of getting them you should be getting in
touch with researchers in December you
won't get hired unless a single
individual researcher says I want you so
you need to get you need to have a
spread of potential candidates who will
hire you so try and get in touch with
them individually in December would be
my advice okay so now if some homework
I've got two minutes and then I'll take
questions here's your homework and this
is about setting boundaries so the first
one is about or it's about boundaries
the first one's about setting boundaries
for yourself so I think we all get a bit
overwhelmed with work we're not very
good at time management so my my
recommendation for you or my homework
for you is to manage your email time
better learn this strategy if any email
comes in do the four DS either delete it
at once if it's not useful delegate if
you can find someone else might be hard
as a grad student but maybe you know
he'll do it for you
do it right then and there it's going to
take a minute otherwise defer it but
then plan when your plans have time when
you're going to defer it switch off
notifications you don't leave these
pop-ups they're just distracting they
burn into your concentration and switch
off email at weekends so that you've got
some clarity so there you're choosing
your boundary and then the second bit of
homework is I told you about the speedy
ating Society that was so great I would
like you to empower yourself by going
back to your university to your
department and organize a speed-dating
Society and tell them that you were
forced to do it that Andy Gordon said
you had to do it it's really not that
hard you you it's useful to do because
you'll forge new connections in your in
your in your department people take
notice of you and maybe give you more
interesting tasks as well and if I be
interesting and fun you're learning how
to plan and lead a meeting and you take
a professional initiative it's something
you can put in your CV make
more employable when you come to finish
your PhD so hands up who will go and do
it come on go for it hands up
we've got one okay send me an email when
you do it fantastic okay so that's it
and that means you're crossing a
boundary so that's a summary that's all
I've got
thanks for your attention have a great
career well I guess that that's maybe
really aimed at someone once you're once
you've got your PhD and you're you're
choosing the sort of research goals you
do there I think as a grad student you
need to build up a lot of skills and so
some of that is involved involved you
know copying what other people have done
making small variations you're trying to
get yourself to a point I suppose where
you've got a specific set of research
skills that will that you should really
be able to you should be using you know
as opposed to doing you know things that
were you know any wait anybody anybody
can do
