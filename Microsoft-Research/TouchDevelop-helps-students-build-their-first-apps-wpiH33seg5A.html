hi there I'm tomball I'm a research
manager at Microsoft Research and I know
man into the research and software
engineering area one of the things we
really work on hard it's how to make
programmers productive and lately we've
been thinking about how to enlarge the
scope of who can program my name is
Pelle I'm from the touch develop team
what we did in the touch develop project
is we wanted to bring the the joy of
programming of early computers those
8-bit computers from the 80s back into
the modern smartphones yeah so
essentially what we did we came up with
a with a new way of entering programs
directly on the only smartphone so you
can actually do it easily with a you
know a single finger my name is Michael
Braun and we are here at Rainier Beach
High School in the south end of Seattle
update was a great success because we
had 17 schools and over 500 students and
they were working online games that were
interesting for them that were relevant
in their lives these are games that they
download on their smartphone tablet
laptop and they're actually spending the
day creating those games themselves so
they're becoming a lot more than
consumers of technology very creators of
it
