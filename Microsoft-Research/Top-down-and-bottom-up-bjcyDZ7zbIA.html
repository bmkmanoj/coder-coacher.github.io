programs to achieve the highest level of
cognitive performance to outperform
humans not simply to match human
performance it turns out that there are
several ways in in which that can be
done for example in the even in the
earliest days of AI some really
spectacular things were done in in the
very first heuristic program that was
ever done in AI produced a proof of one
of the theorems in Whitehead and
Russell's principia mathematica that was
much better than Whitehead and Russell's
proof on the other hand in the earliest
days people like Raj Reddy were working
from the bottom up and that work led to
at Carnegie Mellon the development of a
wonderful problem-solving model called
the blackboard framework which I then
picked up in expert systems and in fact
the hardest project I ever accomplished
was accomplished using that framework so
it what I'm saying is that it's not like
one can say we're condemned to do
bottom-up work we're drawing insights
from all over that spectrum the the car
people when they did the self-driving
car did the second of the Grand
Challenges the one the urban challenge
driving around a city I went to them and
asked the sort of the chief engineer of
that project told him I was going to
hold a workshop on AI and robotics in
Japan he said tell him that we needed a
higher level of understanding which
means the bottom-up people were saying
we need the things that the the
knowledge representation folks and
and reasoning folks have been developing
so to me it's it's a big unity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
