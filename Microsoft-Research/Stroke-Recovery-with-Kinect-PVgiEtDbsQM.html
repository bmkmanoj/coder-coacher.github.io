National University have created a
research project called stroke recovery
with Kinect it's a cost-effective
interactive home rehabilitation system
promoter recovery after a stroke and was
built using the Microsoft Kinect for
Windows software development kit stroke
recovery with Connect uses the Kinect
sensors three-dimensional camera to
capture skeletal movements of the
patient performing the therapy the
system interprets the data to measure
and evaluate a patient's progress in
three game like exercises the classic
box and block test exercise evaluates
patients coordination gross manual
dexterity and motor skills as they
virtually attempt to pick up blocks one
by one and put them into a box in a set
amount of time the program displays
patients scores providing immediate
reinforcement of a patient's progression
the second exercise challenges the
patient to assume a target pose
displayed on the computer monitor and
then duplicate the targets position as
it moves the patient receives what is
known as a fugle mayer assessment score
based on his or her success the final
program is an outer space game that
enables patients to exercise their
reflex and reaction abilities as they
guide a spaceship through space while
attempting to avoid oncoming asteroids
the application tracks the stroke
patients hand trajectory and notes
variations in movement of the elbow and
shoulder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
