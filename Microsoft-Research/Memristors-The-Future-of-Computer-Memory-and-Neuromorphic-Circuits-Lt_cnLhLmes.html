good afternoon everyone my name is
panayotis Uryu I'm currently a fellow at
Imperial College the Department of
bioengineering
and today I will talk about the
memristor which is the focus of my
research and focusing on theoretical
aspects of ministers and also on
modeling device of memristors so the
memristor is a new fundamental circuit
element which although it was proposed
in the 70s it was only very recently
discovered by HP the reason why took us
so long to discover the memristor it's
because the phenomena hijiri give rise
to memory stirs appear on the nano scale
and the reason why the memristor is so
interesting is because there are many
potential applications for memory stirs
I have divided my presentation to three
sections we will begin first with a
short tutorial about the memristor
as as a an ideal circuit element then I
will go through some practical memory
sitive devices and finally I will
discuss some of the applications of of
memory stirs so in classical circuit
theory we have four fundamental circuit
variables we have the current the
voltage the charge and the flux linkage
if you say by looking at the diagram you
can see that we can combine these four
variables in six pairwise relations five
of these relations are well known and
some of you may be very familiar with
them the first two pairs define the
voltage and the current so the voltage
is defined as the rate of change of flux
linkage and the current is defined as
the rate of change as the rate of change
of charge there are three pairs defined
the fundamental circuit variables we
have the resistor which curve which
relates the voltage with the current the
capacitor which relates the voltage with
the charge and also we have the inductor
which relates the current with the flux
linkage
these are the three fundamental circuit
elements and there and there and there
are also passive elements the resistor
the capacitor and the inductor they are
passive because they don't they do not
require internal power source to operate
and they are also fundamental because we
cannot reproduce their behavior with
other fundamental passive circuit
elements you may have noticed from the
diagram that an element is missing in
order to fill this to complete the
symmetry launcher in 1971 realized that
out of the six possible pairwise
combinations only five had been
identified so he proposed in memory
store as the element relating the charge
and the flux in order to fill the
missing link
although it was proposed in the in 1971
the mystery remain unobserved for
several decades it was only very
recently in 2008 that the first memory
sitive device was identified in HP labs
this happened while researchers at HP
were experimented for built-in molecular
scale electronics and when they were
doing the other experiments they
observed these peculiar current voltage
responses which they managed to explain
using an investor model after the
accidental rediscovery of the memristor
essentially the field of no misters I
was revived again the Mystics devices
have many attractive properties such as
nanoscale dimensions low power
consumption and non-volatile memory this
makes them suitable for many
applications such as computer memories
programmable circuits and neuromorphic
circuits because of this nice properties
for memory stirs they have attracted the
attention of many leading companies in
technology in the technology sector for
example H a cooperation between HP and
hynek's is planned to release commercial
based memory stirs by the end of 2014
in 2015 also IBM is experiment with
phase change memories and they're also
working on the synapse project who is
aiming to build neuromorphic circuits
using memory Steve devices also the
international technology roadmap for
semiconductor is suggesting that these
devices may be candidates for replacing
the recurrent memory technologies which
has are soon reaching the end of their
life so the name name mister is a
combination to work it's a memory and a
resistor so as its name indicates the
man mister behaves similarly to a
nonlinear resistor in the sense that it
opposes the flow of charge in the same
way as a resistor does the resistance of
the investor is called named resistance
and it has the same units as as the
resistor which is ohms the difference is
that the memristor has non-volatile
memory so it's resistance value changes
permanently depending on how much charge
has flown through the device as long as
we keep applying the input signal across
the memristor the device keeps changing
its name resistance once the input
signal is removed the memristor will
maintain its main resistance
indefinitely or until we apply the input
signal again if we want to reverse the
the main resistance of the device then
we have to apply an appropriate input
for a proper duration of time of the
opposite polarity here here I have
included a comparison between the
resistor and the memristor linear
resistors that are described by Ohm's
law which is a which essentially says
that the voltage the output voltage of
the device is equal to the to the
resistance multiplied by the input
current in this case the resistance is
constant so for example if we double the
input signal for a constant resistance
then we will double the output as well
in the case of a memory stirrer the
misters are also described by Ohm's law
however in this case the memory stance
is variable actually the armistice is a
function of the charge or the flux
linkage I have included here an example
where you can see how a variable memory
stands which looks like so that the
function in the square brackets is
describes the memory stance as I haven't
mentioned in a previous slide because
the the rate of change of charge is
equal to the current so it's equivalent
to saying that the charge is equal to
the entire past history of the input
current if we use this idea inside Ohm's
law and we substitute the charge with
this integral here we can see that the
main resistance depends on the entire
past history of the input current so in
other words the investor has memory
memristors can be combined in series and
parallel networks in the same way that
the resistors can and actually they
follow the same rules when we want to
evaluate the total resistance of the
network for example in a series network
of non mistress if we want evaluate the
total main resistance it is equal to the
sum of the individual memories instances
and and as you can see here this exactly
same as for resistors but in this case
the total man resistance is a function
of the church and similar loose rules
apply for pal networks as well here you
can see the response of an investor to a
sinusoidal input signal the response is
always limited to the first and and
third quadrant which indicates that the
device is passive so it means that it
does not require internal power source
to operate also the misting is always
bounded between a minimum and the
maximum resistance value which we refer
to as our own and our off also the
response is always crosses the origin
which means that once the input signal
is removed is removed from this device
then the output is always forced to zero
also as the frequency of the input
increases
the memristor degenerates to a linear
resistor and avenged and and eventually
it becomes a linear resistor so in
practice the the resistor Israel is the
limit of the minister at high
frequencies so let's see now how we can
use a an ideal memristor as a single
memory cell to store for binary values
the first question that we need to
answer is how how can we map the four
binary values on the memristor to do
this we have to select for discrete
resistance state and associate each one
of them with with one of the binary
values for example here I have associate
the value 0 0 with the resistance arm R
0 0 and the binary value 0 1 with the
resistance R 0 0 1 and so on so then the
next question is how we can write one of
these four binary values onto the
memristor cell let's assume initially
that the the the number easily is at its
minimum resistance state our own and
also that we want to write the value 3
which is mapped on the resistance r1
zero so to do this we have to drive the
device in such a way so that we switch
it from it's our own state to the
resistance r1 0 this is equivalent to
saying that an amount of charge Delta Q
has to flow through the device so in
order to write this value we have to
apply an input signal which of
appropriate polarity such that the the
divide the device switches from r1 to r1
0
so the next question is how can we read
the stored value from the from this
device in theory applying any signal on
an ideal memory store will affect its
state however in practice most practical
devices have a threshold this means that
if we drive the device below this
threshold then we don't we we do not
affect its state so in order to read
safely the value stored on the device
you have to apply an input signal which
is always below this predefined
threshold value so this brings me to the
next part of the presentation in which I
will present some practical memory stick
devices as you can see from the picture
memory stores are nanoscale devices
unlike the conventional resistor
capacitor inductor it is quite unlikely
that will have large-scale memristors
also you can see from the picture that
the example here is approximately 60
nanometers thick to understand how small
this is just imagine that 1.5 nanometer
is equivalent to two silicon atoms there
are many physical mechanisms which give
rise to ballistic behavior they usually
go under the term resistance switching
devices or mechanism I will I will
describe some indicative examples in the
in the next few slides the important
thing to remember from this matrix is
that all of them share some common
characteristics all of these devices are
two terminal devices and their nano
scale the now scale dimensions are very
important because when an input signal
is applied across these devices very
strong electric fields developed which
cause various phenomena which have L as
a result the change in the resistance of
the device also the resistance change in
all of these devices is electrically
induced this means that the input and
output of the device is always current
or voltage finally the resistance change
is non-volatile so when when the input
signal is removed from these devices
they maintain
their state for some time HP provides a
simple model in order to describe their
first memory Steve devices although the
although the model is very simplified it
captures the main characteristics of the
minister's the actual device consists of
the titanium dioxide layer between two
platinum electrodes the oxide layer is
divided into two regions adopt low
resistivity region and a nun dot high
resistivity region the total resistance
the device is modeled by two variable
resistors in series whose ratio depends
on the width of the doped region when an
input signal is applied across the
device the oxygen vacancies move inside
the device effectively changing the
total mm resistance of the of the device
during the No so basically when when the
oxygen vacancies move the width of the
width here changes and so so this
resistor here becomes larger and this
one becomes smaller so the total
resistor becomes small okay basically
imagine that we have two variable
resistors one has low resistance and one
has a high resistance and this boundary
here controls how large is each one of
these two resistors and as when this
boundary so when this boundary here
grows towards the adopt region it means
that the low resistance resistor is
larger so the total resistance becomes
smaller
the first example of device that will
describe are the redox based devices
these are devices in which the memristor
loses or gain gains in charge carriers 3
adduction and oxidization according to
the international technology roadmap
these are one of the most promising
technologies that they may replace the
we currently use technologies for memory
devices the actual device consists of a
metal insulator metal structure which is
similar to the picture they have shown
for the HP model and when an input
signal is applied across these devices
three types of structural changes affect
the conductivity of the device one
possibilities for a single filament to
grow a lot possibilities for multiple
filaments to grow and a lot of
possibilities for a uniform from to
develop the uniform from is actually the
picture that I've shown for the HP model
so these structural changes are a result
of various phenomena such as
electrochemical metallization violence
change and thermal chemical mechanisms
here you can see how a single filament
looks like these films are essentially
high conductivity passed through through
which charge carriers can easily flow
their diamond and diameter is usually 1
to 2 nanananana meters
which indicates the scalability of these
devices also in a device with multiple
filaments the a large number of
filaments mean lower resistance here you
can see how a uniform front looks like
the darker region in the picture
indicates the low resistance due to due
to table doping when I input signal is
applied on the device the low resistance
region grows uniformly towards the
negative electrode and this has as a
result the total total resistance of the
device to decrease this is exactly the
picture that the HP model describes
other example our phase-change memories
these devices have a similar structure
to the redox devices but when an input
signal is applied across the device the
resistive material is heated and
discussed the the material to change
phase between an amorphous reduce of
high resistance to a crystal which is of
low resistance in say it is also
possible by a properly controlling the
input signal to to maintain these
devices at an intermediate state a poly
crystalline state which the mixture of
both phases and this indicates the
potential of this device to be used for
multi bit storage so storing more than
one bit per memory cell according to the
international technology roadmap these
are product typical devices which are
for which we have working prototypes
another example of a memory stick
mechanics is electromigration
in this case the resistance change
happens due to changes in the geometry
of the device the device actually a very
simple is only a nun wire so when an
input signal is applied across these
devices ions move within the nanowire
because of the electrostatic force
forces or because of collisions with
other charge carriers due to the ion ion
migration the shape of the nanowire
changes you can see the initial state
here and after the inputs are applied
and this has as a result for the total
resistance of the device to change this
is a very extremely slow process so it
is quite unlikely that we will see it in
future memory devices the final example
huija we have included for devices is
spintronics devices in these devices the
flow of currents control is controlled
depending on the spin of the electrons
the device consists of a ferromagnetic
and a semiconductor the Ferrum actor the
ferromagnetic septs electrons of only of
of one spin and so the electrons of the
opposite spin are not allowed to go
through
and accumulating the semiconductor
forming a cloud this clog in the
semiconductor opposes the flow of charge
of electrons and as the size of the
cloud increases the opposition becomes
larger and at a critical value no
current can flow through the device in
this table here compares the new
technologies with current technologies
met with current memory technologies it
divided the cogniser divided in baseline
prototypical and emerging technologies
baseline technology essentially the
memory technology which we currently use
for memories for typical our technology
work for which we have working
prototypes and emerging technologies are
technologies for which we we are still
at the research stage the table here
compares the current and projected
performance of this technology in
various aspects such as feature size
Salaria read time ride erase time
retention time write cycles right
voltage read voltage and write energy I
have used three different currents to
indicate with green the first best
performance with yellow the second best
performance and with red the third best
performance you can see here that redox
based devices and also phase change
devices and in some extent spintronic
devices here are projected to be at
least as good as current technologies or
possibly better this table here compares
the future prospects of new technologies
but in different aspects on the previous
table here the technology are classified
according to their scalability their
potential for building multi-level cells
reintegration fabric fabrication cost
and also endurance you can see here that
again redox based devices and phase
change memories in some extent
spintronic devices are again the winners
among the new technologies the most
commonly used architecture for building
the arrays of memristors is the nano
crossbar architecture in this
architecture the memristor array
consists of two parallel layers of nano
wires which are placed perpendicular to
each other at the cross point at the
point of intersection of these nano
wires with the appropriate material is
placed which is acting as the as the
memristor
the two electrodes at IG at each cross
point can be used to individually
address and configure these memory stirs
here you can see the schematic and also
pictures from a microscope of one kilo
bit crossbar array these the actual
array consists of a top silver layer a
middle layer of amorphous silicon and
the bottom layer of polysilicon the
important feature of this array is that
it is compatible the CMAs fabrication
process these are is a very important
feature for for for these devices
because it means that fabrication labs
do not have to upgrade their existing
production lines in order to fabricate
these devices so in the end it reduces
the cost of fabricating fabricate eating
them
as I have said in the first part of my
presentation the misters are passive
devices this means that they cannot
provide energy any subsequent parts of
the circuit so in order to make them
more useful a possible solution is to
combine them with layers of active
active components in other words the
transistors in this way we benefit from
both worlds on the one hand we have the
functional flexibility of transistors
and on the other hand we have the high
density low power and non-volatile
memory of memristors there are several
examples of redox based devices and
phase change device which can be
integrated with the CMOS technology
depend on how we divide the
functionality between the two layers we
end up with different variation of the
hybrid CMOS memory store architecture
but all of them are based on the same
principle we have two layers the top
layer with memristors and the bottom
layer with CMOS transistors for example
in the CMO el architecture memory stirs
participate also in the logic
computation so you can see that in the
bottom CMOS layer we have we need only
one type of gates and the number of
gates is more it's more dense on the on
the second example the fpi architecture
memory stirs participate only in the
rewiring of the of the CMOS gates so in
order to implement the logic we need a
larger variety of gates but these
results to a smaller number of gates on
the CMOS layer because the see most
technologies is quickly reaching its
physical limits and scientists allow are
looking for alternative ways in order to
extend its lifetime without requiring
any further shrinking of the transistors
the hybrid architecture which I have
shown in the previous slide may be a
possible solution for extending the
lifetime of C of the CMOS process
without requiring any further shrinking
of the transistors the idea here is that
we transfer some of the functionality
from the CMOS layer in a memory Steve
layer in order to take advantage of
these nanoscale devices and also we can
stack several of the of this device on
top of each other in 3d architecture and
also it it is possible to build
multi-level cells so store more than one
bit per cell in the final part of my
presentation will discuss about some of
the applications of memory stirs have
divided the applications in digital and
analog the division is based on on
weather and on how the mm resistance of
the device is utilized in digital
application in the individual
application only only in this and
discrete number of resistance state is
used on the original in analog
applications
we use a complete resistance change
between a minimum the maximum values all
the digital applications are based based
on the same principle we have a mMmmm mr
cell which can be configured to two or
more discrete resistant states each
resistance state is used to represent a
binary value so the most obvious
applications is to build is to build by
stable or multi stable memory cells in
this way by using memristors as memory
cells we utilize their small dimensions
and non volatility in order to build
high density and low power memories and
what potential applications is for
digital computation we can use an array
of memory stirs in order to to implement
boolean logic because memory stirs are
are passive elements we we need to
implement fundamentally different
computational paradigms in order to
implement boolean logic some of these a
project approaches are wire and logic
threshold logic and implication logic
the best approach is implication logic
which uses the implication operator
because it is the only one who use
computational complete this means that
the implication operator is able to
implement all the boolean functions the
final develop Legation whichever I have
included is configurable fill FPGA like
circuits fill programmable gate arrays
are essentially circuits which consists
of general-purpose logic and Mary memory
blocks which which are connected through
a reconfigurable wiring with each other
we can use these circuits to implement
any kind of boolean function and there
which is limited only by the number of
gates which exist and on the chip
the idea is to exploit the advantage of
memristors by transferring some of the
functionality into annalistic layer for
example you can implement the memory
blocks
logic blocks or the look-up tables which
implements the digital functions and
also the circuitry which implements the
rewiring of the logic blocks the digital
application of memristors mostly use the
properties of memories in order to
improve improve on existing applications
however in an hour ago applications
memory search can be can be used to
enable new modern conventional
applications one of the most interesting
applications is neuromorphic circuits
these circuits artificial neural
networks which are implementing how
hardware and they are used to emulate
some of the functionality of the human
or animals brain here we exploit the
fact that memory stirs behave very
similarly to the biological synapse the
synapse in our brain is what implements
the learning so a limb a synapse
determines how strong is a connection
between two neurons and whether one
neuron with propagate the signal towards
another neuron depending on how
frequently how strongly one neuron fires
towards another neuron the synapse
adjust its weight and by and by by
calculator or a nonlinear function which
takes it into account the past history
of the input signal this this this
behavior is very similar to the
resistance which which adjust its memory
stance depending on the entire past
history of the input signal our brain
has thousands of synapses per neuron and
also it has millions of neurons per
square centimeter
the current CMOS technology I cannot
reach this high density of of neurons
person of Sinope spear neuron because of
power and space limitations so this the
suggested alternative here here is to
implement the neurons using CMOS
transistors which are which are
relatively sparse ER in such circuits
and and use the nanoscale memristors to
implement the synapse for which we
require higher densities an example for
for which this has already been used but
in simulations is to emulate the v1
cortex of the human brain which is part
of our visual system other potential
another application of memristors are
chaotic circuits where memories can be
used to trigger card constellations sell
your neural networks where they can be
used as the programmable template
weights and convertible analog circuits
where they can be used as programmable
resistors in such circuits essentially
by adjusting the value of the memristor
we are adjusting some some feature of
the circuit suggest oscillation
frequency gain and threshold a final
application which I have included is how
we can use a memory stir grid to solve a
maze puzzle the first step is to map the
grid the maze onto the grid of
memristors now when the maze intersects
the grid of memristor at some point we
assume that this memristor are
disconnected from the grid we assume
initially that all the resistors or the
memristors in the gate are at their high
resistance stage in order to find the
solution of the maze we apply an input
signal across the entrance of the maze
and that and the axis exit of the maze
after some time the solution of the maze
will be the the path in which the
members have switched to their low
resistance state if there if the maze
has multiple solutions we have to apply
the signal longer and then the multiple
paths will will appear as well
the shorter path will be the one with
the lowest resistance this concludes my
presentation in which a I have discussed
in a mister a new fundamental circuit
element which brings under the same
umbrella or resistance which memory
devices a big challenge in the field of
memory so still
means the development of a circuit
theory for analyzing and roosters and
this actually one of the focus of my
research and by developing such a theory
we may be able to use a uniform framer
to design and predict how this resistive
this resistive memory devices can work
and be designed also by understanding
this devices better we may be able to to
suggest more radical applications from
registers what has certainly happened
with the discovery of the mister is that
diamond research has has told us that
the fundamental circuit elements are not
limited to the resistor inductor and
capacitor actually not only there is a
fourth fundamental circuit element but
Lehnsherr went as far as proposing that
there is an infinite amount of circuit
elements two of these circuit elements
are the main capacitor and the NAM
inductor imagine imagine if we have at
our disposal memory memory configurable
capacitors configurable inductors and
configurable resistors how flexible and
versatile circuits we would be able to
build we may be able to build a fully
configurable analog circuit although
memorization and mem inductors can have
not been identified in the lab with
certainty we have seen several examples
of memory steve devices also we have
seen that some of these devices are able
to compete with current technologies and
maybe they're able to overcome overcome
them in performance it is important it
is important for the for the progress of
the field for some of these technologies
to become standardized this will
provides with a scientist with with some
standard technology to experiment with
and it's also the best interest of the
industry who is always looking for
alternative ways for improving the
performance of their products
thank you for your intention I would
like also to thank Karen and I - not for
organizing this presentation if you have
any questions I will be happy to answer
stability of the devices to external
things like temperature and static
electric fields of varying natures how
stable are we talking about as a device
if we're talking about experimental
devices don't they're not very stable
but there are devices that are quite
stable they can maintain their state for
quite a long time yeah yeah maybe up to
let's say 80 degrees Celsius yeah
binary values what how many district'
discrete resistances can be read off a
device currently and I presume there's
some subtract to limit their own so the
limits how reliably work you can
distinguish one state from another I
think for now we were unable to start to
basically one by one bit per cell but we
believe that there's capability of
storing more bits per cell but reliably
only two at the moment
if you keep the temperature at the you
know these mean temperature and there's
no interference is there drift in these
devices meaning you're right and will
that move it stayed even if there are no
changes in the environment at all
there's no change in the resistance once
you stop replying that voltage or there
is a drift in the device so I think the
question is to ask is what is the
application that we use the memory for
if you wanted to as a computer memory
then you need a device that is stable
for a very long time
but for example in neuromorphic cycles
you need devices that are stable for
shorter times because we also we want to
implement learning but also forgetting
so it's actually an our benefit for the
device to lose its memory in some
applications and there are examples of
both extremes getting rate so very
example of device where you can control
the the forgetting rate depending on the
size of the device so you change
slightly the size of the device and then
the forgetting rate changes slightly as
well they take to which position and
will decay back to so guys where you
could store as it were prior in the sort
of zero positions if you see what I mean
and then updater and it what could you
could you configure insulating with the
each each other limb with the K back to
a predetermined value so you indicate
its lowest resistance so you fabricate
device that you know that it has this
low resistance and that's the way we
stop the king</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
