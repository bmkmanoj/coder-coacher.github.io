good predictor of the future today with
global climate change that's simply no
longer possible so we need to have new
ways of being able to understand what
will happen that means new models models
must be informed by data data is a
digital watershed this is really the
first generation in which data is not by
and large taken by hand it comes from a
computer it comes from a sensor so it
begins data much like the explosion in
digital pictures our research project
with Microsoft focused initially on the
Russian River as the digital watershed
there were interested parties the water
resources were challenging in terms of
allocation for people for fish for
farming and the group's all were looking
for innovative solutions the issue was
building a digital watershed is that
there is a lot of data now out there so
we went to talk to Jim Gray at microsoft
research because his his experience in
the database community and applying
databases to scientific problems was was
really germane to a lot of what we were
trying to do and through Jim we met
Catherine and Catherine's started to get
involved her background in hydrology
combined with her background in computer
science enabled her to really cross the
divide in helping to interpret a lot of
the science needs and science questions
into the computer science and exactly
what did that mean and what we should
what should we provide as the
infrastructure the Russian River
watershed has numerous land use in it
the vineyards expand in the watershed
water use in in the Russian River Basin
has shifted demands and the population
of increase of shifted and so they're
really approaching a problem of how are
they going to provide the water they
need to grow their vines and their
grapes at the same time of serving the
other needs such as restoring migratory
fish one of the really nice aspects of
of having the data in this sort of
architecture that we do and having it
out in the cloud and having all of the
infrastructure to make it very easy
to look at that data and to walk through
that data and reorganize that data very
quickly is that you can sort of over
coffee ask a question and wonder about
whether or not a particular phenomena is
occurring and actually do the early
investigation and figure out whether it
whether it looks like it is or isn't I
could do these calculations myself in
the matter of hours using five to ten
different stream gages five different
precipitation stations and have an
ability to understand what I was doing
check the quality of the data all
through the data cube rather than the
original source on the web the
observations of the dips and flow rate
of the Russian River have encouraged the
State Water Resources Control Board to
come back to the the vineyards to the
water managers in the Russian River
Basin to ask them to think about how you
can do things differently and so they
are in fact rethinking how they do frost
protection for agricultural crops part
of the analysis will be do you have off
stream storage of water that you can
draw upon rather than taking it directly
from the river do you institute better
meteorological measurements to really
predict will it in fact be a frosting
morning through working with Catherine
and with Jim huntin and with our team we
were able to bring together all the
expertise that was needed to understand
their problems formulate the questions
from them bring the data to bear and
then come back through all the way
through with the answers to those
questions we've been running the
watershed and maintaining the watershed
now for I think it's about four years
and the collaboration is growing we as
an artifact of simply having data in one
place in which you can ask the questions
we start an engagement with the National
Marine Fisheries folks which has led to
some interesting work looking at frost
dips it's led some interesting work
trying to link the digital watershed
with maps for visualization so work on
both on the science side and on the
computer science
it's also led to other engagements with
other scientists we're using the same
based technology in work with the
National soil carbon group and with a
flux net group what I really love about
my job and the work in the Berkeley
water center is that I think that
actually I'm sitting at the right time
in the right place to help change how
science is done by taking date a problem
of handling data off the table making it
easy can inform o'clock oceans that
inform a class of policy studies so that
we're moving from antidote oh well I was
walking the river and I think I saw two
data looking at 2001 seeing frost dips
and knowing that they were there
