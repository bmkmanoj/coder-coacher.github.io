hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
welcome to the technically the 11th
tequesta this is our 10th anniversary
but we have had 11 tech recess I
remember fondly coming here for the
first tech Vista a long time ago i was
doing cycles job but they made me dress
in fancy suits in those days but i'm
glad we have gotten rid of that but
anyway good morning to all of you it's a
pleasure to see so many young faces in
the audience actually some mix pleasure
because it just reminds me how old I
would become but I remember when I was
your age and enthusiasm I had for
computer science and electrical
engineering and that sort of stuff so I
am so glad you're here I'm going to give
you a brief introduction to Microsoft
Research i am going to touch upon a
little bit about what what activities we
do in microsoft research in general and
in India in particular and about some of
the programs that we have which might be
of interest to you and I will give you a
brief outline of the rest of the day
psychos will introduce each speaker and
each panelist in much more great much
more detail okay who are we we are
basically a collection of world-class
researchers and scientists we are spread
all over the world on multiple
continents in multiple countries but no
matter where we are and who we are we
have a shared mission we are all doing
what we believe is a shade trying to
achieve a shared goal what is our
mission our mission has largely remained
unchanged since the founding of
microsoft research in 1991 be restated
in different ways but fundamentally
there are three things that we try to do
first thing and the foremost thing that
we try to do is to advance the state of
the art in the fields that we do do
researching now we don't do research in
every field in computer science but we
do a substantially large subset of of
areas in cavero science and we excel in
all of them we are at the forefront of
most of the conference's academic
conferences we produce top-notch
researchers in each field who won who
win lots of
awards and so on and so forth so
fundamentally we are advancing the sale
of the field in every every area that we
work in second we would like to make
sure that the innovations that we bring
about benefit the company and we try to
affect the products of the company by
transferring innovative ideas into the
product groups we have had a long
history of doing that there is hardly
any product that Microsoft the ship that
has not been affected by some of the
work that we have done in research and
we are very very proud of it finally we
also access Scouts for Microsoft we are
the eyes and ears of Microsoft looking
ahead trying to understand what are the
disruptive technologies what are the
disruptive trends that technology throws
up this is a fast-moving world as you
know and things happen that corporations
need to reactive and we are in many ways
be Microsoft Research are in many ways
the discounts for the corporation labs
we have lab scattered all over I am NOT
going to walk you through each one of
them as I said the first one was founded
in redmond and India was founded in 2005
the researchers counts are not exactly
it was right at the time i took the
snapshot we basically have over 700 PhDs
very high quality talent as i mentioned
in the previous slide you might think
you might ask why is Microsoft Research
distributed worldwide why not just put
it near the mothership in redmond in in
in the united states first and foremost
we go where the talent is the mountain
will go to Mohammed if needed so we go
where the talent is and talent as you
know is widespread all over the all over
the all over the world so we are in
multiple continents where there is
talent we also go where there are
university connections we often locate
research labs in centers of near centers
of learning we have a lot of talent in
India a lot of university connections in
India we are here in India we are in
cambridge england next to the next to
the University and so on and so forth
sometimes we locate a lab in a
particular geographical area because it
gives us a better understanding of how
to do a certain kind of research for
example language based research if you
want to do natural language processing
it sometimes handy to be in a country
that has over 20 official languages so
you know we do a lot of NLP work in
India we also do certain work that has
societal impact things that usually go
under the rubric of ict4d or technology
for emerging markets so for example in
India we do we do we do those kinds of
research and we find it more appropriate
to do these kinds of research in areas
that have a need for them where the
climate is correct that we can actually
test our ideas at scale and we also go
where the next billion users are we have
significant growth in the usage
population in both India and China and
we are located there for the obvious
reasons the research areas in Microsoft
I earlier on I said we are we have
world-class researchers doing work in a
variety of areas the variety of areas is
actually quite quite a lot and I am NOT
going to cover all of them we can do at
least research in at least 50 areas
please go to our website and you can see
a large number of areas when we do
research our ideas are mostly curiosity
based it's driven by ideas and
technology not based on product or
business strategy we sometimes do take
our knowledge and apply it to short term
trends in the market for example there
is a lot of work you know flash devices
have become a common mode of storage and
we have done a lot of work on innovative
uses of flash but we also do a highly
speculative work which take a long long
time for example in quantum computing we
don't know how the the world is going to
shape up in the next 15 20 years so we
do work in very speculative areas as
well in Microsoft Research we have a lab
of about 50 to 60 people but we work on
a variety of areas and I am NOT going to
cover all of them they
we do work from foundations of computer
science we do distributed systems
systems work we do natural language
processing machine learning and so on
and so forth there are many many areas
we also have a group of engineers that
do advanced development we also have
applied scientists who work closely with
the product groups so I and we have
something called microsoft research
outreach which I'll talk to you in a
minute let me let me spend some time it
looks like I have time so the research
that we do can be classified into four
general categories we do things that are
very open-ended on the on the y-axis you
see the nature of work that's either
reactive reacting to short term trends
in technology and some things that are
very open-ended that take many many
years to bring to proof to prove shit
that's on the y-axis on the x-axis is
the nature of the engagement is there a
short term engagement or long-term
engagement and we have research projects
as I said there are 700 of us doing work
we have research projects which are in
various squadrons and we are very proud
of this diversity which means that if
you have a good idea it fits in one or
many categories we can do that we have
the freedom to pursue those ideas
without constrained to whether it fits
in a charter or not most of the time we
can do we can do that I briefly
mentioned there is a group called ms our
outreach this is a integral part of ms
are and the MSR outreach is primarily
charged with advancing the state of the
art by strike strengthening the
education ecosystem we also try to
address the group tries to address
societal challenges and also to inspire
scientists now the reason we are here is
because ms our outreach takes its goal
of inspiring scientists the next
generation of scientists and to
strengthening the research ecosystem
very very seriously this is why we meet
once a year sometimes twice a year which
is how we have 11 tech research and we
try to encourage people like you
undergraduates and early graduate
students was thinking of pursuing a
career in research to come and work with
us and we put up be put we invite a
bunch of world renowned speakers
researchers who have done significant
work in computer science to share with
you their enthusiasm and they work we
have panels that described to you many
aspects of working as a computer
scientist and in general we would like
all of you they are to come and join us
in in future years as a computer
scientist I don't mean work at Microsoft
I mean join the field of computer
science and computation in general and
that's what we strive to do in these in
these tech beasters let me briefly tell
you what's in store today I am NOT going
to do a exhaustive introduction to the
topics cycles will do that as emcee
after i get off the stage the next talk
is by processor raja IT pros Raja Reddy
needs no introduction he is a Turing
Award winner and psychic will tell you
more about his achievements he's going
to talk about this conundrum that we
face in the industrial world or in the
world today that is how do you deal with
a lot of information and lack of
attention span we don't have enough time
to deal with all the information so how
do we organize that how do we make use
of that that's what dr. Reddy is going
to talk about following that we are
going to have a talk by processor Edler
zuska on the great enthusiasm that he
has observed in put in in people
pursuing computer science this is he or
he is in the University of Washington in
Seattle and his perception is his
perception is based on what you see in
the United States and I think it is
something that you would see all over
the world now ed is very dear to my
heart because he's my thesis supervisor
and I don't think I would have been here
without his help and encouragement over
these 20 years so I am so glad to see
him here on the 10th anniversary
following las cajas talk we are going to
have a panel discussion which will be
very interesting and hopefully very
useful to you it's by a panel
very distinguished researchers who have
done great work in their own fields and
have considerable experience doing
research so they are going to talk about
what what does it mean to do great
research and how to have a good time
because we don't have a good time you
are not going to continue doing that so
please pay attention to what the
panelist have to say it promises to be a
lively discussion from multiple
viewpoints following that we'll have a
question and answer we're all of us will
be back on the stage and you can unspeak
Wes cheon's in the after lunch in the
afternoon we are going to have to talks
the first talk is going to be by dr.
Jeanette Bing who's my boss she is going
to tell you about computational thinking
in a nutshell it's about thinking like a
computer science or how do you use the
tools that computer science gives you in
solving real life problems following
that sorry I mean to talk three talks
following that we'll have a talk on a
project that we have done in microsoft
research India called massively
empowered classrooms this is a project
that has been deployed in many
universities and many colleges it is
aimed at bringing online education to
colleges in india in a in a
cost-effective and pedagogical effective
way in a much better sense than what say
MOOCs could do the last talk of the day
is going to be by dr. Butler lampson
Butler also is world renown like Raja
Reddy our first speaker Butler last
speaker is also a Turing Award winner
and you may have seen writings by him
particularly if you are an experimental
computer scientist he is going to tell
you some of his experiences in building
many many very many influential systems
I have learned a lot from Butler I have
known Butler's for about 20 years and I
have usually followed his advice in
building a system I used to not follow
his advice and it has led to disaster so
I figured after a few disasters i would
just follow what he says even if i
didn't completely understand at the time
why he was saying that so pay attention
to his hints and hints and principles on
building computer systems they will
stand you in great stead when you
actually build
big large scale systems and then we are
going to have after that we are going to
have some PhD posters and demos the
demos are from the lab in MSR India the
PhD posters are forces put up by PhD
students in various Indian Universities
and then we'll have a closing we will
have some awards to give you the details
of which i'm sure you've been
communicated to you and I have nothing
much more to say I'll be back here for
question answer session I hope you enjoy
the day it's a long day i know but i
think the talks are going to be lively
the panel discussions are going to be
extremely informative so have a good
time and this event is for you and make
full use of it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
