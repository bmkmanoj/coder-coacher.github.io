of global warming and all the things
we're talking about environmental impact
there's so much of it that's going to be
driven by genetics one of the projects
I'm working on is to look for
associations between bits of DNA that we
have and various things like will we get
a disease when we not get a disease will
the drug work well for us will a drug
not work well for us big science big
data have always been very interesting
it's only been within the last probably
five years that it's release become a
passion when I hear big data I think of
hundreds of thousands of individuals and
the DNA for those individuals comprising
billions of bits of information here at
Microsoft Research we're not only
developing these algorithms to analyze
this massive amount of data but we also
have the infrastructure to do the
computations that would ordinarily take
years in just a few hours fast lmm is a
new algorithm that we produce last year
when we run a genome Association study
we have to run lots and lots and lots of
comparisons we use data from the
Wellcome Trust study of the bridge
population which encompassed seven
diseases bipolar disease coronary artery
disease hypertension Crohn's disease
rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 and type
2 type II you're running roughly 500,000
snips but roughly 15,000 individuals and
that's a huge matrix so we have 62
million snip hairs by 15,000 people we
want to do the analysis on we can then
send all the information out into the
cloud you can run on 27,000 CPUs and
then we can have the results pink
computing is really where the problem
that you're trying to solve is too large
from the point of view of how much
resources would need or would run for
too long to run on a small number of
machines here we have for hpc head node
which we've set up with 16,000 cause
each and typing in my parametric sweet
job they've shown up in the HPC
scheduler and it's now scheduling Leah's
each one of these boxes is a machine and
you'll see the wave of activity as the
scheduler starts the word globe going
and if we were to watch this for 24
hours we would study pretty much exactly
the same then at that point we will go
and grab the data and bring it back down
so we can analyze this project needed us
to do about a hundred and twenty-five
computers of work and we wanted to get
that work done in about three days and
to just dividing that out you need a lot
of resources to do that we are taking on
the challenge of taking what would be
traditional high performance computing
one of the hardest work loads to move to
the cloud and moving into the cloud with
this new huge amount of data that's
coming online we're now able to find
connections between our DNA and who we
are that we could never find before but
I think about what I do and how it
affects my kids in the future it's
astounding because I think computational
biology rearing forward together we're
gathering biological data at just
exponential rates the computer is
helping us understand and gather data so
this is stuff that without the both the
improvements and the algorithms that the
Microsoft Research guys have come up
with and the ability for us to provide
the tens to hundreds of thousands of
course it would be have been infeasible
it's a very compute-intensive very
memory intensive very CPU and tested and
it's making a real difference in the
world we're gaining lots more insight
into what's going on biology just about
every day you turn on the radio and you
hear about some new discovery about a
gene that's associated with a form of
cancer or a gene that's associated with
some favorable reaction to a drug this
is what's coming from the genomics
revolution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
