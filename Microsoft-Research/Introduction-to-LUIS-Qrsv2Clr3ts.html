you
luis lets you build language
understanding model specific to your
domain let's say I have a wearable
device and I want it to be able to
recognize commands like start tracking a
run or finished with that walk or set a
heart rate target to 165 here I have a
Louis application I've already built let
me start by showing you how this works
for the application so here enter a
query like start tracking a run here's
the URL that the HTTP endpoint that
Louis is provisioned you can see start
tracking around is a URL argument and
here is the result from Louis and JSON
format the top-scoring intent is start
activity and it picked out the word run
as the activity type let me show a
couple more examples stop tracking or
maybe I could say finished with that
walk here it picks out stop activity as
the intent and walk as the activity type
and finally set heart rate target to 145
and you can see here the intent is
Sartre said heart rate target has been
correctly selected and 145 is the the
number the heart rate target to use so
now let me show you how I can build that
application I'll go in and create a new
application called exercise tracker -
I'll go in and edit it and I'll start by
defining the intents in my domain so
I'll have start activity and stop
activity to begin also I'll have one
other I have an entity which is activity
type that'll be the type of the activity
like run or walk or jog there are
messages that come up to guide you on
your way and I start by just typing in
some utterances some things that I think
people will say so maybe start tracking
a run the utterance appears here
and I label the intent of this utterance
which is start activity and any entities
that appear by highlighting a region of
the string so here the word run is the
activity type so I submit that label can
continue by adding another one let's say
begin a walk the intent is start
activity the entity is activity type I
can submit that now let's choose an
example of stop activity finished with
that jog jog is the activity type stop
activity is the intent let's say all
done that is an example of stop activity
there's no intent present and there's
this other intent that was automatically
created called none
that's a catch-all bucket for anything
that my application can't do so for
example if someone said driving
directions it's not something that my
app can handle so I put that in the none
category periodically the model is
automatically built can also click on
the train button down here anytime to
manually rebuild it now there's a model
present and I can investigate its
performance so I can enter something
like start tracking a hike so it's never
seen that utterance before but it has
picked out hike as the activity type
it's picked out start activity as the
intent and I can see this is classified
correctly and I can click on submit to
add that labeled utterance and let's see
let's choose another one begin mmm let's
see finished with that sprint
so here sprint has been picked out as
the activity type and stop activity so
these pre labels also accelerate my work
here I can just hit submit because
that's been classified correctly so now
let me retrain this and I can show you
how I can redeploy this model to play
this model publish it to an HTTP
endpoint so here is the option for
publishing a web service this is now
active as a web service and I can start
tracking a run that can access it you
can see here I get back the correct
intent and entity that's one of the
labeled utterances so that's good let's
try something it hasn't seen before so
begin a swim how about that okay it's
picked out swim as the activity type
start activity that's good
finished with that sprint ok that's
correct now let's try to stump it let's
give it something it's never really
never seen before
commence swim right so it gets
unsurprisingly none as the intent and it
doesn't pick out the entity there the
nice thing about Luis is all of those
utterances are being logged and now
they're all available for improving the
model so let me show you how that works
so I go back in and edit this and there
are two ways that I can interact with
those unlabeled utterances now that came
out arrived on the HTTP endpoint the
first is I can search them so I can
enter search terms and search through
them but more interestingly is I can ask
Luis to suggest utterances for me to
label that are most likely to improve
the models and I choose which model I'd
like to work on here so these are the
utterances that Luis thinks I should
label first to make maximal improvement
so here comments' swim you can see this
is a good one to label because this is
not what Luis was performing correctly
on so I can fix that I can say all right
that should have been activity type and
this is an example of start activity I
can then submit that this one was
labeled correctly I can submit that now
I can retrain this model and now I have
the benefit of those additional labels
let me show you another way of making
improvements in Luis consider this
utterance start tracking a bike ride
so here it picks out the word bike as
the activity type but not bike ride the
phrase which it should have picked out
so I could reel able this I could fix
this and add some more enterances like
it another thing I can do is I can add a
feature a feature is a collection of
words or phrases that Lois should view
as a class as somehow in some context at
least interchangeable so here I'll
create a feature which is activity words
and I'll add run jog walk sprint hike
bike ride and I'll say that save that
feature and now the model has been
retrained and let me rerun this
utterance by reak licking here and you
can see now Lois picks out the phrase
bike ride as the activity type which it
should and that's because I've told it
that these words and phrases are our
feature and should be viewed as
interchangeable in other domains these
might be the names of products or the
names of people the names of locations
and so on okay now let me add one more
intent which is the set heart rate
target intent and here I have an
argument to the set heart rate target
intent which is the heart rate number
itself so for example set heart rate
target to 145 so I could define a new
entity here and I could teach it to
recognize numbers in this context but
Luis also includes a number of pre-built
entities so here I have numbers
temperatures money encyclopedia concepts
and so on these come from Bing and also
other places and here what I want to do
is add number the number pre-build
entity so now let me rescore this and
you'll see now it picks out
number as as the heart rate which is
great so I'll go ahead and label this as
set heart rate target let me give one
more example here set heart rate to 175
set heart rates great and now if I
retrain this model I'm now able to
recognize this type of letter and set
heart rate to 135 there we go done
correctly good so that's a quick tour of
Lois to find the intense and entities
relevant to your domain use pre-built
entities where each year Microsoft
