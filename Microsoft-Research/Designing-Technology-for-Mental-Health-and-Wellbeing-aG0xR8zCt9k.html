hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
to welcome Anya Timur most of you while
many of you may recognize her from when
she was interning with us quite recently
she's also an MSR scholar she's just
finished her PhD at Newcastle
University's culture lab and today she's
going to be talking about designing
technology for mental health and
well-being thank you and thank you all
for coming this morning yeah it sounds
saying well I'm a human-computer
interaction research and I'm
particularly interested in the design of
new technologies that can support
meaningfully people's mental health and
well-being and so today I would like to
take the opportunity to talk a little
bit about my PhD research and the
project's cause fears of well-being and
I think it's not just quite an
interesting project but also one that
shows you quite well how I approach
research and sort of research questions
that I'm interested in in this area now
just to start with I would like to tell
you a little bit more about my
background and what I've been doing in
the last couple of years I studied in
Germany media and communication sciences
at the University of Jews book yes
that's pretty much an a program where
you would study how the modules would be
competing science and merchants would be
psychology and there was a little bit of
media and arts practice and was very
much focused on working
interdisciplinary and project groups and
in the masters I would focus much more
on psychology and social and emotional
aspects of human-computer interaction
and then for my final year project and
the Masters I would join the de to
interaction group in Newcastle the group
was led by Patrick Olivier and at the
time it was it was quite a small group
there were only 12 15 people there and
they were all coming from different
backgrounds of Engineers people from
social science fine artists and they
would be all working collaboratively and
on different projects quite an exciting
environment quit buzzing so they don't
to do the PhD fortunately PhD was funded
by Microsoft this is how I got to meet
Shannon who became the supervisor of
course supervisor of this work and then
as Sean was mentioning at the end of
last year came to the Cambridge lab to
do an internship project working here
and the tennyson road project and since
i'm a research associate but
any Kassadin to actually listen to
actually group and the group is now
considerably grown in size almost like a
hundred people say over the last five
six years doing the master's and PhD
actually come to work on quite a range
of different projects that can roughly
be grouped in this areas we're looking
at data visualization tools to help
people for instance with track spotting
interesting things that people talk
about non and blogs or panopticon as a
tool where users could spot specific
events and video surveillance footage
I've also been working on explorations
of technology that would help people
reflect on themselves and their personal
experiences so the lovers box is my
Master's project where would ask couples
and romantic relationships to exchange
video messages with a partner and
creating these videos and exchanging
them and the conversations that would
evolve around them would lead to quite a
lot of meaningful reflection on on how
they were perceiving the relationships
and each other
Bink em was quite a different project
quite provocative a system where we put
smartphones in bins and every time
somebody would throw something away the
bin would take a photo of the waste and
then would upload that automatically to
Facebook so you could see images of your
own waste but also you pass and the idea
here was a to make you more aware of
what kind of how your recycling behavior
was or how much food waste you threw
away but also to kind of playfully shame
you and to show you more sustainable
behaviors most of my research though is
focus on health and well-being meaning
mental health and I'm currently working
on a project around dementia care and
also on a technology designed low low
cost low tech technology design that
supports the care provision of Syrian
Health Syrian refugees and Lebanon so
quite a range of projects if you find
any of these interesting and would like
to talk about them more I'm happy to
just will only be able to really go into
the spheres of well-being
for the purpose of this talk
foni pipette one for the top yeah
anytime later maybe forget a channel
right so let me just set a little bit
the scene around mental health and
well-being and technologies to support
that mental health became pretty much a
very important concern for society in
1996 when the World Health Organization
was publishing report was kind of
showing how much mental illness has
increase and just how much it impacts on
the individual but actually the
worldwide economy it was a real big
burden people would stay out of work and
say there was this need to think about
ways of getting mental health mental
illness assess but also support
treatment my problem is that a lot of
people who require treatment actually
don't receive it partly because of
social stigma that's attached to mental
house people wouldn't seek support but
also because actually a lot of therapies
especially like a therapy is a quite
cost intensive so maybe technology can
help here and so very many of the early
interventions were digitalized forms of
self-help materials and therapeutic
strategies and they were often based on
cognitive behavioral therapy which is a
very effective psychotherapy but also
honest very structured so you can it
lends itself kind of to translate that
into editor to format and that would be
made available to people on waiting
lists so beating the blues for instance
was something that was recommended 2006
very NHS nice guidelines for people who
have mild to moderate depression many of
of the psycho therapies also use the
monitoring of your thoughts emotions and
behaviors in relation to certain events
doing everyday life mainly so you can
reflect about you know your own behavior
but also to play a coping strategy so
server monitoring is a really central
part of like a therapies that have been
a lot of explorations how mobile
applications can support people are
managing their mental health so overall
you know there's been a lot of
developments are actually quite cost
effective if you are a technology
literate you know it's easily accessible
for you you can adapt it to all the
sorts of different mental disorders
these technology have also quite common
problems around privacy you know who can
access this maybe quite personal data
about myself where is it stored but one
of the main problems also was attrition
so people would stop actually engaging
with the technology quite quickly if you
imagine you would you're coming home
after a long work day and you are doing
your program or CBT on your computer
without having the therapist there
guiding you through the process
listening to your problems giving you
homework and encourage you to keep keep
doing the program people would drop out
fairly quickly so most of a see I've
ascertain in recent years on this sort
of mental health interventions looking
at how you can motivate people to engage
more with the therapy contents there
have been lot of explorations into law
actually really few into using games
particularly in the design of
interventions for children's a computer
game that at lessons will actually work
through and work through their problems
with the therapist doing therapy
sessions explorations and how you can
use maybe tabletop interfaces doing play
therapy to give children more range of
expressing themselves and in terms of
more standalone online based platforms
there were efforts made to create more
dynamic ways of how you can access the
contents are provide people more
immediate feedback and how they're
making progress could personalize your
own profile page it would also include
elements that you could actually contact
a therapist or that a therapist and
horizons actually as their therapists
moderating the whole interactions with
the system and more and more peer
support was made available I'll inform
sort of little videos that where people
would talk about their experiences or
you know chat rooms that were moderated
where where children and young adulthood
for instance in horizon encourage each
other share the experiences in their
ways of how they manage to cope now a
lot of these existing interventions
focus very much on on supporting the
treatment of mental illness and thereby
they're a little bit more informed by
quite a medical tradition where you are
trying to solve that problem of illness
to try to cope with an illness however I
believe in mental health is it's not
just the
sense of mental illness it's not just
just because we don't have a diagnosable
mental disorder it does not mean we're
mentally well that we're functioning
well in everyday life that really feel
you know we are resilient against
everyday stressors that we have
fulfilling relationships a sense of
purpose and growth they feel like we're
in control of our lives and our levers
meaningful which I consider here's the
more positive take on mental housing and
referred to as mental well-being so the
idea is to maybe look a little bit more
realistic on mental health and I believe
that if we combine strategies both into
treatment and in supporting mental
well-being that we can improve actually
the recovery of mental illness and also
be working more towards preventative
approaches with it currently almost
non-existent and might get a better
understanding how we can support
people's quality of life more generally
as well so with that research motivation
of mine I'm now gonna come extend a
little bit more on the spheres of
well-being so the spheres research was
targeted at a very specific group of
people it's a group of women the men in
the 20s they've got seriously severe
mental health problems also very
challenging behaviors including the vsf
harm and because of that because of
these problem behaviors they require a
very structured and secure care
environment where there would be looked
after properly and that in this case was
a medium secure unit and in an NHS
hospital and on top of that the women
also had a mild to moderate learning
disability so we're able to consent they
had good cognitive functioning but it
was limited in some ways and it's
actually not that uncommon for people
who have a learning disability to also
develop mental health problems in life
is actually twice as likely than and the
general public so quite a challenging a
group in context to work in so so how
did I go about kind of to make sense of
you know the mental health and
well-being needs of the women how
technology could fit with them and their
in their care context and obvious
ethical reasons was quite difficult to
work with the women in the initial
stages so my approach was to work really
closely with different
to staff who were explained to me you
know how they were working with the
women their understanding of the women
and would share the expertise of the
care context they would also point me
towards relevant literature you know
about the mental health problems of the
women and recommended treatment
approaches I would also go through some
personal training and staff will show me
around the hospital unit sir could get a
sense of the environment as well you
know from that whole collaborative
process it came to understand that the
women had a condition that's called
borderline personality disorder it's
very much an emotion regulation disorder
so that means the women have real
problems to understand and Vicki late
their own emotions and that's tricky
because that means they're quite often
overpowered by emotional pain you know
they have low no bud to feel quite
hopeless and helpless and effort is
really difficult to engage them in
therapy but also if you can't really
regulate strong emotional pain they tend
to behave impulsive you can show
aggression towards other people and you
engage in a lot of self-harm because
some of the physical pain destructs you
from that strong emotion of pain and if
you all have all these problems is also
quite difficult to to have strong and
stable positive sense of self so the
women have a lot of cognitive
disturbances they over value the idea of
being bad that they don't deserve
anything now is that they feel they've
got no control other situation and all
of this makes it difficult for them in
the world to have stable positive
relationships with other people so quite
quite a complex condition so how how do
you translate that into requirements for
the design and how do you go about this
so we're quite a few challenges here and
I mean not just in terms of technology
design but also in terms of how you
designed research activities one of the
main concerns especially if the hospital
staff who were around safety whatever
the technology was it near to be safe
and that was because of the severe self
harming behavior so if you're thinking
about technology now any metal piece any
broken off piece of a screen could be
used to scratch yourself if you had
access to batteries you could lick them
if you broke off a little pays you can
put that under your eyelid a laser ways
of how you can
do harm to yourself service but like so
what can I do how can I know how I can
fabricate a technology that might be
safe enough so I've shown around the
unit and I know we've come to realize
that actually a lot of the furniture is
mounted either against the wall or you
see the table areas on the bottom
picture there like screwed to the floor
the red chairs look quite cozy but this
super heavy so you couldn't actually
move them easily let alone pick up and
throw it at somebody it's like a TV
inside this furniture pieces covered by
transparent path back so you can't get
to the TV the curtains are made from a
tear proof material so you could rip
them apart to strangle yourself
there aren't any plant parts or images
that you could take off the wall it's
just you know it's just it's just
further purpose the image and then stuff
would also show me around
you know the seclusion room which is a
like a soft padded room where you have
got soft padded furniture for prison
servers all in blue all quite yeah but
there were materials that were
considered robust enough to give to the
women so it's clear you know you have to
protect technology make sure that
whatever it is that you design it's safe
and it's contact safety also extend it a
little bit more towards me and
safeguarding my own personal health
coming into the environment so I went
for training you know they would teach
me how to be at least an arm's length
distance to the women at all times I was
not allowed to wear anything you could
pull on like a scarf or earrings hey I
had to be put up I was wearing an alarm
system at all times to request help if I
needed to
and also there was always at least one
member of staff there with me in case
something would be happening another
design challenge it worked around the
the learning disability of the women and
bringing consideration to the fact that
the attention span might not be that
that large you know you shouldn't be
constructing long with complicated
sentences it was important that the
language was easy or maybe just not to
use too much text and to support it by
other pictorial pictures or just create
something that was very visual and
stimulating obviously a key
consideration was as well the sort of
therapy that the women were
saving in this case this was dialectical
behavior therapy the staff would appoint
me to answer and I would talk it through
with a clinical care team of the women
and DBT is a specialist treatment for
borderline personality disorder which is
the woman's condition it feels a little
bit on cognitive behavior therapy where
you get taught how to perhaps
restructure your thinking but the twist
and the difference here is that also
includes acceptance based strategies
which are very much informed and
Buddhism that teach you that you have to
accept yourself your good who you are
and you also have to accept the things
you can't change and that's very
important for people who have an
emotional disability where if you are
very emotional you have to learn to
recognize the emotions of calm your
motions now imagine your being angry or
really sad you know I can't reason about
a problem with you in that state you
have to learn to calm yourself down
first and so the to acceptance basic
skills that taught us apart DBT
distressed tolerance teacher see how you
distract yourself from whatever is
troubling you without you know cutting
is healthy this is the idea is to
suggest certain strategies there as
effective but they don't cause you any
harm
and mindfulness is a key part where you
learn about being more attentive to use
that be more aware of yourself in your
experiences and that is very much taught
in a way that you as a concentration
based exercise so you learn how to focus
on one thing at a time and to only focus
on that and not get distracted by any
other things often it's taught as a
breathing exercise where you focus on
your breathing and how it feels like to
breathe in and out and whenever you feel
you get distracted you just redirect
your focus on that exercise the
mindfulness in particular as as become
really popular in mental health it's
been used for a lot of different
disorders it's very very successful
post-traumatic stress disorders
depression etc and it's just focus on
recognizing emotions and dealing with
them now lastly I was also quite
interested
looking at the mental well-being
perspective things to create something
that was quite a person-centered I
didn't just want to replicate
existing DBT strategies and practices
that the women were doing already I
wanted to create something that I felt
that didn't fear a medical or former
generic but rather something else quite
personal and unique teach of the women
and create experiences that and
interactions that they may not have had
before particularly because the staff
was saying Ashley the women are quite
computer literate you know a love
playing at computer games that can
download things there was a lot of
potential here and also you know because
of their challenging behaviors and
safety regulations women didn't have
many objects in their room that could
tell a story about them that would
express the individuality so I was quite
keen to create like a tangible design
something that they could personalize
that was less to keep and to take with
them when they would leave the ward so
how do the spheres respond to these
design challenges so ever all the
spheres are set of three artifacts that
were cooked right over the each of the
women the first one is the mindfulness
fear looks a bit like a a crystal ball
it's made from from resin it has copper
disks attached to either side and when
you hold the artifact in you make
contact with the copper there's custom
ECG electronics at the inside that it
can access your heart rate Mauri
heartbeat and then their lights that
would visualize this let me show you
this just a really short video so at the
inside there's six multicolored LEDs and
they would just say in and out with
every beat of the heart and the idea is
here to to teach the woman to focus on
this visual and if they get distracted
actually the sphere changes color every
30 seconds to kind of motivate them to
keep focusing on that visual as a way to
teach them mindful awareness
can you look like Russian okay so the
idea just behind your hand that concept
is to to to provide the women something
that can bring focused attention to that
they might find stimulating and that
provides them some sort of you know
visual feedback on their innocence ation
of the body like breathing exercises are
quite popular because there's something
there you can focus your attention on a
lot of mindfulness activities quite
abstract so some of the things that
motivated the design obviously clinician
highlight as well the biofeedback
component of it and the opportunities
that can provide for self-regulation
overall viously this was kind of a
compromise in the design in terms of
safety so it was an object that would
safely encapsulate all the electronics
inside the resin at the same time it was
solid so if you would throw that
somebody would hurt and also if you were
throwing it with the right intensity in
the right angle it could break tried or
not however staff prefer that using a
softer material like a rubber because
they were saying you know if you tried
can you bind it and you can get in with
your teeth and so they found it easier
to manage the risks around the sphere
when as a solid object and they would
only give it to the women when they were
feeling fairly stable and for
mindfulness that's important you would
only be able to attend and practice
mindfulness in a fairly stable state
anyway so the staff felt this was a risk
they could manage so then that sounded
was a bit of a trade-off so your
question was to how do you know they're
destructed so have you ever tried
mindfulness is there for any sort of
meditation techniques if I was telling
you just to focus on your breathing
you would probably realize that after a
couple of seconds you would actually
think maybe about the next meeting you
have our lunch it's it's something that
actually happens you mind always drifts
away and the trick is to notice that
your mind drifts away and then just like
oh hold on tails supposed to be
concentrating on my breathing and you
would focus your attention back on your
breathing and this is how you learn just
to focus on one thing it
time it's actually really difficult also
I've I've attended a mindfulness class
myself from anyway from really really
difficult because they're not that good
actually just concentrate on one thing
or my intense drift off but but the key
is that you're non-judgmental that you
accept that and you just focus again so
it will definitely have happened to
whoever practice mindfulness I think
it's not like the the sphere detects
that you've a drifted away key just
assumes that you have and it changes
color the color change is just in this
case program in it's just so but you
just have a different stimuli is just to
make it more stimulators even thinking
about me giving it like a bit more
practical have in this case and to feel
a little bit with the sensor readings
notice is just to make it stimulating
you could practice mindfulness on
focusing on the chair but that's just
not as easy just because you've noticed
yeah if you like hold on
you know when you in new mind drifts
away and then you realize there's a
college it oh yeah I was supposed to be
focusing on that it's more that sort of
creating a visual stimuli that keeps you
engaged contacts made but it doesn't
react to any other input except touch so
basically it switches on where you touch
bases sides and sphere stops we turn off
so I'd imagine for example that the
light we react to your heart people know
it's just on well the light fits in and
out with the speed of your heart you
know yeah so reacts is yeah it is your
it's a visualization of your heartbeat
but it the changes in color are
hard-coded in this case every 30 seconds
will change color
so you could do that you could for
instance do breathing to calm yourself
down and it might reflect in the visual
but the idea of mindfulness is not to
change its to accept so I could have you
know I've made the lights red
if the per hobby was really fast and
green if it was slow but that would be a
judgment that would be more around
strategies for change your behavior and
adapt your behavior as this was about
acceptance
so in fact most of the lives of my like
purple turquoise or orange I tried not
to put any value statements into that
and that was a deliberate choice to stay
with the mindfulness philosophy behind
it yeah but you also said the staff keep
a little bit so it's not at odds with
the idea that it's theirs
so this date how did the staff keep hold
of it when the patients were calm which
implies it yeah so so that's true and I
say I had six women two of them had free
access to the artifacts at any time to
it into median access I mean that men
when they had a good week they could use
it when they weren't well in other weeks
staff had to look over the artifact and
decide are the risk behaviors of the
women appropriate enough that the camp
and that's safe for them to have the
objects and tearful women were their
behaviors were generally quite high risk
so they would always have to ask their
for a staff I would always have to
accommodate it for them to have
especially the maintenance here simply
because it's this robust solid object
that is an object of danger so it
actually depends on the individual risks
as a women and I think they're those can
change over time as well second object
is the identity sphere it looks a little
bit like a little leather purse staffs
experience will be another yeah we'll
get to that so this pair this object
looks a little bit like a purse um it
has a smartphone at the insight and you
open it up there's a screen visible
the screen is protected by perspex cover
the artifact made is from leather
leather steer proof it's actually been a
very robust artifact and and when you
when you open it up there is a little
button at the top of the purse when you
press that button there's an application
running on the phone that switches on
the camera function and would scan the
environment for QR codes that are
embedded the center of these colorful
patterns and mandalas and if they
recognize a QR code that would trigger
the display of a video now the videos
were things that were co-created with
each of the women and the idea behind
them was to reflect things that the
moment were interested in possible
positive personal experiences people who
were meaningful to them things that they
were proud of her and the idea was to
help here to help but to support them in
the construction of a more positive
sense of self and the last object of the
three is the karmic sphere so this one
is non digital it was supposed to be
just a very simple artifact that very
much reflects the concept of of secular
where you beads you know it's just
something you can hold on to and play
with when you get a little nervous or
anxious obviously you could use it for a
relaxation practice you might you know
you could count the beads one after the
other or you could bring mindful
awareness to the different visual
patterns that were on the beach again
safety considerations the leather strap
it's only just long enough to fit around
the the rims wrists the clay beads her
staff was saying you know even if the
women swallow them they're probably
going to be safe for them to have so
these were the three artifacts and the
concept behind them and the idea for the
artifacts pretty much evolved through a
collaboration with the hospital staff
some of the previous research have been
doing and also some some of my personal
experience of being kind of in this
environment and getting a sense of what
we might like to design but it's not
it's not been anything where the women
were really involved in until this point
so it's very much important that the
women also somewhat contributed to the
co-creation of the artifacts and invited
them for for a period of five weeks once
a week to engage in a series of creative
activities where they would come to
personalize pieces and elements and
contents of the sphere
so we would for instance make beats from
polymer clay so working with female we
would also work with certain techniques
like you know the top right it's like if
you if you know certain techniques you
can create actually quite a nice
symmetrical patterns fused tools to
create mosaics so even if you had no
arts and crafts skills you could
actually create quite beautiful
intricate designs so the member would
make their own comic spheres we would
then work with acrylic paint and stamps
and we would work on special plastic
paper that when you cut out your design
you put it in the oven which ring to a
much smaller size and you would create
this little plastic charms that the
women then would choose to have
incorporated inside their mindfulness
spheres they also designed the look of
the leather purses you know what kind of
pockets engravings or not ornaments
colors they wanted to do and that was
them as a design brief for me they had a
lot of different black and white and
Dalek patterns or they could choose a
favorite ones and color those and at the
center would then add on the QR code
that work with their identity sphere and
is each identity sphere would only work
with the particular QR codes of the
women so that was a kind of
consideration for privacy you need to
imagine that in a secure unit you're
constantly observed and the and that
includes even the most intimate spaces
when you're only the shower and you go
to the toilet you when you sleep there
is just no space for privacy of are for
keeping something to yourself that other
people can't access so I wanted to
create something women have the choice
you know whether they wanted to share
the videos with other people I also I
created paper tokens to to help create
conversations with the women around what
other sort of things they like and
they're interested in to start
stimulating ideas about what could be
part of their videos for the identities
fears but also make a video together so
I taught the women how they can do
little to stop motion animation just
using simple paper cutouts and showing
them how they can animate them using a
very simple phone up one of the women
was really keen in terms of horror
movies she went crazy on a graveyard and
screen masks may have read a really
beautiful animation
so what were the findings from this
process I have to admit that before I
started these activities I was pretty
much prepared for all the problem
behaviors of the women everybody was
asking me are you sure they're going to
understand the activities are they gonna
engage with them are they going to be
able to concentrate how they're going to
get it how they're gonna respond to you
oh my god I was apprehensive to say the
least
to go into the moment having everything
set up having to watch everything and no
idea how it's gonna go unfortunately and
very much to my relief it went pretty
well
the moment were Mary Mary much enjoying
taking part in these activities it was
something they're actually really
committed to so they would engage
actually up to three hours they would
skip even cigarette breaks which
apparently is really rare and they love
taking part and I've come to it came to
understand that over the weeks this was
very much related to how he set up the
activities there was a lot of
consideration made about creating a safe
and comfortable space for the women
staff members were there supporting them
that neither woman well also was quite a
hands-on activity you know you were
making things that wasn't putting the
women on the spot everybody would chip
in it became quite a casual engagement
it was also something where you didn't
need any skills you could create quite
quite amazing looking pieces without you
know having to have any prior knowledge
and you would learn skills and and the
women were really proud of what they
could achieve in such a short time
obviously it was very individualized the
women got a lot of person attention it
was all one-on-one usually what they do
is in group activities and would be less
creatively adventurous so they would be
having a coring book in a pan and they
would have an hour sat there and they
were coloring something in whereas here
it was was quite different and they all
also enjoyed how loads of positive
interactions would evolve with the staff
and in that setting that was again quite
different to how they would interact
with the staff on the ward where the
staff would be you know the key
responsibilities is to organize the
women's care to get them out of that in
the mornings you know make sure they
have the medication go to therapy or as
here was all about the women their
choices their interests and assisting
them to create something that they
wanted to make and I think it's partly
because it was so different
many of the other activities that they
enjoyed this process and were quite
committed to it and also I mean there's
something interesting to say it here
about how much it was actually about the
person and not the owner so a lot of the
time and I didn't notice it when I did
it when I was in these activities I
would feel so comfortable with the women
because they were so lovely it was so
well behaved that completely forgot
about the risk behaviors and would kind
of quite often move towards them would
lean forward sometimes even found myself
sitting almost next to them and staff
let me cry often they let me get away
with it because it was just you know it
didn't feel like there was any threat to
be expected however was someone and
where the risk behaviors were credibly
high I really pushed start anxiety level
simmer and they were not happy with me I
was a lot of frustration going on they
would be kicking me under the table all
you know assigned to me back off because
I didn't understand what it means to be
attacked I didn't I never had any
experience so that was just a little bit
oblivious to that just simply in that
situation would forget the implications
that it could have something was
happening but I think that somewhat also
carries a little bit of the beauty of
having us
these moments together okay having taken
part in these creative activities those
fears were then finalized back in a new
castle and then deployed and for the
first 15 weeks of the deployment I would
observe how the women would be engaging
with the objects I would conduct
interviews of the women and the staff
and after the first force and 15th week
of the deployment or also every now and
then be in the environment not to
observe anybody but mainly I was kind of
hanging about waiting to see staff or
waiting to meet the women will you get a
lot of really good insights into the
environment when I wasn't at the
hospital and that was for most of the 15
weeks at left staff with Diaries and
little postcards where they could leave
notes of what they might have observed
of the women interacting with his face
and I would also talk a lot about my
experiences and how it made sense of the
research with with a collaborator at the
hospital was the R&amp;amp;D manager at a
hospital would debrief
experiences but it would also you know
she would help me put everything into
perspective and make sense and give
context information that were really
essential for me to understand what was
actually going on and all the
information collector went into the
thematic analysis and so her now very
quickly gonna give you like just a
snapshot some of the findings that came
out of that as to how the women
experience in the spheres but one of the
things that came out is that because the
women were so involved in the creative
cook creation of them they were actually
quite proud of the objects and they also
had quite a strong sense of ownership I
mean they were their creation so they're
sort of contents that were in there so
particularly initially they were
actually even very protective about the
objects and staff was saying to me you
know I think they just really enjoy
possessing them and knowing that was
theirs and that they could choose that
they wanted to use them so the first
week second week they were showing these
objects to anybody that they possibly
could the other women on the flat staff
members even family members doing visits
and that create a lot of positive
interactions where the women would just
say you know how do they work
technically they would explain that how
I had contributed to them and also you
know how the contents were relevant to
them and they were
damn proud and then the people would
recognize the achievements that they had
and that was a really positive
experience so for instance one staff man
I was saying Kim she seemed breed really
proud of it which is a really good thing
because it's possible she might not have
a lot of things that she's proud of but
you could see she was sort of brimming
with pride showing me his face and for
those women that that's why it's
especially you know they're not many
occasions where they felt they were
achieving something and other people
would recognize that in particular the
videos and the identity spheres were
also enable the women to kind of be
reminded of happy memories and happy
times and people actually that care
about them and that was important
because sometimes they needed that
reminder that there was some times just
thinking you know life has no meaning
you know there needed that motivation as
well to keep keep going with therapy
what is it all worth worthwhile for and
so one of the women was saying you know
and she was using
her identity she would play a video that
showed a lot of images with her and her
mum I should say ah my mom's one it
makes me feel more confident like that I
want to get out of here I look at my mum
I think I think that should have more
confidence than myself
so simply assurance here they were also
using the spheres as a way to keep well
so in some ways the objects because they
were related and associated a lot of
positive experience in the making they
became some objects of comfort something
that they turned to when the women were
feeling a little bit low or lonely and
just wanted to feel connected to family
they were really fitting family quite a
bit but they would also use the objects
that they were bought and there was no
other sort of stimulation around there's
really a problem if you don't have
anything to do if you're left by
yourself you start ruminating problems
come up so having something to do it's
actually quite quite important and we
would also use it when they when they
were a bit distressed there wasn't
important therapy meeting coming up I
wanted to relax we wanted to take their
mind off these or to escape the flat
dynamics so you need to imagine if you
are a known award where all the women
have severe motion regulation
difficulties you know one of them gets
upset it affects everyone if you're at
that day in a good space and you don't
want to be affected by it having the
opportunity to say to staff I would like
to go in my room and use my spheres and
escape that setting that would be a way
you know to keep yourself well and
manage that and in escape that situation
one of the staff said about Janet who
was one of the women she said she liked
to look at it this is about the pair's
first it made it feel happy made her
feel that she wasn't on her own was the
ball she also said she was she would sit
in her room and feel close to something
so somewhat there were these objects
that not necessary that the women could
articulate this very well but there were
objects of comfort and I have to say and
this is like probably something about
how I made sense of the day to say a lot
of the times when I was working with
women it's not that easy for them to
understand why they were doing certain
things or how they were feeling about it
or were able to articulate in particular
one of the women she would quite often
just use one word answer it's not that
easy you know to engage them in
conversation about their experiences as
well
strongly such effect so because I was so
involved with the women they would be
quite reluctant to tell me oh yeah well
if there was something that they didn't
like about the spheres or and they were
refusing to use them or didn't want to
use them they wouldn't tell that to me
straight away but that's where the staff
again came in who would be very happy to
volunteer all the moments where it
wasn't going well and set things into
perspective and would volunteer their
interpretation of what they thought was
going on between the women and the
spheres the staff also suggested a lot
of new users around the sphere say
because these were objects of the women
generally responded to quite positively
staff gave them to them or suggested
them to the women at times when they
were going towards crisis when they were
getting more and more distressed because
they had the hope if they were using the
object destructive and maybe you know
and in some incident could be prevented
from happening that was not the case in
fact a lot of the time women were
getting to stress who refused to use
them they didn't want to engage with
them even if they were engaged in them
they would throw the objects so in this
case it was only ever going to be the
purse that would be given to them and it
was throwing quite a few times so where
the stickers but fortunately it was
robust enough for that purpose but yeah
that lets staff be quite disappointed
that the women weren't engaging more
objects especially in these moments
where it was like most needed it kind of
shows that staff were quite desperate to
have something at all that would help
the women and them to deal with these
most difficult events a moment but that
has a different approach to mindfulness
or DBT culture now a DVT culture didn't
really exist
in this hospital just yeah it was
something that was newly introduced but
most of the practices on the water was
there was a problem and how do we deal
with this effectively so other than me
facilitating mindfulness activities with
the women and if once um had also a
therapist a facilitating group session
with all the women around mindfulness
mindfulness practices wouldn't really
happen and that was mainly because the
women was that the big
learning how to do mindfulness and who
need a lot of support by the staff now
most of the ward staff didn't really
know how to make sense of mindfulness or
engage the women in practice either say
that was something that was was just not
engaged with as much actually this is
this is one of the what managers have
been talking to you at the end like
talking about the overall experience and
he was quite honestly admitting you know
DBT groups to relatively new you know
maybe we're a little bit behind with the
staff training it's not completely alien
to them but if you ask sort of to give a
detailed account about mindfulness the
majority of the people would probably
just remember what it is
so it was just yeah DBT is the
dialectical behavior therapy so this is
nevertheless there were moments where
the women were using this fear
successfully for self destruction
usually when they were coming down after
an incident and it would just help them
to take the mind off things and just to
come relax afterwards there were many
examples of that too but just not really
really distressed overall there were a
lot of challenges to facilitate
engagement in that context one of which
was the lack of understanding in some
way of DBT and how to facilitate that
within that context part was the
artifact safety so the mindfulness fear
wasn't si was the identity sphere that
wasn't used the most a party because
that was an object was considered safe
and that for the women to use so because
not all the women had free access some
had the objects in the room but again
behind the perspective keyboard there
was only one key to that cupboard that
was shared between two flats identifying
that one member of staff on duty had
that key and getting that cup water up
and alone was a challenge could easily
take half an hour it's generally quite
difficult to facilitate person-centered
engagements and the water environment
has super hectic there's so many staff
involved in the women's service so just
to support the research activity on the
ward I recruited 47 staff but there were
many more they were rotating and shifts
mostly support workers it's very
expensive service and you know
qualitative qualified nurse
have higher salary and obviously the
main responsibility of the staff was to
safeguard the women and and to look
after their daily care there's also the
challenge around this being kind of an
external project you know it's been
supported for a certain period of time
but then for integrating something like
that into services in the long run is is
another challenge so if you think about
it I was talking to staff a lot about
opportunity for me to create evening
activities where they could just use it
all in a group but then pretty early on
in the deployment one of the women moved
to the low secure unit so she was on her
own with his fears on that unit and then
her place had been taken by a new
admission so she was left out so unless
you know you rule it rolling out across
the the service unless it's introduced
hierarchically top-down by the energy as
and part of the the guidelines of care
is really difficult to enable long term
engagement so just to wrap up I never
could show that the spheres had some
sort of potential supporting a positive
sense of self and the women the
interactions were enabling them to feel
proud and cheering and also to remind
them about people who care about them
and their individuality they were also
using them as a way to manage their
well-being either to destruct themselves
or calm them down after an incident or
as objects of comfort something that
provided stimulation take their mind off
other things in general explorations
around mindfulness came short it's
clearly something it's been unexplored
in that context but although there are a
lot of technology developments around
mindfulness a lot of apps that support
you research on mindfulness in HCI is
actually rather unexplored something I
would like to continue in the future
I also like to continue developing the
agenda for mental well-being as like
this positive take on mental health and
push this more holistic view on mental
health and also in this project as well
as some of the research I'm doing right
now around dementia care provision where
carers are engaging with people with
dementia there are a lot of tools out
there for instance to support
mindfulness on tablet PCs a lot of the
carers just don't really know how to
engage with the technology
meaningful way and engaged that other
person so the thing that needs to be
much more consideration around how you
actually design services and the
practices around the the technology
artifact and not just focus on the
technology itself alright here we go
thank you okay do we have time stuff for
questions between the artifact and the
method because when you talk about the
evaluation you talk about the the
artifact but in reality it strikes me
the things you described in terms of the
positive outcomes of you know your
evaluation relate more to the method so
the acts of engagements getting people
to evolve so do you see those two things
as distinct like could you have the
spheres and those home environments
still have the same outcomes all it'd
have to be that quite probably expensive
and complicated method that you describe
the on screen yes I see them as complete
interlinked and I think the the impact
that the spheres could have and the
latest so it it has been two stages and
it's kind of somewhat in shame because I
think if you were continuing involving
the women around practices of around the
space you could actually have much more
benefit I think in the long run so in
this process it seemed like that the
creative activity is we're actually much
more powerful than maybe the
interactions of the spheres and I think
partly is because so much engagement
with the women around the creative
activities of then were pretty much
lacking when I left the hospital and
left them with the artifacts by
themselves so this is pretty much what
we're ending at you and they need to be
practices around the artifacts that make
these engagements more meaningful and
that was somewhat lacking so they are
separable and I believe if you were not
creating these involving this creative
approach and who would just give them a
set of spheres then it would be just a
more generic technology
so maybe the beauty in this is the whole
process around it does that answer the
question
most designers spend that time when they
do presentations describing their
artfulness the way they assemble things
and um I find that somewhat perplexing
because sometimes you find little about
the world in which that might those
devices might be thrown in and in this
case you spent most of your time
describing the world in which they were
thrown in and I'm wondering what you
think yourself as uh what do you think
yourself as a designer or do you think
yourself as as human-computer
interaction researcher where the
technology is so I think miss Faye is
pretty much gave me another opportunity
to understand that research context and
what role technology can play in it it's
not something that is a means to an end
we arrived at a product it was something
that I needed me to do more research in
that context and understand that context
and understand that people's experiences
as a way to inform technology design for
mental health and well-being so I see
myself more as a researcher that uses
these as tools to do research for the
first twelve months we guarantee that if
there are any technical problems we do
any repairing fortunately so that and I
think this was pretty amazing given that
their technology prototypes the balls
are still all working we hadn't had a
single problem with them knock on wood
the mindfulness over the identity
spheres there were two instances one of
which was the app was crushing we had
considered for that say if if that was
happening we just advised them you know
let the phone ran out of battery and
then charge it and when you switch it on
it would reset and that works so that
happened once I happened actually on the
first day of the deployment say the
women are quite impatience are like can
you fix it immediately but did that I
took the phone out of it my newly and
stitched it back in and and there was
another instance and that was actually
my fault where one of the women it was
actually in a 10th week she had always
looked really well after the artifact
she had free access she was using it
just charging it but then at some point
it run out of battery
and that phone didn't have the latest
software update so that all you know you
let it run out of battery you started
back on didn't work and that was my
fault because I last-minute exchanged
that phone with a demo phone and just
wasn't aware that didn't have the latest
version and ever since I reversed that
and put the software update on it it was
fine not actively they still have them
but that's exactly the problem it's like
one of these things that you could be
using but it's it's how they're
supported and using them so some of them
Dave I've got one person particular was
very keen and and but she has by now
left the hospital she well she's been
transferred to low secure and then
transferred to a different little secure
unit but know most most of them are not
actively used anymore and that's quite a
shame but you know if I can now come
into the unit and I'm still visiting the
women most of the staff are different
you know they don't even know they exist
they don't know how to use them and I
was in the rooms the objects were then
the ruined is this black box you know
it's almost like the project is over
staff puts them all back in the box and
puts them in a cot and they've forgotten
about really easily so I think there's a
lot more about human interactions around
the objects no matter what thick I
really believe that whatever technology
I would have bought into this is what I
mean with like its own research project
you accommodate this it's just too much
hassle there's so much going on you know
and this is related to any sort of
person-centered activity that they could
facilitate it's just very difficult
