next speaker is general Dan Kulkarni
who'll tell us about myself I came in
price of independent decision-making via
duality thanks you all so this is based
on my papers with sign Bhattacharya
Sanjay maíam and comets-- manag Allah
and Mohammed ogni there was a series of
papers where this technique was used to
bound the price of anarchy I am NOT
going to talk about any specific result
here but I'm going to tell you about the
technique which is the essence of all
these results okay just to motivate
selfish behavior understanding selfish
behavior is one of the main research
directions in game theory and a typical
example given is think about routing
traffic in large networks there won't be
any centralized entity which can make
the decisions and how to route the
traffic so it is left to the users to
decide how to how to like navigate in
this network and typically users are
self-interested and they choose the
routes which optimize their own
objective functions or their they want
to reach the destination as quickly as
possible now the question is how these
systems behave like in this hour in this
selfish settings and I am an algorithm
designer and increasingly this question
is becoming relevant for many of the
algorithms redesign not just these kind
of systems because the algorithms we
designed now are being used by other
users and hence the input itself can be
very strategic for example something
name like page rank or something like ad
allocations these algorithms are used by
the the ewer by the users who are
self-interested and they can actually
manipulate these algorithms for their
own benefits so the question of
understanding how these algorithms
behave in selfish setting is very is of
increasing importance in the recent
works okay and one of the fundamental
questions which is focused on
algorithmic game theory is quantifying
the efficiency lost due to the selfish
behavior like if users are behaving in a
selfish way what is the efficiency loss
pay to an optimal algorithm which could
have like assigned users to a particular
strategies then what what will be the
outcome of such system and compare
against the efficiency loss due to this
okay and in particular in today's talk i
am going to show how to use convex
linear and convex programming duality to
bound this understand this quantity of
the efficiency loss okay so that's the
main go to just to set the expectations
right I am NOT going to talk about any
new result I'm going to illustrate this
technique on something which is already
well understood in the literature in
fact everything that needs to be known
on this problem is already known but the
only the technique I'm going to
presently something new and I think it
is interesting in its own right okay so
what is the what is the problem i'm
going to talk about i'm going to look at
congestion games which is perhaps like
the most important problem studied in
algorithmic game theory at least in the
spice of Anarchy literature like the
entire price of an evolution of pace and
finally literature can be traced to the
study of this problem and the problem is
surprisingly very simple or at least the
variant of the problem I'm present gonna
present is very simple we are given a
network and a set of users and every
user wants to go from some source to
some destination here the user a wants
to go from you to t there is a single
edge the user B wants to go from you
week 2 T okay so this is the and this
graph is given these are the users and
the and the users can choose any part
they want so this is usually called as
the strategy space if you fix the user
be he has two choices of the paths to
reach his destination you can either
take the top one or you can take the
bottom on so every user as a set of
choices okay but depending upon how
people choose their path they incur some
cost in this model it's called latency
and the latency of an edge is basically
the number of users using this edge okay
so in this case for example if a decided
to use the top the edge e then the
latency on that edge is too because both
users a and B are using the same age so
they incur a cost of two on that
particular edge okay
and what is the player cost what is the
objective which every user is trying to
optimize he is going to optimize the
latency he sees along each of these
paths okay and the reason why these
latency functions are interesting there
is a lot of theory in it but i am not
going to get into those details so the
cost incurred by a player player if you
choose a some path I is just the latency
of that edge some of latency is along
each of these edges okay so that is the
player costs and so let's see on this
example here the latency seen by player
B is one on the first edge to on the
second edge because both the users are
using this mhm okay so he is cost is
three on the other hand the cost of
player a is too because he is only using
the first edge thats all is and the
latency on that edge is too okay so let
me see whether I can use this
interactive thing pan and okay cool so
that latency on their heads is two ok
and what is the system designer
subjective system designers objective is
to minimize the social cost which is
some of the player costs okay so that's
the objective of the system designer he
wants to design systems where every user
sees a very little latency right so in
this case again in this example the
social cost is five because the user be
seized a latency of three and user s is
a latency of two okay and now to
understand selfish behavior we have to
make some assumptions how the system
behave and perhaps the most common
assumption or widely studied assumption
is that of Nash equilibrium we believe
that when sis players behave in a
strategic way they all reach a Nash
equilibrium and what is the definition
of the Nash equilibrium is that at least
the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is
that if no player can decrease his
caused by unilateral deviation okay let
me make this definition precise by just
illustrating on this example I'm going
to claim that this this outcome is a
Nash equilibrium because the player
let's focus on player a suppose he wants
to switch to some other strategy and I'm
going I'm going to show that that's only
increase is going to increase his cost
why because he
is using this edge but currently is
using this edge going through this and
he is incurring a cost of two suppose he
switches to some other pot like this
right so that part is really long
because he's going to have a latency of
two year one year so that's basically
like fire six okay so now he is
incurring the latency of two but if we
switch a sin to any other path is
latency will be much higher so we can
also verify that for player B it is his
best strategy given this outcome so this
is in fact a Nash equilibrium okay yes
sure so there is another if you had
choose another path it would still be a
Nash equilibrium yeah but in this is one
particular outcome which is a Nash
equilibrium okay and the the way we
quantify the efficiency loss due to
selfish behavior is this very nice
algorithmic idea a concept called price
of Anarchy which says you look you take
the maximum or the worst-case ratio of
cost of Nash equilibrium and compare it
against the optimal strategy for
minimizing the social cost so there is
an underlying optimization objective
here where I just want to minimize the
social cost I don't want to I don't want
to worry about them being in the Nash
equilibrium so there is some solution
let us call it as opt now since payers
are behaving in a strategic way they
will reach some Nash equilibrium so I'm
going to look her over all possible Nash
equilibrium and bound this ratio and the
reason why we care about the worst is
that it if you are a system designer you
can sleep peacefully because I know that
every Nash equilibrium is like you know
very pretty close to optimum okay and of
course we want to understand why what is
the price of anarchy of games okay so
now we already saw that this is a Nash
equilibrium and the social cost is 5
let's see what is what God can be an
optimum solution I'm not going to like
give an example what is an optimum
solution but let's see some other
outcome where player 8 users sticks to
his original path but player B now
instead of using the edge this path
which you are seen earlier switches to
this path so now the latency seen by
both the players decree
us because in each the pair a now has
ceased the latency of one here and
player be on the other end see the
latency of three right so the social
cost is four so this is an outcome which
strictly gives you a lesser latency so
in fact for this example itself the
price of power is at least 54 because we
saw an equilibrium outcome where the
price of 9th us five now it is four ok
and now there are also generalizations
of the Nash equilibrium for example
mixed Nash equilibrium where your
strategy can be distribution over your
strategies or correlated equilibrium
course correlated equilibrium and so on
and so forth and one of the nice things
about these generalizations is that a
pure Nash equilibrium may not exist for
all games mixed Nash equilibrium always
exists but cannot be computed in
polynomial time but the rest of the
things can be computed and even the
course correlated equilibrium can even
be learnt through games so these these
generalizations of the Nash equilibrium
have very nice properties and one of the
fundamental question I am interested in
is is there a generic technique to bound
the price of Anarchy for these various
equilibrium notions right so is there a
common technique which can which we can
use like lot of techniques have been
developed in the literature but is there
some unifying techniques for bounding
the price of knocking and and one such
technique is the smoothness smoothness
framework biting graph garden which
basically shows inequality of the type
of the following nature I am NOT going
to get into the details of this it
basically boils down to extract
establishing some linear inequalities
and then if you can show that for this
game these these inequalities are
satisfied then the price of anarchy is
bounded by lambda mu ok let's not get
into the details so in my view I think
this is on some sort of a potential
function argument so you have a game
your some outcomes and you want to
design some nice potential which will
going to bound the price of not but in
this talk I'm going to show something
different which i think is equally
powerful and that's the based on idea of
duality and this is something which
people in approximation and online
algorithms used almost like every other
proof of approximation algorithm
I uses these ideas and what is the high
level thing the high level thing is to
you use the weak duality theorem in
particular there is an underlying
optimization problem I'm going to cast
it as an up write a linear linear or a
convex programming relaxation of it and
we know from the duality theory that the
corresponding dual linear program or the
convex program the any feasible solution
to the dual wave is a lower bound on
this act and one of the one of the like
the classic the trick in approximation
online literature is to use to connect
algorithms costs here to some feasible
dual solution and the weak duality is
that okay this if I can bound this by
some factor alpha that that is going to
be an approximation factor for this and
this is something which we use in
approximation algorithm and the takeaway
for my talk is that the same trick can
be used to bound the price of Anarchy
price of anarchy is still an
approximation ratio but here you are
imposing the fact that you want the
outcome to be Nash equilibrium so in
particular I want to compare I want to
look at a Nash equilibrium outcome
suppose this is some Nash equilibrium
outcome and I want to use this Nash
equilibrium condition and produce a dual
certificate and I want I want to show
that by doing this i am only losing a
some factor of alpha and that would give
me the price of anarchy it's very
similar to what people have used in the
approximation and online algorithm okay
so this is the overall goal of the talk
so I'm going to show this how to do this
using one concrete example of the
congestion games okay is a high level
picture clear so that is the thumb so
let's start with writing the linear a in
this case I can't write a linear program
but we can write a convex program let's
see what it is so just before I write
the convex program let me make some
small observation of any questions
upper bound because you need to look at
the worst yeah yeah so I mean I'm going
to I'm not even going to assume what is
this Nash equilibrium I'm going to just
look at some Nash equilibrium and i am
going to produce a dual certificate
which satisfies i'm gonna show a dual
feasible solution using that so I'm not
making any assumption on whether it is
the best or worst or anything it can be
any Nash equilibrium as long as the
outcome is in so which in particular
means that if this was the Nash
equilibrium with the highest cost I am
bound that also okay for every Nash
equilibrium in particular I am NOT
bounding the price of stability i am in
fact bounding the price of anarchy okay
so to help me write the the convex
program let's make some small
observation which is very simple so i
can write the social cost which was some
of the player costs a simply Layton sees
on the the square of the latency on each
edge because if you fix an edge e that
is being counted among all the players
and the latency was equal to the number
of the player so the social cost is
basically the latency square okay so
this is simple thing so let's write the
convex program in the convex program how
to variables xij which basically says
the player Jay takes the path I in the
graph okay and there is a variable ye
which basically measures the latency of
this edge okay and I need this parameter
a lie which is length of path I this is
not a variable this is just some
constant for every every path I I'm Li
measures the length of this path okay so
then the object you okay here mean is
short for for minimize okay it's not so
objective is basically y squared because
that is my social cost so this measures
the latency squared and here i need this
extra term for this talk i will just
briefly sketch why i need this extra
term so we thought this this linear
program has a large integrality gap
think about only one player and n paths
and then we
down this the Li term the cost will be 1
over N squared which is not really true
because everybody is the player has to
choose at least one path though his cost
is at least one so the way to fix it is
if a player I chooses the path player J
Julius a path I he has to pay at least
Li the length of the path because he is
at least the one user using that path ok
so if it is not clear then we were not
going to bother too much it's just we
need it to fix the integrality gap of
this convex program but the objective is
quite simple this is basically y squared
which is what my social cost utilization
is the length of the figure in the cost
you have the legs time oh yeah so this
this anyways the lower bound on the
participation instance so you're allowed
to define dream all social impulse No so
that is splittable in that case you I
don't need this that's that's a good
point like if I was allowed to split
choose like fractionally choose the past
then I don't need this term that would
have all that y squared is all that I
would have needed but here in this what
I'm talking is you to choose one of the
paths integrally okay so this is
specific for this specific latency
function on the edges that's generalize
it generalizes I'm gonna show at the end
of the talk like it generalizes to many
many problems yeah can you just refresh
again why you get the second term
imagine okay so let's take one concrete
example there is a path within and edges
and parallel edges and there is only one
player wants to use this graph okay if I
only put the first edge the linear
program is going to say take 1 over N
where I'm going to take each edge to an
extent of 1 over N okay my objective is
going to be 1 over n square but the
player incurs at least a cost of one
okay 10 work yeah terms in bed skirt
okay if there were multiple players then
Tyler yes right when our end but it
should be one right so but on the other
hand since he is using at least 18 years
to pay a cost of one right so that is
what this term is fixing so he's saying
if I took the path i right i am going to
pay at least one along each edge what
whether there is other players in the
system or not that i am going to pay and
so that i am saying that is a lie right
so you're thinking of a little
conversation and xij is gonna take
values your wife rich pop yes but that's
in the moment where you could take
several different i I intend to I want
xij to be 01 but I can't solve that
version so I'm gonna relax it to be a
linear convex program so there it can
take fractional values in the integer
case this right hand side is this is
equal to about yeah less than the left
hand side yes yes but in the fractional
cases can be bigger so you can say yes
yes so really it shouldn't be why you
say it should have been ye times the
number of people who use it but if
they're integers then it's a square
klicks to find the fractional they're
not yeah so far it feels too right
exactly okay um is it be yeah yeah okay
so what are the constraints constraints
are fairly obvious so xij means that
player j is using this path I so there
are multiple choices of Patsy has yes to
sake one of these okay so xij is just
one summation over all I it has to be
one so which basically says every player
chooses a path okay and then what is the
second constraint the second constraint
is going to say that the latency on edge
is at least the number of players using
that edge which is basically summation
over all I and some may seven all J xij
where pop I uses this edge e okay so
this is all over all paths which use the
edgy suppose there are multiple paths
going like this you fix an edge e then
that's the summation over all of that
and xij is the weather player I is using
player j is using the edge I or not okay
so ye has to be at least this quantity
one so I is an edge in one Sammy Ofer
edges no I is just all possible paths
you can take the player J can take I
index of a path so this graph is given
to you ok so convex program is fairly
obvious I mean so there are no special
tricks except the fixing the integrality
gap of that ok so now so this is a
convex program this is not a linear
program and the people who are not
familiar with how to take right to do
all of this I am NOT getting to the
details that is a very nice survey by
Nikhil Devon or who is not here you can
see how to write the dual of this linear
programs okay I mean in a way that you
can separate the constraints from the
objective which is something similar to
the LP duels so here the duo gives me
the duel is something like this it says
it gives a variable J alpha J for every
player and it gives a variable beta e
for every edge ok and so that's the
objective this is all obtained using
standard taking the LP duels there is
nothing deep going on here but let us
understand this constraint this is where
i'm going to this will be very crucial
for price of energy analysis what is
this constraint trying to tell me so the
constraint is sterling if you fix so
constant that is so that the duel is
going to give me one variable for every
edge and there is a constraint for every
every player and every set of possible
paths for every pair ji so in particular
if you fix a player J so this constraint
says that alpha J has to be less than
all possible beta e plus alloy in
particular it has to be less than
minimum over all possible legacy right
maybe maybe the player is going to take
this path or maybe the player is going
to take this path corresponding to every
path there is a constraint and what the
duel is telling me this alpha J whatever
may be the value of this alpha J it has
to be less minimum of these two
quantities ok so let me rewrite this
this is what is dual is telling me so
the alpha
a in the dual solution has to be minimum
or all the constraints i had
corresponding to the player and this is
looks very similar to what Nash
equilibrium is trying to tell Nash
equilibrium is telling that in the Nash
equilibrium outcome the cost of the
player has to be minimum or all the
strategies he had like if he deviates
unilaterally is cost the cost he incurs
has to be minimum of these quantities
right so this is what dual constraint
told me and this is what Nash
equilibrium is telling me and perhaps
perhaps there is a connection right i
mean this this this pattern we cannot
miss so maybe maybe this beta e + li
this quantity i want to interpret as the
cost of player using this strategy I so
in essentially that is what i want to i
want to show so in particular i am going
to define alpha j as the cost player
incurs in the Nash equilibrium theta and
beta e to be the latency on this edge E
so there is some outcome this is a Nash
equilibrium I am NOT as you making any
assumptions on this Nash equilibrium and
player J incur some cost just define
alpha J to be that quantity and in this
outcome beta e is the latency on this
edge okay so what happens if i define
like this a particular note that the
cost alpha cost of j the costs incurred
by player j is going to be minimum or
all these because of the condition of
the Nash equilibrium and this
immediately gives me some bound on the
price of anarchy just by the definition
because what is the dual objective dual
objective is summation over all player
costs minus beta squared and by the
definition i defined alpha j to be the
cost of the player in the Nash
equilibrium so the first term is just
the cost of the Nash equilibrium and the
second term beta e squared again is the
cost of the Nash equilibrium because i
define beta e to be the latency and this
in fact gives me the prime do dual
object is at least three quarters the
cost of the Nash equilibrium three or
four and which means the primal object
to is at least this and this will give
me a pound of Four Thirds right and in
fact if someone asked me whether this
the players can choose fractionally in
fact if the player chose fractional this
in fact would have given me the bound
four thirds on the price of north which
is tight in fact but since I used this
Ally term in the objective in the primal
objective which means that the primal
was not the tight is not a lower bound
on the opt you lost some factor there so
if you call if you take into that
account then you will get the price of
anarchy okay i am not going to do that
but it gives the tight bond known for
this problem okay i am how much more
time have okay so i think i'm yeah i'm i
don't know why it doesn't show that time
here okay so i'm ok so i'm almost done
so i am left doing only one thing to
show that the constraints are satisfied
and let's just verify for one case so
why is this constraint satisfied so the
Alpha it is very fairly obvious because
alpha J is basically has to be less than
beta e plus a lie and the way of defined
beta is just the cost of using this edge
and that in fact that is what alpha I
set alpha J to the cost of the player
and the beta is just the cost of using
this edge and that's by definition
satisfy the constraints right okay for
if the player switches then I have to
argue that the cost of each edge
increases by one at most one and that is
where this quantity allies sales way
okay but this is just by definition
these constraints are satisfied okay so
and now to bound to the more general
concepts of equilibrium instead of
setting this the cost you set in the
expectation if the distribution is in
course correlated equilibrium you take
the expectation of these quantities and
entire proof goes through okay so
someone asked me whether this is very
specific to this problem it's not I
could prove like all of these results
and obtain the tight bounds exactly is
in the same proof typical technique so
and in fact there were several open
problems like coordination mechanisms
per temporal routing and things which
were not known how to solve using
smoothness framework and we can get
results using this and these were the
first results known and at least to mine
all to my understanding I think the
smoothness framework and the duality or
equally powerful although I might be
wrong and that's one of the
the questions were worth exploring and
another thing this this technique input
highlights is that can be used this to
bound the price of stability like if you
start with some dual feasible solution
and say that I can modify this to us
feasible solution in a way to bond Nash
equilibrium converge to a Nash
equilibrium then we can also get price
of stability results okay so I war
should buy couple of minutes and thats
thats completes my talk I will leave you
with this picture of the entire
framework thank you over the break so
