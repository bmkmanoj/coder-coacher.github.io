tremendous volumes of scientific data is
critical for research discoveries and
collaborations worldwide this ability is
more readily attainable than ever thanks
to the cloud
today's cutting-edge research has moved
to the cloud leaving behind the
limitations of physical data processing
facilities and high costs cloud
computing has changed the face of
research by bringing almost limitless
computational power and scalability to
data intensive research researchers
across disciplines throughout the world
are using cloud computing to process and
share enormous datasets quickly and
inexpensively in the burgeoning field of
genomics cloud computing is helping to
put cancer treatment on a whole new
trajectory as researchers work to
identify the link between a specific
patient's cancer and the individual's
genome in medical imaging the cloud is
aiding in the search for anomalies in
the brain and other complex and atomic
structures the urban sciences of also
experienced a boost thanks to cloud
computing researchers are using the
cloud to blend data from cities around
the globe as they search for subtle
signals and complex patterns uncovering
relationships and issues in water
management waste disposal and public
health in terms of urban development
cloud computing is enabling architects
and engineers to design the most energy
efficient buildings paving the way
towards tomorrow's greener cities cloud
based instrument data gathering
techniques are being used to help
researchers study everything from ocean
chemistry to air quality to changing
weather patterns this wealth of data is
informing discussions about earth
systems such as the causes and
consequences of climate change
understanding the consequences of
climate change requires cooperation
between scientists across many
disciplines sharing data models
calculations and results cloud computing
is the ideal infrastructure to support
such collaborative research it makes it
easy for scientists to quickly share not
only their findings but also bad data
and the entire process by which they
generated their results microsoft azure
provides a versatile cloud platform that
supports multiple languages tools and
frameworks including Linux Python Java
Hadoop Microsoft Windows and the
microsoft.net framework to help
accelerate the speed of insights and
discoveries Microsoft research offers
resources such as free training webinars
and technical papers that will expand
your understanding of cloud computing
giving you hands-on experience with
Microsoft Azure to learn more visit Asia
