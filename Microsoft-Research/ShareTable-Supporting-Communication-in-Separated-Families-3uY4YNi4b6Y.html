I'm pleased to introduce Lana euros from
Georgia Tech Alana's been working with
Gregory a bad they're finishing up her
PhD and she's here is a candidate given
candidate talk for a postdoctoral
research position AJ and I had the
pleasure of working with lata a couple
of years ago where we connected kids
with videoconferencing and Lana's
probably doesn't done more work than
anybody building and deploying video pro
conferencing telepresence systems with
kids and family environments so I will
let her share her work with you wow
that's a great introduction thank you um
so yes my name is Lana and I'm going to
be talking to you mostly about the share
table which is a system for supporting
communication and separated families so
I'm currently a PhD student at georgia
tech I'm almost done oh is this like
really washed out I wonder if there's
anything can do about that but um my
background is in computer science and
psychology and an industrial design and
I think you'll be able to see how all
these fields kind of combine in my work
so I've done a bunch of stuff in the
past I'm really only going to be talking
today about supporting parent-child
communication but if you can read them
there's a bunch of other topics so if
you want to ask me about these at other
times feel free and i'll i'll let you
know what else I've been doing so i'll
start off by giving a quick overview of
the problem space and a bit of
background to provide some context for
my research i'll talk about two studies
that I've done that focus on
understanding the needs of parents and
children and separated families I'll
talk about the system called the shear
table that I created to address the
challenges faced by these families and
I'll give a bit of an idea of future
directions that my work can take okay so
here's our Parent Child separation due
to work is portrayed in the media right
now this is an Oreo commercial
so we solve parent-child separation
right um well does this actually happen
in real life I'll come back this
scenario later and fill in some of the
blanks here so why is it even important
to support parent-child in parents and
children and interacting remotely so
these are just some statistics to give
you an understanding of the potential
impact of this work as a result of many
factors primarily divorce about thirty
percent of children in the United States
don't live with both of their parents
and in fact significant portion of these
children live in a different city from
one of their parents which makes
continued contact fairly difficult and
even families that aren't living apart
parents are spending less time and
playing with our children and since most
families live away from the grandparents
nowadays it really isn't that kind of
one on one child to adult interaction
that's going on it's becoming more and
more rare and although this is
problematic because time together with a
caring adult is a significant predictor
of a bunch of awesome outcomes for kids
like academic success emotional
well-being social even physical
well-being all these areas are affected
by having contact with caring adults so
this is the depressing stuff and I just
kind of wanted to get this out of the
way because the rest of my talk is
really about hope for the future so the
good news is that communication
technologies can allow us to reclaim
some of that important parenting time by
increasing opportunities to interact
potentially especially over distance so
this is a photo from a new york times
article and it's an article about
commuter families families where one
parent spends the week away and comes
home only over the weekend and here a
dad is reading a book do skids over
skype right so this should be great news
we've been working on communication
technologies well for the office since
before I was born so we should have this
figured out by now right communication
we should have figured out um well it's
actually not that simple there's a lot
of differences between communication
technologies for work and trying to
parent / distance the parent-child
relationship is different from other
relationships because it's characterized
by a symmetry so usually the parent
provides care and guidance
the child but not vice versa and
frequently the motivation to interact is
different for parents and children and
I'll talk a little bit more about that
later second when you're dealing with
children there's a whole different set
of challenges from dealing with adults
they need help understanding what the
separation means they need to help
understanding how to deal with that and
frequently they're just any kind of
logistical help and setting up the means
that they might have for communicating
lastly for grown-ups conversation is a
good way to me stay in touch but that's
not really the way to engage children
children build closeness through care
and play activities with significant
dalts in their life and that's very
different from other types of
relationships and finally there's just
the idea of putting technology in the
home which introduces its own set of
challenges so you for example you can't
rely on the kind of internet
connectivity that you may get in the
workplace you need the technology to be
quite robust because you're dealing with
the whole new set of challenges now you
have like cats cheering on your cores
and three-year-olds trying to climb your
system like a mountain that's very
different from the office space usually
and lastly the home is a very personal
space and now you have all these privacy
concerns that you might not have in the
workplace okay so this is the work
that's been done in HCI for developing
technology to connect parents to connect
family connect time for family
communication so I don't actually expect
you to like read all this but I just
want to point out a few things so
asynchronous communication is fairly
well explored like we've been working a
space for a while and most common topics
focus on things like sharing photos
written notes and calendars but
synchronous communication has only come
into focus more recently and in fact
like the papers that are highlighted in
orange and i'm sorry i'm sure this very
washed out you can't really see it but
you can see the general number of papers
i guess um it's
because um I don't know what set up on
my laptop I can see it um do you know
how to do not to fix it it's coming to
flying on the recording it's just the
projector yeah yeah well so projectors
are hard and we'll get to that later on
in the talk but the papers that are
highlighted in orange is also that's
been published in the last two years so
as you see this is kind of like I like
to call the forefront of a zeitgeist so
I think it's a good place to be okay so
now let's launch into what I've actually
done I'll roughly follow the same
sequence in this presentation that I use
as a researcher I go into a space a
conduct formative investigations to
understand what are some of the problems
that I may address in the space I design
and I evaluate to see whether an
approach was successful or not so I'll
start out by talking about parent-child
contact and families that are separated
by work travel and I figured that some
people in this room might identify with
that topic because your researchers and
researchers travel a lot okay so to find
out what happens when families are
separated by work I conducted our long
interviews with parents and children
where at least one parent spends a lot
of time traveling and so I'm not sure if
you can see it very well here but the
table is classified by color based on
the kind of work that the parent does so
the bottom for here are or I have a
pointer hold on there the bottom for
here are academic travel then we have
for here there were military travel and
military deployment and then the top
ones here are all business travel and so
it's kind of classified by frequent
separation versus long-term separations
so frequent separation is more than five
nights a month apart and long-term
separation is spending more than two
months served consecutively apart and
the actual reasons for separation
included lots of things like deployment
training immigration sabbaticals
conference travel and more first I was
interested in have parents and children
responded to the separation and it
actually turned out that their responses
are quite different and you know here
I'm talking in general if you read the
paper you can find example exceptions to
these rules as well but this is what
generally parents placed emphasis on
they usually placed emphasis on
remaining an active part of the child's
life while they're away so to do so they
tended to be proactive about initiating
synchronous and asynchronous contact
with the child such as calling home
every day when I asked parents for the
advice that they would give to other
parents who travel for work they said
things similar to I guess just try and
let your kids know that you're still
there you're still a part of their lives
that you haven't really gone not to
worry about you when they do try to talk
remotely parents try to stay in active
part in child's life and talk about
daily events so for example they might
ask about how school is going and try to
suggest strategies for studying for a
test this is actually very different
from children so children rather than
thinking about separation try to choose
to focus on other activities spend time
with co-located adults who are around or
think about what will happen once the
parent returns so when I ask the kids
for device that would give to other
children whose parents travel for work
they said things like you should spend
time with your mom when your dad's away
and spend time with your dad when your
mom's away or maybe try not to think
about that try to think about other
stuff sometimes like watching TV gets my
mind off of it so basically the takeaway
here is the children and grown-ups deal
with separation differently for the
majority of families that we talk to
when you design a direct communication
technology you are implicitly meeting
the supporting the desires of the
typical parent over the desires of the
typical child now I'm not saying that we
shouldn't build direct communication
technologies for families I'm just
saying that it's important to consider
what might happen when you introduce
obligations to communicate the child may
not be willing to meet or when the
parents expectations for the
communication are not met just something
to think about so additionally i looked
at strategies that these families had
we're staying in touch as well as the
problematic aspects of these strategies
and i'll just give a brief overview here
there's kind of a typical way in which
your mode contact happens so typically
the remote parent calls the co-located
parent or maybe they Skype the
co-located parent and once they talk the
phone is passed around or the kids are
brought in and the other members in the
house will get a chance to talk as well
it's usually scheduled and it's usually
scheduled by the remote parent now the
main challenge of this approach is that
it's not always easy to get kids to want
to talk on the schedule so it frequently
kind of feels like pulling teeth and
getting one word answers second most
parents supplement
calling or skyping with spontaneous
asynchronous communication like sending
mail sending packages text messages and
email these communications were usually
direct directly between the parent and
the child and that's what made them so
special to the child just getting
something with your name on it and the
mail when you're a kid kind of is really
important they most of these messages
were also phatak in nature so they were
not about sharing information but more
about conveying emotion so 18 year old
girl described her emails to her mom and
she said I always use big letters and
say I love you they take up like half of
the page I used to make these little
smiley faces and put them on there then
I put on like a little background so
it's about emotion not about the
information and the email the main
problem with the strategies there's
actually very few systems for
asynchronous communication with young
children they don't often have phones
and frequently not email either a male
is kind of painfully slow now the best
tool in the toolbox of the remote parent
is the local adult the adult that's
still with the child they act as this
awesome awareness system so they let you
know what's going on in the life of the
child while you're gone they're also
cheerleader motivating the child to
connect with the parent because we know
that that's not typically how children
deal with separation and then we have
video chat we just kind of hailed us
like the savior of all remote
communication well we found that out of
the families we interviewed only five
out of the 14 families used it regularly
first this is because for many families
especially military once the
infrastructure was simply not available
there was simply not high enough
bandwidth to use that when they were
deployed and second this was because the
video chat required to somewhat
tech-savvy adults to set up the
connection and many families just didn't
have that so it was easier to stick with
the phone only two of the families we
talked to plate online games together as
a way of staying in touch to me this was
surprisingly few because i thought this
might be a good way engaging kids but
then i considered what the online games
are actually like so if we're talking
about casual online games like yahoo
checkers or something like that you
can't see the other person you can't see
what they're looking at you can't see
what they're doing with their mouse and
this actually makes it really hard to
motivate the game for the child because
children don't just want to play games
of their parents because they like games
the like playing games with our parents
because parents make funny faces when
they make of that role or
let them win or they do all these other
things and you can't really do that with
the casual online games right now okay
so as I promised let's search enter the
Oreo commercial from the beginning so it
turns out in fact that these kinds of
playful activities over video chat can
happen for families at least for the
five out of the 14 families that use
video chat regularly but I think there's
a lot missing from the video so let's
fill in some of the details okay so
obviously it's the other parent that has
to set up the video chat and of course
it's problematic so in this case it
requires scheduling ahead of time and a
few attempts at connecting and before
the video and audio and everything works
the majority of the interaction is
actually between the parents so here the
mom lets the traveling dad know kind of
details of the son's life in general
day-to-day activities okay now finally
mom goes to get the kid of course he's
dealing with the separation in the way
the kids deal with separation he's
playing video games to distract himself
and of course eventually mom convinces
him to go talk to his dad but you know
does require that kind of cheerleading
work so the conversation starts and the
data attempts to get some details about
what the mom was saying you know how was
school and this is the classic
interaction what are you doing school
yesterday nothing and the dad continues
to ask questions hoping get more than a
single word response but it's kind of
awkward okay finally it's time to say
goodbye and so they end with their cute
tradition of eating an oreo cookie
together so that is very creative and
it's cute but of course there was a lot
missing from that video there was a lot
more work that went into that
interaction than the Oreo commercial
showed okay so now that I've made a huge
deal about the role of the co-located
parent and remote parent-child
interaction what happens when that's not
there what happens in divorced families
still to learn more about the needs of
divorced families that conducted
in-depth interviews with members of ten
divorced families we interviewed
children residential and non-residential
parents and I tried to recruit for
variety of visitation structures and
arrangements and custody arrangements I
also did drawing exercises oh man you
really can't see those at all okay well
I won't talk about them I can't I can
show you the drawing exercises later how
about then um okay so I wanted to know
about the communication goals of each of
the family members so here's a quick
overview of the findings
and the goals that are highlighted in
orange might be attention with the other
goals um so first I want to point out
that the major things the parents and
children have in common is that they
want to direct by doing stuff together
they want to play games they want to do
daily routines like eating dinner
together or bedtime and just you know in
general doing stuff together rather than
nobody said we just want to sit across
from each other and talk we found that
both the residential and non-residential
pants actually had the same goals but
they may disagree on how to achieve
those goals they both wanted to have the
necessary information and power to act
in the child's best interest and they
both wanted to maintain a strong
emotional connection with the child but
this was actually really hard for the
non residential parent we also noticed
that it seemed to be important to both
parents to minimize attention between
households so mostly the way they did
this is by accepting this kind of mom's
house mom's rules dad's house dad's
rules arrangement and also this led to
most of the contact being scheduled so
it's not to interrupt the routines of
the other household now this may be a
problem because what we know about
children's if they're kind of in the
moment creatures they want attention or
support in the moment and by the time
the schedule contact occurs they may
have already forgotten what they wanted
to share now one of the things that
surprises in the study was that the
children were much more sensitive to the
tension between their parents and the
parents thought so I talked to one of
the moms I asked her you know is your
son aware of all this tension that's
going on between you and your ex and
she's like no we never even talked in
front of him so if I'm talking on the
phone I'm always in a different room we
never raise our voices in front of I
don't item I don't think he knows and
this is what the boy said my mom has a
way to make her voice sound like she
doesn't care but at the same time you
know it's not true and it really hurts
to hear that voice and whenever I want
to call my dad she always uses it saying
oh so you're calling him so this leads
some children to keep contact with one
parent as private from the other parent
as possible they're really aware of that
competition over their time and
affection I also talked about technology
use for these families and the telephone
was still the primary way for the family
sustained touch but both parents and
children seemed to dislike it it was
hard to keep the child engaged and find
topics to talk about short calls were
calm and several parents described the
exchange of how's it going good it's
going on nothing that seems to be the
typical conversation the telephone is
extra
for young children who are still
developing the communicational
competencies to understand the finer
points of language like irony humor
fantasy in person they're aided by
visual cues but over the phone things
get more difficult as one pair and
described you can't really even joke
with him unless you say I'm kidding or I
got a good one for you a lot is lost and
so then we have video conferencing but
it's still a long way off from being
used routinely one problem is a system
is still too complex for children to use
on their own so it usually requires them
to get help but it's really awkward to
go to mom and ask her to connect you
with that that's what we found from the
interviews so if video conferencing is
set up it's usually for a special
occasion the parents set it up and then
the kid you know can use it at that
point if so basically any video
conferencing sessions that we saw in
these interviews they were always in a
scheduled ahead of time and we never
heard of one being initiated by a child
however both my came a little later so
the the children that I interviewed were
always between the ages of seven and
eleven I think in this interview study
we had one as old as 14 though but they
also had younger siblings frequently so
we could sort of get the parents for you
and how it worked the younger chosen if
they're getting 12 13 14 s acting with
each other
a lot easier for down yeah yeah have
witnessed I have so I think once the
once the child is around 13 or 14 that
definitely happens but I think there's
still this issue where sometimes the
skype is like on a family computer and
it's still something that's kind of
awkward for the child to do without what
they feel like as a permission from the
other parent yeah what is he nice time
required scheduling the other parties
there you make a skype ordering a little
phone call what I do evolved because
mostly families did not keep a computer
with skype logged in at all times
usually skype was something that they
turned on when they were about to make a
call mistake to assume that people keep
their computers on all the time to most
people in fact turned off I see okay
look yeah that's what we found as long
however both video conferencing and
phones suffer from the same common
problem it's that sitting and talking is
just not the common way or the natural
way for parents and children to interact
so many parents complain the talks on
the phone and video were short well this
is not surprising as even in person
children spend less than one hour a week
participating in household conversations
this is from time studies with
co-located family family members so it
doesn't really make any sense to expect
him to spend more time being engaged
with somebody who doesn't live with them
at what age do they start having more
conversations I think the time study was
like the one I saw was just like
children under under 11 I believe you
know let me if you want to shoot me an
email question I can actually give you
the time studying I think that might
give you a bit more detail there all
right so it's problematic right now so
basically remember the five strategies
that I had for work separated families I
mean it's hard enough for work separate
families but it's even more challenges
for divorced families so yeah you get
scheduled synchronous contact but you
don't really get it with the entire
household you kind of get it with the
kid only and you don't have the other
parent acting is this awesome awareness
system you don't have them acting as a
cheerleader frequently if you do get a
synchronous patek communication while
some families kind of are more open to
spontaneous stuff but usually custody
agreements frown on anything spontaneous
you want to have everything laid out
ahead of time you may use video chat
together but we and you may play video
games online but without another adult
there to help set that all up on the
other side it's probably not happening
so it's extra problematic for divorced
families and that's kind of why I wanted
to focus more on divorced families in my
work I see that there's more potential
for impact here okay so now we'll get to
the share table system I'll talk a
little bit about the design process a
bit about the implementation basically
as much as I can fit into the remaining
time about the evaluation so I wasn't
going to try to solve all the challenges
of one system but identified what seemed
to be the most important issues for
communication system for divorce family
so it should provide visual channels for
communication not just audio it should
be really easy to initiate so the
children can do it spontaneously and
without having to ask an adult for help
and most importantly the system should
provide parents and children with ways
of doing stuff together rather than just
talking so one of the things that
acquired in grad school is training an
industrial design so this frequently
means that I think through sketches none
of which you can actually see here I all
of a check and show to you later however
then and the final system didn't really
like pop into my head fully form but
rather this was an outcome of several
cycles of generating ideas getting
feedback from families and these are
some of the sketches from that process
but oh maybe Oh almost you can see it's
just enough to entice you to ask me for
them later okay so the final outcome of
all this work is the sheer table system
this is what it looks like so basically
apparent in the shell each have a shared
table in their home the tables connect
via broadband and this system presents a
dedicated connection so as easy to turn
on as a phone basically if you want to
start a conversation you open the set of
cabinet doors and it calls the other
table it rings on the other side like a
phone would if somebody opens on the
other side the connection is initiated
to end the connection you just closed a
set of cabinet doors that's it there's
no mouse keyboard buttons anything like
that um the monitor is basically your
face-to-face video so that's where you
see the other person it's just full
screen video conferencing and that's and
you can hear them to the speakers but
the table top provides a shared space
for activities so basically there's a
camera and projector above the table
anything that you do over the table
surface is captured by the cameras
went to the other table and projected on
top and the two projections are aligned
so that if I put my paper board game
down on my side of the table you can see
it on your side projected along with
things like my hand as long as we both
have something to use as tokens and dice
so if once you put your tokens on the
right spot on the projected board game
they appear projected in the right space
on my board game so let me give a quick
video of how this would look if we were
using it so my table rings and I open
the doors to initiate the connection it
starts up and I say hi to my friend
sonica okay please excuse our amateurish
camerawork you know we do it would your
best but so I put a book on my side of
the table and again this is not like a
special book is just a regular book and
now it's invisible in the other side of
the table additionally if we want to do
something like draw together that's
really easy you just use dry erase
markers on the surface of the table now
you may not just the frame rate of the
table surface is not great we really
prioritize the resolution of the table
surface over the frame rate because well
usually things that you put on the table
don't necessarily move that much but
it's pretty important to be able to see
it if there's small font so I drew my
fish and now my friend sonicate can
contribute by drawing on her side of the
table as well and I can see it online so
that's basically how it works so the
idea of the sheer table is actually
really simple but there are a lot of
technical challenges that needed to be
soft actually get this to work I won't
talk about all of these but I'd be glad
to answer any questions about them this
is basically just you highlight that I
have skills as a maker and this doesn't
even include the carpentry so the
carpentry was a big part of this project
as well I started out by running a lab
based evaluation the share table with
seven parent-child pairs basically they
did a variety of tasks such as a
worksheet together playing a board game
together this was to allow us to compare
the share table with just video
conferencing and I'm not going to talk
about all these results in detail but
basically it was it was encouraging it
showed us the parents and kids really
got the system and could use it and so
it led us to actually try to deploy it
in the home
so we put the system the home of
divorced families in the Atlanta area
and I really wanted to highlight how the
share table was different from their
previous practices so we did a two-week
pre-deployment part of the study where
we asked them to keep communication
Diaries anytime they communicated
remotely we also ask them to fill out to
validated questionnaires so that we
compared to compare relationships before
and after they used to the system as
well as compare the different
technologies and while then the system
was deployed for four weeks and while it
was deployed they kept a similar
documentation process so they kept
communication Diaries and we kept doing
weekly interviews with them but we also
collected sort of text logs of system
used and also video logs if whenever the
system was in use so this is an example
of what the communication Diaries look
like um so the kids basically had one
where they could just circle something
or draw something and this is an example
of why it was important to also
interview because if I had an interview
I would have never known that this says
excited it's a creative way of spelling
it the parents basically could just
write on on a piece of paper and I was
looking for you know when you talked
what did you what medium did you use to
talk how do you feel after talking what
did you talk about that kind of
information additionally as sort of like
a brief side note I mean I mentioned
that we use the validated questionnaire
to evaluate certain aspects of the
system so developing and evaluating
question this questionnaire was one of
the contributions of my thesis work I'm
not going to go into too much depth
about it but basically the ABC CT that's
the questionnaire it measures the
emotional benefits and the emotional
costs of a communication technology so
emotional benefits might include
something like opportunity to provide
social support and emotional costs might
include something like introducing
unwanted obligations to communicate so I
validated this questionnaire with both
adults and children and if you want to
use it it's really available such as let
me know okay so let's talk about my
participants usually this is really easy
slide in the talking participants but
this is kind of complicated so I'll try
to go slow so in family they set one we
had Matt and Nadia who were married and
they had a kid named Simon Simon who was
seven at the time of the study and then
they got divorced in at eleven different
houses
Matt remarried to marry who already had
a three-year-old son named Jeffrey and
Nadia remarried to rod and by the end of
the study Simon actually also got a
half-brother but we didn't actually
direct with the baby so he's he's not on
picture okay in the second family we
have David and Kelly who were married
and had two kids they had Taylor and
Kennedy so Taylor is a boy and he's 11
and Kennedy's a girl and she's seven
years old at the time of the study they
got divorced and taylor usually lives
with his dad kennedy usually lives with
her mom the kids spent all the weekends
together so basically there's always
somebody getting shuttled every weekend
it's just the question of which parent
gets them both on that particular
weekend David also has another girl
named Casey who's too from another
relationship and um Casey doesn't live
like alone so don't don't call wick
Child Protective Services just me never
interacted with Casey's mom so she's not
on the slide but she lives in a
different house and he sees her every
other weekend and Kelly remarried to
Jason so the people who are in red are
the people who were actual like
participants enrolled in the study the
people who are in gray are people that
we interacted with who interacted with
the system but who were not people that
we had weekly interviews with okay so
here it is it was deployed in these four
homes so both the moms that's pictures a
and C decided to put it in the kids
rooms the dad from the first family put
it in the living room where the cat was
actually a big user of the system
because it generated a lot of heat and
then in the last family the dad put had
sort of in the man den of the house
which was also a shrine to University of
Georgia and if any of you follow
football you all understand the iron
either okay so jumping right into the
results how was the sheer table used so
I'm actually only going to talk about
three of these ways today because they
only have time I think for three ways
but feel free to ask me questions about
the other stuff as well so we saw a lot
of activities like drawing together and
playing together we saw kind of more
instrumental parenting activities as
well such as helping with homework
supporting learning by helping do like
math problems on the table for example
and co-parenting which is um
co-parenting is that thing with your
parents ganging up on you to get you to
do some
so we saw a lot of that especially
around like room cleaning activities
because now the remote parent could
actually see the state of the local room
and so they can encourage the child to
clean the room we saw sharing of
physical items and something we label
kind of sharing the moment for example
we got to see Christmas morning over the
share table that was pretty exciting and
we saw emotional care activities as well
so drawing together was probably the
most popular activity for parents and
children using the share table it
provided a context for the conversation
and it made the whole interaction sort
of feel more like hanging out so
sometime around sort of minute to of
talking to a child like you run out of
questions and it gets really awkward and
so then you say I love you goodbye and
so what happened instead of the share
table is that at this point they
switched to an activity so they would
like draw together something and that
for this provided enough of a context
that they didn't have to say goodbye
right away and usually came up with
other things to talk about later so in
this video you'll see Simon he'll be
drawing on this table and his dad mat
and step brother Jeffrey are on the
other side so they're gonna be watching
and making comments and suggestions so
the video quality isn't great because it
was so dark in the room and also his he
is anonymize so it's not you his face is
in fact blurry but I think you'll get
the idea look my dream yeah where's that
ready no it's like oh wait no it kind of
does look like you that's what I stuff
my secretary except there's no one's
honey wait one second it's almost done a
bit red I think you're gonna love to it
yeah he's left-handed yeah you told him
to lose nothing yeah there you go the
DNA wait okay there's Nina yep you'll
like it very good
so the other thing about being a child
in a divorced family is that you have
two homes and all your stuff is divided
between two houses including your mail
so mail was one of the big sort of
physical artifacts that parents and kids
shared on the share table so here David
the dad from the second family puts a
gaming magazine on the table so that his
son Taylor and his friend can look
through it and chat about the games and
this was kind of a time-sensitive issue
because Christmas was coming up so the
dad really wanted some feedback about
which games he might want to get for the
kid for Christmas either modern warfare
there yet yes sir where's the other one
I don't know what's your gamertag you
guys never added me deep see I don't
have you guys get here uh huh let me
write on here and i can write down my
gamertag white if you ride on here can
you see it yeah no he listened so far
okay here's my gamertag so I like the
casual yeah of course you can see it I
was only like two years of work but the
thing to note here is that Taylor the
kiddo was able to introduce a friend
from Mom's house to his dad a friend
that his dad otherwise I wouldn't have
met we also saw other introductions of
the share table so Simon the kid from
the first family had members of his
immediate family people he considered
his close family members who had never
met so his step brother Jeffrey had
never met his stepdad rod and that was
an introduction that we saw happen over
the share table otherwise this too would
have probably never gotten a chance to
meet okay but perhaps the most powerful
thing about the share table was the
opportunities that had provided for
emotional care so in this video Taylor's
on the other side and he's sick so Kelly
who's his mom and Kennedy his sister are
calling him so just note the use of
metaphorical touch to create a feeling
for comfort and closeness oh you can't
really see it
she's holding his hand on the table
she's stroking you see my hand holding
on to your hand yes aloof a lucky baby
loves dueling Troy thurs right hand FBI
cheap your hands and then we're going to
a family man okay
so this was kind of cool to see and
that's why I think this technology is
really powerful in the home space okay
but for those of you who like numbers
better here's some concrete ways to the
share table improved parent-child
communication so on average the amount
of time that the parents and child spend
communicating remotely more than doubled
for both families additionally it was
encouraging to see that the children
were actually initiating some of these
connections rather than always having
the parent call so I think this could
have been even higher and family one but
because of the specific arrangements
they had around using the share table it
wasn't so the rule in the first family
was that Simon had to go to his mom and
ask her for permission to use the share
table now even if she said yes a hundred
percent of the time just the fact that
he had to go to her to ask for
permission probably reduce the number of
times it heated it in the second family
that wasn't the case and in fact
children initiated more than half of the
conversations over the system so I
talked when I talked to Taylor I asked
him what was different about the share
table and he said it was more like yeah
like you wanted to do it I opened it up
what haven't you awareness if like dad
is even at the other end it rings on the
other side and it's just like a phone so
it rings and then if it doesn't nobody
answers at in time then it stops ringing
and it tells you like nobody's home
whatever so ya know there's no awareness
and that's something that I think would
be really important for this sort of
system to succeed in the long run though
the questions about what kind of
awareness would be acceptable in a house
that's not yours and the people who
don't consider you their immediate
family anymore it's a different question
so these are the results of the
effective benefits and costs
questionnaire showing a comparison
between the ratings of the previous
technologies used by families versus the
share table so previously the pit both
both of the family said that they had
tried video conferencing but neither of
them had used that than the two weeks
prior to the study so in the two weeks
of baseline data collection so really we
have to compare we have the phone to
compare to video conferencing so overall
the sheer table introduced servicing
additional benefit so particularly was
more emotionally expressive and that's
kind of to be expected there's video
here rather than just the just audio it
had this great a sense of presence and
absence which is on
when you feel close to a person even
outside of your actual immediate
communication with them so feeling close
to the first even outside of the phone
call or the share table session it also
seemed to encourage more kind of
engagement and playfulness it did
introduce additional threats to privacy
but it didn't seem to introduce any
additional obligations or I met
expectations okay so I really believe in
looking at both worked and what didn't
work when I value technology so I think
I already touched on all the points on
the left um so let's talk a little bit
about what didn't work so the number one
technical problem with the share tables
at the surface was simply not high
enough resolution for all the tasks that
families wanted to do especially the
tests of the 11 year old who dis point
read sort of regular font size books
rather than picture books with big words
and big pictures basically there was
just not enough bandwidth to do all we
wanted to do sometimes the whole system
was such a bandwidth hog that even the
face-to-face video would get choppy and
that was problematic for the families
then this is despite the fact that we
gave them business class comcast
business class comcast connectivity for
the duration of the study so they upload
speeds are still a bit restrictive and
we couldn't get the kind of the kind of
resolution that we wanted now it would
be really interesting to do is partner
would say like one of the new gigabit
cities that are popping up where
essentially the bandwidth wouldn't
really be a problem and see how this
kind of technology could be used in that
sort of space um the other issue is
privacy so Nadia the mom from the first
family had the most privacy concerns
about the use of the system in
particular she was really uncomfortable
with feeling like she was invading her
ex's privacy so he had it set up in the
living room in his house and she really
didn't like it but she could like see
like his new wife walking around in the
background she just felt like she was
intruding on this space additionally she
didn't like the speakerphone quality of
the system so like when you talk
everybody hears you and you hear
everybody based on her feedback we
actually gave provided headphones for
the second family to be able for them to
be able to choose not to have that
happen they didn't use it but I think in
the first family if we had provided the
mom would have unfortunately the share
table did also introduced a new source
of conflict for the family
is they try to figure out appropriate
practices around its use in particular
in family one no idea sort of the mom
tightly controlled maths use of the
share table so he had to call ahead or
text the head anytime he was going to
use it and she had to say yes ahead of
time before he could use it and
frequently we saw in the video is that
even the time there were times when she
said yes when he would end up calling
she'd say no I were too busy right now
this is not a good time and so this
really reduced communication and led to
frustration on his part yeah you have
any clarity about why big limited access
that way with him well that would be
good pair well so I think she'd been
didn't want things to change so before
the way that the dad would communicate
with the kid the kid didn't have a phone
of his own right so he would call the
mom and she would pass the phone back to
his kids she was the gateway through
which she communicated and she kind of
wanted things to stay sane um I don't
think she saw it as being problematic
she just saw it as like oh well it's a
courtesy for him to call me if he's
going to use the share table later um
but I think it really did reduce the
communication um in family to is
actually the opposite so the dad David
used the share table frequently and
spontaneously and that was frustrating
for the mom because it disrupted the
routines in the house so in one of the
videos we see him calling at 8am just to
say hi and she's like it's it's 8am but
like having breakfast as a family we
need to you know eat and get out the
door while you know why everybody
calling right now call it a regular time
so I said that neither arrangement was
really ideal but the strength of a
communication technology like this one
is that the custody arrangements of the
families agree on with the help of
actual professional can help them decide
on these things they can actually be
encoded directly into the system so if
the parents decided the appropriate
practice is that the kid can call
anytime but the parent can only call
between six and seven on a weeknight
then those can actually be encoded in
this into the system and be enforced by
the system itself now of course the hard
thing is what do you do when you decide
to change those rules how do you
negotiate them and how do you allow the
system to be flexible enough to change
those rules on the fly
lastly we found that both of the moms
complained that it wasn't really easy to
find uninterruptedly system so they
frequently use the weekends when the
kids were a way to catch up on things
like running errands to catch up on work
so they weren't at home in front of the
system to be able to use it so as Nadia
said I can pick up the phone in a
grocery store or wherever but I had to
sit down in front of the share table to
use it and a lot of time that's not
going to happen this really points to
potential for future works on mobile
versions of the system and I think
particularly powerful perhaps asymmetric
interfaces where the parents have a
mobile version they can use when they're
on the go but the child may have still
have something like the shared cable
which provides them with the
opportunities of being able to show
physical things and it's kind of more
natural system to use ok so the main
point of my thesis is that communication
technology is the power is powerful and
it can increase participation in child's
life from significant adults and I think
that that really has much bigger
potential and then just communication in
the home so let me just sketch out a
scenario that touches on some of these
ideas so imagine that you walk into a
preschool classroom and then the
afternoon the children get an
opportunity for free blame so a few of
them wander over to the shear tables in
the corner of the classroom teacher
turns on each station and with the
remote and just looks it to one of
several connections that shadow area
here had arranged already arranged so
these kids already know that mr. dapper
from the local retirement village is
going to be there to continue reading
about the latest adventures captain
underpants so the boys gather around the
station they know that he can see them
and hear them as well they can point to
the page and talk about the picture so
they kind of interact with their own
stories and it's more of a conversation
rather than just having a book read to
them now this table has actually been on
all day on the other side the girl has
been joining it in the lessons despite
the fact that she has been at a local
hospital for the past week so now it's
time to join in the play as well her and
her friend had set up toy cups and
basically are having a tea party
together on the third table the teacher
has arranged the connection with a
preschool for deaf children so he's
planning on connecting more with this
group in the future but for now he just
wants to give the children some time to
meet each other and play together
informally
so Kelly and Alex are on the other side
and they have already set up their board
game so with tokens that I see anybody
can join in Nick looks a little unsure
but I think he's up for the adventure so
I'm really just using the share table as
an example here I really go into each
specific context and try to come up with
a technology that actually addresses the
needs of that context and so the
specifics of the technology involved
might be different the bottom line is
that there's lots of places where this
kind of technology can be useful
communication health care education all
these can really be can benefit from a
technology like this okay so if you're
asleep now is a good time to wake up
because these are the three sentences
that I want you to take away from this
talk so the first thing is that the
parent-child relationship is really a
unique communication context and the
circumstances of the separation you know
I investigated work separate families
and divorced families but there's other
circumstances of the separation these
circumstances really influence the
strategies that the families use and the
challenges that they face the second
takeaway is that looking at kind of but
both the benefits the system provides in
the costs especially in terms of emotion
is one good way of considering and
evaluating communication technologies in
the home and the last one is that
communication technologies can increase
and more importantly change the nature
of remote contact with children when you
design them for considerations for the
specific context of the separation all
right thank you very much yeah uh one
month and at the end of the experiment
what were their feelings that they
expressed with regards to having habit
you know Gmail
yeah a struggle that a lot in the
beginning so you know we are getting
them something really potentially good
and then taking it away so the way we
frame the technology from the very
beginning was that um it's just kind of
like Mary Poppins she helps the family
that has to fly away to help the next
family so in fact at the end we kind of
had a mini design workshop with the
families to ask them for advice they
would give the next family who would use
it to talk about how they could make the
system better and just contribute in
that way I also offered to work with the
families to help them set up something
that is it commercially available and
see if they could use that and get some
of the benefits of the share table so
missing afterwards oh we oh oh my gosh
yes no I mean I still uh the little girl
from the second family is writing a book
report about the share table and I still
get like emails from the mom being like
we're trying to do something else like
let's try this other thing in the first
family the dad really wanted to try
mobile video conferencing so he already
had a phone those enabled so we actually
we actually gave a phone to the kid to
see if that would work but that didn't
dedup not working for them so I asked
him if the mom would have a problem with
kind of the kid walking around with
video throughout the house that would be
a privacy issue and the dad was like no
probably not we usually do what's best
for the kid and then when we
communicated again two weeks later I was
like can we say you're still using the
video conferencing and he said well I'd
like to but she never keeps the phone
charged I don't know why so I think it
was problematic and that was one of the
ways that they don't want to maybe go to
see an iPad solution or something like
that so in the second family I was
really hopefully they would do some sort
of video conferencing and the mom really
wanted to I think the dad had a bad
experience with videoconferencing early
on and that's kind of soured him for the
whole thing he was like at one point
they tried to video conference with the
grandparents and he said it took them an
hour and a half to set up a five
essentially what ended up being a
five-minute conversation like it was
just like too much of a hassle and I've
been working with the mall I'm trying to
basically get her to set up like remote
access and she can set it up on both
sides essentially so the dad doesn't
have to do all that like he was on the
phone she's like click the button to the
left but on his computers to the right
and you know that a kind of thing so
that was problematic but um you know the
families wanted this I mean I got a lot
of questions of one can we buy this and
you know i'm not i'm not doing a
start-up around it but now i can just
you know point to let me share and say
there's a better thing look is this you
know that kind of thing what do you oh
and let me share oh yeah come on yeah
yes new person can you bring some summer
of inheritance and also discuss with
your mother and daughter returned our
mother is flying on the plane you look
annoyed no I don't think I've seen it
i'm sorry i haven't seen all the ads
here but of course ideal video
conferencing right but other is what is
it what did they say when you took the
machines back yeah why mean mostly they
didn't want me to take them but they
that was the agreement from the
beginning so they knew that that was
gonna have to happen but ya know they
haven't seen that out I might have to
look it up yes what it says about about
communication in other situations
okay child child child and even adult to
adult uh any specific aspect or just how
this project in general reflected on it
um so I think one of the things that we
forget as researchers is that sometimes
a small barrier to communication can
actually make a big difference so we
don't think about the login screen or
the buddy list is a big huge hurdle to
jump through but that was basically the
difference between using it and not
using it in this case so the fact that
you could just open the doors and
they're there that made a big difference
um and I actually think that that's
that's the case in a lot of other areas
including the office where I think if it
was much easier to be like one button
talk to your collaborator rather than
wait let me set this up over several
machines and why isn't this working and
all that stuff I think that's that's
what makes a difference between using
you're not using I think I saw their
questions but yeah did the after the
fact when they were using the mobile
video conferencing yeah did they explain
why didn't work was it the mom didn't
keep the phone charged and I think that
was at my theory is that I was the
privacy issue so I thought a lot about
mobile versions of the system this idea
of mobile and some of the early feedback
that I got from divorced families was
that one of the things they really
wanted to make sure was always there is
a easy way to see is it on or is it off
and so if something is mobile like if I
have an iPad that's using doing my video
conferencing or something if it can be
left behind the couch and it could be on
and you don't know I mean kiss leave
stuff behind the couch all the time I
don't know why but they do and like
you're transmitting essentially like
audio to the other house without
realizing it so that's one of the
reasons that the share table was
designed as a piece of furniture so you
kind of know how to negotiate your way
around a piece of furniture you can
easily glance and see how the doors are
open or closed and so you know whether
it's on or off
wait those one more question then and
i'll come back you love about this the
very analog all the way then it works
which is it's very nicely with some of
your other turn it on and anything you
put under it is by definition
transmitted in some sort of appropriate
manner so it can be very use and very
imaginative passion and compassion to me
but all sort of fun things on her and
what are some other creative things that
you've seen he showed a couple things
yeah you know I wish so one of the
pieces of feedback that we get from the
parent is that the deployment wasn't
long enough he was like after the study
I kept coming up with these cool things
that we should have done that we didn't
do and oh my god why didn't we try
fiction area that would have been
perfect for it we saw a couple of things
but uh not like I think all the things
that work like the idea of like holding
hands the kids came up with that in the
beginning in the first probably like
first three or four videos that we have
of parents using their system they're
using it just they don't even pay
attention to the table top like the
little girl is trying to show my mom for
painted nails and the mom is not even
looking at them you know she's looking
at the screen because she's only
interactive videoconferencing for in one
of the families in the first family the
mom wouldn't even be in front of the
system when she was using it she was
using it as a phone she would stand off
to the side and talk so I think this is
like an unfamiliar way of interacting
for the families and so they didn't
really I don't know if they didn't yet
or they didn't I can't say that oh this
is like this awesome thing that they
tried it we haven't thought of before
fact I think the most creative use of
the system we actually saw in the lab
study deployment where the the kids the
dad lay face up on the table and they
can trace his face so that was like
really creative like I wouldn't have
come up with that um but yeah most of
the stuff we saw was you know pretty
standard so I was like oh like here's my
book report you can see like the grade I
got on it here's a drawing you know that
kind of stuff the kids are the only ones
to sort of try it like like playing tag
with their hands or like
creating like summary that they actually
don't really use the system is given
intent of it or you know they do use her
they use it as I intended it in fact I'd
say too much as I intended I didn't see
anything that was really surprising
that's what I'm saying yeah so I didn't
see like any use that was like whoa they
like to just try something completely
like weird that I wouldn't have thought
of before but probably because I spend
more time thinking about the system than
is really reasonable for any person to
think about anything so maybe I've
already anticipated all the possible
uses right 1 2 3 a paper design files
English would fit in a backpack in a
handbag in it under the airline seat
yeah we had someone I wish I could
actually show you the sketches in such a
way that you could see them but um it's
um and see if I can get back to the
sketches page here
Soho Wow no you might hey might have to
I might just have to show to you
separately but that was there was one
sort of right there I mean it kind of
hinged on having a short throw projector
which we all none of the parts of the
system were stolen but all of them were
borrowed and begged so we didn't this is
not really we didn't have like short
throw projectors or that kind of stuff
to actually play around with the idea of
mobility more um but we did think about
it a lot and wish that it would happen
yeah too and yeah so we actually built
something in along those lines um and so
the idea if you called the other table
and nobody answered what it did is it
captured a still image of the tabletop
and projected on your side so the idea
is you could leave a note a quick note
on the table or you can just you know
drop some pictures on the table the
other person could see it even if you
didn't answer the call nobody used it
and nobody is it not because I don't
think asynchronous is compelling but
because projectors took three minutes to
start up and so you called and nobody
answered and you went away by the time
the projector actually started up to
show you your still image so but I think
there's a lot of potential for
asynchronous especially you know in this
case the families were basically an hour
an hour and a half drive away from each
other so to same time zone and still saw
each other fairly frequently think
things would be fairly different if we
were talking about like different states
different countries data how presently
they call in nobody
I I do have them how many times they
called nobody answered but I don't I
mean I haven't like actually looked at
that data I um most of the time they
knew when the other person was going to
call even the spontaneous stuff like
they already knew that the kids are
going to be home that day or whatever
and so most the calls were answered so
who initiated more uh I can show that so
that I can actually show actual data um
if you can see it so basically the
starred ones are the people who
initiated conversations and the first
family was like dad all the way
basically there was one conversation the
kid initiated with the sheer table and
this line here divides the
pre-deployment versus the deployment and
then the mom initiated one conversation
of the share type on the first family in
the second family you actually see the
kids initiating a lot so Taylor is the
boy so he initiated and Kennedy is a
girl she initiated a lot of the
conversation so the starter ones are the
ones that initiate and the green ones
are the people who are participating at
all that in some families who created
new opportunities for conflict I could
get it also in some families do the
reverse where brought their parents
also in some way or maybe um so it
created opportunities for conflict but
so we gave this validated quick
questionnaire developed by psychologists
that like measures different aspects of
a relationship and we looked at okay
well on that questionnaire did they
actually report more conflict or not so
while they report reported specific
cases of conflict about the share table
the family to did not have greater
conflict overall it's just that when
they interact they can't have conflict
but it wasn't they would have had
conflict about something else if it
wasn't about the shirt table in the
first family that was actually greater
conflict between the parents well at
least the mom felt that her relationship
with the with her ex was less strong
after the share table deployment I don't
know as a result of it but it's only
some some causality that potentially so
second family thing with the kids bounce
back and forth between the different
houses did both adults use it with yes
kids remotely yeah so both adults got a
chance to use it with the kids are going
so I really like this system I think
it's really convoying especially to see
that in early
physical play with the projection and
the camera what things that struck me is
for help but you had audio and you had
visual on the form of protection did you
think at all about doing anything
would like physical output like optics
or widgets that like one person can
shake something over here and they're
holding on to it or by given mu or if
they're working on it they can feel the
other person for doing or having some
built-in widgets that they could compose
as a part of the different things to do
yeah we thought about it didn't do much
more than think about it so it was
interesting how much of that
metaphorical physical touch they got
even without actual touch so I think
sometimes maybe the symbol is just as
powerful as the the actual sense that's
being stimulated I think it would be
interested early interesting to build in
things like warmth for example like like
heat stuff I think that's actually
probably more indicative of closeness of
like vibration but it would be cool to
have some sort of actors we thought
about this idea of having like a like a
playground for your toys we're like
things like if you spun your
merry-go-round my merry-go-round would
spin for my toys and like if you have a
seesaw we could put toys on both sides
and they would actually you know go like
that but um we didn't actually make that
human from the other objects on the
table
portraying such about people for what
they were doing I think at all about
using different resources like a
from Sigmund white white why we submit
segmenting the human what is the what
the person's moving around versus image
so you have this like low waitin you
have this thing where you got frames
that are dropped yes up there trying to
show yeah yeah we sure no I think there
was a lot of things we could have done
to be more sophisticated in terms of how
he handled the video stuff but we just
we didn't get around to it I think yeah
and I think I think there's a lot of
opportunities for you know when it's
moving around still give high frame rate
but you don't need to have that good
resolution when it stops that's when you
upgrade the resolution what we didn't do
them future work of it okay all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
