just this afternoon we have just heard
four amazing like outstanding talks by
amazing outstanding speakers so and the
theme of the of the event is
interdisciplinarity in this
interdisciplinary search so without
further ado let me just let me just
invite all the speaker's here on the
only stage so you know Giants of our
field that can't say it differently so
please welcome professor Connor Tate dr.
Lampson profits popular meet you in
professor y'all
so I have to say something while well
people walk on stage so I was preparing
for this panel and I was thinking of a
title and then I was I was you know
thinking I'm very clever bye-bye
thinking of this now and
interdisciplinarity because when i when
i type this so the the word processor
actually said that this now does not
exist it's actually a typo apparently so
interdisciplinary exists but
interdisciplinarity apparently didn't
exist then I found myself very clever by
actually making this a noun by just you
know making it anyway and then just just
now I saw that Professor Yahoo's talk
also uses this noun so I feel that you
know we call croix it is ok ok so then
word is wrong yeah yeah ok so i have
just prepared a few questions that
should sort of start let us go and then
in the end we can also open up for the
for the audience to to ask additional
questions so I'd like to start with a
personal anecdote about 10 years ago i
was meeting a very famous research or
someone I admire very much maybe in the
course of this discussion we will find
out who this is and so at that time this
person was was doing research on sort of
a condo economics meets computer science
algorithmic game theory and I was asking
you know why why did you start to think
about this and then his answer of course
sort of somewhat tongue-in-cheek was to
say well you know I'm a computer
scientist I was thinking how can I win a
Nobel price then I was thinking you know
economy economics maybe biology maybe
physics you know economics is maybe the
simplest one so so now let's take this
as a starting point and let me ask you
know moving forward where do you think
that say you know computer scientists
will be the first where do you think
that a computer scientists will will win
a Nobel price for the first time in how
long will it take
and we didn't herb Simon already through
yes that is true that is true yeah
second one yeah I have a conjecture so
you know in my biology in medical
science that are there are often Nobel
prizes given from methodology for
example the inventor of the polymerase
chain reaction has a Nobel Prize who got
another price soon afterwards you not
very not very long after we discover
actually so I think that that that
shotgun sequencing has changed the way
Jim janome of genomics works in a
comparable a similar way and I mean I
haven't done it by maybe noble somebody
should they should nominate jean meyers
I think a lot at line I think the Nobel
Prize last year 14 in chemistry 1 by
computer type of work modeling the
protein formation folding I think that
that's the person that that it could
have been a computer scientist who does
it because I think that that a computer
scientist is perfectly possible to get
working together with these specialists
to have that distinction I think the
main the main thing is that computer
scientists don't seem to have the
patience to work over 20 25 years
because I remember I met one of those
person in Stamper at that time I wanted
to do protein folding and
so I went to to to see him and say that
is there anything interesting the one
can do end up but I found out as after
talking to him and others I got
discouraged because it's more messy it's
not the kind of question that we
typically solve that can be done in
maybe a year or I'm usually we don't do
a phone but by folks deadline so so I
think that for computer scientist to win
a Nobel I think that they have to be
more dedicated to have more conviction
about what they are doing like the
traditional disciplines but lots of no
bells have been won by fairly
short-lived work the pcr as an example
the double helix is an example it
doesn't have to be the output of 20
years of concentrated labor on one
problem well I think it's more
troublesome than the computer science
could bear if you think about it wasn't
the two Outsiders they have to endure
the cheering and the hostility of other
people they think that they are get
flies and and and that they have to
think about the various tricky things
they have to they have to navigate so
you wanted to be a different answer to
clean skin I think we have to us and
Christian skin okay
really really i don't know but i think
that you know it's true that you have to
you know to do that you know what what
Andy told us some some very interesting
principles about what is
interdisciplinary work what he did have
a size as much is is the amazingly hard
work that you have to do in order to
penetrate so we know the way of thinking
the a discipline that has been on its
feet for four centuries and running and
also the effort involved in convincing
these people that that you are worth our
time as I think I think dr. Lampson had
on you know he had a lot of these quotes
on his slides and one of them was I
think by niels bohr saying that science
is about it I can't quote it but science
is about sort of finding it a notation
to to be able to talk to each other
finding a way to talk yes yes and then
so that sort of relates to this tonight
so I mean obviously the question I asked
was sort of let's say a more general one
in the sense that lights if you think
about Jeanette talk about computational
thinking all right so we have seen today
throughout the day we have seen many
many examples of how say computational
thinking is influencing other sciences
very many great success stories you know
I mean another question I I'm sort of
having is you know with where's the
limit of that I mean can we get can we
you know some time ago I was reading an
article that said that for certain let's
say low quality jobs like say you know
make the people work in McDonald's for
example they have now they want to
basically create algorithms that the
input to which is a CD the output days
is higher or no higher and apparently
that's supposed to be more efficient
than
actually doing an interview and and so
you know Candace or is this a
computational way of thinking Candice
penetrate even beyond say biology
physics you know chemistry can it go
even I don't know 22 can be ever win a
nobel prize in literature or you know
well actually but this bouncer maybe a
little bit different well I in my mind
computer science is probably or even
engineering is the only field which I
think has separated physical
manifestation or physical realization
method with what is done obstruction
basically or virtualization and in that
sense actually when it comes to Nobel
Prize it's disadvantage because if you
say okay I got say my field perfect
intelligence machine now when we say it
it may be the box but we know what is
inside is not important it's not a box
but what is being represented by that
box whereas in that sense if AI perfect
machine is realized its impact is
probably as big as blue LEDs the blue
LED is here is the thing that that you
see ya and then so with that in mind I
don't think there's any limit because as
long as we have the world in which the
physical thing is a reality has the
problem to solve then we have to
represent it we have to obstruct it and
the essence of the solution is how how
the problem is represented and I think
they accept a few things which you have
to deal with the thing there are enough
of things and I don't think
I'm not at least for my life probably i
don't i'm not worried about things two
things to do yeah well let me put a more
optimistic a spin on it I actually think
that now that you you ask this question
I actually think that that that the time
is on our side I think that if you look
at the nobel prize in recent years in
say in physics or in chemistry and it
quite often awarded not to not not
because of the octave the the deep
theories but its its impact so for
example if you look at the the Nobel
Prize of Charles cow so for for the
fiber optics and I think that the the
the physics theory it's it's I mean it's
not it's not profound but I think it's
mostly because it's it's so relevant it
you change the world and if you also
like look at other prizes they are open
about magnetic resonance and that have a
very great impact in recent years or new
material which which might have future
applications or the even quantum
information processing I think three
years ago the face of pride one of the
winner one of the winners is it's it's
is Debbie won for his work on a quantum
information processing technology is the
ion trap and and so so I think that that
computer science has already
transform the world and I think with all
this new promise of machine learning and
I will not be surprised that we are
going to produce some really fancy box
as you but it has the intelligence in it
and I think they might just give the
prize to a box Edison ventures sorry in
your mind is there any any year they
feel that computer science or
computational thinking has not yet
touched that is waiting to be touched by
us one field stands alone in my mind it
has been touched by my computer
scientists by Newton but so its brain
science less valiant has done some some
amazing work very very sir there are a
lot of people who were computer
scientists and I'll doing brain science
in the sense of imaging data and so on I
believe that it's it's a number you know
there is a bed very probably less than
fifty-fifty bed that there could be some
very interesting theoretical ideas that
that will be needed to make progress I
me know that the problem is how does
this bag of neurons create the mind okay
there is there is some some chance that
that this needs some means some
interesting of marketing sites but even
short of creating the mind there are
much simpler things that curves
collections of neurons candidly and we
don't really understand how they do them
it's such a small number of cycles
that's right yeah so so it's yeah I'm
you know you you read you read the
standard graduate textbook in
neuroscience and in the sort of you know
the conclusion of the last chapter it
says you saw you read it all we know
more and more and more and still we have
not even started thinking about what
what what overarching reality is I
remember 40 or 50 years ago Jerry
Feldman tried to sell me on
connectionism and he didn't succeed but
he said something to me that has stuck
with me for all that time which as he
said we know what the cycle time of the
nervous system is it's a small number of
milliseconds and we also know that in
half a second humans and many other
animals can perform a considerable
number fairly complex perceptual tasks
and we have no idea how to program a
computer to perform those tasks in in
the hundred cycles that are available in
the nervous system never my mother would
make sense or be efficient or anything
like that we just don't know how to do
it
so yes I think there must be all kinds
of opportunities in this intersection
between between neuroscience and
computation and my belief is that hardly
any progress has been made so far so
taiko may have more more information no
it's see it seems that that's that's a
field that sort of its different of the
future or every decade okay sort of you
know yep go ahead well the
interdisciplinarity I mean this is the
discussion now I'm I don't know whether
I'm a computer scientist actually
probably not I'm I've been working on
the robotics from the beginning and to
me working in that field I have to work
with work with an on and different
disciplines from the very beginning and
one of the indeed one of the very
somewhat cynical statement I tend to do
is when I'm invited in computer science
so-called computer science conference as
a keynote or something I often shows the
slides which says I hate robotics is
classified as one of the application
areas of computer science and in my mind
it's opposite robotics is one of the one
of the tools one of the application of
robotics is in need computer science to
me and then one the way I say it is the
world is physical we are physical being
and we can't live by eating bit we eat
physical things we eat food and live in
physical so so dealing with physical
thing is in
need the core of almost everything in my
mind now as I said before computer
science that one of the greatest thing
which is somewhat separate the physical
realization with algorithm or whatever
you call we call and and that's the
reason why I think computer science is
though so dominant and we are because we
are not limited by the particular
realization of the computing yeah so so
anyway because of that I think from my
point of view things like physical
science physical things physical reality
Internet of Things and those things are
natural things and that that's obvious
the direction that computer science has
to deal with more physical more real
more real world and that's the source of
the problems this is actually great
transition because because you know when
there's an interdisciplinarity there
also has to be a non interdisciplinarity
somehow and i was thinking i think
professor rosenblum or some someone has
in his speech today talked about the
fear of becoming a mere sort of service
discipline for others and so i want to
ask you know is if if say more and more
like a larger and larger fraction of
computer science let's say is dealing
with physical or later letís is
primarily dealing with physical part is
that them primarily dealing with other
sciences to what extent should we have
such a fear you know I was I was joking
before you know my my I did my PhD in
computer science so I have a PhD in
computer science in 50 years from now
will anyone know what that is or or
people just study whatever biology or
and other fields and and computer
science just becomes a 0 and a set of
tools well we have a worked example at
several centuries old which is
mathematics and Bell wrote a book 50 or
60 years ago a title of which was
mathematics Queen and servant
science if we become the new mathematics
it's not too bad so I don't complain
just what I'm thinking but will we why
not if you believed in or we are yes if
you believe genet we certainly will I I
don't like to become a servant other
other disciplines I think that that the
answer to your question is not
preordained I think it depends on a lot
on what computer scientists namely we
decide to do I think that that that if
we have this conception that let's not
touch the other areas and we just tell
them what we know about computers and
let them work out all the applications
then I think that will eventually become
I think it's worse than a servant it's
it's you know it's it's marginalized to
a degree that essentially you will be
it's just like plane geometry that so my
own preference is that we actively
promote the creation of a greater
computer science in the sense that in
computer science I think that is sort of
like counting imbalance who all computer
science that that that we would actively
would expand the computer science
department so that we have people who
are actually working with a very heavy
knowledge in other disciplines and so
we'll have our own computational
biologists who are actually could be
biologists training and we have the
physicists we have the economists so I
think in this fashion computer science
will forever be a active participant and
growing with all these other disciplines
I mean it's not going to to eliminate I
don't I don't claim that we want to
eliminate all the other discipline I'm
just
let's have a method we need them
otherwise would be able to business all
right yeah so that will be my proposal
and and and I one obstacle is that I
don't know how this would be viewed in a
typical university because you are I
think could be actual camera pushing it
too hard I think that that's that's why
I actually thought in China there's a
chance to realize this vision because I
think that exactly because the core
disciplines are not already so strong
that that they have a very strong ego
that that it is possible to push for
this but I think that that it's going to
be very hard probably going to repeat
what time they said except starts from
the end amino I think I think that I AAS
is an amazing example of computer
science placing itself at the center at
the geometric center of the University
okay so you know we're at another center
of courses of the scientific discourse
and I believe that this is this is what
should happen everywhere in some sense
you know mathematics is a veined electro
center than all universities because it
has all these all you know it because it
has all these tentacles teaching
teaching my mathema everybody must learn
mathematics in this sense you are
becoming the new queen and servant of
science incidentally what I think of
servant I think of an old film another
amazing film that i recommend by dirk
bogarde which word servant means
somebody who radically transforms the
master by dint of being powerful and
necessary okay so so this this kind of
serve under you know
very proud to be so and and I think in
the United States what we are seeing is
that a lot of kids a lot of
undergraduate want to study you know one
study computer science for example in
berkeley about one-third of the 6,000
undergraduate that we have every year
take the intellectual computer science
course and it's not because they want
they have the ambition cam computer
scientist is but because they think that
this is what they should do jeanette
mentioned that in Hajra harvard the most
part the most popular of course these
days is not economics introduction but
the computer science introduction so
this a sea change i mean it means that I
me know even if we don't want to place
ourselves at the center it the kids are
placing us I mean know the customers are
placing us but the point is that I
totally agree with Thomas that it is
very precarious very risky it's not an
easy task okay that that while while
being very imperialistic and ambitious
we should also take good care of our
core okay because because you know but
that the Corps exists it's there you
know our core values our core concepts
are core abstractions or amino it's
there and it's expanding also okay so we
know so so we should also you should
also and you know the samosa secret
which which oddly was was kind to to
mention is very conscious that we have
to offer our hand to other disciplines
but also with the same hand support
support the core the core discipline
this reminds me of Professor yowls you
know diagram you know the initially
diverted to to you know this Venn
diagram that is moving together where
now the course start to overlap and I'm
thinking of a third diagram right where
basically the one core is included in
the other or it's
disappears and then and then you know so
so let me let me turn this observation
into a question so I guess um what is
then the core I mean what like let's say
let's say historically I mean
simplifying a lot of course but
historically you could say that
initially said the core of computer
science to some extent was to try and
make computers work BB useful increasing
scale efficiency and so on and and
developing the theory the algorithms and
then you know the theory necessary to
understand and reason about these things
but moving forward if if say if they let
say more and more of the key attraction
of computer science is to you know in
like the interdisciplinary nature of it
then what what of the core of computer
science is it still worthwhile really
going deeper and and really investing
you know six years of your life to do a
PhD in and expanding I think it will
happen naturally because people are
different there are people who are
really interested in some problems which
have very little to do with other
disciplines and it's just that for
example there are still people who work
on complexity questions saying that why
why is he not equal to NP and it is
derivative I think we should we should
leave room for that and and and
basically I think that only by having a
very large ability to do
interdisciplinary work can we afford to
nurture our core value and and because
that's where the resource to justify
what we are doing and also
I think that that one of the things that
that it's it's a little bit so it
there's this phenomena that that because
in computer science we at least it means
the real computer sign we tend to work
on too many publish too many papers and
so as soon as we have done the easier
problems we cut open we try to move on
to new pastures and and now the heart
problems we just left behind and I think
we have a lot a lot of very exciting
interesting open problems on the step
and let me just mention one that
everybody can can sympathize with namely
that at one point say 30 years ago or 20
years ago I thought that the theory of
data structure is the thing for the
future is going to be as interesting and
even as pretty as any mathematical view
the namely that what's the best data
structure between some problem but it
turned out to be so hard that I think
that by now very few people actually
have the courage to attack such province
it doesn't mean that that that that you
know that I I would love to see many of
my favorite urgency boobed Arjun never
gave up yeah so I think that that if we
structure our field in a nice way and so
that people who work on core problems
don't you let that if we have a reward
system such that would let us let us
keep our core instead of having this
fight which a number of years ago they
were already fundamentalist against yeah
interdisciplinary and and and i think
that's it was a stupid fight and i think
we can and it isn't enough room for
everyone to do and people should be
should be recognized based on their
contributions I think it's just the same
way
it's easy to say that the stupid I don't
have worn it it seems to me that the
core of computer science is dealing with
complexity there is an unlimited amount
of complexity complex engineering that's
what we'll do yes exactly and we're not
going to run short of complexity to do
you deal with any time soon and you can
find it in a lot of different places
speaking about complexity both both
butler and a dimension dimension
complexity so let me so there is a let's
take the p % me problem which we which
fit emerges complexity i think that to
doing that disciplinary work first of
all you have to be recognized as a
science okay and that's you know in
other words other sciences don't tell
you go away okay so let me know your
discipline okay so when i started
working in computer science when all of
us you know started working on computer
science this was not a given absolutely
it was it's not a big problem now x
precise let me know so if we ask why is
that okay there are three reasons very
can see okay one is that they watch the
solver amazing engineering problems okay
for you know i'm speaking of designing
databases okay sort of you know
compilers you know so these are there
are a few amazing amazing engineering
successors okay that's one number two
and you can assign weights is the pivots
NP problem okay in other words computer
science is one of these disciplines from
which I human questions of mine human
interest can control okay so we'll and
we have problems that are too hard for
mathematician person for example um you
know that also will stay with
you know of course I me know if an
amazing question comes up and then it's
immediately squash yes it's for one
right but but but if we would say around
the third thing that put us that brought
us rage made us made us made us giant
among the giant disciplines was the
internet okay so I know that that that
the internet wherever it came from has
has brought computer science to the
people in other words now the whole
world is our subject okay so you know so
so and as a result we cannot be ignored
okay so all these things all right i
mean oh you know make us also realized
that this is a scary situation you know
it's precarious what what Thomas asked
the world in 50 years people know what
what what computer science was and we
have to look at the other two at the
course or if you know the engineering
course or you know the mathematical
intellectual core and that's where you
know that's who without a core we are
nothing right when I said complexity I
didn't just mean reputation i totally
understand me no computer science is
about taming complexity so you know all
of its aspects all of that specifically
the science totally totally gutted easy
I'm sure you did but I wasn't sure that
everyone in the audience did sure why
not including artificial intelligence it
is indeed that topmost complexity of
everything supposedly Marvin Minsky said
many years years ago when he was asked
what is going to happen with robots
aren't they gonna dare threaten all our
jobs and so forth supposedly he said yes
robots will inherit the earth but they
will be our children
it's we're thinking it over but I think
there's another argument for that
computer science where survived but it
is in a different set that that that I
have gotten into contact with quantum
physicists over the last few years and
and and so the quarter information
theory actually it's a fairly integrated
community and I found out actually the
oldest concept that we cherish including
some of the very deep end and recent
work I think the visits have learned it
I think they I think it's incredible
that I believe that they have learned
everything that the computer science the
Iranian computer scientists have come up
about quantum computation and I think
that they have learned all away and they
have exceeded us so so and in addition
they have the added advantage in that
they have a lot of things that they know
that we do not know about it like many
body physically and so on so so I think
that even if the computer science the
company's content branch victimizes and
disappeared it will live kind of is like
in the year i think what is this the
mitochondria and so I think it's
supposed I think we are happy for that
because it means that other people also
appreciate the concept that we come up
with it's also make me a little worried
that that what if every discipline they
really get their acts together for
example the brain scientist or the
biologists they have found out that it's
indispensable for the interview with
large database and and then and that
they have to do people earning and so on
and that there are some you know some
really visionary biologists on they say
that let's just have a part of us
that actually is if they have to study
computer science that actually just
combining with the biology training and
and let's let's let's work on
computational biology is from the
biologists point of you and what if
every discipline does this I mean the
astrophysics they they deal with their
their simulation and they design the
best data structure that should be
computer scientists have learned about
and I don't think he's totally out of
the question I think that that is
certainly conceivable that that but that
it turns out to be advantages instead of
computer science would supply the
intellectual capital to all the others
every one of them just find them it
turns out that is better with them not
to burn the computer that they have to
develop their own and and and so when
I'm saying this I'm this is sort of
independent at least partially
independent from what we do that is if
you look at the physics of this is it
inevitable I mean just just from the
point of view of credit researchers or
that we have to be missing variable it
is considered white I would say it's
possible if I were a biologist or a
evolutionary biologist I will try to get
my students to learn about what they
saying that well there's a tremendous
opportunity and we as biologists we we
are one step ahead of them because we
know what that so computers and computer
science that i'm not sure i think the
basic concept can be a sign can be
covered in just a few years
two years three years so so I think
there's a there's a thing you're dead if
I think about seriously I cannot see if
I seriously think about it I will not be
able to fall asleep about the demise the
disempowerment apotheke computers us
that's just joking I'm my Sarge optimist
I think I should change the topic in
order to not cause insomnia with good so
so okay so we've discussed let's say
what we so bluntly ok so we've discussed
what we can do to others what we are
ourselves let's ask what others can do
to us or what others have done to us
okay so so I guess we briefly had a
discussion before and then we said okay
maybe maybe computer science is somehow
coming from math and physics and
engineering these are say to the three
say strongest influences that we have
seen other other like do you see other
let's say methodologies or ways to
approach problems or something that that
we see in other sciences that could
actually be very let's say fruitful in
computer science
so we have we have heard about rhetoric
today you know that one I mean it's a
simple thing that that Andy Pandy talked
about economics with with you know
within the global information
environment in some sense every system
design is also economic system design
you know Butler had to talk about time
to market and so on I mean oh so and in
other words every algorithm that runs
must solicit its inputs from agents who
would lie and sometimes its gates agents
who have you know so you know in the way
that that that time we described so
incentives is paramount okay you know
when you have systems that evolved from
container filled with that are not my
design then them incentives are
important and economics is the science
of scarcity incentives but that's one of
these
go ahead Jeanette
human-computer interaction requires some
sensitivity to design which is not
really a science as I think all of us
would consider so there are even softer
areas of human endeavor that I think
influence computer science because
before one thing I learned from them is
the meaning of users we of i was i was
doing quality of life technology to help
people who need some hopefully we can
provide help for independent living and
computer scientist or a roboticist we
tend to say okay users and we say Oh
users want this and that and when we
began to talk with them they don't like
t-told users because like all the people
who have visual you know impairment and
then we tend to think oh this and that
and then we give certain small scenario
or even
not visually impaired people and masks
and then see what we can do and they
said no no that's not you may be dealing
with the users but you're not really
doing with people and that there's a big
difference and at least I learned how to
deal how to do how to do a little better
job in dealing with so-called users so
so that that's one thing I thought I
learned right there are only two
industries that call their customers
users and unfortunately we are one of
them bit better than the other one so I
guess I guess we we can open up to the
floor briefly but I have one last
question before we run out of time so to
a new student who can decide to either
study computer science and become
interdisciplinary by also studying
something else or studying something
else studying physics biology and you
know learning whatever he needs on the
fly what would you do and secondly what
will what will a computer scientists to
win 20 30 year 20 30 or 20 21 2010 or
you can choose maybe a quick answer and
then we can have more questions from the
quiz transition for me is that the last
10 years when when my advice you know
have we here you know I advise probably
several dozen students at Burghley
computer scientists when they ask me
professor what should where should I
take I mean no should I take the second
of the third theory course and so I tell
them take linguistics take business
learn economics psychology okay so so
you know
was I think that that we should we
should you know we should broaden a lot
you know it's a new courage of our
students to do because because the world
is our subject our scientific subject
now for many years I've tried to totally
unsuccessfully tried to persuade my
academic colleagues that they should not
admit into a ph.d program in computer
science anyone who has taken an
undergraduate degree in computer science
undergraduates should study classics or
mathematics or physics or history or
something with more weight to it than
computing doesn't let the computing is
bad but it doesn't have doesn't have
enough another way of saying this is I
think you can get a very good
undergraduate education majoring in
computer science but it's too easy much
too easy to get an education that's much
too narrow and doesn't have enough
long-term value and that's something
that I think you students really have to
watch out for
i partly agree with that we your bodies
often we say the computer scientists
pure not as useful we tend to say
because sorry about this what we say oh
because they don't know what the world
is moving round physics and we like
people who as battle is said have some
little bit different more physics
oriented background and then on top of
it half computation mind now having said
that in computer science I think
producing interdisciplinary tyrant does
not necessarily mean to me to teach
other other disciplines within computer
science I think we what we need is to
people who have the mindset to work with
other people what does that mean I think
computer science is a very special field
in the sense that if we minimize it to
say programming okay learn how to
program itself is not useful because it
has to be applied to some problem which
has which maybe change from time to time
so in order to make it you cannot be
expert for everything but the problem is
the mindset of being able to talk to the
particular field and then work with them
and so I think that's what it means
interdisciplinary education that's there
will be different from pube very deep
research who has to be you for which you
have to be 50 50 or even 100 hundred
experts of computer science and the you
know the field I think we have too
little bit separate undergraduate
educational aspect of interdisciplinary
and research aspect of interdisciplinary
yeah by my view is that I think we
should be agnostic in terms of how to
educate
students I think that we should offer
all kinds of options the student that
they want it can be narrowly educated
and if they want there is a possibility
for them to to acquire a very broad even
covering both humanity and science I
think that if we have a good structure
so that the students can get advice from
people who know them for example if
every student has a advisor in college
so that they get to know better and and
and try to give advice the best they can
I think that over the long run you know
people choose different options and you
will become clear what would be the most
expected outcome and and I think that
that we should keep we should just keep
give even it amount of freedom and see
how it works out I think narrow and deep
is fine narrow and shallow is not so
good well but they're going to me that's
what I worry I don't worry about I think
they are going to be punished in life
yes but a lot of harm will be done first
it's their choice you know it's it's am
now we're back to evolution so okay so I
think we maybe have time for a few
questions like one or two and then we
remove to the next there's a question in
the back
I'm a I'm a roboticist my most of my
work is algorithmic I have degrees in
the electrical engineering and applied
math but I teach in the mechanical
engineering department and when I hear
the sentiment expressed throughout the
day about about you know the concern
about Kent computer science survive or
are we becoming a subservient discipline
to other disciplines I'm just amazed in
my mind is bobbled someone mechanical
engineering colleagues also worried when
they were when they work with doctors
that maybe were just between technicians
to these these medical types and we're
not getting a proper credit that they
deserve so I think that concern is
really misplaced I wonder if the real
the root of that concern is maybe has to
do with education specifically
enrollment numbers I mean if this is
probably not the problem at Berkeley or
CMU or Stanford but many computer
science undergraduate programs for my
understand the enrollments are declining
and in some sense that's expected
because the students companies want not
people who have operating systems
expertise but somebody who's computer
savvy can program and have domain
knowledge so I wonder if you can maybe
address that point
programming system operating system well
no but I don't think computer science
enrollments are declining right where I
mean though you claim the computer
science elements are declining at
somewhere somewhere in China they are
well other parts of the world for
example Korea where I'm from because we
also have the discipline of software
engineering in China so if you add them
up together maybe it's a different
picture ok we have a last quick question
and then we have to move on hi my name
is ocean one from national university in
Taiwan so there's another common way to
divide this plan for small thinking
people in terms of theoretical versus
apply so theory versus application and
the that kind of a distinguishing since
you had to to say something about
interdisciplinarity so just want to hear
about your perspective on this kind of
divine
I always thought that this this condo a
distinction between theory and
application is is over emphasized in
computer science let me know if you got
an electrical engineering department or
or or a mathematics the or Arab
mechanical engineering department and
you ask where is the theory group they
would not know whether we are talking
about okay you know that they're
engineers and some of them work on
whiteboards and some of them work in
labs ok we know but but but the there is
much more unity I mean I think there is
much more in the United States and we
want to admit okay very very sorry in
computer science then we want to admit
having said that so you know it's I
believe that that that both people who
do who you know whiteboard people and
people love people can do it's very
productive in the interdisciplinary work
you know and you know in different modes
of course and in different capacities
but but in my as I can see it so we know
that there are opportunities for both I
me know that the brain science example
that I used right now only applied
people are doing or not doing this kind
of interdisciplinary world
or all right so um we're out of time
actually so and so thank you very much
to all the panelists it's been really a
pleasure and an honor and thank you
