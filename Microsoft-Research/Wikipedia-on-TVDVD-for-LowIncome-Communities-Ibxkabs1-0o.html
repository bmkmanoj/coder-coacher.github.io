Microsoft Research India let me
introduce one of our demos called
Wikipedia and TV and DVD this will be
given by dr. bill tease who's a member
of our technology for emerging markets
research hi my name is Bill tease and in
the technologies for emerging markets
group our goal is to understand the role
of Technology in low income communities
in India and around the world and see if
we can invent or apply technologies that
somehow contributes to their
socio-economic development and in this
project we're exploring new ways of
distributing interactive educational
materials to communities that don't have
access to computers or the Internet and
the idea is very simple instead of a
computer will use a DVD player ordinary
DVD player and a television which is
widely available in many communities for
example in India over seventy percent of
households have access to television and
about a quarter of the households have
access to DVD players and in this
project we've mapped actually a version
of Wikipedia onto a normal DVD player so
let me just show you how it works using
the DVD remote control I can navigate
interactive menus on this system just
how you would navigate chapters of a
movie let's say so for example I can
press one to go to the search page and
share I'll be able to key in any query
to search for topics that are on this
disk so for example when we search for
India turns out this interactive
capability is present on all DVD players
but frequently is underutilized here
we've really pushed the capabilities of
how to get the most out of this ordinary
technology it's pruning away some of the
options to show things that are not
present on this disk and as soon as
we've I disambiguated the query we see
the list of topics on this disk this
disk contains a subset of Wikipedia
called the school's Wikipedia this is a
curated selection of Wikipedia articles
containing about 6,000 articles which
translates to 250,000 screens on a DVD
disk
and so for example we can choose India
is entry 14 and here we have the
wikipedia page as you would see online
now I can navigate through this page
using the number keys for example I can
scroll up and down and I can also follow
hyperlinks so if we want to learn more
about new delhi that is numbered with
number six so why don't we follow the
link and we'll go to another Wikipedia
page and again we can scroll and so on
so really we've built kind of a basic
web browser that's running on an
ordinary DVD disc and very excited about
this because in addition to the
penetration of the technology there's
also a very robust network for
distributing DVDs in places like India
so for example often in villages that
are watching movies on DVD that are
still playing in the theaters so how can
we leverage this existing infrastructure
for educational purposes and we're
looking at other applications as well
looking at health care education
entertainment's in addition and right
now this is just a prototype disc but
we're working on making this much more
robust and hope to have more to share
about this sometime soon thanks
