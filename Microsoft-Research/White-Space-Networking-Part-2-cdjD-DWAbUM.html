hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
all right um so hopefully oh you
enjoying this because i doing too many i
know as students you know it's great to
see your pretty used to people giving
you lecturers and you're listening to
the lectures and writing notes and I
don't want you to do that I I have done
a lot of reflection in my life about
education here education in the u.s.
education elsewhere in the world and
sort of like I sort of have come to this
conclusion that and it is not a unique
thing to me I mean many many people will
tell you exactly the same thing but I
have the opportunity to implement that a
little bit and so what I want to do is I
just want you to be motivated and I want
you to understand what is it that we are
trying to do and you understand that
well the sources of information that you
can get then I can do justice so I'm not
for example you know Kyle gave you this
talk about what do you talk about oh
look its localization right localization
and couldn't give you Sora so they would
in some sense teaching you about very
specific technologies that can that you
can use for on bigger systems like and
what they did how they solve the problem
I wanted to have a departure from that I
wanted to sort of give you sort of the
bigger picture of all this stuff and
then motivate you to go back and look at
for example Sora and in how you can use
that platform here how you could
potentially use area tracking for
localization now it is for indoors but
potentially there is a way to do it how
you can use full duplex radio is to
improve improve some of these systems as
well right so so that's why I said
hopefully you will enjoy this more than
just writing notes but let's do some
technical stuff too because otherwise
with the CIA self-love stuff so it's not
fluff all right and I know let's start
with a another video this is kind of a
repeat of that in the point that this
video made it's actually the reason I am
showing it to you because I
the guy who is going to speak in the
background let's see if we can if you're
a movie fan you would know exactly who
it is if you're not a Bowie fan it
wouldn't matter you had a question first
that
note so the network operator has to so
so for example whoever's managing the
network here for example right they are
they for example if they provide access
points and you connect with the access
points the access point is responsible
for that not every client that's how the
system's grouping because it'll be too
much of a burden on the client for every
client has to do that so even the access
point you can come up with some
interesting solutions those are open
open problems now whatever I say in that
thing is not written in sort of concrete
this is something that you can design
and see what you can get away with given
the rules that are provided to you ok
let's do yeah so yeah I guess the point
I didn't make earlier the point i was
saying is that about education here they
are etcetera is that what i want to is
research is one of those beasts which is
not make every problem is not a solved
problem and that's what i wanted to
appreciate which is that you know when
you go to to undergraduate whatever you
read books you learn the concept the
theory then of questions are given to
you and we test whether you actually
understood everything that's actually
necessary absolutely necessary but when
you transition into the research world
you're sort of it's an ambiguous
situation you're not very clear it's not
nose solution is the perfect solution
sometimes you don't even have solutions
that's what i wanted you to appreciate
which is like I have a lot of the things
I'm provided and telling you is I'm
telling you what are facts and then I'm
also leaving you with some open-ended
things for you to say this is where the
opportunities and then also one little
tell you about some commercial
opportunities as well as research
opportunities and then we move that here
so let me start with this video which is
not which is kind of cooking video
what if you could better educate
children living in a remote village who
lack access to specialized instruction
what if you could manage traffic so
gridlock doesn't stop your city during
rush hour what if you could provide
state-of-the-art high-tech medical care
to people living in remote communities
what if governments could use technology
to better deploy city services such as
garbage removal and reduce costs in the
process what if a boy who dreams of
playing in the Premier League's but
finally strained his favorite themes
games if you look for the answers you
won't find them and what's out there but
you might buy them and what's not there
it's called white space and it's a
renewable natural resource found in
unused radio frequencies these unused
white space frequencies can be used to
increase available bandwidth improving
the quality of broadband connectivity
and lots of these unused frequencies are
located between TV channels signals set
out on these unused TV frequencies
travel far and penetrate trees walls and
other solid objects inexpensively
extending the reach of Wi-Fi and other
wireless broadband technologies
currently limited to using higher
frequencies what can t be white spaces
enable
you can manage traffic in your city
minute to minute adapting the
infrastructure to accommodate conditions
you can more efficiently deliver public
services
you can have medical resources be
available for preventive care by
reducing the cost of broadband
connectivity a school can now become
part of the global village the only
thing stopping this from happening is
the lack of favorable consistent
regulations allowing white space
technology to be deployed on an
unlicensed or license exempt basis
people and the devices they use will
finally be better connected by tapping
into the TV white space available in
your country
alright so first of all does anybody
recognize the voice there you go so you
have fancies okay I like the video just
because of that because I think he's
speaking very well but the point there
is a point to video the two points are
one the different scenarios that you can
implement and the second is that you
need worldwide harmonization so somebody
asking the question the break that
what's preventing India for example to
implement this one of the things that
are preventing in India is there's no
harmonization there is no concerted
effort here to kind of think very hard
deeply into this and when I made the
earlier comment about leapfrogging i
think that is that is how you have to
think you have to think that look at
these look at the future look at this
technologies and see the way to do it is
while the world is struggling you you
know India we can actually leave frog
and do much more but but that does
require regulation and movement forward
and and generally if you are if you have
harmonization across the world end
products will get built because then
there's more commercial opportunity when
there's more commercial opportunities
there'll be more of these things build
and when they are built then you will
have more these scenarios that we've
talked about or something that you can
implement and people can both benefit
financially from it plus usefully so
there was some point of that video ok
now let's start let me start with a
question that was asked also at the the
the intermission intermission it's movie
anyway about is this just like these TV
white spaces so there was this thing
called the PCAST big a stands for
presidential commission advanced
strategy to end technology so this is a
body of people that are appointed by the
President of the United States to think
about the future for technology inside
the US to keep us competitive with the
rest of the world or even ahead of the
rest of the work because a lot of the
lot of the gains in the US is because of
the money and the money comes because
believe it or not because of the
technology technology front has been
enormous for the United States so these
guys went and did a large so they would
a who's who of the tech work not that
they were not technical leaders but
there are business leaders so they were
sort of CTOs of google city of microsoft
tapas big company multi-billion dollar
companies come together and
I tapped into their internal technical
guys like for example i was asked
questions to write a report and they
wrote a huge report but inside the
report they said the norm of spectrum
you should be sharing not exclusively
this is exactly the point that i started
with my first slide in the first lecture
which was to say that this the thing
about separating the spectrum and
exclusively giving it to somebody is
gone it's not it's not the future the
future has to be about sharing and
that's what they came to themselves and
sort of said if we can get this done
then we can multiply the effective
capacity to by a factor of a thousand
okay which is pretty large now so the
question that was askin mentioned was is
it only about white spaces snow white
space is the first manifestation of the
dynamic spectrum access concept or the
opportunity network so if we get it
right then we can argue and try to open
up the other bands as well now there is
a large project that I am also involved
with and that actually Krishna was quite
a pioneer in India who did it too which
is around spectrum observatory this is
about if you read literature if you read
newspapers you will see that you know
people say oh people say oh we have a
spectrum crunch we don't have it from
crown oh we have enough spectrum we
don't have but all this debate is all bs
what we need a scientist is we need hard
evidence we need evidence of whether
something is happening or not so what
you do is you create an observatory you
create a way to observe the spectrum
across the entire bands and you know
that's your ground truth that nobody can
argue it because if somebody sales as
being used you said no last six months
we've been looking at this nobody's
using it or somebody says well it's not
being used as sorry it actually is me so
you know you need that kind of an
evidence so I said Krishna actually
built a system like that and in a sort
of a distributed manner which you could
just put your spectrum analyzer and then
happen to the tap into this is a large
system and you can observe and so we
have taken it in Microsoft taken it to
the next level now we are building this
all up and so we are going to go beyond
white spaces but we have to succeed in
white spaces without success
we can go to the next thing and if we
succeed in white spaces and go beyond
then we can get to the dream which is
that everything is shared nothing is
exclusive all right so what is it now
another question came up and obviously
this was not planned I expected these
questions that I have this lies so I
there another question caps up what
about leasing so the idea of leasing if
you don't know what met what was meant
was that lets say the seller a guy has
this spectrum that has been sold to it
and what have you lose it like he says
that I have a spectrum in his rural area
but nobody is using it but I own it you
know you can lease it from me for a
certain amount of money just let you
leave scars you lose homes Uli's
whatever and then you after you lose it
you kind of use it right so if you are
interested in that there was a lot of
stuff there's dice man as a conference
whenever I had this black box with a
thing I'm referring to some paper that
was published in thigh span in 2005 I
have a references at the very end that
you can look at obviously I picked only
well obviously but I picked ones that I
was very familiar with an easy for me to
do so these are in some of the papers
that I've written but but this is a
pointer which will lead to more pointers
in some sense so that's where the
conference 2005 we talked a little bit
about that the thing you've been talking
about is opportunistic which is
different in contrast to leasing is like
this these guys are talking and when
they're not talking you sense it and
then you use it okay so that's that was
also published in The Iceman then and
the this was an earlier paper and some
early ideas in it now let me say
something about leasing what is how is
leasing technically going to work if you
were to design a system now these are
again open problems nobody researchers
just working on them and it's not
nothing has been really moved to the
point of any commercial thing so really
what you need is when you want to start
when you want to end what's the center
frequency what's the bandwidth band and
how much power you want to operate on
very right that's what you need so you
can then create a protocol like dhcp in
an Internet you call it let's say d SAP
dynamic spectrum access protocol right
you said I say some entity somewhere
will take this request from you
take this a question of you and decide
what they can offer you something it
will offer you something now that entity
especially the guy who owns a spectrum
let's say he puts are here you know that
and he puts it up they're going to say
let okay so rom is asking for something
he's asking for some center frequency
with some bandwidth and her was
reading his laptop is actually looking
for that sir well he's asking for
something as well but he is asking for
center frequency which is slightly
different bandwidth which is slow bit
different power different now I have to
decide here what is no profitable for me
who to give it to write because whoever
I give it to the other part of the
frequency is now sort of fragmented in
you know I can only give to somebody
else because once I've given it to that
individual or into a decline so this is
a serious a theory problem here right
because you're trying to maximize
utilization and maximize profitability
however you design it I'm not going to
say more about it but there's a lot you
can say here and there's a lot of work
in other fields that you can bring here
to solve this you had a question
yeah you can this totally depends that's
why I said yes you can have that
priority based on your commercial
interest you can also have a fairness
fairness thing that I you know I'm just
going to be fair to whoever car you can
be first come first serve you can come
up with anything so it really depends on
what your own priorities what is it that
you're trying to optimize against okay
so you can decide on that and you can
build a system based on those decisions
and so yes yeah that's it is auctioning
aurea bargaining the real thai boxing
that's what happens in ads for example
when you search when you know if you're
doing search like you want to shoot an
ad for your travel i'm looking for
travel you want to shoot me she wants to
shoot me then you know the system will
sort of do our combined miniature
auctioning and then decide what i would
add to put right because you both want
so yeah you can build systems like that
that's correct that there's lots of
opportunity lots of interesting things
one can do they can bring from the
araphi to do that then the other
question was I don't know who I think
Krishna assessing about enforcement so
once you've given it out how do you how
he gonna ensure that the guy is actually
it hurting to the power that he said
because if you if you have the monetary
thing which is like a for this power you
have to pay so much money then you know
what if I just give you say hey I want
to go at something lower but go higher
because high gives me more age how are
you going to enforce it right so then
you think this is not an easy problem at
all to enforce it somebody asked about
the FCC and I my answer was obsessive
right you know has this thing truck but
you know commercial companies may not
have this sort of a lying low type of
thing I don't know if you know this or
not but you probably don't know this i'm
going to say something bad about me so
you know where you go that is the u.s.
there you go park in his private lots
and you sometimes park and they send you
the Stanley let's say haven't paid money
they'll send you this thing right if you
don't pay will take you to code will do
this will do that whatever right if you
don't do anything they actually don't
have too much legal ramifications a
legal way to do anything they just scare
the heck out of you knew immediately pay
so we really think about it I mean you
know somebody might prove me wrong but
really my point is in your commercial
entity it's not necessarily you don't
have the SEC or government hand so you
have to come up with a better system you
might want to put some sensors and you
know in your in the field in the senses
are all the time especially in the areas
that you are so you might want to invest
in that sensor that provide you
real-time coverage because it probably
real it encourage you can initially shut
somebody down and say you know you're
not doing it or you can figure things
out so there's a very very ripe an
interesting area this is interesting
area this is an interesting area there
was a I think I if you look at the paper
there's a paper and D sad that i wrote i
think 2005 you can look at it give you
some some ideas of what to do and
there's a lot to be done I haven't done
much work here but there's a lot to be
done here and this is becoming heart now
going back to the opportunistic part
really what you need is sensing now what
I haven't talked so far about is this I
just talked about databases now talking
about research and technical things so
let's go back to the sensing problem
right so you've got this back this guy
sees this kind of spectrum this guy sees
this kind of spectrum you if they
identify that this is the one that that
is available and they communicate on
this so you need the ability to of
course sense and then you need the
ability to communicate which one did you
are seeing now it may turn out that what
he's seeing mrs. what he seemed in terms
of his sensing ability is different yeah
totally different because first of all
for for these white spaces because the
range is very large so you know the
think of the hidden terminal problem in
Wi-Fi that's exasperated in in some of
this because this is a lot longer a lot
bigger so you can have that that issue
now you have to have this Hardware
alluded to this which can now change the
channel right we wrote a paper which I
think of as landmark paper which is to
say we questioned this thing about in
Wi-Fi why do we have 20 megahertz like
if you think about it many people so
that's what I think about like for
example in books will teach you Wi-Fi
has 20 mega channel you were accepted
and read all kinds of kappa here but you
want to ask the question why the heck do
we need 20 megahertz why did 20
megahertz what did they decide with that
then if you ask a question then you say
well let me see you can I do better than
five can you do better than two not
everything needs 20 megahertz right and
then you start to realize that yeah of
course you can do better it's got
different properties you can do more
then you say well can you design
to chat and of course you can design
Howard way towards that now that so we
wrote that paper by the way it was in
Paris it calm published but that paper
was really honestly motivated from from
YY spaces stuff because in wide spaces
we didn't have 20 megahertz we had six
megahertz and so we had to design
systems which were to operate in six
megahertz and then we had to have the
ability to sort of move them back and
forth and so when we were doing it there
and we say it works for white space why
the heck doesn't it work for Wi-Fi and
so that's how we moved but anyway you
need hardware with channel adjust and
frequency listening okay and then
because you're going to switch channels
often because primarily users are going
to come you need this overhead of
switching channels to be much faster and
you can do the initially there was a
part time when it used to take you know
25 milliseconds and even 50 milliseconds
now we have gotten it to 80 microseconds
and so there has been some work there as
well another thing is this about the
sensing so the thing that I didn't say I
mean I sort of said it at the questions
answers but let me show you with some
nothing so there is this thing about a
microphone so microphones occupied 200
kilo Hertz now there was a big mac saw
Mike Rowe phone lobby which I'm not
going to say much about but very
powerful lobby which said that you
cannot operate because we use
microphones like for example big games
cricket matches or football matches or
anything like that we're using
microphones and that particular band so
so the question is that they they have
the power to go and tell the database
you can't use this channel so six
megahertz was gone because 200 kilohertz
have to be used as is ridiculous from a
technical perspective so what we do is
we build this thing is an act in a quite
cham chamber I don't know if you know
what I echo chamber is but essentially
it controls the propagation of radio
waves so you can't get in you can't get
out and it's very very clean so there's
no interference nothing so inside the
integral chamber we put like this is a
mic and we recorded something I'm going
to tell you what the original thing is
then what I'm going to do is I'm going
to actually start doing white space
transmission in that same frequency man
i'm going to tell you how that recording
feels like ok so let's do that quickly
she had your dark suit and greasy
washing water running right don't ask me
to carry an oily rag like that nothing
is happening at this point it's just
purely just recording it okay now we're
going to play with white space
transmissions going on the same band
she had your dark suit in greasy wash
water all year don't ask me to carry an
oily honey
sheehan reporting
and we were just material
then subcarrier suppression which is
what i showed you riding with the notch
filter here then the same thing is this
and this is with this you got a monster
202 the hood she had your dark suit in
greasy wash water all year listen don't
ask me to carry an oily rag like that so
what I want to show us some reason
recording and then I want to show you
what happens when white space
transmission was happening and in the
original you could hear and you have to
take my word for it and we'll try to do
it later to see if it work you could
hear it very clearly the thing of course
because its original and then we went
when we did the white space and then we
recorded it it was garbage complete
garbage you could if you really held
very careful you could hear the
recording little bit somebody speaking
in the back end but was just white noise
you know if you ever heard likes that
kind of thing very way so then
technically you can say well I can solve
this problem okay what i can do is so
what we did is we got these two devices
there's a spectrum analyzer and what we
do is we found out where that
transmission was happening in the six
megahertz and we break them notch filter
so essentially you can see the
transmission is happening was happening
here in this little piece and so we
build filter which will just bring which
will just utilize this part and this
part for transmission in the six mega
channel and not do anything here right
and then we did the same experiment and
of course it was perfect no problem we
could transmit on white spaces or as a
full video while this recording was
happening in there so that told us that
there is a technical solution to this
problem of not wasting six megahertz now
in the real world in the sse world none
of this is now specified because again
they don't necessarily yet no there
hasn't been enough push on them that
you're wasting this bandwidth because at
this point they even trying to get
assistance to work in this is the
average thing so this is really you
think about the next generation of
technology where we can actually send
something do the right thing and to be
able to utilize a lot of the manor i
wish i could have shown you the thing
it's very dramatic but that's ok just
believe it so now and we show you
something
built long time back and again just to
give you a sense of what you need to do
to build it so we took a 2.4 gigahertz
Wi-Fi device and we made it work in the
six minutes so we took a Wi-Fi card we
added mixture to it the wideband
synthesizer prh low-power amplitude 6
makers bandpass filter a TI switch and
then we sort of brought it back and so
really we took a Wi-Fi system and we
convert it's a Wi-Fi card and we
converted into a six megahertz to its
ups very very simple components in there
ok now and we build this this is what we
sent to the FCC when we were trying to
prove to them that you can build
something so the laptop this is the
radio it looks kind of crummy it could
scan from 400 megahertz 29 28 megahertz
and five megahertz channels I could
dynamically channel just the channel
width and set of frequencies and we
could just show this I think so it was
very simple I honestly believe two or
three two seniors can potentially get in
the lab and build something like that so
again this is to remove any many things
from your head that you know this we
actually have to go and buy this
expensive hardware you don't you can
build this now from a networking
perspective there are lots of
interesting questions to ask all right
first question is how should these notes
connect now I'm moving away from the
database I'm now moving to the technical
world where I'm going to say anyone
database some of these things apply but
i'm saying i really want to build a
system that can sense because if it can
sense that i can for example the whole
reason for showing you that thing about
microphone was that if I could sense the
microphone I could still transmit and
use the band to use a channel without
having to worry about it but if I sense
then how do I know that what I'm seeing
is exactly there's something the other
noticing because he's pretty far away so
how do we connect I should even discover
that these nodes exists because this is
not like a Wi-Fi system anymore right
it's not like then which a sub-band
should the truth is that sort of talked
about center frequency channel etc how
should these and have a group react when
some primary user shows up like family
shows up in node a and B can't listen to
it
a has to change but has it tells am NOT
they'll be that you have to go to a
different channel so how do you do that
and then what kind of protocols you use
can we actually do these protocols do
they even exist in the real world and
then the question is one of the tools
that we need to build to be able to say
something scientific about these things
so that we can actually give some
properties to any other stuff so really
as you think about this network is a
little different from from what we have
done in the past so I'm going to show
you an attempt at this first time I'm
not only this is not the most exclusive
this is not cast in stone there are many
new interesting things and if you should
have come up with interesting new ideas
and more poverty you should design it
but this is a term that we made so think
about this is a multi radio architecture
we actually had in this question since
we had a scanning radio which was
scanning the channels all the time and
then we had a transmitting video which
was really heads which could sort of
reconfigure the channels right so that
was the property of the hardware that we
built now we design a new mac protocol
we designed an spectrum allocation I'm
going to talk a little bit about there's
a resource allocation matrix to be able
to take advantage of that so this was a
control channel based protocol so
instead of Wi-Fi where we have so the
control and data and mix in the same
plane right we have RTS cts in the Wi-Fi
we actually separated the two out so in
the control channel we were able to use
for contending spectrum access and this
will also use to sort of understand what
the what the spectrum looked like from
where you were watching it and we called
it a time spectrum blocks and you will
see why I call it DSP is the time
spectra blocks later and then thing we
have this allocation and reservation
engine which is again I'll tell you more
details about it but really this was to
give you a full picture of everything
that is happening around you so that you
could figure out where you want to
transmit again this is a very very
flexible system that we are trying to
build here ok the rid of 2d view of it
this all has to be distributed and no
centralized thing that was a property so
what was the mac protocol look like so
we try to take advantage of what we
already know we know about RTS cps so
RDS would be sent to indicate that i
want to send to to you to note B or
whatever and it will include the
different frequency her time spectrum
blocks which are defined as again I
find a few seconds as this is the
frequency I want to operate on and for
this long okay so you said it then the
CPS will send you the reaction saying
hey I see it too or I don't see if these
are the ones I see it so it can be an
array or it can be just 1 TSP so it
tells you you know the frequencies and
and then if there is a sort of a match
and hopefully there is a match he says
this is the one that you can operate on
these are the three once the right thing
you can prioritize them you can do
whatever you can say this is the best
one and you can decide why that is the
best one this is next next next and then
you say introduce this new thing called
DTS which is not there now if I say okay
fine let's agree on this one and I will
transmit to you in this particular tsp
okay and then you sort of do that and
then you wait for just a few second
microseconds or whatever and then you do
the transmissions in the TSB in that
time duration spectrum location a little
bit more about it in a second so so you
know pictorially the Civil look like
this so you have time you have TV bands
this is sort of transmission that are
going on your time spectrum blocks looks
like this is the size the frequencies
this is the amount of time I want to use
to send it and it sort of sits you know
you can sort of sense if you're you've
got sensors a sensing channel you can
say this is the time i want to use use
your channel on and then everybody else
all the nodes use the same sort of
things this color indicates different
things and they reserve the channels and
they transfer the channel now inside the
TSB you can use whatever mac protocol I
mean this is sort of it is a mac
protocol but you can use another mac
protocol see if you if you want to sort
of use something as simple as what
happened to my animation here actually I
had a transmit act transfer knack that
animation is gone but but you can insert
a TSP you can use whatever mechanisms
you want if you want to do similar ads
in your pockets in me an ax and me
package something like that you can do
that or can sanction 10 pack which is in
mena or you can sort of come up with
something even more fancier because this
tsb could be not just one node it could
be entire network so you have a lot of
flexibility in here but this is how the
spectrum looks like now there is this
thing called the the be smart
the resource manager now the thing is
the question to ask for yourself would
be that how do I decide what the size of
this thing is right because I could just
take the whole size that's not very
smart so what we're going to do is we're
going to sign we're going to do a very
simple thing we're going to assign the
size based on number of flows okay so if
n is the number of flows and B's the
available bandwidth then you basically
say that i'm going to be b over n to be
fair this is designed for fairness ok
and so choose the optimal the ocean for
delta T that's supposed to be data by
the way so now keep in mind as you
design this that long blocks means
higher delays right if it is so if you
sort of have you know if you're using
this for a long time and all everybody
else is waiting and that's not good and
if you have a short blood blocks then
that means that it can be turned on too
much of this contention way on and
that's not good too so you have to come
up with an optimal way of doing this and
of course again you can start to now
apply a lot of theory a lot of
intelligence into any of this stuff as
well I know I'm going fast I want to
finish up this thing into some Q&amp;amp;A so so
this example of this is for example if
you have eight backlogs it flows that
you want to deal so when the first guy
shows up he just decides whatever he
decides n is equal to one be over and
picks up beside second guy shows up he
he decides whatever is this is right at
D&amp;amp;B and then he picks that as well
because he's got all this frequency shut
up third guy shows up he has enough he
can do it but as these guys start to
show up you can start to see that the
number of flows are changing now how is
one question should have come to mind is
how they knowing the flow remember I had
the second radio which was scanning that
radio is listening to the control
channel and seeing what's going on so
everything is happening in the control
channel so even if two guys are talking
to one another it knows that those two
guys are starting and it's creating a
map in itself so it knows what how many
floors are going on and that feeds into
the be smart be smart thing and so this
is how you do so you end up in a few
allocation as the number of flows keep
coming and then you sort of reduce the
TSB size and try to do the right thing
so this is not so different from the
previous set of protocols but
but this is kind of how it works so this
is an animation of that a little bit as
a different flows are coming in same
thing it just allocates differently
based on it let me see what I see ya the
difference that I we did here was we
have a control channel protocol which is
different it's kind of like a root or 11
like the data the data transmission is
happening on the UHF frequencies and
then you are actually creating a some
congestion resolution thing as well so
yeah so again going back just to sort of
recap the be smart is determines the
size of the TSP to map the app request
available the resource allocation matrix
keeps track of what is going on across
the entire thing and the CMAC actually
does the does the transmission so this
is what we sort of created based on
these two guys now this is all fine and
dandy it works we built it it you know
it works but a lot of people said hey
and this is where again the practical
stuff comes in somebody says I can't
afford to put another radio here believe
it or not cost money and I'm not making
any money on this stuff can you do it in
one radio that was the first question so
if I give you this problem and then you
would say okay let me try to design this
is the whole thing in one radio because
we design it from what we thought was
practical optimal in some respect it
works I have thing good so the business
I wrote it as business questions asked
and the question was can we lose a
single radio systems and more
specifically can we use Wi-Fi and the
reason is because they say we have
already invested millions of dollars in
building Wi-Fi it works really well can
we just not use Wi-Fi instead of using
this new radio that you designing with
new control channel and new tsps and all
that other stuff so that was the problem
given to us so first way to sort of
think about what is different about our
network or about white spaces that is
not in Wi-Fi so we have a deal with
spatial variation we have to deal with
temporal variation and we have to deal
with spectrum fragmentation and these
are different different we also need a
way for doing fast ap discovery across
180 megahertz now involve are you don't
require that right you just that you're
set on a channel and you operate on that
channel near
because we have this notion of primary
secondary users if the primary user
shows up you have to immediately scan
and figure out where the heck I should
operate because I can't operate in the
hood and if you've got a hundred
eighteen megahertz you know in theory
that you have to scan that's a long time
and your communication is completely
busted you're not going to be able to do
any video nothing because if it's
scanning so you have to design a system
which can do this very very fast okay
yeah and yeah you have to be sort of
make sure that you don't you keep the
disability you don't actually change you
still have to not sort of worried about
the prime reasons now in this in Wi-Fi
didn't doesn't matter because you were
all secondary users per se or primary
users and so everybody other thing here
you don't have so there are differences
between Wi-Fi and what the system is and
that's what makes the problem
intellectually interesting okay so so
the question then we did this I mean you
can we there's a paper that got the best
paper award sitcom 2009 and this you can
read the details of it but we eliminated
the control channel and I'll tell you a
little bit about that people not the
whole thing but we came up with the
spectrum assignment algorithm a
discovery protocol in a fast recovery
after disconnection to solve a lot of
these problems that i mentioned to you
and so what I'm going to do is I am
actually going to focus on this one
because not enough time but I've given
you a reference you should read that
paper if you haven't already done it so
let's see let's talk about available
channel so the first level of question
is one level question is what you know
channel width I you know I've been
saying for a long time now their channel
width is no longer constant I talked
about a 20 mega in this case I talked
about six megahertz you want to use as
much as you can right so it could be 12
it could be 18 it could be 24 and so we
are going to allow that right so we're
going to allow all of that stuff and so
how are we going to first find an access
point which is operating first were to
find at what channel the access point is
operating on when we first connect and
then you have to find out what with its
using right it's a non-trivial problem
if you think about it because if nothing
is fixed now we are trying to beat up it
so I'm going to take that problem on
head-on so again some assumptions that
we
meeting at the time this is right at the
paper and write the things we did and so
uh you know this was four years ago
almost five now but things have changed
but not so much so we we we had this
sort of a pc thing we had a connection
manager we have a Wi-Fi substrate years
of translation all this stuff not that
important most important thing is this
algorithm called sift that we design and
innovation here was what is the look at
the signal in that in a duet temporal
analysis of signal taking a Fourier
transform and doing analysis and that we
just we want to be fast so what we want
to do is we just want to drink the
samples and see how can we just looking
at the sample can we say what width it
is on so the first question for us way
is to just run everything on different
different channel width and visually see
what they look like so this picture may
not come out very well but let me assure
you you can u 3ds you see these three
pictures right and you see that they are
different correct and what this is is if
I'm trying to remember now this is when
something is operating on 20 megahertz
this is when its operating on 10
megahertz and this is when its operating
at five megahertz just by visually
looking at it you can see there is
difference now can I take that and
convert it to computer reason since
again the system now look my system look
at this take these samples and and just
by looking at a sample tell and the
answer is yes right so that was the
innovation the innovation was just
sampled thing really really quickly and
you will know what what width is being
used because it has to match some finite
number of wits of course you can it's
not like continues alright so now how
are you going to use it so now let's say
you can do this very fast which we can
how are we going to use it now in this
case I've divided this to show you an
example and saying these are all
channels these little things right and
the access point is operating on some
channel here and it's pretty large ok
this is the let's say six minutes or
whatever the width is this going to be
generalized to whatever number you want
this is the ones you can't use so how
would you use it this
simple ways you cannot go and check if
there is any signal in any of these
right and then you kind of what you do
is you say there's no signal here no
signal here so access point can't be
here can't be here can't be here come
here come here then you know you and
when when you see the access point you
have some signal but it's noise because
you really can't match it so what you
can do is you're going to change your
width and I'm going to run again and
show you so you running at six megahertz
it's kind of checking you go up here to
you see some not a nose but he didn't
really know so now you change that with
and you keep changing the width till you
actually fit it to your width and then
you say ah that's where the access mine
is this is what you would do this is how
things work but now because we have sift
in a much faster algorithm as possible
yousuck the same picture and what you do
is you do the same thing but first of
all what you do is you randomize this
thing so you don't do sequentially
because all you looking for our parents
now just balance right to see what the
width isn't yeah so the first thing is
to see some signal with what wit and so
you just jump around you kind of go here
you go here and you see oops I found
something right and because you've
sampled it you know what width it is and
as soon as you have that wait you extend
it to that wit and then you do the
matching and don't you find an imitator
and now we're going fast there is some
details in the air but you can find it
so that's how it works pretty fast so
then if you do there's some graph which
is his white spaces contiguous width so
you know given this is free this is way
this is free and then this is the
discovery time and notice that of course
as the wit contiguous which goes up you
actually do lot better but this is
pretty fast and here's a here's another
graph we sort of shows I should have an
ax put another graph here to show the
contrast which I don't have but it's
verified and there is a discovery time
we try to do different version of the
sift in different areas to to detect
what kind of thing is it so we did that
ok I should and let me see if I want to
go through this very fast
I there's a lot of words here
essentially what I'm what the point is
another part of thing was that when the
access points decides what channel to
use it has to sort of decide which is
the best channel for it and there's some
algorithm to decide what channel because
you have many many options available to
you you have to decide which option is
BET and that's what it's sort of talking
about so so this is good so I'm sort of
almost at the end here so since the time
we did all this work in 2009 and all
this stuff there has been many many
pieces of work that if you want to go
and places to go to check even this year
2014 I just came back from this
conference called mo basis there was a
paper on white space network which talks
about using it for vehicular
connectivity so it's actually a nice
paper I was reading another plane back
and seeing whether I should incorporate
in it but I let me tell you the main
idea there was the falling so they
wanted to use what the point they made
is that look even if you have cell
networks which is what provides access
to two vehicles and buses and things
like that bandwidth isn't there so what
if we use a combination of a cell
network and a white space network and so
they use so the whole paper is about
saying that the cell network is the
control signal and they put they had to
do some channel estimation for various
reasons so they put two receivers were
one in the front of the bus one of the
and back of the bus and based on what is
happening says the bus is moving patient
what the front sees the second the back
adapts itself based on the channel
conditions to to provide you a lot
better throughput without this a sort of
failure and they build the system in
Wisconsin and it deployed in many buses
and it works pretty well and that's what
it was so if we as you look at these
conferences you start to see use cases
of this and you start to see new
problems that people have been looking
at and stand to solve and you will start
to see a brand new opportunity areas for
you to work in and so I want you to look
at these conferences after this they
have also know many many test beds
there's one in Wisconsin I think you
guys in Houston is building it or built
it uh sure yeah okay so a Cambridge I
talked about Singapore Brazil via bit so
this is
lot of tests bets that have been built I
mentioned it standards have gone on and
there is lots of database providers the
other thing we learned that you should
know is that I always work here right
that's where I do in most of you I
believe work here as well but you can
succeed in a venture like this without
actually thinking about a lot of this
other stuff as well and so what happens
here it is impacted by regulations
without a question so either you get
involved or have these guys tell you
what to do and I suggest that you get
involved and so make sure that it
actually works in your direction in your
favor and similarly the businesses you
know this trouser but this drives it as
well so my point is that if you're going
to go down this venture and you want to
do something more than just write papers
and bitter to the system you've got to
be a little bit not more holistic or if
you yourself are not you partner with
people who are to build a full complete
thing right so I think that's it yeah
I'll just leave this up I'm on time open
to any questions you want yes
what do you mean by offloading much huh
yes so you should actually do that all
the time in fact any place where you
have so let me say two things what one
is that you can do that if Wi-Fi is
available there so lot of these now is
that I talked about you might not have
Wi-Fi so for example even if you
consider this campus as you go in the
middle of the campus you might not get
any Wi-Fi signal but you get white space
signal so you can't really offload their
that's part one of the questions so if
you do you know option you have no
options but if you do have an option yes
you should always offload to White's via
Wi-Fi always in the reason I say always
is because Wi-Fi is a very mature and
very constructive Network usually right
and his white spaces is much more about
providing range and long-range coverage
so to the extent possible you really
should use y Wi-Fi and it's and you
would probably get better bandwidth from
it too and the lesson I mean and this is
not something new if you think about the
cellular providers like most of these
cellular providers now own hot spots all
Wi-Fi hot spots all over the world and
they have software in your systems which
will automatically offload to this Wi-Fi
hotspot even though they have cell
coverage because they that's a very much
more precious resource so the answer is
emphatic yes if you have a chance you
should always do that and most radios in
the futures are not going to be just
white spaces they're going to be a multi
radio multi-mode radios will operate at
2.45 gig 700 megahertz they will have
the ability to do all these different
things and so then that you have to
write the software to do that property
yeah
yeah initially the client does not need
to know what is the bandwidth that is
supported by the base station that is
how the design is initially it looks at
the central yeah sound into sub carriers
and then it the base station says okay
we are using 5 megahertz or 10 not 20
yeah can there be a similar one that is
applied here because when you give that
example my understanding is we are
trying to determine what is the size
that we are using yeah and I probably a
similar one applicable heroes that's
correct so you may be right I can't
actually give you a new phatak answer
here but I do again go back to the
square thing about NP this is a very
controlled network with a central
operator with a scheduling algorithm in
the base station what we're trying to do
is I designed this for a pipe give you
this example for AP but if you want to
construct an ad hoc network you could
still use this property that I talked
about but an LD you can't because empty
doesn't have that ability although I've
heard that they are now going in the
direction of trying to build an ad hoc
network as well so i'll have to dig
deeper into seeing how precisely at the
east and some of this is pretty predates
the standards i think but yeah so that's
my answer that's a good point but i
don't think it will actually solve in
the more general case
this white space is always point to
point type of network I mean just like
in Wi-Fi the access foreign plan but
always their example yeah so that was I
mean one plant and another connecting
together I mean there is no sort yeah so
why species is you should think of white
spaces as a very similar to Wi-Fi so it
is a point-to-point thing there is no
the the central thing where the access
point shows up is a particular instance
EA shun of it so if you wanted to build
a mesh network which is just multi-hop
network you could totally do it you
could absolutely do it and once again
because we don't suppose well there's a
lot of opportunity to do page stuff here
so right now the way the world has
worked in since since we did all this
work has been that the standards have
gone the route of doing if you look at
the standards for white spaces they're
very similar to Wi-Fi because they're
trying to reuse all the hardware or the
software me know the not software but a
lot of the physical layer stuff and so
just like Wi-Fi has this ability to just
to a distributed it's a disability
protocol white space inherits that
distributed protocol to there is no
centralized mechanism but yes our
advance of the question is also a
distributed protocol the DC is
distributed but here the example saw
that two clans have connecting with each
other there is no short like I mean
theory we cannot think of access point
and there are so many clans that will
connect to this thing because there is
these things is primary and secondary
and anytime you have to switch to some
other frequency the nexus one cannot
connect to so many clans at a certain
point there are only two plans can
perceive at the same time so I don't
think yeah in near future also it may be
possible to do icic sorry I missing the
studio question got it I see so let me
repeat the question so you think I got
it and then maybe others becomes clear
to what this as well so what you're
asking is that there are at least two
different things one is that there is a
primary user somewhere so if he shows up
you gotta switch fast but another
another thing is that
you know AB sex those access point will
have a certain view of the spectrum this
line service and we have the spectrum
and then some other clients may have a
certain another review of the spectrum
as a question is how do you compare how
do you connect to all of those things so
this is I think so the first part which
is the switching part when the primary
user comes and that's actually in the
paper that I refer to venetian sort of
read and it takes advantage of this
which is that you can do a few things
here you can't because you have to
switch immediately you can't what you
can't do is the simple thing which is to
say tell clients and send a message
saying it's all good because I didn't
get into details but think hard and
you'll get the details there is a power
saving mode and Wi-Fi where which is yet
right so then you apply the same passing
moment the clients are sleeping you know
you switched in the kind gets up and
you're not there so there are problems
there but it doesn't solving the other
thing I don't know how to solve it the
best in the way other than saying maybe
you can put you know multiple radios on
the on the access points so they can try
to serve different batches of the
clients based on what they are seeing
and what they are what they are not
seeing so it's a it's a reasonable
problem and there are some solutions to
it I don't want to design a solution
right here in the front but I don't
think it's I don't think it's a not
solvable problem I just think that it's
a it may require some thinking to do
that it's a good observation though so
okay let us consider a scenario in which
as we know that the broadband up our
broadband we can use white spaces now
consider a scenario where there are
several operators say XYZ and they are
having base stations and sim in a
geographical area now the question is
since there are several vendors and as
we know that white space is dynamic in
terms of both the time and space so if
there are several users and with the
same different base stations now I want
to say that okay my winter wants to say
specify some quality of service like
okay I will be providing
users with this through more bandwidth
or something so this is a question that
is in my mind how will a vendor say in
terms of license use also i don't know
after my license expires if i'll get a
same amount of broadband and the amount
of bandwidth to use or not so how can
the u.s. problem is solved in this space
so what you're asking is a question
related to lease for example if we take
the lease and then use okay so let me
first say a few words before I ask ever
answer your question so what I didn't
say and and I'll take this opportunity
to say now is that there are folks and
especially in the telco world which are
who are saying that you can run na te
protocols in white spaces by the way so
everything i've said to you is cancer
like Wi-Fi based or in a distributed
protocol but so you know what they say
if you can defeat them you just join
them so when Doug goes have been trying
very hard to sort of say that I'll just
not don't make it unlicensed will make
it licensed but if they're not willing
that then they say okay why don't we
just use LTE because really what they
want to sell right so the reason I
wanted to sort of say that is because
now I'm going to try to answer your
question so the question that was asked
was that if you have a leasing model
which is I didn't say much about here
which is its instead of say and it's so
then it's not really white spaces what
it is is it a different model because
here the model is that I own the
spectrum and I'm leasing it to you and
now you're going to provide quality of
service to your clients and your
question is what if this goes away the
lease goes away this is a completely
different model from what I'm saying
because it's no longer distributed at
all it is it is completely up to you how
long you going to take the lease from
and how long I'm going to give you the
lease for and then based on that you can
decide what the quality of services okay
so there are several base station says
base stations can't be owned by a simple
person so somebody needs to provide
those services sure so if there are
those guys so we cannot we don't want to
just sell the spectrum so the other way
is leasing so what is the order in
distributed model again there will be
the problem of qos don't you think so
okay so let's first separate these
things out so first let's separate the
at the point of saying not white spaces
spectrum leasing and that's a different
problem right now let's go to white
spaces wide spaces let's talk about
unlicensed white spaces in unlicensed
anything nobody owns anything so anybody
can do anything okay so now even if some
operator decides to put access point it
is not unlike what happens in Wi-Fi
today so an operator can put hot spots
and somebody else can put more hot spots
and somebody else can put hot spots and
there is no quality of service so there
is no producer that's right so in an
unlicensed world this is the biggest
argument against white spaces saw the
biggest argument again watch middle
right that you can't provide quality of
this all best effort so will again be
facing the same problems as we are
facing the Wi-Fi you will be facing in
the same problem yes that's not a bad
problem to have by the way which is it's
very become so popular that's useful
because once it becomes useful then you
actually go and lobby and you create
more white spaces you you know you do
again you make the same arguments that
you made for white Wi-Fi to get white
spaces we get more fit so I think that
would be great if you have that problem
I think we have succeeded we should have
us as the bag we said we've done
something great for the world not worry
about it so much and go and go after in
continuing parallel go after more
spectrum and get more spectrum free
hello sir okay so I have a question
about you should introduce yourselves so
that I at least know who I'm speaking to
and I'm shreekant the imeis very since
to Renee tripp-lite in hyderabad under
Ramu t-shirt ok Oh sir I have a question
regarding the database design
hmm before I asked my question I just
want to say something actually we have
attended a conference at IIT Kanpur on
dynamic spectrum access for about three
days somewhere in October or something
like that so there were many things
discussed about you know the technical
aspects of the DSA and the policy-making
bringing game theory into policymaking
and all such things but for the first
time you know you gave us the conviction
that this is all is not just a myth
existing somewhere outside as a matter
of fact all the papers I mean which you
have published we have read all the
papers here but for the first time now
is not guy it's great it's great to see
that you know some working model has
been in Overland so it's I thank you for
that it really encourages like before
you go to the next appoint a prequel to
your actual point let me just react and
say the following thing to you because
so the interesting thing about any of
this is that intellectuals like to make
things hard because if it's not hard
they think they're not adding any value
so when they apply game theory or
they'll apply some interesting other
mechanism to this it's actually much
more about themselves then what the
reality is so what I hope you got out of
all this is that really you if you can
solve the problem in a simple way that's
exactly what you need to do because
that's exactly what the world will
accept and that's exactly what the
regulators will accept so yes in
conferences you will hear all kinds of
things and they actually muddle you up a
little bit because you know it's just so
that's all I wanted to say which is like
you know you heard of this kiss thing
right keep it simple stupid so it's
actually totally true okay now go ahead
what is your point super garden
in fact I wasn't able to forget that so
so actually you know while listening
something like this I mean a database
for a wireless system did you customize
that I mean you know it really different
set of instructions I mean you know if
you design a server for typical web
applications and when you design a
server and database for such
applications not many of the software
things are required for this I mean you
can optimize it to a better way so did
you employ something like that No so we
did not but but realize that let me just
say the following which is that it's we
did not do a lot of the optimization
that we have learnt in the database
world in trying to do this really well
but there's no room for that my point I
mean I didn't want to sort of go on that
angle because that's that's so
everything I sort of said I will
completely submit to you that the things
you can do potentially you can do better
like you had least in the databases you
know we sort of talking about the
propagation modeling for example or
protein talking about for example in the
query mechanisms you know we adopted
very simple query mechanisms for it but
there has been a lot of work in the
databases world which sort of gives you
some regional coordinates and says give
me things around there we didn't do any
of that and the way the schemas we chose
or pretty simple you can do a lot more
there I I wouldn't say this is the best
design I will just say this is the way
you want a database to operate one last
thing little bit of the way yeah since
your discussion has been more soon
realizes who want to have a quick
comment from you on the recessed I mean
research being done in India I mean what
do you see the fundamental difference
between the reeses there and here i just
want to yeah yeah I could only I mean
from you man I'm going to get into
trouble for this
God Hoshi he actually keeps me honest he
actually said in real afterwards
intestine anyway so I will tell you what
I think as honestly as I possibly can I
think that but let me tell you my
background I also come from a systems
world so which means that I if it's not
clear to me let me just say one more
time I do not believe anything is real
till I build it and they'll actually can
feel it until actually it works I don't
so so with that so I have that bias in
my head what I see for example India
that ability to take them next step to
sort of take these ideas and actually
build and deploy them is just lacking in
the US that's not the case the in fact
they have internalized this very clearly
that and most of the top universities
will take will work hand in hand with
their additions and build systems
practically deployable systems and they
will actually have their students I
showed you those pictures right this guy
getting on top of it ladder and putting
a lot of the stuff this is very routine
and I don't see that here so for you as
students or you know maybe the next
generation I think that's where you want
to want to go you want to sort of make
things a lot more real than they are
here they have been here I think okay so
in the positive side i think the
fundamentals here are the best in the
world I don't think this like Indians do
amazingly well in u.s. they are they are
superb my group has a lot of Indians I'm
going into and they are just super
researchers and so the cream of the crop
is here but those are the ones who have
actually taken it to the next level so
as as a research here goes better and
you know you get more money and you
deploy and you start deploying and
building systems and taking all these
risks and not be afraid of failing right
failing is part of learning you have to
fail if you don't fail you're not
learning you are going to get better and
better and better
better you will actually you know become
top class so I don't know if that
answers the question but generally
that's the feeling I have is a lot more
theoretical work here that is not added
to my assistants work can I respond to
that oh please so we can get us to you
let's have a panel here all right I
request you and all the members of the
audience to come to a demo of some
products that have come out of IAC the
demo is on monday between four and five
and you will see some counter examples
to what yeah so so let me then okay so I
I have to respond resistor I remember
it's not about exceptions to the rule
they always are there people like you
there people other people I know who are
you know who are very very close friends
with who totally agree they're either
educating the US or have something or
their disk to it I'm prob with more
general stuff right it's not one or tues
or even a thousand people are going to
make a difference on a 1.2 billion for
people think it has to be systemic it
has to be at the very fundamentals of
what we do so hey well not another
possible that's great but anyway that's
that's my answer think we can go more
into this later everyone anything else
yes
since yes yes yes it does I so my first
doc was all about it was very factual it
was everything was fractured but what I
mean by factual is there in that cases
it was about systems that we had we had
designed that are becoming real that are
being deployed all the good stuff the
second talk was about really about many
open problems and what I wanted to show
you in the second talk was that i want
to show you how we sort of started to go
around it and how we evolve ourselves
but you're totally right for these
things to rework you need a good sensing
technology which i actually didn't go
into much right people like the sensing
technology also has to be fast so one of
the things people have done is do energy
sensing to detect when i mentioned this
earlier right do a threshold see what
energy levels of a signal you are
getting then do feature extraction from
them to pattern matching do some Fourier
transform and the new parrot right
matching on that these are all very sort
of in the research stages and not really
are completely done yet so yes we have
to nail that but the my demo that I
couldn't really show that would have
been very dramatic had I shown you which
is that when it totally about the notch
filter that we designed to get out the
microphone out that should give you a
sense of how much how suboptimal the
real world is right now in terms of even
if we were still succeed in the white
spaces and that's where all the good
stuff is going to government that's
where a lot of research will then plus
great products will be built right so
you're totally right spectrum sensing
has to be done once you do spectrum
sensing you can eliminate the notion of
databases or you can use databases in
conjunction with spectrum sensing
actually that's the other route that we
are going in which I didn't say much
about to use both together where you get
some hints from the database and you
then so one example really quickly is we
sort of say they did always say
something is busy but you don't you just
take it as a hint and you sort of still
check but but once you know something is
busy and if it actually gives you some
sense of what that is then you know
which particular signal to look
for you look with that specific signal
and say well it's busy but it's not
really but let me go sense it more often
because it says it's busy so something
might come up right so you those are
some of the middle ground things that
you can build we didn't talk much about
sensing but that is the open yet stays
an open problem yet good questions I
like the questions okay thank you yes
sir just even where the sense tomorrow
I'm going to talk about something that
is not actually violet so you've been
hearing wireless wireless all the way
through right and you're going to hear
even more but I'm going to talk about
something which is in mobile in the
mobile world and hopefully you should be
exciting because hopefully tell you
where I think the next generation of
cloud computing is like so just to give
you a preview of that ahead of time all
right thanks a lot you're a great
