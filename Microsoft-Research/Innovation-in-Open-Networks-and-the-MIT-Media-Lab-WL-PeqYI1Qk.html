you
it's an honor today to to welcome joey g
Ito to speak with us today and tell us
what's going on at the media lab I heard
this morning that Joey Ichi means large
harvests from peasants and Ichi is first
born so we're gonna hear about a little
bit about that today anyway so that you
know Joey is not your your your everyday
media lab director if you look at his
bio you'll see it's quite quite an
interesting choice to take on on the
reins of that organization incredible
contributions and numerous startups
investments in some of the bread and
butter of today's social computing
Twitter Flickr so on he was named by
Business Week as one of the 35 25 most
influential people in on the web in 2008
2011 he was chosen by nek business as
one of the 100 most influential people
for the future of Japan and by foreign
policy magazine as one of the top 100
global thinkers you know sits on boards
from macarthur foundation mozilla
foundation so he has had tentacles
everywhere and he's now focusing his
attention on the media lab and we've
become a member of that consortium this
year and will be speaking with him at
lunch about ways we can engage even more
intensively so Joey went to tick tick
coming up and be telling us today about
innovation in open networks and the MIT
Media Lab thanks thanks area morning
everyone and thank you for joining the
media lab I remember I think the
conversation went something like well we
don't have access to everyone and
everything at the media lab where we why
would we join and I think that's going
to be our afternoon conversation but
this should be a prelude into that
because I'm going to talk a little bit
about the philosophy but I first want to
start by doing a scientific experiment
and the scientific experiment I'm going
to ask you to hold up to hands when I
say go
and the it's going to answer a question
which is how creative were you in art so
painting and drawing when you were in
kindergarten from a range of 0 to 10 10
being I was Picasso 0 as I didn't do it
at all ready go so as I give like an
average of eight although there are a
few people who are quite low so there's
the spread is the there's some diversity
but I a bird around eight so now the
same question except today how would you
rate yourself on that artistic scale
yeah okay so this is an interesting crew
because it's not that much of a
diversity but I think it's a little bit
lowers it was probably about like a five
or four so some lot of groups i find it
go from nine to zero but but i think you
can kind of understand where I'm going
here with this which is that in a world
where we cherish innovation and we think
that creativity is an important thing if
you think that your confidence in art is
at least one measure of tribute to VT
something happens so this is kind of
page I've kin Robinson's book says I'm
not the first person to say this but I
think it's really important to think
about the importance of creativity and
innovation the importance of innovation
society and the fact that we on many
measures don't believe we are as
creative as we were when we were in
kindergarten so part of it you can say
oh we get older but I you know I think
it were different when our brains are
different when we're older but I don't
think we're less we'd have to be less
creative and so something that we do
whether it's you yourself your parents
your school your society something about
society makes us less creative as we get
older and a lot of it has to do with
what we need to do in a modern sort of
industrial society which is focus
produce repeat protect all these other
things that you need to do as an adult
right then my assertion is that as the
internet has come in and as the world
has changed the balance of the number of
people that need to be creative in
society versus need to be focused and
repetitive and organized is change and I
think the most important part of
is the internet I think the Internet is
I mean the internet probably has
impacted Microsoft more than just about
any big thing since the beginning of
personal computing I would a certain so
so to me I want to start out by first
talking about the relationship between
the internet and where we're going and
so I so I I'm 46 guess right now and so
I still remember the days before the
internet and after the net whether it's
my career or the people around me so I
split the world into these two halves bi
standing for before Internet where life
was simple you know things like it was
kind of like Newtonian laws worked when
when this thing hit that thing this
winning would happen and things rolled
at a certain speed and and life was
predictable and life was sane and you
could kind of be somewhat repetitive
even though there was some change going
on after internet what we found is first
of all those laws that we had what we
can complex things became connected and
fast and so those Newtonian laws that we
held so dear turned out to be local
ordinances but we have yet to figure out
what those other laws are to predict the
other things so you know because of
again to just pick up book memes it's
like the black swans everywhere
everything is obvious in retrospect very
hard to predict our plans are often
wrong and so how do you think about
surviving and thriving and working in a
world that's unpredictable where plans
don't work where things are complex and
again not all of the world is here yet
you still have industries that are bi
but I think more and more of the world
is AI and Microsoft is dead center in
the world of AI I think and so yeah I
know it probably the same I use the word
AI but but anyway you're flexible okay
good and and so so we'll go through some
of these but some of the principles that
I'm working on and the labs working on
what we don't have to read all these now
but I'm trying to come up with some
principles of AI what you have to do to
change in order to survive this shift so
I'm going to go back into my history for
a second and talk a little bit about
this is how innovation used to happen in
the network space and still happens in
many of the spaces which is you have big
companies and governments that send Nick
time wearing experts to
intergovernmental agencies where they
sit around and they argue and they argue
and they are
you about every possible benefit every
possible risk and they create these
stacks of specifications that are like
you know meters high and if you remember
many of you might back in the 80s when
we had X 25 which was a packet switching
protocol that was actually competing
with the internet and it was this was
actually ccitt back then and this is
when I was getting into networking and I
remember these battles and the thing
about it was the specs that came out
were so voluminous that only large
companies would ever be able to rent
them into stuff because no one person I
tried to sit in I mean maybe some people
here can do but I tried to sit down and
read like the specifications for X 25
and to try to figure them out nine as a
student couldn't I couldn't make heads
or tails of it so so you have these
large contractors that turn these huge
binders of specifications into products
and services that go turn to fees and it
goes around and around and I think for
things that you can't change later that
have a high risk and a lot of
infrastructure like our phone system our
physical plant network this may be okay
and there's a lot of books written about
infrastructure investing stuff again so
so this is worse for certain things but
when we were working on the internet and
a lot of you here probably we're working
on at the same time if you remember like
the internet Engineering Task Force and
a lot of this happened a mailing list we
were all relatively speaking equal you
know all of us you have 12 year olds
jumping into conversations and if they
could write code they had a voice and it
was really kind of a meritocracy was
flat it was disorganized it was
distributed it wasn't centrally
controlled for the most part and this
was really a battle if you remember
between centralized planned innovation
and decentralize somewhat anarchic
distributed innovation and in a way if
you remember also even today I the
internet Engineering Task Force their
specifications were really short couple
pages long and they had the very humble
name request for comment compared to
these these government specs and so so
this is in addition to being distributed
or a humble well we all know that the
internet one right and again I think
that what's important when we think
about this triumph of the internet over
x 25 was that it's not just a technology
triumph it's a triumph of philosophy
it's a triumph of a way of
doing innovation and I think that that's
the important thing about the Internet
so the answer to me that when I talk
about AI it's not about the internet
being a particular kind of networking
protocol but it's a way of doing
innovations a way of thinking about
things it's it's really permission 'less
innovation because all these people had
permission to innovate you couldn't open
these phone switches without permission
without government authority this is all
about authority this is all about about
hacking so this I think is around 1991
something like that 92 this is my toilet
but this is also the first commercial
Internet service provider in Japan and
you know this is an old sun sparc one i
think this is a vt100 terminal where
only half of the screen worked so you
couldn't actually see to alcohol error
message there's an old old Cisco I think
was a GS and then we got the little hard
disk here for the news and this is you
know and the thing that's neat about
this a couple key things so this cost
nearly nothing to set up and I could
stick it in my toilet where it's
actually a bathtub in the toilets here
and then because his head the fan
because it was really noisy and hot but
for this low-cost this crappy thing we
could create a point of presence it
would have cost any phone company to do
a point of residence for anything even
x.25 you know millions of dollars and we
were actually using and gets into
technical stuff because your technical
crew but we are piggybacking on a tMT's
frame relay so we were just using this
sort of space that they weren't using so
even the bandwidth was nearly free so we
could start rolling out the internet at
almost no cost and this is because the
protocols were easy they were open and
as long as you've met the basic
parameters of the specifications you
could join in the party and startup
started internet service provider so so
one thing so this obviously drove the
cost of communications way way down
because if you remember from X 25 it
costs thousands of dollars to sit on a
session because they charge per packet
you had to have bilateral agreements
between all the company and if you set
up a service you actually have to get
anyway and and and do billing and all
this other stuff was crazy so this drove
the cost of connections way way down and
what that did was it lower the cost of
collaboration which
sparked open source and free software it
also lowered the cost of distribution
because you no longer really had to pay
to provide a service on the internet and
these are key because when you connect
them with Moore's law which I won't have
to explain to you guys is you get the
low cost of networks in the low cost of
computing together creates a low cost of
innovation right because you no longer
have to really pay for distribution if
you have the right product you don't
have to pay for collaboration so much
and with computer cost em so so if you
use Yahoo Google Facebook any of these
guys they their cost of actually putting
the thing together if you you know the
fact that the software is free the fact
that they could just connect to the
internet while they were still students
this really lower the cost of innovation
what does that mean when you lower the
cost of innovation is it changes a model
so back when you know what Microsoft was
founded or when pre-internet usually and
not always but usually you'd have to
come up with a plan to raise the money
to hire the engineers to build the thing
because the traditional company to get
to a point where you actually had and
again Microsoft's made actually an
anomaly probably most companies you
would have to raise 10 20 million
dollars to actually get anywhere so that
because the cost of innovation was high
the plan came first the money came next
in the engineers came last when the cost
of innovation goes to nearly zero it
flips where you get the you build the
thing first and in many cases you don't
really know what it is because like I
remember when I invested in Twitter
everybody was a lot of people who didn't
invest a lot of smart investors invest I
remember the thing they said was well
it's a feature not a product you know
and it's a feature not it's a feature
not a company but thinking is in a
network where everything is connected
features are pretty good companies you
know and and so you build the thing
first then you get the money and then
you figure out what it is right it's
kind of the opposite and it's also
engineered then MBA rather than MBA then
engineer right so this fundamentally
changes the way everything is innovative
just by changing the variable about the
of the cost of innovation and so what I
would say is a couple things as we think
about the internet it became system over
objects because instead of trying to
plan everything as one big thing each
element of the internet you know David
Weinberger small pieces loosely
is really about each humble little piece
being a piece of this broader network
and looking at it as a system and save
an object disobedience of a compliance
is really important as well and we'll go
into that more but i but i think the the
fact that you you hack the system and
you don't ask for permission i think is
an important element of that emergence
over authority because it's really this
sort of rough consensus running code of
the sort of evolution of protocols
instead of whoever's in charge getting
to decide everything and then practice
over theory which is again rough for
consensus running code build first not
necessarily build first think later
think a little bit build and then think
some more and sometimes you get it wrong
you know we got spam wrong we didn't
anticipate spam we ran out of IP
addresses but you know everybody up for
all the panic the spam caused we're able
to kind of fix it on the edges without
messing with the network and I think
that it really is like an immune system
that we have with human body is as we
discover new kinds of pain and failure
we evolve through it and that is really
much a practice or a theory version I
think it's a theory is kind of like
intelligent design you know and and I
think a lot of a lot of companies try to
do that with their products and i think
is really hard and changes the nature of
risk as well because so this is sorry
this isn't a scientifically meaningful
graph but just just think of this as an
image so this is the brain of a normal
big company executive right because
you've got all these different
possibilities of downside budget over on
market failure you know recalls all
kinds of stuff and you're upside is
usually kind of linear its market share
here margin there and and you know some
companies Microsoft's one of them I
think does make big bets and they do
have geometric growth in certain areas
but for the traditional big company this
is kind of what it's a small piece of
what their brain mind is taking up with
venture i think is very different so i
when i was doing i do very early stage
venture but I my average investment is
about a hundred thousand dollars a shot
so if I give Eric a hundred thousand
bucks and he fails the most I'll ever
lose is a hundred thousand dollars
unless I make the stupid mistake of hit
him calling me up and saying I'm running
out of money helped me out is okay okay
I'm gonna help you or give me my money
back you know
all start to cost a lot of money because
if you think about the cost of your time
sitting in the room right now for the
period of an hour is probably more than
a hundred thousand bucks and so then you
think about the energy that it takes to
try to recover money that you've
invested or to try to fix something
that's broken there's actually higher
than just letting it go and actually the
time that it takes the RIBA splat may
exceed the investment right because i
think that the minimum viable product
for software consumer internet product
is about 30,000 bucks right now which is
probably about five minutes of our time
right and so I don't read business plans
for low low valued investment so what
you do is you go and you double down on
these guys because like you know Twitter
may become a billion dollars right my
investment or like Facebook any of these
big shot big investments $100,000 will
end up in the hundreds of millions or
billions of dollars so what you want to
do is you want to take Eric whose
company is failing so you were really
good I mean it wasn't your fault it was
just that AI wasn't popular at the time
and so so but you know you'd be perfect
helping me with machine learning over
here at Twitter why don't you join us a
CTO so if venture capitalist is going to
be betting on lots of great people most
of them will be failures they'll be
moving the people around to keep them in
the family and then doubling down on the
big ones and then as long as there's a
big one every couple of years or every
five years or every ten years it still
makes the fund extremely successful now
this is the same thing you can do in a
company on the edges you can't it's hard
to do in the middle but but but then you
way out here you've got things like
Wikipedia I mean if again I pick out
Eric I mean if Jimmy Wales had come up
to you at MSR and said you know I'm
gonna make the best encyclopedia in the
world you know the trick is anyone can
edit it isn't that cool did it and you
probably wouldn't have given them a seat
right but I think that the key here is
that if the innovation cost is low
enough it doesn't hurt to try and so
like that isp that i showed you i went
to a training company in japan i said
can you invest six hundred thousand
dollars in this and they set up a
feasibility study corporation where they
got all these experts together talk
about it for a year cost them three
million bucks to decide not to invest
six hundred thousand bucks you know and
and and so so when the cost of thinking
about doing something exceeds the cost
of doing it I think you have to question
it you know and and then the other exact
you it does everybody already know the
3m
and paper drew story okay this is
actually of interest it's 1925 and by
the well how much time do I have okay I
won't go too much so so 3m was a
sandpaper company into 1925 and what
they were doing was they were sanding
cars so that they can paint them and
what they were was popular at the time
were these two tone cars and with two
colors so what they do is they put these
strong adhesive and bit um and butchers
paper and they paint the cars and then
they drip the thing off and one of the
sales engineers kept seeing the paint
get all screwed up and they'd have to do
it again and he said you know we're good
at it he civ we know how to put a thesis
on paper I mean invent masking tape and
this is going to revolutionize paint and
so he goes and asks for permission to do
this and the CEOs of no way we're a
sandpaper company get back to work and
so for as the story goes for 24 hours he
gives up then 24 hours later he figures
out okay well managers can only write
cannot write anything more than one
hundred dollar check or can't write a
hundred dollar check so he starts
writing $99 checks to vendors gets all
the equipment starts to do research and
the CEO and this is where there's two
versions of the story but one of my
favorite version of the stories the CEO
walks in the second time it looks at him
and walks away and then this guy drew
invents masking tape which
revolutionizes 3m and then that turns a
scotch tape and then later post it comes
out from the similar thing which is was
at the edge of the network but but the
key here is that if it's not costing you
that much it's an interesting peripheral
opportunity why not try it and how are
you allowing that to happen inside your
companies and stuff like that that's
that's one of the things that I think a
lot about what I'm talking to the
members of the media lab because the
media lab really is a place where
everybody in the lab can make anything
and so the cost of trying things are so
low that really what I'm all about is
trying to find these things amidst you
know 350 well maybe it's a little bit
more successful than this but something
like this so the other thing is we get
into here is so again being Japanese all
I'll pick on the Japanese I mean I think
like Japanese like to invest in things
that look like they have no risk I
remember like Rockefeller Center or
Pebble Beach
and I remember talking to some Japanese
government people who were investing the
national funds into stock and said what
kind of stock are you buying so the ones
with no risk it said well that's like
betting on the most popular horse in
every horse race you're going to lose
money because the ones that look like
they have no risk actually have the
worst pricing and the way that you make
money is if I know lily and I'm the only
one that really knows her very well or
the field and no one else wants
investing Louie I'm gonna give it the
best price I say Lily you know none of
your friends want invest hey how about
if how about how about a buck a share
right and so but she doesn't have a
choice she's gonna let me invest at a
buck a share so she does really well
let's say and and you know 99 times she
won't but she does really well and she's
in the New York Times and everyone's a
little unless you're stuck I'm sell it
right so what you do is how you make
money generally speaking you know in a
world of risk is you buy low and sell
high right and I think this is kind of
you can apply this metaphor kind of
generally there is no such thing there's
no risk and the things that look like
they have the most risk are usually most
overpriced and so what you want to do
whether it's high risk or medium risk is
you want to find stuff where your
assessment of risk is going to be more
accurate than the market and therefore
you can pay less for it than the rest of
the market can so you can buy it and
then you sell when the information is in
the price when it's going to be
overpriced because everybody's excited
about is a bubble right so so so the
point is not to not take risk it's to
take risk in a thoughtful way with a
portfolio because you're going to be
wrong a lot of times but but avoiding
risk is definitely not what you want to
do in the same way I think in a world
where you can't predict the future is
not to resist failure which is what
strength is a lot about like building
lots of berms and doing all kinds of
stuff it's to be resilient which is the
ability to react to just about anything
quickly is more important than the
ability to resist failure because
because it's going to happen anyway and
I think the problem is strength like
firewalls sometimes give you the sense
of security and we know that firewalls
kind of diminish the sort of security
anxiety of people who write applications
and I think it has caused problems so I
think the idea of everybody needs to be
resilient is an important part
agility is also and we talked a lot
about agility I think everybody knows
how agility is important but I want to
drill down on this a little bit but in
life one of my favorite examples 2005
YouTube I'm male seeking everyone
between 18 and 45 upload video that was
her first business model dating site
with video and of course it didn't do
that well and they pivoted quite quickly
they became when I met them they were we
were flickr for video i was like okay i
should have invested i didn't and then
they said wow myspace is growing like
crazy we're going to latch on to that
will be the video embed for myspace so
even though they weren't as good as
google video technically i don't think
at the time they grew because they were
able to latch onto this distribution and
then google eventually had to buy them
but might the reason I bring this up is
most companies if they had spent two
years working on this had made a
division and they had been a patented it
they probably would let us keep trying a
little bit longer right and you they
wouldn't have pivoted they wouldn't have
they would have missed the myspace
opportunity but it was because it was a
it was a small team they didn't have
lots of code and they get went out
running and this is why the agile
software development really really key
is to be able to take advantage of
opportunities but also dumped code that
doesn't work and one of the biggest
problems is and i'm sure you have
different versions of this inside of
Microsoft I mean in Japan I see it in a
completely different scale it's every
patent every line of code every you know
division that you have is a liability to
agility right because those are reasons
why you don't want to dump stuff and
even when I have companies that have one
week sprints I'll see engineers crying
when we say hey we're going to pivot but
I've been spent the whole week staying
up all night how can we pivot we don't
have enough data well we ran it for a
day it's clear it's not working let's
pivot and what you find even with a week
you have crying engineers think about
what it happens if it's two years or
even longer I I I would commend
Microsoft because Microsoft's pretty
good at pivoting considering how much
you invest in things sometimes but but I
think that it's really important to
think about the balance of liabilities
and assets and look in the context of
agility this is where I don't know if
you don't know if I'd was sliding her
but pull over push so John Seely Brown
has this great book called the power
pole which is really about pulling
assets and
resources as you need them rather than
stalking them and centrally planning
them and to pull them from the edges of
your network and the obvious version of
this is kind of like whoa learning a
computer programming language in school
because you might use a 10 years from
now is probably not a good idea but even
more common is companies really do like
to try to get stuck together before they
go you know and reed hoffman you know
sort of as a contrast to ready aim fire
he says aim fire aim fire aim fire i
mean the ready part is a lot of people
spend a lot of energy on this is sort of
my compass / maps is when the cost of
deciding to spend six hundred thousand
dollars cost three million dollars and
is also wrong that that's a extremely
expensive inaccurate map which is what
most people have in their plans today
and it's also what strategy is I mean I
i heard that Sheryl Sandberg said that
at Facebook we don't do strategy because
by the time we have when the world has
changed we you know and I think it's
because they're very focused on trying
to retain agility in the face of growth
and I think that's a really interesting
strategy you do need a compass I think
you do need to have a vision you need to
have some values and and and you have to
have a trajectory but what you don't
want is you don't want to have to top
down dictate everything that you do and
I don't think you guys do this I think
that but but but it's kind of fractal it
you can have talked about this at
multiple layers the other key thing I
think is serendipity says so serendipity
and luck seems sort of like a well
they're like a statistics or
probabilistic thing but but but there's
a lot of really interesting studies
about serendipity so one is I think it
was an English study and I can send it
to you if you want because I really i
did send it to you I think but it's a
there's a study where they they they run
a newspaper ad and say if you're really
lucky or if you're really unlucky come
to this test and the test is they get in
and they give them a newspaper and say
how many photos are in this newspaper
account and tell the examiner and
there's like 40-something 42 photos so
they're all counting and then there's a
big headline says if you see this
headline tell the examiner and you win
250 bucks and then another headline it
says there are 42 pictures in this
newspaper so all the lucky people
obviously see the headlines and say hey
give me two hundred fifty bucks in there
42 pictures and they're out and all the
unlucky people are sitting there
counting all the pictures they missed
the headlines and it was it's really
interesting that correlation and and
it's it's it is really about whether you
see the stuff around you so in terms of
peripheral vision if you I think there's
a study that if you put a dot on the
screen you show things in the periphery
you'll see it but if you give somebody
an incentive like I'll give you ten
bucks to watch the dot that disappears
you know and i think that the focus that
we so cherished and companies about
execution and things like that it does
limit your peripheral vision and if you
plan everything you can't be lucky right
and so so i think that that there's a
really interesting balance between
planning and focus vs serendipity and
the opportunity and embracing
opportunity around you and it also ties
in with pattern recognition so how many
people have done mushroom hunting for a
few okay so if you're good at it if
you're good at it it probably means that
you know that when you do mushroom
hunting you don't sit and focus because
your focus only on like one percent of
your field of view if your focus you
kind of pull back and you focus on
nothing and then if you're good but and
if you've done it enough the mushrooms
start to pop up through pattern
recognition I think small game hunters
do that too they fall back and then they
can see the little twitching animals and
things like that you see the difference
but when your focus you can't because
you're just cognitively filling in all
this other stuff with things that you
assume will be there and this is also
really important is when you're trying
to look for peripheral vision and the
opportunities around you where you want
to pivot you can't really be focused by
definition because you're only looking
for what you're looking for and and this
is directed research is this way because
you're saying I'm going to build this
thing so give me this money I'm going to
focus now in a funny way and not I won't
overstay piscis not always true but but
peer review something sometimes like
that too so I've got to explain this in
the words that they understand how do I
explain this how do I make this a thing
I've got to be focused about it it does
tend to limit your ability to discover
things while you're on that path right
and so to me pattern recognition and
peripheral vision are essential for
discovery but we have a lot of systems
that sort of emphasize the opposite i'm
going to give a quick example of what i
would call the power of pole so safecast
is a nonprofit that I helped start
japan after the earthquake there and i
was actually interviewing for my job at
the media lab when that happened and so
I was kind of panicked as my wife and
our family were in Japan and I didn't
know anything about radiation geiger
counters or anything like that so I
called a bunch of people and went around
on that so one of the guys I found was
really by the way so he's like I don't
really have that much to do but I'd love
to work on the data stuff so he jumped
in we found this guy who worked dan who
did the Three Mile Island Geiger counter
measure measurements after the event
June mariah from KO had a sensor network
bunny from he actually hacked the xbox
one why microsoft people might know him
but but he is an open hardware guy he
ran a bunch of hackerspace networks he
did the Tokyo the LA hackerspace Sean he
ran that was part of the Tokyo hacker
space and she was an ideal he was a nap
he was a bank I CIO but he also
understood analog devices we had a group
of people working on the web stuff and
kick started and some people who kicked
in a little bit of money were able to
within about a week pulled together
pretty cool crew of people and we were
able to really start to understand a lot
of the issues as well as a health around
it and visualize it but we realized very
quickly as we start to try to build
geiger counters and deploy them because
we were trying to kick-start a Geiger
counter say Japan is that the sensors
were in limited supply and the kind of
large pancake sensors we had we just
didn't have enough so we need to go
mobile in order to collect enough data
so we invented the bento box guy gear
the be gaggy which we put on cars and we
drove around and so we had local
volunteers this was right after the
disaster literally these government
people in hazmat suits were showing up
measuring soil measuring data and they
walk away and not tell the people
anything and these people are freaking
out and traditionally these kind of rule
japanese villages are a little bit
xenophobic they really don't interact
with foreigners that much but when these
guys came in you know with Geiger
counters and explained that the kids
that were sitting that the cesium was
stuck to the roof and so the
measurements were higher on the top
floor than on the bottom floor so maybe
they should move the kids out of the
Attic to the floor or this area was
contaminate
and was really neat about this was like
after they kind of went and started
working with these people that local
Fukushima people set up a non-profit and
they said okay well you guys the
government didn't help us but you sort
of even though you're foreigners citizen
scientists came and really helped us
figure this out we're gonna create a
non-profit we've learned how to do this
if something happens anywhere else in
the world we're going to go there and
help like you did and say we're from
Fukushima we're here to help and to be
what was really interesting thing about
this is all the government was
completely failing at this time no data
actually wrong data and and all of us
were had figured out and we had
connected internationally with really
nothing right we started from a position
where we knew nothing and then a week or
a month later we knew more than the
government didn't at least in terms of
figuring out the data and deploying in
these areas and this is some one of our
students the media lab created but we we
now have over three and a half million
data points that are available under a
creative commons CC 0 public domain
dedication and and a lot of interesting
things I mean we found out very early
even before the government had announced
that people were being evacuated from
low radiation zones to higher radiation
zones and it was blotchy you know couple
minutes away you get 10,000 times
difference in radiation measurements and
things like that so you have you
couldn't just fly over with helicopter
you have to go in very granular and and
in anyway so so this project has become
very successful we're now starting to do
air air quality monitoring LA and it's
expanded as a huge citizen science
project now the key point here and I'll
finish this and i'll go and by the way
guy who condors don't get innovated on
very often and except during these sorts
of things so bunny designed this Geiger
counter which is very state-of-the-art
and they're being manufactured in china
now the really great Geiger counters if
you want one but we also made it
available over under open hardware
license but just back up i think that
point about that i was trying to make
about the power pole is i think it
wasn't actually a liability that we knew
nothing was actually an asset that we
knew nothing because then we could pull
in all the experts that we needed that
were available at the time and every
single project that looks similar to us
we just merged and i think it helped
that it was a crisis so people were more
happy to be mission oriented rather than
kind of selfish but the fact is that
compared to what the government was able
to do we completely
we beat them and now we're you know
we're on the front page of the Fukushima
Prefecture website so they've a year and
a half finally acknowledged us and
brought us in but but i think my point
is that all the planning in the world
didn't help the government very much and
actually i think hampered it and today
with all the resources available and
that you can usually find the people
that you need very quickly i'm going to
pivot a little bit here because i think
open hardware is really important so i
was talking earlier about open source
software and the internet lowering the
cost of innovation for consumer internet
and software i think it's happening in
hardware open hardware is going to be a
key component of that because just like
open software made it so that at Google
all they had to do is really figure out
the difference and write a small piece
of software they didn't we have to
rewrite databases and rewrite the
operating system and rewrite apache they
just use them I think open hardware is
going to help kids focus like at the
Geiger kind of that we may we really
didn't have to do that much except some
of the analog circuitry in the UI UX
everything else we're using Arduino and
all these other things that were off the
shelf that we're open and with and this
is in our Center for bits and atoms we
have you know this is a multi-purpose
multipad machine so it does cutting
milling and and 3d printing this is
whatever groups of students that have
spun out they're going to make a sub 500
sub $5,000 very hard plastic I'm high
quality laser a laser driven 3d printer
but the cost of 3d printing is going
down we have companies like PCH
international and others that are doing
the supply chain side and the
manufacturing side so that the the risk
and the cost of manufacturing and the
agility of manufacturing is going down
and so to kind of put it in your space
you see HP with the four or five year
roadmaps getting out of hardware because
they're not agile enough then you see
you guys making tablets you see you know
Apple really focusing on trying to stay
agile you see you know Google buying
motorola you see rumors about Facebook
getting into mobile phones I don't know
if it's true or not but but it makes
sense that the companies that have the
agility now that hardware is cheaper and
more agile are beating the hardware
companies who we don't have it's harder
to become agile I think then the other
way around and and hardware is becoming
speedy my guess though is that just as
the innovation got taken from big huge
companies to medium-sized companies to
the edges I think that hardware starting
this year maybe and this is I mean
Kickstarter's going through his growing
pains around this and sorry I'm a
investment kick-started too so it's a a
disclaimer but I think they'll get over
it and that kind of sort of grassroots
hardware movement i think is going to
have a lot more traction yeah notice
that too but i've always wondered about
like like there you know arduino kind of
smaller hyperspace kind of things it
seems like when people are doing things
with small scale that's really true it's
very easy to build up something salsa
but then the more they get into large
Club production the more calcified their
infrastructure becomes I know do you
think that part is changing it also
possible to get into big cement still be
yeah I think that I think that companies
like PCH are going to make the
difference and so without disclosing too
much I mean I think there's a couple
different pieces so so their industrial
scale supply chain manufacturers who are
willing to do startup things now so all
my all my hardware startups are now
working directly with the manufacturers
and the they are taking on a lot of
inventory risk they're actually betting
on these startups because they realize
is more upside now and and that they
have the capability to play and so for
some of the hardware stuff that I'm
working on so for instance a couple
things that happened so the inventory
cycle now has gone from about four a
year for some of these companies to
about 53 so that the inventory risk is
really low and they and actually right
now for most of these companies that i'm
working on you you pay to China and they
shipped directly from China so you don't
hold any inventory in America so and and
they're actually using the same database
and everything that they use for apple
and everybody else and so so you're
actually getting the same quality and
and it's extremely flexible right so
scaling up is easy I mean you have their
different ways to do it you can start
local like with the sparkfun of Lola and
the move on or you can bring these guys
in very early but like PCH has an
accelerator program now they're actively
pulling startups and so I've seen the
costs like the business plan cost of
startups going from the sorta
million-dollar range too
like the 1 million dollar range do these
Hardware steps just because they don't
the inventory risk and a lot of the
tooling and all of that again it's it's
a little bit tricky because they're also
just new to this so they want to make
sure they pick the winners are not doing
it for everybody but for the ones that
look successful I think it that profile
is changing so I think actually this is
the year I think it's important year and
I think as Microsoft has sort of figured
out how to interact with startup
companies and venture they're going to
want to do this in the hardware space
you know one really interesting note
would be to note that you know a lot of
the telephone companies have started the
mobile carrier companies are not carrier
hence the companies started really
looking at shenzhen and shins I for
their R&amp;amp;D labs because they kind of
ignore IP and in some of the areas there
and what's interesting about that though
is that that sort of impunity actually
unleashes creativity and so there are
certain things like a double sim phones
that have been invented in the street
shens I that that are now being
re-imported back because there's certain
kinds of innovation that happen in the
absence of lawyers that that that are
actually inspiring and interesting and
so so that that's
I think right now for the short term I
think the factory floors of China are
really where it's I mean the other thing
that you see is you see like design
school kids ending up now in China a lot
of my media lab students are going to
China because they find out that if
you're sitting on a factory floor in
China talking to the people with a
database of every single supply chain
component and inventory you can redesign
the thing on the fly and have it fixed
you know I mean like if you look at the
the the recovery recovery the supply
chains after the Japanese tsunami those
people that had people on the ground or
had companies who had people on the
ground who knew what we're going on they
were able to design themselves out of
the supply chain problem very quickly
whereas the people other people just
waited and I think it had a lot to do
with how heavily you were in China I
think it may shift around a little bit
but and certain components made me in
different places but i think that the
right now that you really need to focus
on china and shenzhen specifically but i
think it's hard coming to biotech so so
this is Joe Jacobson stuff he's the guy
who did Ian get the media Levin so he's
created a spin-out called um gen9 so so
I don't know how much you guys know
about biotech because I'm just repeating
stuff that I don't really know but um
but if you so the metaphor here is in
the old days you had to put transistors
together by hand before the integrated
circuit and so the limit of the
complexity of a device and the the cost
of a device was dependent on the labor
costs in the yield of this hand wiring
process so you had a thousand
transistors or whatever would be the
maximum complexity you could get to
because you would introduce errors and
then the integrated circuit allowed
Moore's law and complexity go with
electronic design and all then so forth
so so it was really the machine
manufacturing in the Assembly of
transistors that really allowed
complexity to occur right now with
biology what you have is you have this
huge database of gene gene bank and all
these we have sequenced so many genes
yet we still go to the Amazon rainforest
and squeeze trees to get the essential
elements for drugs because we are not
able yet to manufacture or understand
biological devices to the
sent where we could there are some
examples like I think Dow created this
cell that or this basically cell
biological device that creates polyester
even though polyester doesn't occur
naturally in nature they were able to
pull the jeans together but it costs a
tremendous amount of money to design
that and then but it still they dumped
the old method because the old method of
petrol and all that was forty seventy
five percent efficient and now there are
over ninety percent efficient with a
biological system so biological devices
are much more efficient they're
generally much more ecologically safe
but they're hard to make because the the
complexity of the devices in a testing
of the device is limited by the fact
that you have thousands of people again
in China putting these base pairs
together by hand and they introduce
about one error per hundred base pairs
it's like the old transistor days so now
our our lab our lab to spin out of our
lap from our lab gen9 prints genes on
circuits on CMOS and it's about ten
thousand one error per ten thousand base
pairs will probably up by now another
order of magnitude very soon and we will
and they print lots of it cheaply very
fast so we'll have half of the world's
gene printing capacity in kendall square
within a year and so what that does is
it's a lot like integrated circuit it
suddenly allows us to take this huge
gene bank of all these gene expressions
we know print them test them and now
with micro fluidics you can actually
test all these you if you go over to v
sore something you'll see a hard on a
chip a liver on a chip lungs internship
and so the testing cost is also going
down i think the regulatory cost of
innovation is actually higher now than
the the other part but now as you can
imagine the explosion of complexity with
the ability to print really complex gene
sequences the ability to test them
without having to do go through the same
level of costs and testing may create an
explosion of innovation around jeans and
and just so you know this affects
electronics in a lot of ways and we have
we can create memory we can create
sensors there's all different kinds of
biological devices that will replace
things that are right now traditionally
made either mechanically or out of
petrol or kind of through brute force so
so i think that what i'm saying is that
the idea of the low cost of innovation
pushing innovation to the edges outside
of the centrally controlled authority
of research lab is a trend that started
with software and consumer Internet
services but is pushing its way into
hardware and then eventually into
biotech and so then I'm going to talk
about the media episode so the media lab
it is an academic institution but we
definitely are a disobedience /
compliance sort of place so when I say
disobedience I don't mean to be
disrespectful but it means you don't win
a Nobel Prize way by doing what you're
told and and I don't and I know even if
I expected it they wouldn't do what I
told them to but I don't expect it an
emergency over authority learning over
education is very important I think that
to me education is what somebody does to
me and learning is what I do to myself
and I think a lot of well all of the
focus of the me lab is really around
learning through construction learning
through passion learning through doing
and not learning through instruction and
practice over theory so and this is
actually pretty critical because when
you have a massively interdisciplinary
splice you can't have opera singer and a
sociologist and a mechanical engineer
right and academic paper together very
easily but you can build a robot
together and then the robot you can look
at and is pretty rigorous it either
works or it doesn't you know and so so
so building stuff is actually a really
good way of testing theory in the
absence of theory our degree is called
media arts and science and a key thing
here by the way is that the media lab is
the only lab in all of MIT where we also
have the academic program everywhere
else there separates you have like the
school you know you have a ecs and they
have a csail computer sciences and so
the labs have the money and the research
and the academic programs have the
degrees and the students and somehow
there's like church and state so we were
able to kind of break that rule and what
that allows us to do is say for instance
let's get rid of classes which we did
and so the students and the faculty or
have a zero to minimal course load and
we focus on research so we're able to
change the academic program to focus on
research the one weird thing is this
degree a PhD in media arts and science
their masters mr. size doesn't really
mean anything you could have been an
opera singer or you could have worked on
synthetic molecular biology so it's an
also an interesting thing that it's a
degree from MIT but it's really really
difficult to say what actually you've
learned but all of our students have a
really high that what is it that their
employment ratio is very high which is
also kind of an interesting thing
because I was somebody from a Assessment
Agency the other day came in and said I
just met like five students I'm gonna
hire them right away and I said well you
know they have never there's no
requirement to get into media lab except
for an interview with a professor and
I'm degree doesn't mean anything and so
how can you really believe in
assessments if you want to hire all
these kids who have never been assessed
you know so so we were founded in 85 by
Nicholas Negroponte in Durham weasoner
who was the president of a mighty a--the
time and back then if he remembers
before the internet was before the
personal computer was kind of like the
the near your birthday right when is
Microsoft's birthday 75 so this is a
little happy birthday but but when you
were still small right huh okay and so
what's important back then is you know
Nicholas was writing the book being
digital it was really about man-machine
interface about empowering the
individual it was like consumer
electronics inventing the personal
computer and so that was a focus back
then I think I'll talk a little bit of
the world's obviously changed a little
bit we have currently twenty-six faculty
who are principal investigators so we
have each each faculty as a group and
each student applies to a group not the
Institute so you we don't admit students
this group the faculty admit the
students and each student has a main
faculty and we have 140 graduate
students masters and PhD and then about
300 research projects we have 80 member
companies who are like our sponsors
about an 39 million dollar operating
budget that won't go through all these
groups but they're extremely diverse the
key thing is no two professors are in
the same field so the whole point is
diversity and so we get criticized for
that a little bit sometimes because it's
kind of shallow each of these people are
fairly deep in their own way and they're
connected to their cohort but the key is
that they could all talk to and work
with each other but we really do have
everything
from you know robots to network networks
to bio mechatronics and robotic limbs to
sep who was doing social computing see i
don't know what other random this is
like a high low tech which is sort of
the maker stuff anyway and we have we
have opera of the future and you get the
idea and molecular machines so it's an
optics it's very diverse we just did a
faculty search we're doing more faculty
searches I'd love ideas maybe some of
you should apply but sorry but the
requirement and I'm really happy that
MIT let's do this requirement for our
faculty is they have to be anti
disciplinary and again and I'm this
doesn't mean that they need to be rude
it means that they if you can do
whatever you want to do in a particular
discipline you should go do it in that
discipline if you could do whatever you
want to do in some other institution you
should do it at that institution you
should only come to the media lab if
we're the only place that you can do
what you want to do and that's true with
the students as well and so most of our
faculty are only applying for jobs with
us and the reason we have I think around
a ninety-five percent yield on students
that we admit is because most of the
students are also only applying to the
media lab and so they really are like a
collection of really interesting misfits
they usually don't fit in a discipline
for a variety of reasons maybe it's
because this new maybe no one can
understand what they're doing or because
it spans too many different disciplines
but for whatever reason if you don't fit
in anywhere else that's how you fit in
at the Media Lab and and how this is one
of the few moments of consensus that we
had at the faculty meetings which is
this is how we measure ourselves on
uniqueness impact in magic magic is
important because magic is kind of it's
about the narrative right so we don't
want to do biology two point oh but you
know bionics in human human augmentation
is kind of interesting so it's got to
hold together also as a story but this
is this is kind of how we think about
what we do this is part of it I think is
a reflection of the fact that we spun
out of the architecture machine group
out of from architecture we're still
under the school of architecture but
it's a very much an atelier model where
we
these spaces where these labs where
people build things so instead of
sitting around too much we have the
offices and private rooms on the outside
and we pile people in in the middle and
these are this is three different groups
this is the effective computing bio
mechatronics and and and and medicine
here but but the group's it and again
it's really about if you have an idea
sit down a mailing list over coffee just
go and build the thing I think it's
really important I mean that the center
for bits and atoms has a class called
how to build almost anything and by the
end of the class you talk to any the
students is extremely liberating class
because they can pick up anything just
anything really and they can tell you
how you could build it you know it's a
and it gives everybody and and and and
they also have basic you know
programming skills when again and
there's there's a spread but generally
everybody can design everybody can code
and by the end everybody can build
anything and so suddenly the whole cost
of trying something is nearly zero
because if you get enough kids together
you can go to the basement and build a
car we have or molecular device or a
cell you know and so so it's really
interesting because then they're
completely liberated they don't sit
around right making powerpoints they sit
around building your things and then
maybe making the powerpoints later to
try to explain what they built I'm going
to skip this slide so one of the key
things that's changed since the media
lab was founded was that back then when
you're making the next Walkman or the
next consumer electronics device is very
product oriented and eat and you I HCI
oriented you still have elements of that
and it's still important but I'm
starting to push everybody towards
thinking about more of the ecosystems of
products because I mean I to you it's
obvious but but that that's a big shift
and I've changed the name from sponsors
to members because I want this to be a
membership organization where the
company's work together because if we're
thinking about ecosystems I want to see
how Nokia's work in bt's work and
Microsoft's work and and you know GM's
work works together in an initiative
around the future of cities rather than
one company looking for a piece of IP to
help them with a particular product for
the sharper image catalog so so so it's
a really the idea of the membership
organization is to try to create a
community that works with us that
inspires us for our research but then
we inspire them to work together and so
what I'm trying to do is to turn this
into a network rather than a container
which is kind of what it is and was into
into more of a platform one of the
examples and we just want to give is we
did we've I recently launched this thing
called innovators guild and this has
pivoted a lot to I originally thought
Lucchino the innovation officers of all
of our companies seem like they're kind
of a lonely bunch and that they could
learn a lot from doing rather than
thinking and so I wanted to create like
a field trip where we take chief
innovation officers and we we build
something on a field trip and they they
get hands-on experience so we decided we
would do it in Detroit and we did a few
recon missions to Detroit and we figured
out very quickly that the first of all
Detroit was like well I don't we don't
want any you know whiteboy do-gooders
from a rich University coming in here
and flying out you know and we've had
too many of you guys and they're really
kind of burned out with people coming in
with solutions and so what we realized
is they really really well first of all
they were resentful and was really hard
to get in and so we decided well this is
actually really interesting experiment
and co-design because the whole thing is
they they think they know their issues
how can we get more involved in it it's
a long story short we pivoted away a
little bit from this kind of drop in and
do something and leave to trying to work
with the community and at the end what
we did is we spend a bunch of trips try
and identify those people in the
community who are really really neat and
who were doing interesting things from
urban farmers to a kid who was
incarcerated for 19 years building
communities and all these different
local people we brought a bunch of media
lab students we had idea who's one of
our members helped guide the process of
the design process and a bunch of media
lab students working on the hacking part
but the but we brought you know the the
people from the community and what was
really interesting was that we started
out with a couple of design challenges
that we'd sort of figured out after
going a few times but after the this is
like a two and a half three-day process
halfway through most of these things
were completely different and and these
are you know some of the groups working
on it and these are some of our fellows
this is like Chris Bevins he's a
designer he's from I do their building
compost things you know soil testing and
things like that but but what was neat
about this process was that the kids in
Detroit came back and said wow like
there's one designer local local
really really talented and he said this
design process thing is really amazing
it works and it makes me feel you know
like I'm being productive and here I'm
seeing next to a kid from MIT and I'm
actually contributing because I
understand the problem I understand the
constraints the Media Lab kids were like
wow we didn't realize we thought we're
going to come here to help but we
learned a ton because we realize that
designing in the field for the people is
completely different and then these
chief innovation officer types also
obviously got a lot of but what was
really so there's a couple different
things that why mentioning this so one
is I think co-design is a really really
important next step in this kind of
innovation on the edges because if you
think about kind of customer centric
design is a lot of what people talk
about so I'm telling my students you
know if you're talking to somebody from
Microsoft if you're talking to somebody
from a bank they're not your customer
your customer is the people that they
want to sell to so if you really want to
be valuable to Microsoft if we really
want to be valuable to you for instance
and if we really understand Detroit and
we can Co design something in Detroit
that design is going to be much more
interesting than something that's
designed in redmond for Detroit because
that's what we figured that's what we
that was our learning Zoe we spent you
know four trips going out there the kids
sit around thinking about all these
different things with idea about what we
could do to help Detroit but we got
there that was all wrong and when we let
them help us design what they wanted it
turned out to be exactly right and these
projects now have traction and I think
this idea of going where you're going
and letting the customer design it that
actually also connects with super
customization it connects with DIY
manufacturing and connects with a bunch
of really important trends which is as
the cost of doing things goes down to
nearly zero you really need to start
involving the customers in the design
process rather than just treating them
as consumers and and and again I think
that this this process that we're
developing here I'm going to try to
integrate more into the lab we're going
to be reaching out to different places
we already have with Tata we have this
thing mit has this thing called frugal
engineering where we send students for
four months to India so that they
designed within the constraints of India
rather than plopping stuff in ethan's
doing stuff in Africa but we're really
going to work on this code design idea
and this is something that we'd love to
work with you on as well but anyway so
that's kind of a rough idea of this this
the the trend and I think I think I
think you you see how this hopefully
ties together in and hopefully it
resonates with us
level thank you talking about some of
your earlier point no change in so now a
lot of big companies move to you know
our society not allowed because of it so
why do you think since I penetrate the
other places with your father away from
the government oh so this is second hand
information so maybe you can tell me if
I'm wrong but my guys like it because
there's a kind of a critical mass of
innovation there so it's not just the
cost there are a lot of innovators there
who are working together and there's a
lot of startups starting that are doing
really interesting things and so I think
that the they may work with the other
factories in other cities but there's
apparently like a subculture from
hardware hackers and shins I shenzhen is
it's like that i think they call the
shins I gang right and there's a gang of
people who literally you can go into the
market and this is kind of slightly off
the record but you can buy the
schematics for every single mobile phone
on the market and then you can go to the
factory and use the same line that they
use and you can buy the same parts that
they use on the street and you can
literally kind of hack you know a an
ericsson device and again you would
never be able to sell this back in the
US and its really not anything but but
if you think about it as a lab rather
than as a as a manufacturing center it's
really interesting because it's like
what if you could take an ericsson phone
and mash it up with a motorola phone
what will be what would what would
emerge well they're doing that there and
and and so so that's what's I think kind
of interesting it's not the
manufacturing part it's more than
hacking part it's nothing to do this all
day always yeah yeah well they're
they're the ones that support the
ecosystem right but but I think what's
emerged recently is that there's a whole
underground innovation center there that
people don't really talk about but I
think a lot of people are going and
checking out
the questions and comments reflections
I think too plus it's all about agility
and how to react and that seems to work
better in small environments like to
know what you experience from going to
this kind of very agile and very dynamic
environment to something bigger than me
laughs yeah so that's a good question
because I'm doing this on my own team
and it is it is hard so so Media Lab is
is is it the whole enterprise is
probably four or five hundred people so
it's not Microsoft but still a big ship
and and I am having to create smaller
teams that do stuff on the edges and I'm
having to redesign the lab a little bit
and hopefully once I get the edges sort
of sorted out i'm going to start hacking
on the middle and part of our
conversation is about how microsoft can
help me with the new model that i'm
trying to introduce but i do think that
the key to to it is you do need to
create so here's kind of my the way that
I've seen six large companies
successfully do it in certain
circumstances like banks and things is
you create smaller groups that create
either supporting structures or
identical structures and then use and
then you once you become roughly
equivalent in terms of function you
switch over to the new stuff I don't
really don't think you can it's hard to
change existing old stuff and you can
still move the people but a lot of the
structure what I think you need to do is
create a scaffolding in and switch over
rather than to change what exists I
think one of the key things of changes
if it's a new thing you can build it out
as a side thing if you're trying to
change an old thing what I found
traditionally is because I don't really
like changing it while you and this is
this is not so much the media but this
is more of me talking from the
perspective of an investor is I usually
like to get the team to rewrite the
whole code in the most modern language
whether that ruby on rails or whatever
makes sense make it test-driven make an
object-oriented make it agile and then
you separate this big thing out in two
pieces then each component you switch
over but at the beginning you don't
change any of the features you sort of
copy one for one so that you can test
compatibility and switch and once you've
switched over to a more agile platform
which is
test-driven object oriented and
separated into groups then you can start
to modify you can keep it but I always
like to prevent the messing with legacy
in terms of like the the forms and the
the protocol between the the I keep
business process reengineering and and
process engineering separate from code
engineering and I'd like to do the code
first and write an equivalent that's
cleaner and then start messing with the
people later because when you mess with
the people in the code together you
start you don't have a reference I think
that's one of the biggest problems these
big companies do and then also in this
is sorry this is kind of maybe negative
from Microsoft I try to get people off
of packages because packages tend to
clump things together and keep them more
complex than they have to I like to try
to separate things out so that's i'm
working on a company or like a start-up
i often get everybody reread the code at
media lab it's it's a slightly different
type of organization because it's really
more of a community than anything else I
mean really literally I mean I I I can't
fire the faculty they're going to do
what they want to do anyway it's it's
really like more like writing an open
source software project and is like
running a company so I think there are
similarities but but there are there are
significant differences i think in
mediums profession where you uh given
all that you've been doing you could be
doing with your time what possessed you
take on this role yeah i was surprised
as well that because i wasn't sure what
I went to visit the media lab what I was
getting into it just Nicholas has told
me I had to go and and it was funny
because he I just read this in Wired the
other day so I didn't know until a
couple weeks ago but they gone through
like 250 candidates and I was on the
list but they kind of decided that it
wouldn't work because I didn't have a
degree right but then they got through
all of them and they all I had they had
left was me and so Nick
Nicholas called me up and said come and
do an interview and then I met everybody
and I really fell in love with them and
they fell in love with me and what I
fell in love with him was I met every
professor and a bunch of the students
over two days in like half an hour each
and it was so diverse and so
disorganized that it I was like this is
me right because my problem was I was
interested in everything so I was on the
board of this and on the board of that
and living here and living there because
i wanted to do everything and it was
really ripping me apart but i found that
at the media lab there was for every
single interest I had everything from
diving to djing to you know you I
whatever there was somebody who was
better at it and focused on it at the
media lab doing it and so I was able to
in one place find something that I could
focus on that actually allowed me to
take this interest in everything and
landed then I also i had just turned 45
and i think i was Melling out a little
bit and and I decided that this whole
sort of venture investing thing it was
really interesting but there was a
certain like every single it was I don't
know how you explain but like ventures
like this particular kind of like golf
club and it's really perfect for a
certain kind of shot but there are lots
of different shots that don't work with
that right and and they all tend to arc
in a certain particular way and when I
met the kids at the Media Lab and listen
to what they want to do I want to become
a social entrepreneur an African work on
oral histories and I wanted it was so
much more diverse and and and the people
were so interesting the venture
capitalist aren't interesting to hang
out with but but I but there was an
explosion of diversity that I really
liked so so to me and the last thing
I'll say is the thing that I did most
successful at in the past other than
sort of investing in stuff like that was
building communities so it's creative
commons and and the the firefox
community to fight against the evil
empire all these communities community
management was like a fun thing for me
and when I looked at the media lab it
was a community management exercise and
not and to me that that was also an
interesting thing I thought something
that I thought I would I'd have fun
doing
so I recently read this would be lead
style and then cut off the ideas and
i'll talk about similar to fast
prototyping and testing and so on but in
that book they have this validated
learning where there's no battery
because it's a company is it although
use or people a lot you know there's a
metric that you can measure the success
but in the video that it does kind of
you know academics is you should how
would you measure this kind of you know
to see whether you're making progress as
your community yeah I think that's a
really good point so first of all I'll
say one thing about metrics so I know
Eric really well and we were we work
together and it's important to have
metrics and in the way that like aliens
good lean startup does is they'll
measure millions of things literally and
they'll pick they'll really try to find
which measurements actually matter and
they'll come up with theories and
they'll come up with metrics but they
build the metrics kind of as they go
along to try to figure out what are the
dials and the drivers for my business to
increase by rallying and adoption and so
on and so so it's which is very
different from what big companies and
some of my foundations friends would do
which is they have a theory first then
they create the metrics and then they
deploy the money which is a metrics
driven planning structure rather than a
product that's surrounded by metrics
that they use to figure out whether it's
successful and to make sure that they
capture the learnings so that's I would
say even though we were use the same
word metrics is very different than we
believe in this theory I'm an economist
and I'm right and we're and hey wait a
second reality is wrong it's does my
theory doesn't work you know so that's
one thing that the media lab is really
really different because I think in the
company you've already kind of have a
pretty specific trajectory you've got
you've jumped off a cliff and you're
dead and you're trying to become alive
before you hit the bottom and so you
really have a time limited amount of
time to figure out a way to get to
sustainable growth and so so you've got
to be very focused on the fact that your
metrics are growing in a way that people
can see the media labs is kind of the
before that part so so a lot of people
will say the Media Lab is a bunch of
solutions looking for problems the kids
are really literally just discovering
and so one example is you know the yo-yo
ma came and said he wanted a sensor for
his bow to sort of understand the
movement so you know some of the
professors and students put together
this sensor and then Penn and Teller
came and said well we want on our magic
show to be able to twitch and move
something over there without the
audience knowing this sent a bunch of
kids to Las Vegas to sit at the Penn &amp;amp;
Teller show and then an NEC engineer
comes and says that's exactly what we
need for our air bags to protect child
seats and then they deployed them in
Japanese cars and so the lab is really
more of a sort of a toy box of these
solutions and the companies are the ones
that help us think about the constraints
and think about the models and where
they would go and so we're we're I think
we have to have it that's why our
corporate membership is a really
important part of what we do some what
we do have about a dozen student
startups a year and but whether we talk
about this later but where i'm setting
up a fund for our corporate sponsors to
invest side by side with the VCS and all
of our students start up so so I do
think sometimes the kids will say hey
I'm going to do this but you know it's
really hard to do it in the lab you want
to do it outside because the other part
about the lab is that we're really kind
of an idea upstream idea factory if we
once you've proven that this idea is
show able and demonstratable you sort of
encouraged to back off of the idea
usually if you really want to turn that
into a thing you usually go off and do
direct your research or you go up and
join the company that can do it or you
do a start-up around it and and so and I
think if we got into commercializing and
product izing things too much we'll
start we would start running into some
conflicts with our sponsors as well
because that because our sponsor
companies are also really diverse we
have manufacturers like you know LG
samsung sony toshiba then we have you
know software companies and then we have
service companies like British Telecom
and then we have you know hasbro and
hearst and so so it's really I think it
gets complicated if we get too much into
the the actual business of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
