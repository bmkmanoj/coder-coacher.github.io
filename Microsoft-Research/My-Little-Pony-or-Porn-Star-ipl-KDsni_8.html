hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
first up is Morgan
this is not quite as exciting as my
little pointer prints are because this
is technological you told me in addition
of my little pony R&amp;amp;R as I said this
morning to address all of these
wonderful quotes that in my literature
review or One Laptop Per child the
creator could easily applied to
technology or technology 100 years ago
and the question will be in this
presentation is it about internet
computers or is it not about the
Internet I figured I'd make it simple
like we don't have a modem which actual
technology is it's just is it readers of
Internet from there is it not computers
in Internet and I'd like a raise of
hands for each of those on each of these
so the first one will soon be obsolete
in school scholars will soon be
instructed to be high it is possible to
touch every branch of human knowledge
with this technology so computers
internet presents
volunteers internet reasons this is a
package of pictures
this technology has the potential to
tech people like no other technology
will bring about numerous two-way
communication and would likely usher in
a wider society governed by electronic
democracy internet computers you are
joke not Internet
though you might have a fundamental
effect spot intellectual development and
in other new technologies including even
computers internet oh not computer's not
internet this isn't personal
one of the intellectual forefathers of
will not conquer child next one this
technology was going through my culture
and education to the masses eliminate
politicians ability to incite passions
in the walk bring people closer to
government proceedings and produce a
national culture that would transcend
regional and local jealousies
one of the huge amazing parallels I
discovered in this is Venice there was
so much culture around the video of it
is so much like the Internet it's
amazing I believe that police technology
will enable us to so modified the
learning environment outside the
classrooms that much if not all of the
knowledge school I said presley's tries
to teach us with such pain and expense
and such limited success when we learned
as the child learns to blocks painlessly
successfully and without organized
instruction computers the internet not
Internet
of settling international
misunderstandings it would ultimately
make force impossible
technology democracy because it for
business communication collaborate and
even to inspire uncontrolled by central
authority computers Internet's full
this sounds very much like
I know
it's true wires how these four houses
amateur enthusiasts educators pioneered
this technology communicating over vast
distances without political or economic
controls emboldened by their new
invention many of these people also felt
as virtual communities and I did where
the global social space we are willing
to be naturally independent of the
charities you see to enclose upon us
have no moral right to rule us nor do
possess any methods of enforcement we
have Barlowe
1996 for me the great hope is now that
this technology is coming out people who
normally wouldn't make this content are
going to be taking in and that one day a
little
to reorganize cities and make
memory if I really look at how to
eliminate poverty create these to work
on the environment
I can't even better way to do it Peter's
