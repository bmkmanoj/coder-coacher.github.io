hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
okay I guess we can start so it's our
great pleasure to have a general here
today he's visiting the lab so general
has a degree in both economics and
computer science and there is now
currently finally a PhD student at the
Cal Tech where he's advised by Professor
veerman and professor Lowe and a speech
GTCC's about well if you can guess from
the title you know energy efficient you
know I t particularly no with cloud
computing both across data center and we
fin data center and his work has been
widely recognized by the research
community it's got a couple of best
paper award for the work of his PhD as
well as also in the industry settings he
has been collaborating with HP in order
to help them developing i canna
efficient data center and today you know
it's going to talk about you know is
which thanks a lot and I gave it to you
yeah it's really a pleasure to be here
and uh I really like this building it's
very nice and and also this is a 100
call back in a half an hour session last
week at Imperial but this time we have
the luxury to have one hour which you
can show the work in a little bit depth
so nowadays energy and accessibility
have become one of the most critical
issues for our society while the
abundant potential of renewable energy
such like a wind and solar prison a real
opportunity forces ability they are
intermittency and I certainty is a total
operating challenge they are flown from
my work I Funkers on to develop
analytical models and the deployable
algorithms and eventually go to industry
transfer to enable efficient the
integration of renewable energy into our
IT system of further our channel power
system so there isn't talk ok Caillou to
me a favor please so i really hope by
the end of tokyo can give me and any
comments you have a my dogs
essence it's your only very hard to get
this kind of comments since people are
you ready to friend Olivia okay yeah
let's start so okay this might not be a
good example by the let's Google eyes
okay so people are using google services
and but not everyone knows this cause of
google moda why mini server and what
does this mean for the stability so the
omission of wine server is comparable to
a car and together with all the either
IT companies and the total emission of
IT is comparable to the airline industry
so so imagine how many flights we have
every data and also as a building bulk
for Colonel computing there are centers
consume about two percent of the word
electricity consumption what does that
mean if we aggregated the other data
centers at our country and we named it
the United enters and that's why we
named countries and the moon is
electricity consumption our annual basis
is comparable to the united kingdom and
to make it even worse this part is
increasing very fast it's much faster
than total electricity consumption so
that means carter is two percent but if
we do know too since in the right way i
guess in 10 years it will be third
person so this is very important and
recently greenpeace have two very
interesting report wise how dirty is
your data wise how clean all your cloud
to come for attention but more
importantly actions on this important
area so for my own research yeah okay as
a researcher in networking system that's
why i'm so interesting in this group
back to my master study into my
university i am most of ochres all wrote
architectural protocol design so 0 and
this is my home area but during the past
five years i saw a new dimension merging
which is energized estimating almost all
the traditional area now they care about
energies have a power they even care
about the climate change an ecosystem
okay this can be divided into two part
what is to make up artist system morse
assemble
what is to use IT to improve the
accessibility of our society so my work
is is going along both lon for this one
I have the geographica load balancing
which I will discuss a little bit in
this talk and I also work with HP for
three years to design and implement as I
in touch we first net zero energy data
center it's a call to a company were
louder last year and for a second one
I'm only recently I most fukers on the
merits mass is an interdisciplinary
challenge for both engineering and
economics ok here ok as you might say
this this is a keyword maybe for Mike
application so sigmetrics is my home
conference it's parallel to see combat
and focus more on the performance eval
you more theoretical side c-calm
nowadays is really hard to see any
formulation and the mathematics 0 but ok
sigmetrics is a conference focusing a
little bit more on the server side ok i
will start with us as in behind apart as
we see this is an important area so we
have also a huge pushes from both
academia and industry so as a result the
power usage effectiveness of a pua which
is defined as a power into the building
/ the power use my IT system is free to
use to do the real work is a greatly
reduced during past decade it's reduced
from more than 32 just 1.1 for the state
of our data center or does that mean for
three it means for each kill our power
used by our server there are two killers
visited on the cooling and power
distribution but 1.1 means we have
ninety percent utilization this is very
good but but what's missing there right
so first wise a lower power costs lower
peewee does unless roomy low energy
consumption if we make this IT system
worse and it can actually reduce this
one unfortunately this is a one of the
tricks other idea how they are playing
now what do they do is they remove the
actually moves
cooling need from the chiller to the
files of the server once I see the
server like the laptop right you cannot
it's real hard to distinguish between a
power from the file of the powerful the
IT system therefore by doing that they
can reduce Pee Wee but it doesn't reduce
their energy consumption more
importantly is that even a lower energy
consumption does not necessarily me so
stability because we need to care about
how much power is from renewable sources
this is also very important problem
nowadays because more and more data
centers they are built at a location
with very cheap very cheap price but at
the same time very dirty so for my
research I focus our improved
accessibility to make data centers not
as simple and go here to power this
interface renewable energy okay but they
all center here on the demand side we
have itd man we need to finish and we
have other or hat on the supply side we
have local renewable generation such
like the apple new data center he knows
currently I guess I remember if my
memory is correct so there we have a 20
megawatt PV panel beaches is a huge area
and also it can also use the power from
the electricity grid our power grid is
possible it I'm wearing it actually
surprised mum and supply they are both
the dynamic and uncertain and they do
not necessarily each other this is one
example of are already very optimized
the data center in the power consumption
ok here the red curve is a PV generation
is measured on top of beauty and the Li
society power raised ID capacity
constraint the crown bar is cooling but
we really want it may look like this so
workload management so what mcnees
possible is workload is flexible this
flexibility is twofold the first one is
the flexibility in time okay if we take
a closer look we actually have to cut
some work
why is you are interactive or clogged
being searched let me colliculus search
we expected result to come back in one
second to a very high satisfied but we
also have another class of petrol black
so the background indexing all lessons
and the scientific computation of that
for this kind of work load we have much
larger flexibility we've had to it at
any time as well as we finish before the
deadline we still have deadlines but the
is much more flexible for example at HP
we have won a huge image processing job
for this thing that takes several weeks
to finish so no it's not a big data and
a lot of big deal application they
really take a really long time to finish
a linear it's almost a no emergency for
finish them test just as fast as
possible so for this one we can to the
demon shipping to make it to better you
test your generation and I also work on
the life cycle analysis and optimization
and even from the starting point to when
you build a data center you need to
consider for each part how much you want
to provision and the second part is in
my mind more unique in our IT system
it's as the flexibility in space for
example yeah the basic idea is that we
can decide which to the center to serve
the request in a real-time manner right
and therefore we need to deal with the
distributed control and online control
because there's a large distributed
system and there are a lot of
uncertainty in the future information so
this I will focus on in this talk okay
here what do you mean by by geography
load balancing ok again sorry about that
I take a Kouga example ok Unitas this
but actually they have their Center all
over the world and they are doing this
because probably to minimize the
delay to increase reliability and this
mix dodging challenging to see this here
in the system the request view first go
to apology or maybe know that all front
and server other than this one we will
decide where to send the traffic to
write at least one in my pits and closer
but why in Colorado it my speed right we
we call it energy and we're loading our
ear because we make trade off between
load balancing network amended say an
allergy of our time very and location
dependent and a given the rotating
decision that innocent of euro Nemec
capacity provisioning to design a number
of active servers for each hand slot
okay and I have a demo here to show how
they see some work to do the follow the
renewable protein in order to eat the
renewable integration so here the legend
okay each circle is a data center and
the the inner area missin the number of
active server in the data center is on
earth circle that is a total capacity
the left hand side is Adam and we have
the IP power demand another cooling
power demand right hand side is a supply
this the red part is what we do not want
it as a power from the electricity grid
at least to add video more television
okay for each dot is our sauce we have
one sauce / each state and if there is a
line between the source and the data
center there is traffic there The Seeker
is nice the more traffic we have okay
well we start we can see as time goes by
the proxy we decide that the data center
to send another dinners interview we
will change attempt with size according
to the coming traffic and also does
renewable generation and and another sin
to to notice is that we do not send the
traffic from the east coast to west
coast it's too far away but for the
middle part we we might sleep according
to the renewable generation okay by
doing this we can increase our renewable
transition
but how to make this we need a
deployable and distributed control with
theoretical guarantee for this kind of
follows up in your world okay here i
think people all grieve is deployable
okay what i want to come with is that we
also need some cereal guarantee this is
important if when with something goes
wrong and also the distributive is
related to this season I think Google's
example actually a more increase in case
and recenter work this is AG my egg my
has thousands of data centers as in
United States so there the distributed a
solution is very important folder and to
do this iphone model to algorithm and to
evaluate the impact and eventually to
reassess on design throughout this
process okay this is my research style
is complete both regard and relevant
okay let's start with the model and for
proxy we discretize the workload to each
check for example to each other together
the workload for the current comes out
as LG and of course for the the relation
between all the time slot we have
another paper work out a lot with oh but
i will not focus in this talk but if you
increased it i'm always happy to discuss
offline the second okay give me the
total incoming load the proxy need to
decide a try fixin to each the center
which is lambda G and IG is the traffic
going from proxy g2 there's an eye this
is energy of erotic until center we have
all the informations total number of
server can I might actually surprise p I
power usage effectiveness eii maybe some
renewable generation RI and uh okay the
arrival rate is decided by the Jodi okay
lambda R is simply just a summation over
j of Lanai g given this but they also
need to decide the number of active
servers small I'm I for your thumbs out
this is a dynamic capacity provision ok
this is model either for objective we
minimize
both energy calls and delay calls for
energy causes function of a number of
active servers and also are the other
parameters for the link halls we have fi
as a delay in style to the center and a
bij as a delay from the proxy to the
city center which is a network delete
for example this is why exam powerful
energy calls the number of active
servers plus the power usage defending
is to get a total power minus renewable
price of electricity price here we can
use MGR one process sharing queuing
delay and to get a sample ok these are
two not examples to help you to
understand I understand the objective
but for our algorithm design we have
work for general okay what do we
minimize this is our control variable Y
is mi is a number of active servers at
this I this is a dynamic offensive
provision alumni IJ is a routine matrix
the concern we have you need to finish
all the traffic non-negative this is
just a concert here okay and you
mentioned we ignore the integer
constraint because these two number are
you really very large thousand at a
thousand level and the last one is very
challenging for distributed algorithm
design it's a total traffic for today's
an actual smaller than the service
recover the data line this is a complex
of munition we sound mind assumption and
so we can solve it in a centralized way
but the challenge is how to make it
distributed okay the algorithm design
part and also work before my work they
also work with real system but none of
them provided is a guaranteed of melody
okay our idea the first level idea is
that a separation between jolting and
the data standardization here actually
the decision for each day centre can be
isolated very well right so each day is
interim just given my little coming
traffic I'm you decide that's for local
by doing a local optimization how many
several I want to keep
it seemed to let cool renewable was it
yes local renew exactly but this still
it costs associated with a sorry
selected let's do some costs to
providing this renewable yes Matt that's
why we have the life circle analysis
because the capital cost for wind and
solar is very large but once you already
have it it deployed this is for the
operational culture during operation of
the Casa is very small okay so this is
okay and once you get this the number of
active service it will transfer all
measured by the proxies and the process
need to solve the resulting matrix in a
distributed way this is challenging but
assume we can do this a dozen in this
process going down this is a traditional
circle for distributed algorithm design
the we can prove there is no performance
loss from this separation in the sense
of it a city you convert to the optimal
solution okay but what's remaining is
this one the drought indices to see the
challenge okay for example if this is a
feasible set for proxy Gigi okay what's
that it has three constraints right the
first one is you need to send out all
your traffic I second it's not active
that's wise for each data center yo
traffic plus the trophy from all the
other people should be smaller than the
service capacity but proxies are doing
the update as same time and what's
traditional way to do this is from the
current estate we calculated a gradient
direction and if it goes out of a
project back but here we cannot do this
because first one in order for this
approach to decrease for the objective
function to decrease for this approach
we eat the objective function to
believers pictures basic me it has
banded the lira team if it is different
okay but here the queuing delay we know
that is close to infinity it's not
liquors so we cannot use this wait a
second why is we
we need to calculate in a distributed
way but those counseling days is not
couple it's couple so what we solve this
problem is that ok the first idea is
that we assume we have an initial
feasible set feasible point this point
is just feasible we do not need this to
be optimal but the freedom it can be
achieved by the other reliability
beginning of the season now from this
one we divide our arrow set the level
set means it contains all the points
with objective value smaller than this
ignition point ok also benefit of this
one is this sat asleep sures so if we
still do the gradient and project back
to this one then we can show it will
make it a function to decrease and
what's even decrease its keeping this
feasible set so it goes on and we can't
do that ok we solve the first channel
but a second why is that well I don't
like this I basic me only proxy chimbu
right you assume all the other people
don't do make any update but let's not
do the full convert this way so how to
make this is turns out we have a very
simple solution that is you justice
security down by the number of active
process and by doing this we can prove
although each one is updated at the same
time but I will keep them together we
still keeping this filter set under the
objective function decreases fast enough
ok and hear this proof is very general
we just need a function to be convex no
other assumption and the human needs we
can prove for the sequence generated by
our algorithm every limiting point is
optimal given the slab size is small
enough ok under ok let's let's have a
little bit brick here and
I guess maybe some of you have already
seen this figure before and this is from
PhD custom cosmic and okay what is the
outer circle is a human knowledge okay
this is what we get after elementary
school and then we go on and the equal
to the college now something happen here
is we have a major reach might not be a
good thing but the death of reality as
they you keep going around that
direction for eventually the PhD right
and the the you you make some brick
through you get your PhD degree and okay
if this is the case I should see for the
theoretical side what I just described
losers here the distributed algorithm
diese is actually one of my contribution
here since before that I I didn't see
any work can do the distributive
algorithm visa without a lip shorts
collision what do they do is just assume
the functions lectures okay but back to
this what a contribution is still
negligible so that's why we need to we
are nowadays are working with localized
to come true if you know professor don't
tell you at Caltech is a big name in
control community ok now we compared to
the technical part and the other
properties we have for voy to be
deployable why is the convergence read
write and here is a cover to an optimal
solution for the algorithm we design
three years ago it's converged already
at a exponential rate we have a new
algorithm this year for transaction our
networking and this can convert much
faster the reason behind this is that we
do not follow the traditional approach
since for optimization what we can
achieve optimality is when the KKT
condition is satisfied by so for this
algorithm we directly go to the KKT
condition to make it satisfied for each
time step as much as possible so it can
convert very fast and also this we have
the the the idea of this airways worm
two years ago and we also have all the
simulation to support it it actually
converge but it takes two years to prove
it actually so it actually says Samson
seems the easy is actually not easy i go
ahead what is the time scale on that
axis in which the world changes under
you with ok ok so for for the time so to
reconsider now it's one hour right and
for each time step it might be five
minutes up a minute ok that's sometimes
to calibrate consider changing faster
than every five minutes ok the soon we
that is ok first of all people you
really believe when the distri wind
energy distribution is a variable
distribution right and the in essence it
does not change it so fast if from the
card slot is kind of a random walk for
the next one but the solar can actually
be very fast just one color to go
spirally decrease to 0 and therefore
people already have some small storage
inside also windows order to keep it
smooth in your very x well maybe one
minutes or five minutes so that's why we
we basically to no need to worry about
the fluctuation at the time skill set is
he already handed on to that longer time
secure that solve the problem and the
second why is that people more worries
or roti matrix is too complicated but we
can prove if your graph if we consider
all the data centers and all the proxies
as a node if there is a traffic amazon
there is a edge then we can prove there
exists a simple optimal solution as
there is no circle inside and the proof
is constructed the last one is
uniqueness generally speaking the
optimal the optimal solution is not
unique but we can prove the per server
arrival rate its unique across all the
optimal solution okay then we evaluating
impact to post it as an operator in
terms of the cost in
and also to the environment in terms of
the emission for the fur set up we have
ten location and we use the industrial
actually price for each one and it
actually varies a lot for work load we
have one policy per each state and we
use a workout from hot meal and secure
it by the population with internet
access within each state and the network
latency is proportional to distance okay
then we can evaluate the first one from
innocent of readers perspective how much
can we see over a heuristic solution a
heuristic I mean it's already very good
become Paris edition called local local
bees we still do the optimal dynamic as
a provisioning inside the data center
this just folded otium is near is
eroding it's already I think it's
already much better than most of the
industry practice now and uh for this
one into the simulation we can see we
can save that cause up to twenty percent
the reason behind this is receive the
energy cost quite a lot but we only
increase the delay a little bit as you
see in a demo we do not move traffic to
a very far away data center Christ yes
so instead you're trying to have smoked
electricity company that's right since
you're trying to do you're providing
renewable energy Robin trying to
optimize on prices if the electricity
company providing the renewables and
once it Oh later you will see if you
have also that kind of case okay ah this
is a general work it kind use the fall
for different objective this is just for
my objective since it's very
straightforward for this as an operator
to focus on cost also we hope some can
also for cassava are the externality but
in reality join ash to those people are
selfish it's why and okay this is good
for the cause but for the usage it can
actually increase well the idea behind
this is that when you send out a traffic
to a further to the center to utilize
the cheaper it actually says here you
need to use molar server to serve the
request two copies in the folder larger
network delay right this is very bad and
then we want to study how to make it
also environmental friendly the the
answer is to use it for folder in your
parenting there are two approaches okay
this is our objective okay this is
something probably you cannot change as
a as an operator is selfish but what we
can change is that first of all we can
change the price recapturing the price
signal to make it a more aligned with
the renewable generation a second while
we so nowadays more and more this isn't
already have a local renewable
integration and okay for the first one
okay this simulation we have the data
center this is a renewable generation
our East Coast and West Coast of the
United States and with these are the
time difference here and also for the
server's act number of active servers
under static pricing as a current
practice look like this also some time
difference and if we can do dynamic
pricing have the form of kind of carbon
tax then we can show it actually can
enable all motivate this kind of the
follower in your world to send the
traffic to the center is more renewable
for the second one we focus on the
question of the local renewable capacity
required to reduce the broader dirty
energy usage by a significant level this
is your part of your concern this since
this will capacity the capital culture
is very healed and okay this is a
lunisolar capacity equal to what it
means the average generation equal to
the average usage every demand if you
just do local it's very cute it's not
feasible if you can do geographical
load-balancing with even lower than
Theresa prior cheap really surprised we
have to assume a lot and we can do with
high energy price action academia and we
know that the India
actually surprised is very high let me
kind of soup further okay so for this
why what we have is that it is good for
this is an operator because it can
reduce operational costs we have the
distributed algorithm but we also have
an online we don't do that and it can
also be good for the society to in need
to ease the renewable in equation if we
can provide the right incentive for them
to do the follow the Reno karate okay
then i go to industrial implementation
okay the reason after behind this is
that after my second year I already have
the sink metrics paper and a nicer place
people would then I come to my advisor
also i went to my advisor to see i need
to go to the industry to to make a
really impact the firm's the arm is
already three years during summer i work
full time with HP and during normal time
i work part i and we actually work on
the implementation of this one and what
we have we realized first is that for
the routine part also is not easy in the
theory part but it actually we have
already a lot of techniques i
incorporate it is very easy for example
google has a global workload management
when I in turn this google in 2012 i can
have the SS to native to the code base
of this line and it is very easy to
incorporate this way into their current
royalty so this part is okay well to the
center part actually is it's very hard
for industrial so what we do now is
relieved all the servers are all the
time so there is a article last year in
eunuch types to criticize the data
center just has a very low utilization
in that article they claim the average
utilization is only ten to fifteen
percent why we have such a low
utilization its way to know to turn off
to sleep of the high user it just keep
them all that's a reality so I work with
HP for the data center for this endeavor
has to be part I p cooling and the power
is Syria haha I we have impact on each
other and all the information I gathered
about our capacity and work another
planner to get the schedule to minimize
the environmental impact to minimize
energy costs and to steal me I still
meets the service level agreement of the
workload okay this is a system
architecture okay this is more like a
sitcom talk and we have we predict other
information and we get all the parameter
and other service operational goals to
get our workflow schedule and the
resource provisioning plan for our run
high workload manager for this one we
have the multiples a model and a country
algorithm it can be local transform one
data center and it can be global for the
geography load balancing it doesn't
matter just depends on how you use it
for for this what is ticks on a long
time to finish because here we work out
a cool location of different kind of
workload on same server we do the lamb
migration of virtual machine we also do
the cooling optimization and also we
have the reactive control since we have
the prediction error so I have a demo
here for the HP data center what we are
doing now okay ignore the lower part is
just a statistic and here the central
part is IT system I show three physical
server but actually we have many more
well it is green it means active all the
brown boxes on the server our automation
this is a very powerful server it has 24
cpu cores just for white server and this
is a power part we have the entrepreneur
generation and we also use the power
grid there is a switch among these two
and for cooling we can use outside air
cooling and we can use a traditional
cheater pudding this is the time of the
day and the outside air temperature okay
now let's start now since this night we
don't have any renewable generation
since the outside air temperature is low
we use upset air cooling right and later
when we come today we have more animal
solar generation
now we can do turn out all the server to
serve the request and since the outside
temperature become higher we go to the
traditional trailer cooling to serve the
repast okay it goes on and the leader
you will see it counts as during night
we don't have renewable generation may
go back to the situation we just use
white server okay so this is what our
system looks like now and last year oh
not last year in 2012 HP imbues the
architecture and it because the computer
will learn it last year a more important
this part we already have a product
called ego pod data center it is used by
large IT companies like eBay and
Facebook okay I know I assure a full
circle go from the analytical modeling
to algorithm design and eventually go to
the industrial transfer okay I'm the
second part now is that the IT in my man
to the playa a more important role in
our overall infrastructure for our
society okay let's say now we have more
and more renewable generation from the
sustainability consideration enter it's
interesting to to realize there are
actually three stage for our power grid
during the first stage we care about the
cost so we try to minimize our cause
then people have the concern about the
reliability a leader may try to improve
the reliability and people care about
the accessibility and nowadays we care
about the sustainable and the people
worried about the cost so this is a the
power electricity the power industry
okay during the past 10 years the
renewable generation increase a lot and
among these wind and solar actually
dominate all the new capacity and the
list to our very challenging for
our power because what we have is we
need to meet we need to balance the
supply with demand for the power with
otherwise we have a black hole it's not
like our IT system is just yo-yo your
website goes down it's here if you're
building Yoakam the power will go down
what do we do traditionally predicts the
demand and then we come to the supply to
follow the demand and now with renewable
generation the supply side is less
controllable and I have high I sentences
here although we can use battery or
energy storage I'll reserve whatever
they call to solve the problem is very
expensive so people are considering to
meet the demand side also responsive to
make the demand to follow the supply to
some extent therefore we get a huge
growth in America's people are
considering the electric vehicle air
conditioner and even pool pumps as a
candidate for the Murray spots but in my
mind the center is also a promising
option because they are very large load
right is it controls as a very large
number of smaller a second Weiss it's
already highly automated so the control
knobs are already here but if you want
to control our air conditioner in your
home you need to install additional
additional equipment that costs money
and driver and this party is also in
green fields and we have significant
flexibility in the demand and this is in
different level even in cooling and
lighting we can already changed some we
have some demand flexibility my work
focus on workload management and by
default the dissenters should have the
unsigned backup generator and also the
storage called UPS rental I interrupted
power supply system so this can further
add to the flexibility of our data
center so this is a most the most recent
result is not the conference is in this
June so what do we have is that the
worldwide data center can provide the
energy storage capacity
that was 20 billion dollars how we get
this number is that we work with
Southern California Edison this is a
power company and we have the PV
generation in in a power Network and we
will use either data center all battery
to deal with the uncertainty in the
renewable generation we can show a 20
megawatt data center with only twenty
percent of flexibility can provide the
same voltage violation read as if we
have a three megawatt storage and this
storage is very good and from this
number we calculate this one so there
are huge potential and this is also my
may feel twenty one of my most important
future direction during part following
five years what will reality is that is
not so good we have a lot of program
design but but there isn't a rarely
participe the reason behind this is a
huge challenge behind this why is
algorithm design for this is an operator
since this kind of demand response
program surely you have a high
eternities here it isn't a unity we
prefer a predefined of flattery I don't
care about what you have in a whore
network I just care about you just give
me this fixed read that's why it's
another evidence people are selfish just
care about ourselves and another is that
even that's this reason ball right we
are human we have the limitation ourself
but that's really the problem for the
market design just you know people are
selfish way therefore you should try to
design the market so that you provided
right incentive this is much more
important than just a component about
the selfishness of people and I'm
working on a lamppost on Phobos
algorithm via market design so here is
actually introduced similar challenge
and I did have a bachelor degree in
economics back to packing university and
the this is to our highly
cop out here right assuming the future
if we completely solve the engineering
problem but if we do not have the right
market ISA its do use this since you are
just doing either right in the wrong way
but if we in the future we can really
solve the economic problem but with no
local control that you call me just just
lying 0 as a theory it will not change
the world my UK market designed around
constraints ah ok are you aware of the
you play in the gym object designer and
constraint no not really ok but I would
be very happy to learn from you about
this this ok that's my problem I am more
focus on value US market and actually
different you know different the country
have different quite different policy
for them for China we we have a
different approach to solve the problem
whenever we don't have enough capacity
as a beautiful as the Chancellor one
simple sentence for our solution that
solves all the problem if jazz our cause
is very high and then question oh okay
then the hope is that would be I learned
from here a circle can be also using
ASCII and uh okay this is also one
sentence I I hope you can remember for
my research style okay so or overview my
work start from that isn't our work of
its HP and the folder call and it can be
used for the curl computing right so
that you're confident menacing
essentially I work with both Google and
Ike my for this part and this can't be
also a good candidate for the Murray
sports program and I work with both a
utility company and also the Berkeley
National Lab they have a division called
energy and environmental divisions they
offer one pulse of fellowship each year
and this year i console fellowship so
now nowadays I'm academia job market so
but I I already negotiated to differ
Rainier
to work out look in the berkeley lab
before i started by my assistant
professor in the university so this is
very important see they are lying at a
very good position not sure how how much
you know about this fiber that is it
belong to post University of California
Berkeley and also the Department of
Energy of United States therefore they
are at a very good position of both
industrial academia and even a
government so this is very good for my
research here and no other part it can
actually provide opportunity to move is
not what it is beneficial and we are
advising a start-up to commercialize its
idea and the crowd can be a very good
platform for our smart grid up from the
merry censoring and to communication to
decision making ok my traditional
analyzer direction is of course
networking and system it's for platform
public data and I work with cloud
everyone this might be more femurs the
amp lab at Berkeley if we are in the
networking and system community dear i
work with Professor year stoica on the
net model big data part and also there
is a professor reach randy cashed and
professor david Colin they not have a
very interesting project called software
different building I'm not sure whether
you heard that before that sounds the
worse mention yet okay and this like I
be also used for smart grid because here
we have human in the loop right whenever
we have human we need to deal with the
behavior of Hume and the vichy is
usually a big data problem to understand
the user behavior right throughout the
at least part it will make our IT system
most a symbol this part is to use IT for
the sensibility of power system as well
this is actually distributed come real
time control and distributing the liner
with ice and deformation ok before i
finish i would like to acknowledge my
colleagues at Caltech I'm co / Steven
and Adam boots of amazing advisor I'm
close to finish but other although five
years is already much a little bit
longer than the UK ASAP and I I still
hope I can learn more of them it's this
it's amazing experience from them and
also i work with HP guys and people all
over the world ok ok I'll yourself here
and if you have any questions let me
know thank you I sell other question um
if you can see that like moving to make
a cloud environment or your sub like
dance giving some models but basically
tenants have incentive if they're all
cookies energy aware of and you're
fishing total opposite there are some
money you know it's like so that's where
you can do without shipping and so on so
what do you think would be the essential
for tenants to the energy friendly
that's very good question so can you say
that train a dragon so if you're under
like a cover the center and things like
the workloads come from the tenant yes
so most cases it's a black box so don't
really have much flexibility to do a
clothing or something I'll heaven if you
expose them to the 10 some of the
benefits mostly like you know monitor
necessarily mean okay benefit this might
help because I don't I say well you know
what I mean I ready for Miley Walker to
be sheet in the future with this goes
out to be cheaper to hustle okay I think
always a problem can be solved either
from the economy approach or by
regulation it really depends whether we
have the market failure a lot you really
most the time regulation always works if
you have some like tags all that
regulations here it can't help but a
more a more gentle approach is that if
you can affect the cause of the center I
provide the right incentive to reduce
the cost of the data center who use more
renewable island to renewable energy
then the data center who use more
renewable energy will become more
competitive in the market to provide the
service is a lower cost by doing that we
can encourage all the user to utilize
that one the other two that again it's a
problem is whether we can provide the
right incentive and if not if you use
think assume they are how to be a market
failure we have to do this regulation
did you do something to try to robust
solution to your organization problem
yes they do have not clear what do we
have now the year of the situation is
like okay HP has a data center inc
Colorado and zeros in actually cpu is
for part the first why is a fixed cost
very small the second wiser you say it's
charging it's just the total amount of
electricity we use no matter when you
using the third why's your pic charging
the NASA moi is coincident peaking chart
what does that mean is by the end of the
charging period for example in northern
lands at that time the utility company
will pick one hour and charge you a very
high rate at that hour is actually the
peak hour of the utility as a whole as
they don't know that's why you didn't
tell you you don't know further and
there the gerbils opsonization really
matters so sometime you want to have the
worst case guarantee and we also design
algorithm with as a possible worse kids
guaranteeing in terms of comparative
ratio there but if you like we can
discuss off
question about our I mean using IT okay
clearly we use a lot of energy just to
run those data center give some start in
the beginning but I guess many of the
services provided by IT and not selling
us from doing things in the real world
sending a letter I can send an email oh
yeah okay instead of Charlie yeah yeah
yeah yeah it smells very interesting I'm
sorry cancel do you have an idea of how
much we say okay with those services
google how much you pay on the london oh
okay perfect uh personally I that's not
my focus but I know one work very famous
is that they compare matter you want to
use okay what's a service okay for
example YouTube whether you want to
transform the video from youtube or
found Vedek they compare is this cost
and we're the ok that'll result again as
you can expect is it depends it really
depends how efficient is our network
yeah and it's also a pity that the
current communication network router
that is my home area is it's not a power
proportional that's also a big problem
and as ear is that network committee it
is a big problem for problem even the
justices are networking energy
consumption to make it more powerful
potion on nowadays it's a big challenge
yeah like Cisco nowadays Harvey right
they're all working on allow that line
but it's not so easy the reason is that
if you switch on/off the the LAN card
yeah they don't want to that tradition
there was the cop the energy costs
associated with the actual transmission
at the data EG there's a trade off
between us and II moving the computer is
that important and could you allowed the
origins take it into account yes we can
take that into a car as I just said
nowadays it's not very powerful
emotional so the changing in in network
communication powers to understand that
the the cost of each and the network
communications is not depending on how
much data you're transferring oh the
power I should see the color is your
early dominated by the band is customer
yeah yes but if actually if we consider
bandwidth causing an optimization
problem because they need more even law
since we can balance the castle to
change your to Mickey off your bandwidth
small flat as I can't give a further
benefit but in this work I just used
energy as an example to show the benefit
actually you can imagine as eyes you
have more flexibility you have you have
the ability to to to the floating you're
more flexible way you can always benefit
from giving your different objective</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
