you
okay today I'm going to talk about some
very recent work that I'm working on I
love feedback and improvement
suggestions it touches on a bunch of
different areas it's something different
so some of you might have expertise in
different parts of it so the question is
you know we're all struggling with
reading especially as our devices get
smaller and when you think about it the
letters we use to read are these really
ancient thousands of years old letters
that people are in describing and stone
and writing and papyrus and stuff and
those are the letters we use if my kids
were to ask me why we use them because
my parents use them in my parents
parents use and well not really they
used a different language but anyway
some old people use them and that's what
we're using now and it seems to be
really hard to change the letters you
use but you know you still might ask the
question is this optimal let's even say
we're just still reading English I'm
communicating with someone else in
English but what what not exactly font
what what how should I represent these
letters what script should i use and
especially as we're getting moving to
watches and everything is getting
smaller we might want to try to pack a
little more information on smaller
screens while still being readable okay
can anyone here read this what does it
say very good Microsoft Research Lab
India right so I was in India recently
in this year and the kind of inspired me
a bit one of the things they're
beautiful script this is canada i
believe and i was visiting some people
at microsoft research in india and they
gave me a tour and showed me the palm
leaves and the reason that the scripts
in south india are so curvy is because
when you write you know they used to be
written on a palm leaf and when you
write on a palm leaf if you right
straight it tears the palm leaf okay so
that and you know there's a whole family
of languages that have a script like
that and you know that's why it is and
that's why they write that way in our
alphabet has its own history which is
also very old and we have our reasons
for a liar so that's that's why we read
the letters the way we do but you might
consider alternate scripts you know of
course we have some cursive you know we
have shorthand nobody uses that anymore
really but there's Braille so there's a
bunch of different alternate ways of
writing the alphabet there's actually a
neat website that I encourage you to go
to called I'm
where people have been very creative and
coming up with all kinds of alternate
ways of writing English mostly just
hobbyists but most of the ideas of
presenting things that I thought of have
already been and i'll talk about have
been presented by somebody here the
thing that they haven't done is they
haven't really thought about optimizing
using data okay and it's important to
optimize your script otherwise it won't
necessarily be any better than English
and nobody would well that nobody but
you know it would only be used for fun
also worth mentioning you know if you
say well if I'm thinking of changing the
letters why not just change the language
even better and there have been people
doing that right there's this language
called Esperanto that many of you have
heard of him you know pretty cool I mean
somebody got a hundred thousand people
to learn this language and learning a
language is a hard thing it's not just
learning a new alphabet it's learning
all these new work you know but on the
other hand you know somebody deciding
should I learn Esperanto or Chinese if I
learn Esperanto I can talk to 100,000
people I learn Chinese I can talk to you
know a billion people or whatever so you
know I'm so for this talk I'm not going
to think about that it's super
interesting problem but I'm just
thinking lowering expectations let's
just think about how we present the
letters A through Z okay alright so I'll
talk about the problem and what does it
mean even to do well it's not an easy
thing to define and to try to convince
you basically or we'll ask the question
really how much better could we do can
we do five percent better can we do
three hundred percent better can we fit
a lot more or just a little more and I
think that's really the crucial question
behind this this problem okay I'll talk
about kind of a wacky script that I
don't think anyone is going to say this
is the greatest crypt ever but but it'll
be good to think about you know as an
example of how you would optimize this
script so this script in particular is
mapping each letter is three dots tall
black or red or white so there's three
times three times three there's 27
options one of them is all white which
is a space and they're so at least 26
options or 26 letters in English so it's
a matter what permutation do you give
for each letter in English to each of
these columns so each letter is again
just a column I've written the English
letter the Latin letter on top or on
each of these words so you
still read it but the idea would be to
phase that out and eventually sort of
remove those letters so that you just
read the shapes so this is again I'm not
claiming this is the best script ever
anything like that i'm just going to say
well how would we go about optimizing
this and it has some of the features
that you would have when you try to
optimize any script it has some
interesting properties that each word
here has a shape if you ignore don't
read the white stuff and just look at
the red stuff each where it has a shape
like you has this sort of see like shape
so it's almost like a lagaga raphy like
chinese or something where there's words
have shapes but on the other hand if you
don't recognize the shape of the word
you can break it down and read it one
letter at a time whereas say take
chinese if you don't recognize the shape
of a word go look it up in the
dictionary it's not that easy so okay so
that'll be a fun fun example to go
through and you know you don't have to
use colors of course I'm actually
colorblind I prefer using black and grey
but other people may prefer their own
and you know you can use whatever you
want and kind of oh one thing some of
you might be thinking that I'm I'm
actually very ambitious that I'm
thinking that tomorrow you going to go
down to the cafe and you're gonna have
these new letters it's not what I'm
saying I'm saying you know just you know
some small fraction of people who who
are interested in put this on their
phone or on their browser or whatever
and you know if they're interested in
learning this new way to read they can
do that and if they like it more if they
can fit more information or whatever
criteria they have they may use it so
what are the goals that you might have
from a different script there's so many
of them and you kind of want to balance
all of them but the first thing to
realize is not everyone has to use the
same script because we have this you
know new technology you can have your
phone translating essentially between
you and everyone else and you're seeing
your letters in your way but there it's
all English going back and forth that
nobody knows how you what font you easy
well what representation you're using
what script so what are the goals so you
of course want it to be readable and
that's you know very very important I've
had many people tell me oh yes I would
like you all to read without my reading
glasses you know and I know where the
next 5-10 years i'm going to probably
need reading glasses because my parents
did at that age so i would love to be
able to to read without reading glasses
so nobody knows how old i am i would
like to be able to read when things are
small of course so what what would be a
good way to get that pixelated is
another problem if you don't have a huge
solution on your device a lot of reading
is not about just linearly reading
through text it's scanning right you're
scanning through your emails your
scanning a web page you're scanning your
text messages or whatever so that's very
important how quickly can you spot
something when you're scanning how
quickly can you read in general of
course is very important and do you
understand all these things are very
important can you learn it can somebody
new learn that learn these types of
scripts also super important and are
they aesthetic you know nobody wants to
look at something super ugly which is
why I definitely need to partner with
some design people okay but but you get
the idea I hope so like but a simple
goal you might think of there so many
different scenarios but and you kind of
want to compromise between all these but
think about maybe a natural goal is you
know how much more information could we
fit on a screen say a phone screen or
something while still being readable
okay or equivalently could we keep the
same information and make it more
readable and I think it's neat to think
about even when things are blurry so
it's nice to have delicate lines in a
script it's great they're beautiful and
they can add clarity but it should also
it'd be nice if it's also readable when
things are a bit blurry because there
many times when things aren't right next
to you they're over there there's food
smudged on your screen there's all kinds
of reasons why things are blurry and it
should be learnable and beautiful so
that's a lot of things i'm not going to
present a solution to that but I'm you
know in watching me try to do that I
hope maybe some of you will get inspired
by this problem and see some of the
obstacles and kind of interesting
problems from a machine learning point
of view that it raises okay so there's a
nice script here that I heard about talk
from talking to many people the first
was an intern who's Korean and said the
Korean is great and I said really and I
he was kind of suspicious but then I
talked some linguist and they're like
well you should look at Korean everyone
keeps telling me about this Korean
alphabet so and it's a neat neat story
too because one day the King just said
like you know look my court we've
designed this new script and we're
switching and you know cuz in general
it's hard to switch languages I mean
before computers you had to get there
was no point in switching your own
script unless you wanted to do like
steganography cryptography yeah I mean
you had to get other people to do it in
order to read and so the King just like
okay we're switching and um they
invented this very nice alphabet even
the shapes of the letters like reflect
how your
mouth is when you're pronouncing those
sounds and things like that it's very
simple and the simplicity of the
language translates into making it easy
to learn and actually into other things
like it's easy to type there's been
other studies when someone has a stroke
and they know Korean afterwards are
better off reading Korea and then if it
was English is somehow its deeper and
embedded in there is anyone here read
Korean many Koreans in the audience know
um anyway um I've heard that it's really
great I'm suspicious I've lost
suspicious there no career than the
audience oh yeah is it true he's Korean
really great I don't to put you on the
spot yes okay what what message here is
well yes I mean it's not that surprising
it you know a script that's engineered
might be better than a script that just
sort of randomly patched together now
let me show you sort of some of that oh
let me just draw an analogy to the
keyboard so we all know our qwerty
keyboard the one we usually use is
inspired by the typewriter and has a
history it's actually pretty you know
there's a story that it's not optimal
and then this guide where I came along
and invented this other keyboard which
is so much better turns out that this
one is optimized for something but it
turns out only to be about four percent
faster in IP does anyone here use the
Dvorak keyboard yeah we do have a dork
user all right great so you know that
means that they're probably million or
so or at least million users in the
world if we had one so that's pretty
good you know but I'm still it's not
that well often used on the other hand
there's this thing called shape writing
or people who swipe and all kinds of
variants and actually microsoft recently
you know their their mobile phone has
like it use a machine learning right so
they're machine learning is the best i
guess around and they set the Guinness
Book of World Records for the fastest
typing on the phone using this swype and
it uses a shape writing and uses machine
learning and now how many people here
use this anyone here use this kind of a
rating system yeah we have a more
getting a sense than that everyone is
into raising their hand yeah
but anyway I think there might be a
hundred million users or more for this
this this technology what is the message
so so you should go for a big win of
course if you have a small when you
people may not do it and of course it's
also good to be easy to learn actually
let me see okay first question how many
people are here okay okay good okay good
all right so I'm okay now let me ask if
this keyboard were let's say twice as
fast as the qwerty keyboard how many
people here would go through the trouble
to learn it depends but you can kind of
guess I mean you'd have to make your own
guess it depends of them but I got a lot
of hands that you can't see but like
maybe more than half so what that tells
me which is kind of interesting in it
I'm very interested to see that I was
curious is that actually the failure of
the Dvorak keyboard is not because it
was so hard to learn it's because it
didn't give you that Twight 2x speed up
right I mean sure it takes a long time
to learn and that's a big barrier but
actually even worse is the failure to be
a big win right if it were twice as fast
you know you guys are rational people we
spent a lot of time typing it makes
sense yeah it took me a week to get up
to speed or even longer it still might
be a big win over the years okay good so
okay so what do we have that that you
know our ancestors didn't have we have a
lot of things we have precision are you
know computer display or even laser
printer can print out things at very
high resolution potentially with color
if you want to use it or not it's up to
you with animation potentially these are
things that you know you would like the
language to be readable without them but
they can add a redundancy to make it
even more readable you know animation
can be very upsetting but it can also be
done nice it might be possibly subtle
and good interaction so how would use
interaction well you know maybe the
script is fairly clear for almost all
the words but when it's not clear you
could zoom in or you could somehow click
on something to make it more clear we
have big data Wow and you know
presumably people didn't have so much of
that in the past we have crowdsourcing
we have psycholinguistics we have so
many things but most important i think
is that we have the ability to create
these apps and plugins that people can
communicate with one another in the new
square
that you know in the past you would have
been able to do right if I had invented
the new script 100 years ago with like
good for you and you know you can write
notes to yourself and actually you know
people did Leonardo da Vinci had his own
thing and JRR tolkien created a script
of people learn them but it wasn't very
popular okay let's talk a little bit
about this is like an oversimplified
model of learning wow you guys are fast
I just gave this talk in Israel and took
a long time but anyway so people a lot
of people here raise their hand so it
says a please raise your hand if you
could read this sentence very good and
how are you doing that you know it turns
out is a lot of it is from the shape of
the word and it turns out it's harder to
read a sentence if the words are not
shaped like you're used to and that's
kind of an oversimplification but you
know even look at the text you know here
that I took from this picture I mean
we're all used to seeing this kind of
annoying text trying to understand you
know and things are blurry and what is
this and make it out and what you see or
the shape to these words so let's look
at this simplified model of reading for
a second and see how good is English
right now so you can look at the shape
of words and say okay there's some words
that are letters that are as tall
ascenders and there's some like like
down here and there's some letters that
are descenders that go below the line
and then there's the new neutral letters
that are just in the middle and you know
so if you just take a pattern say okay
three neutral letters well there's so
many words was can i er no take a
pattern like that okay can anyone think
of a word that fits that pattern what
any words what p red
go ahead i mean i'll wait you gotta do
it okay anything else wait what you good
that's the most likely word according to
my database that had it but he isn't
Thea's you know on your mind anything
else hmm yes yes a gun okay anyway yes
they continue so these are the words and
what about this I don't think there are
any I mean there's what hmm too low
words and then a tall one I could think
of a file format that fits this that i'm
using right now but that yeah powerpoint
but that wasn't in the database because
it was of movie subtitles anyway so
nothing really there's almost nothing in
that of that shape too bad okay so let's
let's think about what you want for from
a language may be a simple model would
be if you say okay let's say we picked a
word from our dictionary and then
predicted well then looked at its shape
so pick a word distributed like english
and then looked at its shape and then
said okay if we just saw the shape and
guess what's the most likely word how
often will be right or how often will be
wrong so let's say our ambiguity is how
often we'd be wrong so you pick a random
word from the dictionary and they say
okay I think it's take your best guess
just according to the distribution words
that fit that shape and say okay well
how often am i right so the error is
these you know you get it right for you
you'd get it right for was you get it
wrong for all leave what's your error
it's pretty easy to figure out for
english it's it's about half so half the
time you'd be right just from the shape
which is kind of interesting and then
you can do a little experiment so you if
you want to improve it let's just swap
two letters O and Q let's write every 0
as a cue and every cue is a no okay what
do I mean here here's what I mean can
you read this you can still read it okay
so what happens is you know this you and
yes no longer collide so we're no longer
we're getting yes right okay and we're
no longer getting yes wrong and we're no
longer getting all these like there were
tons of words in this category
cuz most letters are neutral so a lot of
them go on and now there's a word here
which is get know as we got so got and
get have no new shapes so it's you're
doing much better and you get ten
percent decrease already in the air so
just I'm doing I'm saying that's not
because I think there's like the most
realistic model of reading but shows you
that English is probably not optimized
right i mean it's coming from some kind
of ancient antiquity and you might say
well wow how did we get fifty percent
accuracy just from the shape well it's
probably many of you know there's IPPs
law or something that you know much of
the distribution is coming from a few a
small number of words right so just to
drive this point home i mean you might
say well here's a simple improvement you
could make english and this is not the
most radical or I don't know if we want
to but just to show you that it's not
optimal so take let's take this text
which is from Hemingway okay and let's
say you know these darn capital letters
let's get rid of the capital letters
let's just do something else with them
and keep them somehow lower case maybe
make them bold or underline asleep okay
cuz you know if you're a newcomer to
English you have to learn 26 lowercase
and 26 capital y okay so now we only
have 26 letters so we got rid of 26
let's add two more letters into the
language let's add a letter for the word
though okay I'll make it a theta why not
and then let's add a word for and which
I'll make is an ampersand okay so you
could try reading this in the late
summer that your wheelhouse across the
river and the plane to the mountain so
you know you can read it I mean you're
probably gonna be slower reading this
then you would be this but it's also
more compact but just I don't know I
don't know how long it would take you to
get faster I actually suspect you be
eventually faster at reading this
because you can fit more information in
your phobia and the little part of your
eye that high resolution and you can see
more words at once and your ID does is
you know they studied reading amazingly
does it dance across the page in the
more words you can see in the small area
the faster you go but anyway then of
course you should switch the O's in the
cues and then but my point is there
there's maybe a lot of room for
optimization so I want people to to get
excited about this potential problem and
another thing that you see here is that
yeah I did this in stages right I first
replaced the you could imagine a nap
that if it's doing this you know each
day it gives you a new word or something
so you'll have to learn and sit and
study for a long time you already know
how to really show its boots drop off
your ability to read English let's keep
your reading normally and then you know
gradually introduce things one at a time
for any approach not just for this one
okay so here's something that's also
very exciting which is that so you know
I said okay in English there were three
clusters of words the tall the medium in
the low what if you optimize okay so if
you optimize and you have only two
clusters of words you can match the
performance of English just with two
clusters you split them up somehow
because all the vowels in English are in
the same cluster if you have three
clusters you can do even better you get
down to thirty percent error and for the
language that I'm going to talk about
this essentially is there's binary
patterns there's seven patterns not
eight because one of them is all empty
you get down to two percent error so
just from the patterns of which cells
are are full or not you know I mean in
English you have you sort of break it up
into these cells so you you know we've
only used these three patterns but you
could use other patterns you can have
that all all of them there's seven
patterns that you could use so if you
use all of them and then you ignore this
color distinction you can get down to
two percent error so that's a big
savings compared to fifty percent error
sort of just reading the shape i mean
the inspiration of that one is just
let's just directly read from shape
alone let's ignore all the other stuff
so but there's a lot to think about when
you want to optimize this both for
ambiguity so this is not an optimal
assignment of the alphabet because oh
and you are the same except you switch
red and black and it doesn't feel right
i mean the shape alone is not enough
then so you know this is a great shape
for the word you let's say but um it's
not great in the sense that in many
words oh and like you know I don't know
if you look at sort of be blank t or you
know but but that many times the vowels
can be interchanged so you don't have a
and you looking the same or very similar
so you don't want to just have them be a
permutation you don't have to remember
exactly where the red is in order to
read this where you just want to look at
the shape and get it so that's why the
two percent figure is nice because if
you optimize the alphabet you can get
down so you just look at the shape and
ninety-eight percent of time you're
right ignoring the red and black
distinction let's look at some languages
here so take some languages of the world
in Israel I learned an interesting fact
that apparently they say that there's a
call out from some people who read
Arabic saying it's very hard to read and
they're looking for a new script so that
might be a great target audience for
this if they're actually looking for a
new script but because it's hard to
distinguish these and subtleties there's
differences between these languages and
you can do things to them you can make
them smaller and animal film can read
well you guys can't read from Victor but
anyway um you can make it bigger again
and see how do they look after you make
them smaller and then bigger and some of
them lose a lot of form and some of them
maintain more you can make it really
small and then big again and you know of
course this one almost by design will
keep it a lot of its information at
least compared to the other ones some of
you may know that depending on the
program you're using the way they
actually make things small is they use a
sub pixel accuracy and play with the
colors of the pixels a bit exam okay
anyway all so blurry you can look at the
blurry performance of things and I don't
know for me I'm colorblind I don't even
see the difference between the red and
stuff on my screen I do but something
here I don't can you guys see any red in
there or not okay good so um you know
different people will use different
fonts than or whatever is fine so as I
said so you can't optimize it down to
the two percent level and then you get
some different assignment but it may be
ugly with words that are you know holy
that how lots of holes and depending on
your aesthetic you may not like it you
may not like the shapes that come out so
so really and what I'm saying is it sort
of in experiments I do I just teach
people seven letters on Mechanical Turk
because it's easier to learn than
alphabet with seven letters you make
tons of words and you know if you assign
one assignment of the letters you'll
have very blocky letters here and
another one you'll have letters with
holes in them so really you have to
figure out something that's both
aesthetic and unambiguous and so if you
ask people you know what shapes do you
like I can just go on some crowdsourcing
platform and ask people and they seem to
give reasonable answers I think and then
which I don't have time to go into
detail but you can try to learn a model
for what people like right
and you could try to optimize your
alphabet for combination of being
unambiguous a clear and you know
readable in essence and aesthetic I need
to do that because I have a terrible
sense in design but maybe a designer
could just write a function for what is
a nice-looking letter I'll be
interesting too so I think you know you
can sort of what you know I basically
how did I get all those numbers I forget
to mention is I run I just for the end
of this ambiguity or the ambiguity
number i just run a simulated annealing
algorithm it kind of blows right through
the 26 letters and so here you can also
you know you're just looking for a
permutation so here you can do the same
to try to optimize it and you know
people seem to prefer red but you could
you know put in your own preferences and
say oh I don't want to have too many
holes I don't have this and whatever you
could design your own alphabet however
you like so I did experiments where I
would show people words and then I would
ask them whether they liked them I would
also ask them if they have seen that
word in the past it's like a control to
see whether they're paying attention or
not and it was actually fun and that
data could be useful to and as a we saw
in the last talked um and then you
generated features for these things and
tried to fit the data and I'm anyway I'm
not convinced that I have the best
results yet but I think there's a lot of
room for generating myself a bit last
thing I want to mention is that there's
been a lot of work on input systems and
of course it's natural that that's a
pain point that you all feel right
because you're fast at typing on the
computer slow at typing on your phone so
you feel like I wish I can type faster
you don't feel any pain with reading but
maybe there's still a room for
improvement but the ideal I mean we
think 20 years down the line you know
100 years as long as let's say we're not
you know communicating by telepathy then
probably you would hope that we have
some kind of input system and reading
system which are nicely coordinated when
you write when used to write with a pen
it was very naturally connected to the
way you read you wrote the shape now
when you type its third from the left
button in the middle it gives you this
shape and there's some kind of
disconnect I feel and it we need to have
an input system which is much more
efficient and coordinated with the
output system and like you know there's
this old idea of the core chorded
keyboard where you type you know
multiple fingers at the time that for
example would pair nicely with this that
script the other inputs make pair nicely
with other visualizations of
down the line I think if you need to
think of a combination so basically you
know the doors are open to any kind of
wacky ideas people have 44 different
letters and you know I've talked about
the different things you have to
optimize which are sort of you want to
be readable not ambiguous quickly
readable and you wanted to be pretty and
I think it's a super fun problem
involving machine learning design
potentially crowdsourcing and also hv i
thank you I think how do you this one
fan out like each of those dots I would
tell you how the question is how would
you type with these dots potential I
mean the old light there's this whole
idea of a chorded keyboard which goes
back many years and the idea there is
you push down fingers simultaneously so
you could have three dots three fingers
you know and you have extra fingers for
space or your back space with but and
you could maybe push down harder for
black or red I'm not you know that's not
my strength but you could imagine that
you're on the side of your phone you're
actually typing by pushing on the side
of your phone somebody actually built
one of these for regular English and
then you don't have to use up all the
screen space for the keyboard you just
unless you need a special punctuation
you just type boy could do in your
packet um so you a beard few question to
be a long line with you over mathematics
is a condensed language right is it a
mathematic notation yeah I mean it's
pretty much there whether you want to
reach I mean looking at the formula yeah
here's a lot of things that already can
capture with a single gaze yes right and
what how we compare mathematical
notation with where you want to go I was
apparently mathematical notation
ambiguity I get to do this project yeah
yeah you could try to design a new
script for math I mean there's different
and another thing that comes to mind is
late tech right that's one way of
representing a formula but I don't
certainly and yeah I mean you could try
to design a new script for math you know
if you if your computer can translate
between this and the old one
feel like there's a lot of opportunities
and you can also try to help I think
there's probably been some work on
helping people are dyslexic there's
there's a bunch of areas that you could
work on I feel like there's a big area
which is just reading you know for
normal English but certainly you could
do it in any of the other areas as well
but i'm not sure if i totally got your
question questions to say Gary there may
be really fast for years come back here
yes he read a book and today see papa
but now is there evidence that the
bottleneck is sort of how fast your
drink usually how fast you were taking
it right between say readers and
infinitely assesses app to meet ya there
was a there have been studies sort of
where they found that the bottleneck was
actually the processing for some people
of just the processing it wasn't the
reading but so so in that sense I'm
personally a little more interested in
the question of fitting more and in a
smaller space comfortably than in and it
may I mean I don't know I don't know
maybe for some people it would and for
others wouldn't right maybe some people
are already up there peak speed but
maybe for your sister right you know she
would be all like like yes and there may
be different alphabets are different
scripts that work better for some people
in other that that's a super interesting
and as far as I know it hasn't totally
been worked out which was kind of weird
yeah I came over the end of it maybe sun
else knows but i recently saw a website
that was advertising the idea that
Prince instant yeah right ok so imagine
the shapes this allowing doubt to work
even faster yeah let me just put up with
it seems like it should yeah if you
become fluent in the language my second
question is how fluent are you in any of
these or two oh yeah so spritz of this
thing and as a joke I put up like you
know imagine reading your email in this
way so spritz might be so spritzes you
guys can read that and imagine trying to
read your email which would be painful
because you don't want to read your
email linearly you want to scan through
your email you don't want to read it but
but it might be good for reading a book
on your watch
anyway um yes I don't know I mean it
could be it's super interesting and when
you look delve into the science of
reading it's super interesting to see
how they do it in how the eye works but
yeah I may work read differently these
weird blocky shapes if I may read them a
little differently than it reads the
other letter so people have done a lot
of work how how eyes read certain
languages and they've done a lot of
local optimization Amish intervention
local optimization on the letters a lot
of optimization making a beautiful but
like this other stuff I don't know it's
a good question how animation would help
I don't know almost like Morse code oh
where you design the letters you are
using red color and black color together
I believe if i write it on the paper is
very hard to hear how are you yes why'd
you eat the color you don't have to it
was just an example of using some
technology you could do it all with
black I mean you could have some system
where you know i don't know if i write
it with a circle and annexin a no or
something x means red and neck homie you
see what i mean i could translate it to
different shapes or something and you
might want to do any way to add
redundancy so that you could exactly for
that reason so that you could write it
on paper nicely so that's a good point
that you might want something which is
easy to write on paper think also you
want something which is easy to type and
but my first prior and I'm not thinking
of this is replacing English by any
means so probably people write regular
English is just for those small fraction
of users who are interested in reading
faster and learn this alternate script
then they can also read
