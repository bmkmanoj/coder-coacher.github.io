hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
so our final speaker is Tony hey and I
feel disadvantaged because he had a copy
of my biography when he introduced me
and I don't have a copy of his but he
will say he's written a totally cool
book he's got a draft of there and the
only problem with it if you look at it
right now you'll be so distracted you
won't listen to his talk but otherwise
Tony hey thanks very much okay so I was
trying to think of something to
entertain you so I thought I would title
my title something that you might not
unheard of which is the third age of
computing which is an idea from Butler
Lamson if I can get this to work okay so
third age of computing so I'll come to
that so the outline for the talk is I
should explain the right I come from CMU
Northwest right because we haven't
peterlee we had Rick lash it of course
we now have peter lee in jeannette and
just this week i learnt that harry shum
who actually is a lung from here is now
coming back to be Peter Lee's boss in
the in the research and technology
division so we have good connections
with CMU as you all know so what I
wanted to say first of all was a little
bit about computational thinking if you
like applied to science which was what
Jim Gray was doing it was actually using
you know Vance computer science
techniques to help scientists who were
drowning in data and that was where it
came from and so i'll talk about Jim's
idea of the fourth paradigm and I used
to do a science and I'll explain and
what I think that is but then I'll end
with some words about the future which i
think the cloud will be in your future
machine learning pertinent will be in
your future and i'll i'll end with a
sort of explanation of what butler but
those
grand sweep of computing so I mean
you've seen all these things data of all
types yes we have lots of data for for
commercial transactions and under all
these things and Twitter feeds and
mining those is extremely important
search data and so on for commercial
companies but also it's also true in the
sciences now you have satellites and you
have high throughput gene sequencing the
problem is now not that we can take ages
sequencing one human but with all have
our Dean's sequence very rapidly and the
problem will then become of getting
interesting facts and interesting useful
stuff from all that data and that's
that's the challenge in almost every
field of science environmental science
biological science and anywhere you look
at particle physics astronomy and so on
so if you look in bing a good search
engine which I'm sure you were all
familiar with because I know that my
family are one of the few uses of being
in Europe but in the u.s. it is used a
fair amount and I look up data scientist
you find that computer scientists have
good employment because data scientists
the hottest job you haven't heard of the
role of the future what is the data site
so there's a whole whole literature this
was some some weeks ago so distilling
about what is a data scientist in our
e-science workshop we had in chicago a a
year ago we had two sessions on data
science one was given by computer
scientists and it was exactly what you'd
expect that machine laning data analysis
and so on and the other one was given by
librarians information scientists and it
was all about data stewardship how you
look after the data how you capture the
provenance and how you do the metadata
and all that sort of stuff and in fact
it involves all three of these and
rarely were the data scientists have all
these skills so data science is a rather
large area and it covers things from
information
science will be the iSchool movement
today to analysis state machine learning
and so on to actually go in getting the
data reducing it down to something
useful so that was I think what Jim was
trying to get at and started working
with scientists I think in the 1990s he
started working with astronomy because
they had datasets which were larger than
the biggest relational data sets you had
in in commercial practice at the time
that's not true now but it was then and
he wanted to extend sequel server play
with the web services and things like
that and he chose astronomy because they
were drowning in data and the data was
of absolutely no commercial value so you
could actually do things with it you can
analyze it and play with it so Jim came
up with the idea of the fourth paradigm
so I'm sure you most of you heard about
this now thousands of years ago we've
been doing experimental sciences you
know making measurements of the stars
and things since the Egyptians and so on
and since the days of Galileo Maxwell we
condense much of that into laws of
nature and then you can explore those
theoretically i used to be a theoretical
physicist so you can actually explore
that analyze it in various situations
make predictions for experiment which
you can go and do and those have been
the traditional two ways of doing
experimental and theoretical paradigms
for doing science and they're the way
that have served us very well for
hundreds of years but in the 1950s of
course we invented digital computers and
that enables you to do different things
and Ken Wilson who won the Nobel Prize
the particle physics in the 70s called
computational science the third paradigm
because it enabled you to explore
situations that you couldn't do
experiments you can't do experiments on
climate change well we are doing one but
it's only one that's would like to
understand what the drivers of climate
change and so on can you do galaxy
formation and then
and black hole collisions and things
like that so computational science looks
at different things and to do that you
need to teach people teach graduate
students different skills they need to
know about algorithms they need to know
about new medical methods they need to
know that in particular high-performance
parallel systems and how to program in
parallel on those systems as you heard
from guy so a different set of skills it
doesn't replace theory and experiment
but it's it's a new way of exploring
science what Jim was was seeing in the
last decade was the emergence of a third
set of a new set of skills or fourth set
of skills if you like for data-intensive
science so you have these throughput
instruments you have simulations and
supercomputers which generate petabytes
of data you have sensor networks which
generate huge amounts of data coming in
data from all sides are overwhelming
scientists and what they need to do is
to know how to manage this data and so
when I was doing a complementary side to
this e science was if you like the set
of tools that enable you to manage this
data for analysis and data mining for
data visualization and for exploitation
but also collaborating scholarly
communication disseminating preserving
and so on so a whole set of tools is
needed for that which the community has
been constructing over the last ten
years and I anticipate in another 10
years we won't talk about e science
because those tools which embody a lots
of computer science will just become the
standard way of doing science so ii
science will become science and so this
is an interim phase but i think these
these paradigms are genuine and that
students who are doing data intensive
science need to know about a different
set of skills they need to know how to
manage a petabyte this is this is jim's
slide from jim's talk that was too he
talked about feels like biology has
computational biology which is doing
simulations of molecules and so on but
also bioinformatics which is actually am
aizen genomic data for example similarly
with chemistry computational chemistry
camera informatics and now you see many
feels like I'm going to a meeting next
week in Australia on Astro informatics
for example so there's there's there's
new types of fields the emerging because
of this deluge of data which we need to
get to information to knowledge and so
this is Jim's slide the generic problem
you have huge amounts of data how to use
classified what's a schemer for the most
people in science don't know what a
schema is how you organize it may have
to reorganize it how you share it query
and so on so these are different sets of
skills that graduate students actually
need to know to function as a data
scientist and these are part computer
science but but Alex solid claims you
need to generate not not t-shaped people
who know depth in one area and only a
little bit across other areas you need
he says pie-shaped people so you need
people to have a depth of knowledge of
computer science but you also needed
people who have a depth of knowledge of
a particular domain so this is what Jim
was talking about in terms of his fourth
paradigm you see it in many places now
this is a professor at Santa Barbara
Jeff dossier who studies snow it's
interesting because of climate changed
that the snow line in the Cascades is
going up a meter a year and that means
there'll be less water stored in the
mountains for the summer and that they
more runoff in winter so there be more
floods and they'll be less water in the
summer so it's really bad news and this
is actually how in order to make
conclusions you have to combine data set
some all sorts of different areas and
try and investigate and analyze so it's
a very interesting article showing the
need for actually combining data using
machine learning using computer science
tools to make serious predictions and
estimations with errors of the future of
in this case Mountain hydrology
hydrology is gone that water is going to
be a major major driver in the next 50
years so a mini science was about the
tools that you need to go and support
this data life cycle from acquisition
from collaboration analysis data mining
to publishing it and finally to
archiving some of it that's the paper
and the data so Jim's vision was that
what we should construct and what's the
goal of science including computer
sciences that you have some literature
and from the literature which is all
open access so it's actually available
in full text and that's what the the
open access movement and the the White
House announcement that came in February
requiring government federally funded
research to make their papers available
full text without a pay wall after a
certain period of embargo so from the
literature you can go to the data so one
of them my goals is in in Microsoft
Research Cambridge George gontier solves
the four-color premium theorem using
theorem proving tools been solved by
mathematicians before and so this is
proof there's associated data similarly
with sense with your paper there's
associated data and what Jim wanted to
do is to be able to go from the
literature to the data to add some data
of your own you antum analysis and you
get new papers new data and and you
publish it and you get to the data and
his whole belief was that you could
increase what he called the scientific
information velocity and having worked
with many different communities of
science over the years it's quite clear
there's a huge amount of inefficiencies
in the way we do it and talking to David
Lipman who is at the NCBI the NIH of
people who look after the National
Library of Medicine he does pubmed
central I mean the reproducibility of
results in biology nowadays life
sciences is really very scary I mean
there was a study by Amgen look 253
papers published
science and nature they were only able
to reproduce seven of them so a lot of
things we need to do to make this
efficient more effective to solve the
problems of climate change at least
understand the problems of climate
change to solve problems of Demyx and
diseases and things like that so that's
computer science computational thinking
applied to science and I think there is
a real role for computer scientists at
least teaching people their skills or
actually working with scientists to go
and find solve some of their problems
and that's what Jim was doing um what
the future well I'll just pick up three
things which I think will be important
the cloud machine learning and conclude
so you must be aware that universities
are building clouds they're not the same
as what Google and Microsoft and of
Amazon would call clouds where they have
hundreds of thousands of cause in huge
data centers which are next to
hydroelectric plants and you know very
carefully cooled but everybody's now
using this cloud paradigm and Microsoft
for example these data centers in the US
linked by hype high performance high
bandwidth all over the world and you get
when you store data in the data center
you get three copies here but you also
get three copies in the data center so
you have redundancy and actually it's
becoming a very useful model for
industry and many of the fortune 500
companies are now using clouds routinely
in academia it's been you know much
slower academics like to have their own
cluster or their own super computer or
whatever and so I do believe it'll come
I've been slightly frustrated in that
not many people run on Windows clusters
I'm well aware of that coming from
computer science department and physics
but actually what I this year
Microsoft's cloud now supports Linux
Python Java usual sort of tools that you
find it in the computer science
department and and in science
departments so I
now believe it's possible to do
interesting stuff on infrastructure as a
service on on the Microsoft cloud so we
actually do have an initiative now as
your for research and you can apply for
a significant amount of time in a zero
for free and you can go in light a short
proposal a couple of pages or something
like that and it's analyzed every few
months and we try and make awards so if
you're interested me or Harold can tell
you more about that and machine learning
which is the topic of this afternoon is
really important I actually think
parallelism machine learning is is even
more important but that's another issue
but we all know computers are great for
indexing the whole web Microsoft Google
and other people do it really but what
you need to do is computers to help us
do things automatically in in PubMed
which is where the abstracts in the life
sciences have put in the National
Library of Medicine there were two
abstracts of papers deposited in PubMed
every minute of the year and there's no
way you can keep up with that so you
need actually help to target to alert
you to interesting things to make
influences you may be looking for
something but the computer understands
what you're looking for and can actually
go and say well wouldn't you find this
more interesting and so on so these are
the sort of ideas and and and operations
you need computers to help you do and
the combination of these things is
extremely powerful I was interested to
find out that when you speak into Syria
on your apple or a microsoft phone you
do you speak in what happens is that
actually the processing can't be done on
the phone the machine learning to
actually do the speech recognition it
got up and is done in the cloud and
comes back to you in less than a second
so it's remarkable that we can actually
go and speak into a phone and you get
the answer but the computation the heavy
lifting machine learning has all been
done up into
with deep nets which is now what
everybody's looking at has been done in
the cloud so I think this is an example
this is just you know a phone example
but you can imagine all sorts of
different examples both in science and
in in commerce and and in everyday life
where you can use the power of the cloud
to turn a small device without much
processing power into something really
powerful so that is at least some of the
topics for this afternoon so to conclude
then what's the Third Age of computing
well there's a paper by Butler lampson
called what computers do model connect
engage what he says every 30 years
there's a new wave of things that
computers do so he analyzes the nineteen
fifteen nineteen eighty what computers
did was compute they did simulations
like you know initially the first the
ENIAC was used to simulate a model for a
hydrogen bomb for example just to be
concrete you can read all about it in
the book and around nineteen eighty
people we had the the ARPANET the
internet and in 1990 we had the web so
people were beginning to understand the
power of computers now the computers
have shrunk to mobile devices handheld
devices and so on for communication so
for the next thirty years we've been
exploring the use of computers with
their power in connected devices so
that's what Butler calls the second age
of computing so simulation communication
and what's happening now is that we're
using computers in new ways artificial
intelligence is one of them Augmented
human intelligence is another Butler
causing the embodiment it's computers
acting on your behalf taking decisions
that are useful to you helping you find
things you need for example you all seen
these this is ads on television for BMW
and Mercedes where the car breaks in an
accident before you do it actually acts
on your behalf and does something useful
so
computers then have begun to engage with
the physical world in non-trivial ways
and there's huge ways of doing that and
that really is i think where we are now
that we have these sort of three ways we
spent 30 years learning different ways
of computing in all the most generality
and then be connected them all on me but
new ways of doing things in
communicating connected computers and
now we're actually being intelligence in
there in its weak AI sense as opposed to
strong AI and isn't is now giving
computers new powers and systems which
are going to be really exciting and
that's I think is the topic for this
afternoon and for me it's really
exciting and understanding how you can
get things which are simulating in more
and more intelligence are clearly going
to be really important and so I leave
you with this my son did a PhD at
berkeley he got infected in the bay area
with startup fever so he's gone back to
London to do a start-up so at the age of
34 I'm still supporting him I'm hope i'm
hoping one of these days he'll support
me you never know but so he has a thing
which he calls sketch nations it covers
all sorts of things this is one he did
about Big Data machine learning and the
cloud gives informed intelligent
decisions and that really is what
industry want what people want informed
intelligent decisions so I think this
combination if you want to find out more
about these things you can go to sketch
/ nation's com you can find out when
you're doing exercise that the body uses
can absorb about a cup of water every 15
minutes the rest is surplus and all
sorts of random facts but this is one on
machine learning so think this is the
topic for this afternoon and I think
I've said enough so thank you very much
