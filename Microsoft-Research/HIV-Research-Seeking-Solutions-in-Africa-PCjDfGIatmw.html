was completely unprepared I had no idea
of the extent of the epidemic it was
staggering every year 1.8 million people
died of HIV and if you do the math
that's five thousand people a day
before I started working on HIV I was
working on spam filtering I actually
invented the spam filter the first thing
that happened when we invented the spam
filter was that spammers started working
around our filter one of the problems
with HIV is that it's continuously
evolve when I came to HIV it was sort of
the same thing we had our mune systems
like a spam filter trying to block HIV
and then HIV mutating to get around the
immune system so we had the idea let's
do the same thing let's go after the
Achilles heel moon HIV
my name is purity I live in south africa
in this particular part of south africa
among young women the infection rates go
from less than 1% at age 15 to almost
two-thirds of the women being infected
by the age of 22 or 23 i dogged man was
over
usually people told us that if you
hiv-positive be dead
so first of all we want to find out
where our immune system is attacking HIV
and we do this with a program that we've
developed called file OD and so what
we're doing is cataloguing these
fragments of HIV that are vulnerable to
attack by the immune system there's so
much data being generated that it
requires massive computing power if you
were to do these computations on a
single machine it would take years but
at Microsoft we have thousands of
thousands of machines that can work in
parallel to get the job done and we do
it in a matter of hours so when David
send me the results of the computations
in an excel sheet it has reduced the
huge data set to 20 significant
observation so I now know where to start
with my research in the lab I think we
knew T of that collaboration is that he
has the knowledge and can adapt the
programs f me neither
if somebody was able to create an
affection I think that will be grateful
for the whole world yeah so I've done a
lot of collaborations in my life but
this one with HIV is very special I
firmly believe this is a solvable
problem and I and many other people have
devoted our careers to this and we're
going to continue working on it until we
succeed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
