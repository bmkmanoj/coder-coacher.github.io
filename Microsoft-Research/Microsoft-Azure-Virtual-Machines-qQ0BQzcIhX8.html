virtual machines well look at the
different kinds of VM types that are
available in Azure talk about the
different kinds of disks and images and
then we'll walk through an example where
we see how easy it is to create a new
virtual machine that contains popular
libraries for data analysis there are a
couple of ways to get a virtual machine
up and running on the cloud and we're
first going to look at cloud first
provisioning what this means is that we
build and configure a machine in the
cloud it does not exist as a separate
physical machine anywhere beforehand
there are three ways to do this you can
build it by clicking through the azure
management portal or you can write a
script to do it either on Windows or on
other operating systems finally you can
write a program which calls the azure
rest api s once your choice of
provisioning is made you will need to
select the image and instant size to
start from the newly created disk will
be stored in Azure blob storage service
and your machine will boot while we
stress that Windows Azure does not only
run Windows vns it does of course run
Windows servers very well windows server
runs great on it and many very popular
Microsoft applications like SharePoint
and sequel server also work on Azure
right out of the box when you run
windows server on Azure you can run
Active Directory DNS facts print and
document services is and many other
services for more information on the
Microsoft server products that are
supported on Azure please consult the
hyperlink shown in the slide only
certain distributions of Linux are
officially supported Susa enterprise 11
service pack 2 opensuse 12.1 sent OS 6.2
and a bun to 12 point 0 for virtual
machine images of these distributions
are provided by partners for experts in
each other distributions of Linux can be
installed as bring your own linux
however some integration work will be
needed for all of these supported
windows and linux servers virtual
machine images are available in the
azure gallery which is available from
the new vm creation portion of the azure
portal
virtual machines can be allocated in a
variety of sizes the ones displayed here
are just the list available as of this
video but new and larger ones are being
constantly added now let's take a look
at the actual process of virtual machine
creation in the azure portal after
clicking the big new button at the
bottom you're presented with a menu that
looks like this select the virtual
machine item and then you can see the
option to create a virtual machine from
the gallery when you select from gallery
we're taken to this screen on the left
is a menu so you can filter down the
list of images or look at all the images
that are available the middle section of
the image gallery displays a list of
images that you can create and store in
Windows Azure the my images section on
the far left can be populated by
capturing an existing windows as your
virtual machine using Susa studio to
build a migrated image or uploading your
own virtual machine as I'll explain
later by selecting platform images we
are presented with a list of just
operating systems by selecting a
particular OS of interest we get a
description of it after you select the
image you want you assign a name to the
virtual machine specify a size and
create the administrators login name and
password for Windows operating system or
specify the authentication method for
Linux operating system some platform
images have minimum size recommendations
noted in the image description another
place to get virtual machines is the vm
depot this is a microsoft operated but
user-contributed repository of virtual
machine images because disks are an
important aspect of how virtual machines
work will take a little time to talk
about them and their configuration on
Windows Azure here's a screenshot of a
running Windows virtual machine you can
see that there is an OS disk which
serves as the C Drive this appears to
the virtual machine as a SATA disk that
is persistent across reboots of the vm
there is also a D Drive labeled
temporary storage this is also a SATA
disk but it is not persistent this means
that if the vm powers down and then
powers up the data stored there will be
lost however the disk is local to the
virtual machine meaning that it has a
very fast connection there can then be
any number of data disks attached to the
machine these are stored in the Azure
blob service and are persistent however
they appear as scuzzy and not as SATA
drives there are some important
differences between the OS disk and data
disks as highlighted on the slide data
disks are larger than the OS disk and
can be added and removed without
rebooting the system but they cannot be
imaged also for tuning system
performance the cache behavior of the OS
disk is probably preferable as I
mentioned earlier the OS disk and the
data disks for your virtual machine are
stored in the azure storage service this
means that not only is the data
persistent across reboots but also they
inherently share the same intrinsic
benefits of anything that uses as your
storage they are highly durable being
replicated three times within a data
center and then another three times in a
second geographically distinct data
center now let's look in more detail at
virtual machine images themselves so far
we've talked about disks for the virtual
machine and the various types of them an
image is a different kind of thing
images are base operating systems which
can be cloned and then start up as new
virtual machines they have been sis
prepped and cleaned and can only be
created by uploaded by capturing a disk
however is a container for data that is
exposed into the running virtual machine
you can upload your own virtual hard
drive file and mount that as a data disc
or you can create new ones during
virtual machine creation one of the nice
things about VM images is that you can
then transport a machine from your
facility into the cloud one of the key
benefits of infrastructure as a service
is flexibility and control the windows
azure solution provides the capability
of not only moving vhd s to the cloud
but also allows you to copy the vht s
back down and run it locally or on
another cloud provider this is great for
testing out production issues or any
other need where we require a copy of
the production server another use case
is when you already have a golden image
your institution uses for server
provisioning or you have a vm running on
premises that you would just like to run
in the azure data center first you
upload the vhd to a storage account from
there use the portal to add it as an
image if it's already been sysprep or as
a disk if it's a pre-configured vm then
you can spin up one or more virtual
machines using it the azure vm gallery
is really the easiest way to get up and
running with new virtual machines on
azure these are pre-configured high
quality virtual machine images which
have been built by Microsoft and
partners the azure portal assists the
creation and configuration of new
machines by grabbing information like
SSH keys and assisting with proper drive
provisioning however as you're also
supports very well the use cases of
customers that want to bring their own
linux the customer is responsible for
creating their own linux image and
capturing the configuration
appropriately it's important to note
that the OS must be running under a
hyper-v virtual machine if you're using
VMware the vmdk file can be converted
using Microsoft Virtual Machine
converter now let's walk through
creating a simple virtual machine using
the vm depot this machine will include a
variety of popular data analysis tools
like our studio and python we will look
at provisioning the Machine configuring
it and ultimately we will demonstrate
connecting to a running ipython notebook
instance on our new VM the image for
virtual machine is stored in the vm
depot the vm depot is a library of
open-source virtual machine images that
the online community has contributed you
can browse the depot and start new
virtual machine based on an image you
find there or you can add your own image
to the vm depot to share with others
although the vm depot site is maintained
by microsoft microsoft does not manage
screen or provide support for the
contributed images to access the depot
you can browse the web site at vm depot
ms open tech comm here we can see there
are many images created by users and
upload it to the vm depot the one we're
interested in it for this
video is the azure data analysis one
clicking on the image title takes us to
more detailed information page about the
image including a list of which regions
it's available in and the endpoints that
are available in the image once it's
created another way to browse the vm
Depot is via the azure management portal
here I've signed into the portal and
I've clicked on the virtual machines tab
on the left I can click the images link
at the top and now I can see there's a
link for browse vm depot at the bottom
clicking on this brings up a UI within
the azure management portal that lists
the same images as on the web page will
scroll down to as your data analysis and
we can see the same information here to
actually add to this image to our
account we click the next button and now
we can specify the region we want to
copy it into and the storage account to
use by clicking the check mark we will
start the copy of the image note that
this particular image is very large and
we'll take it roughly 20 to 30 minutes
to copy we can see the copy begins and
will take a little while here's another
copy of the image I've made before once
the image is finished copying we simply
need to register it with our account and
now we can actually create new virtual
machines using this image to do so we
simply click new virtual machine from
gallery and on the left under my images
will see the name of the image we just
copied first we need to enter a virtual
machine name then we choose the size of
machine we want we create then the user
name and a password now it's very
important for us to remember to write
down the username and password or stored
in a password manager if we forget these
there's no way for Microsoft to retrieve
them and we must reset the virtual
machine this next pain sets up a simple
cloud service for this virtual machine
it's okay if you don't know exactly what
a cloud service is they're not really
the topic of this video so I won't say
too much about them except that they're
a way to create dynamic scalable web
services using as your VMS and as
infrastructure since these are built
using VMs this pane appears here in our
case we're just spinning up a single
note of as your data analysis vm so we
can create a new cloud service we need
to ensure that our cloud service name is
unique within the cloud app net domain
and also we should make sure that the
region is the same as where the image is
located by default the only endpoint
defined on this virtual machine is the
ssh one we need to add a few more
in order to play with the spark and
shark project we need to add a mapping
for a port 4040 now we can click the
checkmark and azure will start creating
a virtual machine we can see that the
provisioning process is started and
after a few minutes the dashboard will
show the status as running now our
virtual machine is running we'll use
putty to ssh into it the address we put
in is the same as well we typed in
during the vm configuration we can also
see the hostname here
the username and password is the same
that we can figure it as well in the vm
configuration wizard great now we're
logged in what we can do is start the
ipython notebook on this machine and
connect to it with our web browser
ipython was already installed on this
image ok let's use your browser and
navigate to it now we have to use HTTPS
and we'll click here to accept the self
signed certificate and continue to the
website now the password that I Python
notebook is expecting is the one that
was created by the folks that created
this VM in this case it is capital e el
asta CL 0 UD 123 a claw elastic cloud
one two three and now we're in we can
create a new notebook and then start
evaluating Python code in ipython
notebook to execute the cell we hit
shift enter
and here we have an inline plot from
matplotlib now let's go back to putty
and reset our password will shut down
the server and we can start a Python
import the ipython module and run the
passer function and now we'll enter our
new password now we need to copy this
password value the hash value and we
need to edit the file user dot ipython
profile n/p server the notebook config
pi and down here where it says notebook
password we need to put the new password
value that we generated and now we'll
exit and save and our notebook server
will start with this new password we've
created now i use the nano editor but
you can use whatever text editor you
would like that is installed on this vm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
