simulator is the ability to simulate
some fairly complex circuitry on a
classical machine now this is something
that in general is very hard the naive
numbers scale very poorly that if I had
32 qubits I need to to the 32nd
locations in memory to store the state I
need an input state an output state and
then I need a matrix that's 2 to the
32nd by 2 30 second to actually operate
on the state we can do much better than
that and liquid is really good at
optimizing for the classical machine
we're able to do things you can't do on
a quantum computer because we're
classical so we take advantage of that
as we're running simulations so if you
naively first write your circuit and run
it on the system without doing anything
you will get exactly how the quantum
computer would operate on it but since
this is linear algebra we can take many
tricks that you could use in linear
algebra to speed up the classical
machine in one example we can just take
every circuit and take these gates that
talk to one or two cubits and combine
them together into bigger and bigger
matrices a single matrix operation
instead of doing hundreds of them can be
much more efficient on the classical
machine and liquid knows how to trade
these off we can get many orders of
magnitude speed up in the simulation of
a quantum system by optimizing the
linear algebra this is one of the main
things that happens when you call the
grow gates routine that's in the API and
is also documented and an example is
shown in the tutorial that is available
on video on this website so walking
through that will show you how to write
a simple algorithm play with the
algorithm and then optimize it to make
it run a little faster this is also how
we run Shor's algorithm so much faster
if you take the final argument and
change it from a false to a true the
true says optimize the circuit and when
you optimize the circuit you'll find it
runs two to three orders of magnitude
faster on the bigger factoring problems
there's a second version also part of
grow gates that understands physical
simulation so for doing quantum
chemistry or quantum materials we can
take advantage of things we know about
the problem not just the linear algebra
for example every time we apply a gate
the number of electrons don't change in
the chemical therefore we can take
advantage of that and only keep the
lines or if you will the lines of the
matrix or the pieces of the state that
have that number of electrons we also
know that while we're sitting there the
number of electrons that are spin up and
the numbers spin down don't change so we
can get rid of every place where they
would change this winds up compressing
problems in quantum chemistry down to
very small sizes so for example when you
solved water which is built into the
samples h2o would normally take 32,000
by 32,000 matrix to describe the
operation when you do all of these
compressions the system becomes 441 by
441 it's a tiny matrix we can now work
on that entire problem as one matrix we
can exponentiate it we can solve it and
these optimizations all make liquid run
extremely fast compared to a naive
direct implementation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
