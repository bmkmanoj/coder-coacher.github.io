you
you
many developers search and reuse code
from the web the bank code search Eden
for visual studio 2013 gives a better
code search experience directly inside
Visual Studio after installing the adhan
when you trigger intelligence you will
see the how do I button on top of the
auto completion window click the button
to open the code search panel is our
first example we would like to find code
to read the file line by line note that
in the query the variable file is
referenced after hitting Enter the adhan
shows the suggested snippets the snippet
for example uses the streamreader class
to read the file as we can see the
variable file appears on the right place
the bottom of the panel displays
information about the snippet we can see
the web page where the snippets came
from and their titles you can navigate
through snippets from different content
providers for now we have four partner
websites msdn stackoverflow.com 411 let
me go back to insert this snippet into
my code now I want to obtain another
snippet to generate the md5 hash code
from the contents of the line variable
to do this are type in the query
generate md5 hash from line to make the
query more clear we can specify the type
of the variable and use the @ sign to
escape the variable now as before you
can choose this nipple that you like the
most this time I will choose a snippet
from stack overflow this is the bank
code search Adam I hope you will enjoy
using it thank you each year microsoft
research house hundreds of influential
speakers from around the world including
leading scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
