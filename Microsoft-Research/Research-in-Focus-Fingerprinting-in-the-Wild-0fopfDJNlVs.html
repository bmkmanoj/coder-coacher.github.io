research director Kristen told joining
us we had planned via Skype a very cool
thing all the way from Kenya where work
even the Internet's gotta sleep some
char like eleven o'clock over there but
I want to talk to you bout what we're
going to talk about some really cool
stuff one of your colleagues in the
field in Kenya currently she's working
on an ambitious project to use computing
the catalog can preserve our planets
wildlife and it's quite fascinating in
the easiest way that I would sort of
explained sort of what's happening is
that essentially things like zebras the
stripes on their backs are like
fingerprints they're actually that
unique and that this technology is able
to help track them identify them catalog
them and all of that right absolutely in
fact if you think about the example this
morning in Harry shoot stuck where they
were had the dogs come out and they were
saying what kind of dog they were yeah
right with individual animals like
zebras are like well barcodes
essentially you can use machine learning
to not only identify what type of animal
that they are but get down to even
individual animals and be able to see
how they interact with one another be
able to track their progress through
life without having to put any kind of
heavy sensor thing that actually might
disrupt their migration patterns or
something like that so yeah that same
technology that we were showing this
morning can be applied in the wild for
what using low-cost sensors camera traps
even fly over video drones no I'm going
to ask you some about more about the
Microsoft collaboration here but we were
going to talk to Tony about sort of this
strong citizen science aspect to the
project sure can you speak to that at
all absolutely so we don't take photos
all the time we're camera happy and one
of the things that we know is that
everybody has a camera phone even in
Africa in these emerging nations and the
thing we want to be able to do is you
know the quality of those images isn't
always necessarily the best but but
that's actually how we can track these
these animals how we can monitor where
they go in the wild how they interact
with one another is through these types
of video images or even just simple
camera phones and the way that we're
doing is we're taking machine learning
to identify the individual animals in
there but allowing people to really sort
of
participate in that process they're out
in the wild they're out on a hike they
want to take an image of a particular
animal they can take a shot of it and
say this endangered species actually in
this particular location we can get the
GPS location read from the phone as well
now as I mentioned we had a little bit
of an internet issue here we're going to
talk with Tanya burger wolf associate
professor University of illinois-chicago
we actually did an interview with her
earlier we're gonna take a look at that
now great hi Tanya I'm so glad that you
could be with us today can you tell us a
little bit more about your computational
ecology project yes we're building an
image-based ecological information
system this is a computational system
that will allow us to go from images
which have become the most abundant
source of data about the natural world
to scientific insights through the
pipeline of image analysis information
integration and queries analytical
queries to those data we want to create
a biodiversity of view of the planet
through the lenses of individual cameras
what outcomes were you expecting to
enable new science Wow the field ecology
field biology is limited by the number
of people that can collect data the
ability to put out sensors in often
unaccessible inaccessible environments
to capture the animals that have to be
just at the right spot at the right time
and then if we go to more animated image
data collection sources then the limit
is the ability to analyze them so by
putting together the system where we can
go from all this multitude of images to
the data extracted from that we're
hoping to enable science as much high
resolution and bigger scale from
individual to ecosystems from seconds
two lifetimes wow that's great what
would you say are some of the really
good outcomes that you've had like the
people that you've interacted with while
you've been here besides the
computational ecology group in Cambridge
I've connected with people in computer
vision here in Microsoft Research
Redmond there is all the wonderful work
on visualization from layer scape
worldwide telescope that we're going to
use fetch climate will provide the data
for the climate for the areas for the
ecological context the system will be
built on Microsoft Azure on the cloud
because it is the information is coming
from all these various sources so it has
to be sort of aggregated on the cloud
but it also the people who are looking
for that for that information and using
this information I've distributed all
over the world so they have to access
access it through the cloud oh great so
I'm glad that Asher's played a role are
there other technologies that you've
encountered while you've been here
they've actually played a role and
helped you out in the project that
you're doing photosynth and image
composite editor are the perfect tools
for us to take this multitude of
photographs and create a picture of a
population of an animal of an encounter
with a wildlife so we're going to
continue these collaborations and
continue building and expanding these
tools because in their current capacity
they actually are not quite able to take
advantage of the data that we're going
to be collecting within the context of
building the system yeah so it's been an
exchange basically we've got to learn
from you and you've got to learn from us
it's been a wonderful exchange yeah so
talk a little bit about the future where
are you going to go from here with the
project so we're building the pilot of
the prologue project and deploying it in
Kenya in July it's exciting we're going
to see first time live in action our
ideas out in the field where the
tourists are going to take pictures of
animals we're working with an old with a
old Paget on nature preserve an impala
research center in the lake keep a
conservation area of kenya so we were
going to go there and the tourists who
are taking pictures are going to become
deputy rangers and we we will try out
our system using those pictures to
extract information and actually get
right away the head back to the tourists
and
build the system for the scientists as
well and hopefully a couple of years
from now with funding we we will have a
system which is capable of extracting
information from image data that comes
from all these sources from online
albums down to the last little drone
flying over some remote area in Namibia
or anywhere else and create the
biodiversity of view of the planet from
this lenses of individual cameras that
are deployed all over the world yeah it
sounds like this is a great research
project tell me a little bit about the
citizen science aspects of it we are
particularly excited about using
tourists and just accidental
photographers and incidental photography
as data providers but also data labelers
but because we need to annotate this
images to train the algorithms to
recognize species and individual animals
because in this field people are not
only willing they're excited to provide
that information they become engaged so
giving this data to through collecting
the data from learning what you can get
from those data and then become
activists in conservation and advocates
for conservation in the world because
they know what's happening they feel a
part of it they can follow through
social media we're building extensions
through social media about their zebra
the one that they saw when they were out
there and it's also great educational
tool because kids can get engaged by
looking at the images by seeing learning
about the species learning how to
identify the species in those images and
that provides data again for the
algorithms but also when you go to the
zoo a year from now then instead of this
19th century technology where you see
the printed information about the
species you're looking at we will be
able to maybe put a screen that
we'll show and the zebras that you're
looking here the zoo here's what they're
doing out in the wild here's where they
have been over the last week and that to
me is incredibly exciting you had to
engage with the public that was yeah
that's terrific tell us about some of
your collaborators some of the external
collaborators that you're working with
on this project oh this project would
not have happel happened without the
wonderful collaborations of many people
involved in this but the main
collaborators for the project
specifically are well university of
illinois chicago ahold of course dan
rubenstein is the ecologist from
princeton university he's been studying
zebras and other equals for many years
and so it's through him that we started
working many years ago and this idea of
the system came came up and then we're
collaborating with a computer vision
expert from Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute Chuck wrote a check steward
and recently have been joined by the
wild me nonprofit that tracks shark
started out by tracking pounders with
sharks and citizen science project so
Jason holmberg from wild me is our main
data architect and building this sort of
data base foundation for the project and
it's happening in Kenya at the Impala
research center and the old page the
Nature Conservancy so with all those
people involved talk about some of the
challenges I mean obviously with that
many folks going working with you on the
project that's got a presented challenge
what are some of the others as well
every bit of it is challenging from
collecting data in uninst romentic power
constrained and bandwidth constrained
environments such as Kenya and it's
going to be true for every wildlife
nature preserve out there pretty much to
the des the engineering challenges to
the computer vision research that has to
be done to build the system the
information integration deployment of
the system on the cloud visualization
and the actual analytical engine to be
able to ask the ecological questions
from those data to the aspects of
citizen science and dealing with people
who are involved in data collection and
then engage
and all the way through the whole
process from data to inside and then
education and outreach that we're really
hoping will be one of the outcomes of
this so it's it's simple things like
people setting their time zone correctly
for their cameras right so we have to be
able to put a protocol in place where we
can actually collect useful information
can you tell us how you got motivated to
work in this area what was the
motivation behind you going into
computational ecology my husband he's an
ecologist and we've been together for a
long time so it is through him who that
I first heard my first questions about a
college in my first stories and my first
job in ecology as a computer scientist
but it is through motion his colleagues
through these conversations but I found
myself both excited about these
questions and quite often thinking oh
gotta be a better way of answering this
question and so finally after many years
I decided to put my brain where my mouth
has been and start finding a better way
of answering this ecological questions
and then going to Kenya with through the
collaboration with dan rubenstein and
being in that amazing setting as the
researcher or as a in the context of the
course that Dan and I co-teach in fuel
computational ecology and seeing
students not only ourselves working on
problems that neither of them or us
would have been able to do by ourselves
in our own respective fields and coming
up with new ways of seeing the world new
ways of answering understanding the
natural world in this cunning setting of
Kenya I just find myself thinking
something that few people get to say
once in their lifetime I'm doing exactly
what I want to be doing and this is just
look and and an amazing opportunity that
I continue to be grateful for and
continue to be excited by well I really
want to thank you for being with us
today Tania and I really wish you very
good luck out in Kenya and with your
project in the future it sounds like a
great project that we're going to have
that will help every
understand computational ecology better
thank you and thank you for the only
collaborations to her fun peek back
there to conversation between tanya and
kristen kristen is here with me and we
were able to reach out and get in touch
with tanya she is on the phone she is in
Kenya we know it's very late Tanya in
fact it's almost tomorrow to you thanks
for staying up very late with us one
question we would love to ask you about
is ultimately establishing that
relationship with Microsoft talk about
how you came to work with Microsoft
there about five places in the world
hello by the way there about five places
in the world that have computational and
ecology to get them their name and the
title and Microsoft's computational
ecology research group at Cambridge UK
is one of them and so when I was looking
for a place to spend my sabbatical that
group was a very natural place for me to
be that started I indeed spend three
months there in fall 2013 last fall and
it started wonderful collaborations part
of which is this project image-based
ecological information system started
out of a collaboration also in
discussions with the group there with
Lucas jopo and withdrew purrs and then I
continued it because we want we realize
that we need to have it have a deployed
on Azure on the cloud and so azure was a
choice a natural choice for us and in
the spring I came to work with crystal
and the connections group at microsoft
Redmond research Redmond well Tonya we
know it's very late thanks for giving us
a couple of minutes your time we want to
let you get some sleep because we know
you got zebras to track in the morning
in just a couple of hours thanks for
doing this with us we appreciate it and
keep up the great work okay thank you
thank you for the support absolutely
great stuff there a big thanks to You
Kristin as well for eating the charged
doing the heavy lift and you interviewed
her I just hit play no forget it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
