hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
can people hear me yeah okay sorry my
voice hasn't gotten back yet and
hopefully be back by tomorrow or
something um you know I wasn't going to
say anything because of the wise but I
can't resist doing two things one is I
have to acknowledge the people who made
this possible first of all of course
it's all of you thanks for accepting our
invitation and coming and spending the
two days but of course all the speakers
the session organizers the ones people
who did the research shook is demos
pretty much everyone else and the three
execs Jeanette pioc and Harry was
usually hiding somewhere in the back
there and really the amount of time and
effort that deep sleep put into making
this event a success was incredible you
know that's I don't know if I add up the
per minute cost of all that will be a
very expensive event I have filling but
then I can't forget most importantly
they wonderful wonderful head really
came in to us at the right time but also
want to thank all the organizers the lot
of people were involved the entire
outreach team really work together on
this it was you know really great to see
has come together and I'm pretty proud
being a part of that team but there are
five people I want to call out
specifically and maybe they can either
stand up or come here a Judith bishop
and Katherine vacantly the co-chairs who
put together the program did it and I'm
Catherine GE maybe is not here at the
bar Kathleen come come come to the front
piece let the light shine on
so if you found anything wrong with the
program it's definitely one of those two
everything that was right is me thank
you both Sarah estimate that Maria
Christensen who did a lot of the work in
the background two faces names and faces
that you probably don't know her steam
but without whom you wouldn't be here
enjoying what thanks Aaron Mariah but
lost but not least the amazing Harold
who went through all the changes over a
log I said give them a big hand thanks
all of you you did such a good job you
had to keep on doing it for the rest of
you life thank you very much now it's my
pleasure to introduce Peter I that's the
other reason I'm here you know you under
my wife's is done I wouldn't miss a
chance to introduce Peter Peter in as
you know is the head of the new
experiences technology group of DNR
research but more importantly most of
you know him as a long-standing academic
researcher a person who founded a
technology of his in TARPA most of you
know him but many of you know perhaps
only some of you know he's a charismatic
speaker very charming person not a
couple of things with peril you should
be very half he is such an avid
sportsman and gamer there's nothing that
you can beat him on including gambling
so I wouldn't bet against him on
anything if he tells you something just
believe it and the other thing is that I
caught him it was said very recently I
early adopt so having someone you know
who's in a senior level manager who
adopts technology 10 times faster than
you do that's a little bit of trouble
but without in mind let me invite Peter
shares
Wow so it's a it's really I think that's
the most unique introduction I've ever
had and certainly this the sultry 'used
and that so thank you very much and but
I would also like to take this
opportunity to thank and congratulate on
and on who is really leading the whole
team to put this together down down so
it's been just an incredible experience
and I just want to start by thanking all
of you for being here I know it's it's
an imposition it is hard and takes time
and effort from all of your busy
schedules to come and spend time with us
I hope it has been a good use of your
time and I hope you've enjoyed it as
much as as I have we definitely don't
take it for granted and I am personally
also thankful that so many of you are
sticking out all the way to the end I
don't know how many key notes from
former CMU people you need to to listen
to but but I'm glad you're all sticking
on for at least one more so so thank you
I'm very honored as I was sort of
experiencing the events of the last
couple of days you know it's just so
inspiring you know I know it sounds
trite to say it but but I really mean it
you know the the Jeanette's opening
keynote yesterday that amazing panel
that Eric Horvitz had organized with
testing just amazing sweep of discussion
about the future of artificial
intelligence i I just was really taken
aback by really going all the way and
thinking in terms of kind of long
large-scale evolutionary terms in
learning just just amazing and and then
going throughout the day in really
tackling hit on some hard issues about
our community and the problems we have
with diversity in our in our community
and just looking at the stark numbers
even more starkly than before I was just
impressed with our willingness and
ability to kind of
go after those things and then today
just looking at all the demos I felt
very proud to have a chance to be a part
of an organization that has chance to
show off a little bit and engage with so
many of you most of that work was of
course in collaboration with so many of
you and then I was just in the ARV our
holocene session standing room only and
just you know you just get a sense that
maybe there's the possibility that
something big is about to change in how
we interact with and immerse ourselves
with the virtual with computing just
really incredible and as I reflect on
all that and over the last year or so
interacting with so many of you in
hallway conversations or as you visited
us or I've visited your labs and
universities or conferences and
workshops or various government
committee meetings and so on yeah it's I
just reflect on that I just left really
almost awestruck at what a vibrant
community we're all a part of and you
know it's just it's something that it is
I think just so precious for us together
as a community we just are advancing
human knowledge and doing it in ways
they actually add meaning and help
people's lives and together we're
engaged in research that on the one hand
has tremendous practical and even
commercial value just the overheated
venture capital market again here not
only here but in China other parts of
the world in Europe and at the same time
that research is sometimes just achingly
beautiful and just in itself just in
that beauty seems to just add meaning to
our lives into to the meaning of our
society and what we're all about as a
species it's just an amazing thing and
then together as a community you know
there's just always one thing I noticed
yesterday
wow there's a lot of laughing going on
we have a heck of a lot of fun and it's
just an amazing an amazing amazing thing
and so it's just so precious and I am
left thinking that we are really in a
golden era right now now you know as I
was working on the tire tracks now one
thing that leaves out it is you look
back at all the amazing stuff that
happened in the 1960s the emergence of
VLSI design and birth of micro
processors all of the early work and
compilers and programming languages and
still many other things the birth of the
ARPANET and you look at that and think
wow what a golden era for computing
research but when you look at it now at
least for me I'm just thinking we are in
a new golden era now and it's just
really an amazing thing I couldn't be
happier and couldn't feel luckier that
all of us together that we are a part of
this kind of community and so time will
tell if that's really the case but I
think undoubtedly we should all feel
very good about what we're doing and
just revel in the time that we have and
just go for the gusto I think Harry Shum
in his fireside chat with Atlas Oscar
yesterday was just trying to say say
that you know now is the time to really
to go for it and so that's I think the
first thing I want to say now of course
what I want to actually talk about today
isn't just to congratulate ourselves and
pat ourselves on the back although you
know I think that's a good thing
generally to do I instead wanted to
address the topic which is sort of
alluded to by the title of this talk and
this has to do with the possibility that
there's some fundamental changes to our
field to our research and maybe even
fundamental changes going on in our
society that have to do with the very
nature of research and how our society
by which I mean our
government the public and universities
in all of our other great institutions
in their society how they view and
tolerate the expense of what we do as
researchers and I took the title here as
a rip off of an op-ed that appeared in
The Washington Post a couple of months
ago by the mit president which was
entitled a better way to deliver
innovation which I thought was a
remarkably bold title it's always just
you're setting yourself up for failure
if you're going to declare that you have
a better way to deliver innovation is
such an important topic but such a hard
one but the op-ed I felt really struck
me in a certain way because in essence
it was also giving us or putting into
words the sense that i'm guessing all of
us feel that there may be as he put it
some profound shift in how our society
our country and really i think this is
global develops adopts and capitalizes
on innovation and this update goes on to
say that as you look at the different
mechanisms that we have for doing this
for capitalizing and developing and
adopting innovation that there are
shortcomings we don't quite see the
answers if we look at their venture
capital system raphael rife writes
venture capital is simply not structured
at least the current system of venture
capital to support complex slower going
concepts that could end up being hugely
significant and then he goes on to say
it might be unrealistic to expect big
corporations I of course read that as
Microsoft to patiently invest in
technologies designed to impatiently
disrupt them man that just hit me right
between the eyes because we have a lot
of investments in Microsoft Research
that if I'm really honest with myself
are designed explicitly to try to
disrupt the Microsoft as well as the
other players but this is what we try to
do and there's
real questions being asked about this
and of course is this also extends to
the government and ripe Oh Pines that
our government cannot effectively supply
the large-scale long-term funding needed
for new companies and products all of
this of course pertains to innovation
but it really speaks to our community
our community of researchers because
hidden behind all these words is the
implicit assumption that the innovation
starts with research and that puts
pressure on us as a research community
and so Eric Lander a month before that
gave this amazing lecture at the Library
of Congress and I'm i have to thank
edolas oscar for pointing this to me and
in this lecture he writes it's very much
worth reading there are bills in
Congress to ensure the accountability of
taxpayer dollars invested in science how
could you possibly complain about that
what can possibly be wrong with wanting
to have a clear case for how investments
in basic research pay off and of course
he states a fundamental truth a truth
that I think all of us in this room all
of us together as a part of the research
community know is true but it's so hard
to explain the answer is absolutely
everything is wrong with that that if
you try to plan things out too much you
miss the serendipitous extraordinary
returns but we feel this pressure
because the world has come to believe
our world has come to believe out of our
unreasonable past successes that the
future of innovation that our hopes for
innovation all start with us start with
research and as a result you know when
rife is talking about how to get
innovation faster more reliably he's
actually talking about how do we get our
research work to matter more in
innovation
that's where the pressure comes and
ground zero for this I think is the tech
industry our information technology
world I of course everything else
matters too but nowhere today is it
mattering more of the information
technology and every company in our tech
industry is feeling this and so I do
want to talk specifically about the
reaction to this within Microsoft
Microsoft Research but let me just zoom
out a little bit I was starting at the
national level let me just zoom in not
quite Microsoft Research and zoom in
just to the tech industry and as I look
around at the let me just use the the
term innovation departments at all of
our competitor companies they are all
feeling pressure so wonderful people I'm
sure many of your friends at Amazon's
lab126 they're doing some fantastic work
but it is really hard as they try to go
fast to do successful innovation and as
I read what's going on there and of
course we hear it not only in in the
tech blogs but we hear it from people
that we hire because there's just a lot
of people flowing back and forth between
MSR and Amazon and Google and Facebook
and so on and so we just hear a lot of
things but as I read some of these
quotes Wow you know it really resonates
I hear that you've probably heard it
from emma's are people you've probably
heard from google people over the last
year or the struggles to really deliver
actually ship somehow ship something
innovative out of advanced R&amp;amp;D
activities in places like Google X and
as those things those struggles kind of
mount up you hear more negativity and
this creates reactions CEOs notice these
things and then you have companies like
Facebook starting to set up and
experiment with open research labs and
Facebook's a research lab being very
prime example if people were impressed
last year with Mark Zuckerberg going to
China and speaking Mandarin what was
actually much more impressive was Mark
Zuckerberg going to nips and speaking
the language of AI researchers I mean
that that was an incredible thing that
he did and so that investment there and
of course we see this even going
overseas to China with Baidu's lab one
way I've talked about this to our people
in Microsoft Research is that five years
ago all of your research colleagues were
at universities today it is just as
likely for your research colleagues to
be at Google or Facebook or at amazon or
ebay you name it and the reason this is
happening is that smart CEOs in our
industry are desperate for that next big
thing and just like the mit president
seems to believe they believe that next
big thing is going to come from people
like us and so can we do it I think it's
a big question and of course we have a
smart CEO to a new one and he believes
the same way and he's really driven some
pretty amazing and deep changes now this
is a picture that holds a lot of meaning
for us in microsoft research right now
because this is a photograph taken at
satya nadella's first public outing in
the Silicon Valley after he became the
CEO and this was at the recode
conference and he had the prime first
slot at recode and so when he was
invited to do excuse me to do this he
sent out an email to a bunch of people I
was very privileged to be on that email
asking telling everyone that he wanted
to bring one tech demo with him to
recode and so asking for ideas so you
can imagine all the pointy elbows and
the company coming out
and just to be frank about it at least
in my limited experience of Microsoft
Research MSR would not normally engage
in that conversation we just observe and
be ready to help out once decisions were
made and so lots of different ideas were
offered up and saw two listened and then
after a little while if you're a lot of
emails so I basically said I don't get
it I don't get all of these ideas I want
something that allows us to be a head to
lead and be great he used those phrases
those vet phrase and he said I would
think skype has that rage he wanted
something that really had real market
power and then we should focus on this
for both speech recognition and
translation and pour all of our MSR and
product rd into it and so you can see
there even in his very first public
Silicon Valley outing he was looking
first to MSR to be able to say something
and bring something to the world that
had the kind in print and aura of
innovation and let's face a speech
recognition machine translation speech
synthesis these are all the things that
only we do right now it's something that
is cutting edge research contemporary
research again looking at our community
together for answers and so you can
imagine after that decision was made and
there were lots of hard questions asked
and such as stood his ground is that no
this is what we're going to do we were
suddenly under the gun as a research lab
it was a mad scramble you see here grew
deep singh Paul that's Walt Mossberg in
the that who is the other person without
hair but Gertie of st. Paul's the
corporate vice president who owns the
skype business giving the demo or the
demos working really great so that's a
big sense of relief and then such a on
stage as soon as the demo completes
publicly
pronounces oh and by the end of the
calendar year we will deliver the public
beta which was would have been nice if
he had discussed that with us first so
and but I tell that story because you
can see there's some deviousness and
really hard nosed management by satya
and he is totally aided and abetted by
harry shum in all of this to push and
push and push to see the maximum that
can be extracted a lot of research here
and so the way I think about it and get
in the way they talk about is that we
suddenly have been thrust into the
middle of the innovation strategy for
Microsoft and we've been given a mandate
to do more and I mean mandate by the
dictionary definition meaning we have
been given the permission to do much
more in this company but also the
expectation to do more and it is pretty
darn exciting I'll say more about that
as we go on now i do want to take a
little bit about skype translating i'll
say something about the technology and
the research in it but the other element
of our new CEO is he has defined a very
aspirational the way I actually I use
the word corny mission statement which
is to empower every person and
organization on the planet very romantic
turn of phrase there to achieve more and
as I have come to understand the
thinking Skype translator was also just
that kind of empowerment idea is there
an idea about how to make money or
generate revenue those the Skype
translator no in fact at the time that
this decision was made skype had two
missions one is to lower operating costs
and increase revenues and to to increase
the reliability of the skype service and
now along comes microsoft research with
the backing of the CEO with a technology
that cost three times more to deliver
per call and that is a research rickety
prototype
and so it is just the statement that
this this mission to empower people
really mean something that is really the
focus so to give you an idea of that I
think some of you have probably
experienced a translator and we've been
just so pleased to see how people
embrace the technology and people are
getting real work done for the fur in
ways they couldn't do before
granddaughters are talking to
grandmothers in a different country for
the first time it's just really
wonderful but on this empowerment issue
I'd like to show you just a short
two-minute video of this surprising
kinds of applications that come out of
technology like this so if you could
roll the video please that'd be great
when I'm 13 years old lost my got the
love I can imagine this makes it
difficult to communicate with people
when I met my future wife Joyce able to
communicate with me only by spelling out
letters on my hand a month later we met
again and I thought you're taught
herself yeah off the bat this is just
for strategy because no fingers last
fall etta come to my office to tell me
about an idea that he had for adapting
Skype translator to a scenario that
would have to be useful to him Ted bean
def can't make calls for skype boa Skype
translator because it produces
transcripts he could actually read the
response back from someone so we sat
down and talked about it for a little
bit and there were some pieces missing
in Skype translator so we need to
actually do something to make it more
appropriate for that scenario
Ted heart is requesting and
automatically translated calm my ASL
interpreter for my meetings at work to
be planned in advance and sometimes it's
just always possible it doesn't replace
an ASL interpreter give me a lot of
other awesome adventure reach the last
minute although these features were
really impactful for dead in his work
life really hit me was the realization
that there was a big impact on his
personal life I realize did you see
skype friends they don't like a call my
wife directly from the first time there
are relay services that you can use but
they are inconvenient and require time
to initiate the call with Skype
translator i just read the transcript I
understand she is sad when they put all
that 24 years after she learned sign
language errand boy but I can take a
more full step into hers so I was
sitting back thinking about it i'm
looking at it and realizing the impact
that this could have for me for people
here at microsoft and for our customers
for people with deafness with hard of
hearing all over the world technology
has a car it can empower people to do
things make things easier it's available
now download it give it a try and help
us to make this a better and better
product
I just really love that I love all of
these research stories where the
outcomes of research the intended
outcomes maybe they happen or not but
the unintended impacts end up being the
surprising serendipitous outcomes end up
being the really cool ones and I really
felt proud of this one a little bit more
about Skype translator a little bit
later so you know getting back to the
beginning you know there's just this
just incredible hunger for innovation
just incredible thirst to more reliably
come up with the next big drivers of
value the next big drivers of impact on
people's lives the next big drivers of
expanding people's imaginations of
what's possible in this world and just
all that wrapped up innovation and that
pressure I believe comes squarely down
on researchers in on the research
community and so all of the turbulence
and the questions that that we here and
that we feel right now the sense that
maybe society is becoming less tolerant
of the expense of research all of those
things they're all coming from this
place at the same time it is also
something that is exhilarating for us
because it is us as a research community
that are being put front and center in
changing the world at least in my
limited career as a researcher I don't
think I've been in a situation where I
feel like our community is being asked
to do so much and being expected to do
so much and so I use this crazy story
and I'm going to tell it here and don't
the you know laughs at me too much but
it goes back to when I think I was six
or seven years old and I grew up in
small town in Upper Michigan and my
parents were on some summer vacation I
went to my first theme park and I saw a
roller coaster for the first time oh god
I wanted to I wanted to ride that thing
I knew I had to write it but I my head
didn't make it up to the red line so I
wasn't allowed so a year or two past we
got another family vacation and I see a
roller coaster again and this time I'm
tall enough alright so I get to ride the
thing I get strapped into that roller
coaster car and then as I'm going up
that first hill I realize oh god this is
a big mistake you've got to get me off
of this thing and then of course by the
time I finish that first ride it's just
the best thing in the world I need to
write it again that's a story I tell to
people through our researchers to our
engineers to our partners in other parts
of the company to reporters to everyone
and the reason I tell it is i think that
that is roughly speaking the situation
that us as a research can be that we are
in today if I reflect on this I think
that we have always believed in
ourselves as research we've always
believed in the power of research we've
always believed we could do more for our
company or for our University or for
community or for the world if only we
were given the mandate to do more and
now that we have been giving that
mandate it's kind of scary there are
uncomfortable questions may we get a
little nauseous no but no one falls out
okay but things happen and that is the
situation that I you know where the dog
that for years was trying to catch the
bumpers on the passing cars and now we
finally caught one and now what and at
least I can speak I think pretty much
for microsoft research and I can see
Jeanette shaking your head that is
definitely the situation in microsoft
research today but i suspect that this
is a much broader thing
so what what can we do about that what
should we be doing about that and you
know it has been a real thought process
and a turbulent one it's been a
rollercoaster ride but one of the things
that has always been the case for
microsoft research is that Microsoft
Research has done a lot of
experimentation we've always sort of
tinkered with models and reason we've
been able to do that is we've been
blessed with resources we have about
twelve hundred and fifty people
worldwide we have a lot of funding
resources we can try a lot of different
things we can try different approaches
different philosophies to management we
can try different ways to organize
ourselves and and traditionally emma
Starr has done a lot of that some of
you've probably heard of experiments
like the impossible things initiative
that was something that Rick Russia
started or extreme computing group or
many many others that didn't actually
even have names that things that we just
tried and so we are embarking actually
on a much more significant kind of
experiment now in the creation of an
organization in microsoft research that
we've been calling microsoft research
next and next it's sort of double
entendre but the actual acronym is new
experiences and technologies and so I've
been spending the last nine months
exclusively focused on building and
trying to figure out what emma's our
next should be and so I'd like to just
say a little bit about I don't want to
get into organizational detail it's kind
of boring but try to give some overall
management philosophy around what this
is I call this a projects organization
and that's actually an allusion to the
DARPA notion of project and by project
that means several things one is that we
try to organize people in ms our next
into subgroups that are all aligned or
going towards some clear goal and I'll
give you some examples of these things
but if you think of the Skype translator
team that Skype translator team has the
goal
to eliminate the language barrier for
all Internet connected people in the
world so that's a goal and it's
something that actually to some extent
or another can be can be easily assess
and so that implies that the structure
of ms our next is highly
interdisciplinary because to do
something like the Scott translator you
need distributed systems researchers
because you're trying to deliver a very
complicated and expensive service to 350
million active users you need speech
recognition you need machine translation
you need HCI many many different kinds
of people have to form that group and
that's a little bit of a deviation from
the way MSR has been organized in the
past where we have really gone for
serious intellectual depth and organized
ourselves into groups around the grand
disciplines of computer science and
related fields like machine learning
like computer vision like cryptography
and so on a second and this is sort of
an allusion to the hile Meyer Catechism
if you know about that is we talk about
exit strategies so pick some time in the
future one year from now five years from
now 15 years from now but imagine that
future point and some change in the
world that you want to affect hopefully
for the better and now what is some
credible plan for getting there from
here and of course it's research so we
know that everything changes today you
get smarter in the plans change every
day but we try to have always in our
project teams a thought of what we want
the world to be like at what time and
some notion of how we think we can get
there even if that has to be revised on
the on a near-daily basis and so we talk
about this in terms of exit strategies
because that also
means that we think about how we will
actually get things out into the real
world or out into whatever community of
interest we want to have an impact on
we've tried to change how we control
resources and funding and I'm sorry next
to allow a lot of buffer so that we can
have an agile response so there's a new
idea that comes up and we want to just
invest quickly we can do that there was
just a recent incredible idea for a DNA
storage device that came out of some
collaborations between the University of
Washington and Microsoft Research and so
what we want to be able to deal when we
see extending things like that it's if
we can really understand and push on the
accessible goals and the clear exit
strategies that we can very quickly like
within a few days provide the resources
and the people to really get started
this really comes from Harry Shum and
from such an Adela but we've tried to
instill an end-to-end mandate to give
our project teams the right to take
things all the way to the end and in
some of the Amazon X projects that
involve actual setting up businesses to
actually act like startups and find ways
to actually deliver all the way to
paying customers if necessary now most
of our research projects aren't like
that but all of them actually have now
the ability to own things and deliver
them all the way to the end and then
finally a big thing has to do with
culture you know there's a phrase that
we've been using that we want to
celebrate innovation and reward great
execution on our research work but we
want to worship impact and that is just
sort of a credo to try to instill this
idea that what we're trying to do is
actually bring things bring what we can
do
out into the world and so this is not
that far off from what MSR has always
been and with our has always done things
like this in the past but we are now
just trying to be a little bit more
focused at least for my part of emma's
are being a little bit more focused and
organized and intentional about it I
wanted to tell you a little bit about
the just give you several examples to
you an idea of the kinds of things that
have started it's only been nine months
it's still early but I think I can give
a few examples give you an idea and as I
do this one thing I want to say is that
the way we got started with MSR next is
basically Jeanette Harry and I kind of
sat down and we sort of try to find
people who might be genetically
predisposed to this next model and move
them under me people who might have less
comfort all the things people always
evolve would not have to be a part of
emma starr next and then of course we've
been hiring a lot and that hiring has
been quite a lot of work I think we've
hired well over 100 new people since
since last winter and so it's a work in
progress and so I think the point of
this image is to state that there's a
little bit of a sense of changing the
engines on the airplane while it's still
in flight and so so as as I describe
things there's some things are more
aspirational than real but i'll try to
to be as grand as possible and the
examples I'm choosing are also examples
of projects that had their origins
outside of MSR and the reason to do that
is just to try to emphasize the things
that maybe can be pushed and brought in
from other parts of the company into the
amateur model okay so I talked a little
bit about the Skype translator and of
course there was this sort of surprising
push from the very top and we've been
really
it's just been a huge amount of work but
wow really just so much fun the
challenges have been just incredible I
mean just the scaling challenges alone
have been really tremendous and we've
just barely scratch service we've been
very cautious we had a very cautious
preview program that was very limited
and the only client application that has
this functionality is the modern or
metro app for windows which has a very
small user base right now as we've been
very cautious about the scaling but that
will be changing over the next few weeks
and months but we are now on the road to
just developing and releasing more and
more languages and studying very
carefully for some of our preview
partners on what people do one of the
interesting things about Skype
translator in our experience is we've
been learning a lot about what I called
intimate conversation and what do I mean
by that well all of our speech and
machine translation models to the most
part we're trained on transcripts of
lectures and speeches trained on the on
business transactions like you trying to
talk to a hotel clerk who speaks the
different language you talking to a
waiter or waitress you talking to a taxi
driver so I call those all either formal
conversations or conversations business
conversations between strangers but when
people are using skype they aren't
strangers it's that granddaughter
talking into a grandmother it's two
co-workers who work for the same company
and they're trying to get work done
there is a different vocabulary and a
different kind of sense there's an
amazing amount just singing to each
other that goes on in skype people tell
jokes to each other all the time people
laugh all sorts of things happen so our
models just like Google's were just nail
the talk to
hotel clerk scenario just great so
that's all fine but he'll now that we've
organ stop translating that teams damn
boring there is something much more
human much more intimate about the kinds
of things that we're learning and as a
result the models that were having to
ship are for the most part all coming
out brand-new and we are learning so
much about this kind of familiar
intimate conversation and what is so
exciting to me besides the fact that
we've had to do some groundbreaking work
in disfluency removal and segmentation
and so many other kinds of things things
that are actually controversial if I'm
trying to talk to someone in China and
maybe I you know I'm trying to become
friends the joke i have is if i'm trying
to get a date in shanghai and i have a
few arms and oz is it right is meaning
lost if those arms and ozzard are
removed as they are right now with our
latest technology it's these are very
interesting questions and as we get to
the bottom of these things what opens up
for us and what is so exciting is that
we get new business opportunities
because if you look at a big part of our
business which is the enterprise
business and our support for things like
meetings this is a typical me in fact I
hope Lily Chang isn't to embarrass this
is a photograph of a group research
meeting in Lily Chang steam look at that
meeting look at that scene can't you
hear in your heads what's going on there
that is not you know like one stranger
talking to a hotel clerk with another
stranger there is to a different kind of
thing so to be able to process the
speech in these kinds of settings I
believe our experience with Skype
translator is giving us some insights
we're learning something about human
discourse and it's just incredibly
exciting and so I just see a whole new
vistas and fundamental research opening
up before us
that Skype translator is in the category
of projects that I called strategic
collaborations with product engineering
so we are joined at the hip with the
skype engineering team and our success
is skype success we're just all in with
them the work that we do with hollow
lens is very similar the work we do with
Bing with office and so on is very
similar and in one way when we do that
kind of work we're being very respectful
to the mindset and the thought process
in the product engineering groups but
it's important for research also to have
a part that either openly or not openly
disrespects the thinking in in the
project engineering groups that actively
tries to kind of not just take for
granted what goes on there and so we
have another part of our portfolio that
really tries to be disruptive that
really tries to work on high ambition
goals that if met if successful would
completely upend everything and so we
have quite a few projects in this then
we haven't been very public or open with
any of the projects to this point
although we as you watch us over the
next few months you'll see more and more
come to light but one that we have
talked about publicly it's our quantum
effort and the quantum effort is again
something that has a very clear end goal
I think you've heard about some of it if
you attended the quantum session
yesterday we have a program written by
crystal sephora and routine for
computing energy minimum for ferredoxin
and we want to execute that program
because executing that program we
believe would lead to fertilizers and
other nitrogen fixation technologies
that would have a significant commercial
value as well as the potential to
eliminate world hunger so now what do we
need to do to
execute that program that's our goal and
the only way we know of is with a
quantum machine and we've gone far
enough to understand that the quantum
machine would be able to execute that
program and so now we're on this path
and we've been doing some work that i
think is incredibly exciting it's a long
path but it is planned out and we have
dates in mind those dates seem to change
all the time but you know because our
confidence in what we're doing and how
good we're feeling about things changes
all the time it is research after all
but we're thinking about those things
but the cool thing about this and this
is something we all know another
fundamental truth about research is that
when you go for these high bitchin
things and if you're very focused you
know for sure that there will be lots of
interesting useful spin-offs along the
way and so this top middle image is this
beautiful image which i think is going
to be so important that is an interface
between indium arsenide and aluminum and
you can see it's atomically perfect and
so we have managed to find engineering
process for doing that now why is that
important well indium arsenide is a
standard semiconductor aluminum at low
enough temperatures is a superconductor
and when you have this atomically
perfect interface and you go to low
temperatures the Cooper pairs that
define the superconducting
characteristics of the aluminum start to
inhabit that subject conductor and when
that happens you suddenly have
superconducting properties in a
semiconductor and now all sorts of
things microwave detectors and various
sorts of devices that we know how to
fabricate today in some in a
semiconductor substrate you just start
dreaming about all sorts of things and
so these sorts of possibilities of
spin-offs the things that we learn by
trying to engineer things at extremely
low temperatures just have far-reaching
consequences even if we never make it to
executing krista's ferredoxin program
Christa and Dave workers
harry and jeanette mentioned catapult so
in this team their goal the way I look
at their goal is that from now until 20
25 they have to keep our cloud on the
trajectory of Moore's law and so that's
pretty hard now the thing about this and
is as you think about doing this you
have to think about this series of
architectural and technology changes and
in the short term the technological
approach that has been taken is to look
at a reconfigurable computing fabrics in
our data centers and so working in great
partnership with Derek to and his team
in bing we ran a large pilot about 1,600
servers on the Bing ranking load that
was very very successful give us a lot
of confidence we're now on the path
actually to carrying the full Bing
ranking load in a few months in FPGA
boards and that then has created the
possibilities that we can go actually
whole hog potentially at some point to
our entire cloud and already the cloud
business Asher has been publicly
demonstrating the possibilities of
encryption at line speeds for free in
our cloud using this kind of technology
what's really exciting though to us it
is not anything that I just said all of
that was just a way of incubating the
technology to persuade our company to
pour in the hundreds of millions of
dollars required to do that kind of
deployment but when we look at this what
we dream about is looking at the global
network that was built for our data
centers and overlaying on that global
network a whole new kind of gigantic
distributed computer based entirely on
reconfigurable logic
and now what do you think we might be
able to do with that and all sorts of
great dreams happen there and so this is
a third category of projects that we've
been trying to funds that I refer to as
incubations there are research ideas
that we've managed project at them we've
met to test them but now they're they're
ready to kind of go much bigger and that
that scale maybe give us new research
possibilities and as you look at those
things there's so many other things that
all have that kind of flavor they have
some clear goal some goal and some time
frame that gives us an idea of what kind
of change we want to make in the world a
plan for getting there a plan for
getting the things out in the world and
then giving us some freedom to play
around those things by putting enough
resources around and so this is an
experiment will it work out I am Not
sure but we're pretty darn excited so
far even as early going so I do want to
take some questions but before I do that
let me just close with the final thought
we are just incredibly excited and just
the the kind of impetus and the mandate
from Harry shaman from such and adela
just being a part of microsoft research
and the great collaborations
interactions with not only the labs and
Jeanette's whole organization but XD
Huang's intelligent services group in yu
ting closed group have just all been
fantastic but i don't want to lie either
this has been an incredibly turbulent
year it really has been a roller coaster
ride and is I think about all of the
things that we've gone through this past
year I reflect on it and I
just am incredibly proud now to be a
part of a company that is willing to
take the kinds of risks that it's taking
right now a company that really seems to
get it and believe in what research can
possibly do if only given that mandate
so this rollercoaster metaphor as a
metaphor allegory allegory is actually
very real I think for all of us and as
we think about how this future will play
out for us I'm hoping that as a research
community we can actually prove that all
of the assumptions that people seem to
have that innovation is driven by
research people don't often times say it
but it's actually implicit in what
everyone is saying it's implicit in the
kinds of doubts and the questions that
people are asking about the cost of
research it's implicit when people are
asking about the ROI and wanting to
understand it we now are in the position
with this mandate to prove that that is
all true and correct and so I don't see
any way as Harry put it yesterday that
we can do without all of us working
together I'm pretty excited pretty
confident and really looking forward to
seeing how this plays out so thank you
very much for listening I wanted to
leave a little bit of time so I think we
have five or ten minutes for questions
so I'm happy to take any questions that
there are any yes
yeah so the question was a guys started
early on with the quotes that were
really looking academic research but and
then moved industrial research and now
can I bring it back to your academic
research you know I think that the
fundamental questions that are being
asked in academia and Industry for
industrial research academic research
are my view now and I think I have some
perspective because i have now I've been
in both places I think they're
fundamentally the same I think the
urgency in computing research in
industry is extremely high right now
because right now the tech industry writ
large doesn't know what the next big
driver of commercial value will be you
know if the apple watch takes off and if
suddenly every person in the first world
starts spending six hundred dollars for
a wearable computer we'll all be happy
for a few more years but barring that
it's not clear what the next big drivers
are going to be so there's a desperation
and urgency and so that's why you see
our CEO and the other CEO is really
starting to like look with some
desperation at their industrial research
or innovation departments for answers
but if you take that urgency away I
don't see any difference it feels the
same to me when I was at DARPA I visited
about 30 universities and labs during my
time at DARPA 31 I think and you know
you could just feel all the great stuff
going on but also the kind of worries
and anxieties people have about funding
and those worries were deeper than where
is the next grant going to come from the
worries were kind of there's an
undercurrent of just concerned about wow
it's society going to continue
to understand in a basic research and
its value and to tolerate the the
expense of it so the urgency might be a
little bit different but I think we're
all in this together and so when I look
maybe I'm putting too much on MSR but I
do view us as important in our community
because we are in some ways at the
vanguard of that pressure right now
because not only are we a part of this
open research community but we are just
happen to be in a company in a very
turbulent industry in a very turbulent
time I'm probably so by the way yeah
like I'm probably being overly dramatic
about things so you can take what i do
and turn it down by by a few notches but
i think i'm saying something relatively
true yes
question for you or possibly for any of
the other executives who are there you
talked a lot in sort of generalities
about how we should manage research and
innovation and whatnot what does ms are
not have what are you planning on doing
going forward where were you planning on
growing and are there limits to what you
think MSR can accomplish oh yeah so
there certainly are limits I let's see
so there it gets to spencer's a question
one is kind of research directions where
so what does our portfolio balance look
like in terms of technical or research
directions another one way to look at is
what sorts of modalities or management
philosophies in might we try to adopt
and so they're interesting answers to
both to both questions you know when we
look at areas where Jeanette and Harry
and I kind of think about Wow are we
missing the boat on some things topics
that come up often are things like a
Jeanette brings up neuroscience a lot as
we've gotten to see the importance of
tangible devices and so on there are
more more questions about materials
various aspects of materials and
material science yesterday robotics came
up particularly that kind of physical
actuation in the mechatronics there
there are very interesting questions
about this whole cyber physical systems
or IOT space so there are many many
directions and we threat about these
things all the time in terms of other
innovation strategies we're trying to be
as creative and open minded about things
as possible one thing that happens that
most of your universities that's hard
for us but we're looking at ways to do
it is most professors if they have great
ideas or graduate students they can go
spin and take a leave of absence for a
year to spin off and try something and
with the comfort that they can come back
and so
that is something that is much much more
difficult microsoft research and so
we're thinking about things like that
because it's important not only to
maximize the potential for impact of the
research that we do but also to sort of
inject that kind of entrepreneurial
thinking in the culture of MSR and so
there are different thoughts like that
and so as we're sort of just having our
hallway discussions having our formal
meetings reviews and so on right now
we've just ended one fiscal year and
starting a new one and it's a kind of a
prime time that we that we think about
these things so ultimately as big as we
are we do have limits and so we're
always feeling like we're hitting those
limits and so we have to make choices
and and so we we do what every
department head what every professor
with the research group what every Dean
has to do which is is to try to make
those choices
so seeing if unless there are any other
questions so let me then close I will be
out I think all of us will be out in the
little reception afterwards thank you so
much again for coming we really really
are grateful for all of your time and
attention and I hope you enjoyed it each
year microsoft research helps hundreds
of influential speakers from around the
world including leading scientists
renowned experts in technology book
authors and leading academics and makes
videos of these lectures freely
