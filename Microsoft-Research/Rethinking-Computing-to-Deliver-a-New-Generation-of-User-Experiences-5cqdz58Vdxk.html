don't really think very much about where
the computers are that they are using
and that really is possible because of
research that's occurred in distributed
computing over the past nearly 50 years
we are using use our search engine it's
actually RT supercomputing have fun and
resource but where user use a hot meal
it's actually yours are distributed
system were BOTS email traditionally
computer hardware has evolved by
individual processes getting faster and
faster and faster and that stopped
several years ago and instead hardware
now evolved by having more and more
processor cores all integrated on the
same trip so the challenge that we're
focusing a lot of our work on is how to
develop software so that it can benefit
from those cause because so many of
Microsoft's customers will experience
computing through cloud computing as we
deliver more and more services to them
the technologies that underlie cloud
computing are an important focus for our
research our research focuses not just
on a functionality of cloud computing
but the security that has to be
integrated throughout the applications
and services that run there in no matter
how fast or cheap computer processing
power becomes there's always the
challenge of how to write computer
software and so being able to support
abstractions for parallel programming
making it easy for people to lie
parallel programs it's very important
we've moved from a world in which
computing was very evident to people and
they had to deal with in a very direct
way to a world in which computing is all
around us in a ubiquitous and often
almost invisible way so the dream is to
make computing invisible to its consumer
to focus on the what rather than
how and for that reason we need to
continue to invest in research that can
deliver on that dream in the years to
come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
