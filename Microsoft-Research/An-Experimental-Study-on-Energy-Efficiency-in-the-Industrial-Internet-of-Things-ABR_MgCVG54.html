hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
look
good afternoon please settle down we get
started now so welcome back from lunch I
know it's sort of sometimes hard to be
awake immediately after lunch so we have
a very dynamic speaker we picked him on
purpose right after lunch so is a
pleasure to welcome dr. Rajiv Cherie who
is a principal scientist at TCS labs
here in bangalore as well as in the US
he splits his time between the two labs
regime has been you know lots of places
or the years he started off his career
in ayia see where he got all his degrees
his PhD in 1996 is it 1997 and then he
spent time at IBM and GM in industry but
he was also an academia for a few years
he was the first president of the niit
University in Rajasthan and for the past
few years he's been at TCS looking at a
bunch of interesting things in
communications and IOT and he will tell
us about some of that Tom okay thanks
thank you wanker so pleasure to be here
the outside let me thank my good friend
known a winker for a long time dr.
venture Padma Robin but also it's great
to be here because almost every second
person Microsoft is a good friend a very
kind of them to invite me for this great
summer school on IOT and i think is a
great perfect time to have the summer
school there's so much happening in the
world have been a party to hundreds of
meetings last few months with everybody
you can think of it at cisco my too soft
or Carnegie Mellon upper do and the list
goes on and on and everyone is talking
about two areas one is IOT are there is
cyber security so more about
cybersecurity later up all right so let
me just give you a peek of what's to
come so this is really i thought i'm
going to start with so here is a just to
you know before i start i have my
colleagues costa blanca is just finished
his PhD from us he's going to join us
very soon probably or the next one month
the Cincinnati labs dr. Jeffrey to
heading the labs in the US i worked with
him he's the chief scientist for TCS
worldwide and now also heading the
entire program on digital manufacturing
so my talk is really focused on a very
exciting new topic i think very few
students would probably know that what
is digital manufacturing but it's really
occupying everyone busy these days
whether it's academy or industry so i
have a chance to
about that I am based both the linkage
said both in India and the u.s.
bangalore delhi as well as detroit's
incident so here is the outline of my
talk and I'll try to do my best next one
hour when cut to a big challenge
post-lunch talks I'll try to be I try to
make sure nobody sleeps so I'll probably
ask questions to random a random set
over here so if you sleep then well you
don't want to be embarrassed by okay so
let me start by a very important area
that is really keeping many of us busy
with sleepless nights that's called the
industrial Internet so all of you know I
OTA you know you guys are smarter than
most of us students but what's new for
us is industrial IOT so there's a whole
new area called the industrial Internet
of Things and I'll give you examples use
cases and application of that so I
thought just to set the tone for my talk
it's important tell you why I am talking
about this you know because they
important tell you the context of this
talk not just some results and then good
luck and they end the story so let's
start with watch industrial Internet
what's the industrial trade consortium
and that leads to a very important topic
these days called industry 4.0 so almost
everyone in this world almost every
company including Microsoft that we work
very closely with TCS Cisco all the OEMs
that make cars hitachi name a company
and they are in industry 4.0 i'll tell
you what that is will then come straight
to the problem that we have been working
on so we've been working on several
problems experiments proof of concept
prototype along with our students along
with our colleagues both in India and
the u.s. and I thought it's important a
moment to give you a peek at some of the
work that we have done but please keep
in mind that this is work in progress at
a lot of what I am sharing with you
today is actually happening as I'm
talking now is this company confidential
it's not but a lot of things I am
talking to a work in progress along with
the partners partnering companies as
well as business partners in TCS okay
let me start with the industrial
Internet of Things now the best example
I can think of a general electric now
way back just two years ago I was amazed
did you know this General Electric you
know all the when you fly those big
jumbo aircraft trans-pacific or
transatlantic flights almost all of them
have four engine jumbo jet that jump
engines and most of the engines are
manufactured by the pratt &amp;amp; whitney
or General Electric now when you fly in
our aircraft press Atlantic or Pacific
you know you have these large
four-engine wide-bodied aircraft and
these engines are GE engines and g is
doing real-time analytics as you are
flying on that lantic ocean which means
that every component of the engine now
has iot now you lastly what those
devices I will come to that that's not
important but they are i authorized so
there are all kinds of sensors actuators
everywhere the rotor all kinds of
mechanical devices at the aircraft
engine rightful time you take off till
you land they're doing real-time
analytics and the idea is that by the
time you like they should know whether
you are ready to take off after viewers
because any defect in an engine in a
long-haul flight can be fatal let me
know that right you see many examples
whether it's Malaysian Airlines or any
other example it could be really
devastating so just think about it did
we ever trust this form of fairy tales
just few years ago that while i'm flying
somebody is doing analytics and over the
cellular link or what the satellite link
is going down and they're doing
real-time predictive analytics and
figuring out what's the probability that
the engine will go down or some
component will malfunction and so they
won't take off now they'll give a new
aircraft so the g in my view if they ask
me which is one pioneer of predictive
analytics and i'll talk about that it's
general electric others are you know
great followed but she really is doing
some deep deep work whether its
manufacturing or aircraft or ornament
yeah what well but the number well see
remember but then now you talking about
infotainment and it took tumble a whole
interface the entertainment and the
infotainment and the software piece of
it so they really not involve that
they're talking about specifically the
engine the turbo engines that run the
aircraft specific to tap that if
something goes wrong there then the
railways a red flag and they let you
know that to the big complex questions
with respect all right so the whole
industrial IOT is about machines it's
about all kinds of machine that could be
generators in our SCRC building from the
icrc building where a student of color
crc and the machines generate data but
the people are also very critical
element in IOT so one of the first
takeaways of this talk that I want to
share with our colleagues is please
don't ignore people in IOT because
people when
it's factory flow over their classrooms
or whether it's any environment are
playing a critical role and a lot of us
ignore people running model the network
which is not a right thing to do and
I'll share some examples of how you can
model people and so this loop goes on
and on machines all kinds of machine
including cards i'll talk about smart
cars in circles now aircrafts and
generators turbo engines turbines they
generate data and there are people
involved and so this loop goes on and on
and on alright so the whole world of
industrial Internet of Things is so
important that is defined a new
consortium called industrial Internet
consortium please go to this website
many of my friends asked me didn't come
the company and even outside you know
give us some use cases what are the
killer used a slow IOT everybody is
grappling with it because if I have a
killer use case I will probably be
making millions of dollars right because
it's a killer use case I think the best
answer would lie in in this website
called is equal sodium go to RG and you
can see here is just up over peek at
some of the killer use cases that they
have me along with our partners pcs is
leading use cases has in fact we have
spawned many platforms in is here along
with Cisco's siemens oracle tego and
infineon and and I'll come to that in
the short well for now but the whole
point is we really want some killer use
cases please go to the website internet
industrial consortium is just like I
Triple E it is getting all the companies
of the world together and it's defying
some great applications of IOT here is
my favorite example so go back in one
year ago and we asked them are so boring
launched a platform and boys that look
let me define a killer use case for IOT
in the Boeing plant in Seattle right so
look at the use case Robert amazed by
what going is that so the question was
that when you manufacture an aircraft
you know you have millions of rivets
remember when you sit near the wing of
the plane you can see that there are
thousands of rivets on the wing and each
rebec did you know has a different
pressure when you manufacture the
aircraft you know when you open it and
when occluded you have to put different
pressure talks are different the p eyes
are different p 1 p 2 2 PK now if you do
it manually it's could lead to a
nightmare because if some of the rivets
are loose it could lead to serious
disaster over the air so what Boeing
side is I'm going to work with my
partners I did with the partners was
please look at
forgot a partner other companies and I
am NOT to now i authorize my
manufacturing which means when the
worker goes and puts those rivets I have
this iPad or whatever divided will tell
me exactly rivet number thousand nine
here is the pressure here is a torque
Revit number nine thousand ten here is
the pressure has a talk but not just
about rivets about any small component
in the aircraft that use case will
become a big hit in the industrial
Internet consortium and that led to
almost every company in completely
Microsoft saner look let's define a
platform or a test bed in this
consortium so that the world can use it
and we also learn from experience so
here the peek at some of the great
desperate there don't miss the website
and here is my favorite picture right so
now let us come to what is smart
manufacturing and I will quantify what
smart means what is much fly chain look
at a typical assembly plan now these are
powertrains right powertrain the engine
so these are typical engines of a German
and a fracture plant right and you know
the whole assembly line is pretty
complex so any one of you who not been
to a car manufacturing plant please go
it's a lifetime learning experience it's
amazing our car is made of course comes
out every 30 minutes but there are
hundreds of stages before a car comes
out right from the time metal is
inserted until the car comes out it's
unbeliev like a magic but leave go to a
factory and you see what I'm talking
about now just imagine if I would I otay
is this factory right and I like their
what I otay is the factory which I mean
if a foot i attain a manufacturing plant
or an assembly plant the question that
we are asking an industry an Academy are
together with that means what are the
benefits we can reap can you quantify
the benefits in percentage so that's the
kind of questions we are asked you know
I'll take you through some of those
questions right so when I i authorize a
plant i mean maybe i'll put my Wi-Fi
access points all over i'll put iot and
the machine that critical places i don't
even know how many and where to put but
that's a research question but the
question the key point is once i know
how we need to put and where to put what
are the benefits that i can that are you
know i can tap from the iotas ation of
the factory and I'll give an example of
what we did last year and that to me was
the first is a such experiment of a real
factory that we all die before I come to
that the whole space of supply chain now
you know earlier I used to think go back
in time and supply chain that's boring I
mean I'm a computer
scientists what a supply chain but you
know amazing everything you do
everything you work on laptop car
fleeing supply chains right right for
the time the components that come out
whether it's rivets or whether it's
small components till the final finish
good comes out the end-to-end supply
chain is going to be very complicated
right in fact now 3d printing is playing
a big role and all kinds of fancy
technologies are playing a big role
social networking but just to summarize
this end supply chain has many phases so
you source the components in all kind of
nuts and bolts and then they go into
making a product could be a car so make
me making manufacturing a product and
finally you end you'll end up with a
smart product much in product could be a
TV could be a laptop and I'm going to
focus on this talk on the make part of
the supply chain make is the
manufacturing partner so because the
whole supply chain is very complicated
and you can I Oh ties the whole supply
chain but that's not the objective heads
pretty complicated so let's look at the
most important part which is the
manufacturing part of the supply chain
and in that manufacturing plant so one a
year ago we asked the question we all
got together along with ISC bangalore in
fact i don't know where the simple
either so we met with the friends DC
Department they bring some great work in
Wi-Fi deployment and an IOT so I said
look my team said let's let's go to a
factory where we have access to now the
biggest challenger who will give you a
factory because things are being
manufactured right you don't want
disrupt operations because you take one
day factory you know how much losses or
it could be tens of thousands of dollars
right so nobody gives you a factory and
come and say hi Joe tamanna iota in a
factory it's not easy so remember that
okay it's easy to think you know I can
go to any factory now I said no my
friend they won't give you the factory
their proprietary issues this
confidentiality this issue of revenue
loss we were lucky so we have a factory
in goa which really makes PCB boards
okay so when you you when you go to the
ATM there are none were just talking
about you about our go experience and
there you are so welcome Anna so so
under than I and but ten others went to
the Goa factory and we said look let's
ask a question here is an assembly line
and what does every line does is it
comes out with a PCB boot and whether
the board word goes in the ATM machine
so whenever you take your money highly
likely that board is made by the TCS
factoring go of exported to Germany
another play
this too it's my small factory size of
probably half the acrc abilities it's
not it's not that small too and so we
said all right Adam you may recall too
so we said all right let's take all kind
of sensors with us the dumps the most
dump sense of the RFID tags so we will
take RFID readers we will take the
Arduino boards of course they have
raspberry PI's will have an endeavor
favorite you know our favorite sensor
devices that you use an ec right all
kinds of sensors we will take whether
berkeley modes and then so the first
question is where you put these IOT
devices that's not easy when you put
there where are the pain points in each
stage see there many stages right so
your raw material comes over so what
happens is just in a one-minute peak
sobo empty board comes in phase one then
you can see the spools over here right
here the old machine so each school has
a component so one school has inductor
one has a resistor one has capacitor
forces connectors so each pool has the
millions of components in there turning
and when the board comes back back back
with his second they place the
components goes to the next stage their
inspection goes to the oven goes to all
kinds of soul drink all all done
automatically and finally the part comes
out which is the finished pad or FG is
finished goods or sfg semi finished
goods now there is a manual inspection
over here because human beings are the
best in composition they know what's
defective just by looking at it assuming
they've worked in for many years in the
assembly line right you can't automate
looking at something and figuring out
what is defective you could use cameras
that's a research work going on in many
industries but the cameras could make a
mistake we false positives and false
negatives so you wanted it you want to
rely on human beings not everywhere but
in many places so that comes the end
product which is your PCB board so we
should all right we will i authorize
this factory wheel for rfid tags on the
board now the problem we will have to
solder it no problem the board will move
across stages so what do we know from I
RFID readers well we know the count how
many at least we'll RFID is great in
counting right we'll can count all
components we can figure out if some
product is not there so if a resistor is
missing on the board we can find that
out if a capacitor is missing we can
find it out if the angle is different we
can find it out so we can't do
everything but this was an experiment
and what this did was this all right now
we have iota is this factory we spent
three days in Goa love the evening of
the beach but the morning of a hard work
and by the time it was treated we said
all right now we have a great set of
ideas which we will take it to the
industrial Internet consortium which we
actually did and now we have a
well-known running platform which is led
by TCS and we work closely with Cisco's
and Siemens and Oracle's and infineon
each of them are looking at their own
components inside at n to n black well
tell you what the platform so this what
led to this famous figure can I show
this probably I can ok well so this
figure is a figure so here is a
technical architecture of what a test
bed looks like right so on the edge dr
you know what the edges edges where the
access points are way or i would be tags
are so all the sensors actuators are are
in the edge here is a factory we were
mimicking we were actually visited all
the data from the factory will go to the
edge cisco has it by the way did you
know we were in cisco a few days ago
cisco has come out with lead to the
routers which sit inside a manufacturing
plant and I didn't know that I said oh
really out of the manufacturing plant so
how the different so Cisco expert lme
well these routers are rugged routers
their wireless routers they work on
Wi-Fi and why industry because they can
work across any harsh environment so all
your data that you collect in the
industry or in assembly line of land
flow goes to the access point TCS has a
platform called tea cup tea cups and
fatigue TCS collect universe platform
it's an IOT platform that we have it is
available if you want to use it so we
have all kinds of tea or the HT or the
platform tier where the where the cisco
fog director is and finally you have the
end enterprise tier which has all the
analytics engine the erp and the cloud
yes no known you cannot physically place
in each component you can only so that's
a good very good question so here is
your PCB board you can't touch the
component very sensitive you only place
the rfid tag may be at you appended at
the back so you solder it at the back of
the board you can't touch the components
but that's so that's the other senses
right so we don't only have RFID tags so
we have many sensors that are there
Buckley board we have run with modes
that we had and I'll tell you some other
research questions we have all kinds of
sense right so we really have a
heterogeneous bunch of sensors each of
them are doing their role RFID is only
one row it's only per board everybody
cannot be / component won't explain what
be cost-effective just to share with you
even the question of how many tags how
many tags and where is not as an open
question it's not obvious so apparently
Allen would know best ec has come out
with a great tool is he is coming to the
great tool which if you feed in the
parameter will tell you where to place
the sensors at what distance because
it's all about radio propagation right
and how many what is the critical
minimum number of sensitive that's not
obvious right you know what span blow
your money putting hundred tags and you
don't want to put five bags because that
won't give you any results so so just to
summarize part one of the talk that you
have all kinds of platform that are
coming out remember it's your the focus
of this workshop is only here the last
mile IOT but look at the end to end
picture there's deep analytics there is
cloud there is a glow heater there are
platforms so just to excite the audience
that when we talk about an end to end
picture it's everything not just the
tags that's the last mile all right cell
phone just starts from your cell phone
but look at the back end it's huge right
base station base station controller MSC
and the list goes on and on but that's
the whole story over here okay so that's
really the summary of the excitement
that are going on in industry in
industrial internal so what is
industrial Internet of Things when you
want to leverage IOT in an industrial
manufacturing setting then that's the
whole work space of industrial Internet
of Things and that is lead led to a very
interesting concept called industry 4.0
so Germany as you know one of the world
leaders in manufacturing and I don't
know why but they really are the best in
the world and manufacturing anything
leather scars or other components and
Germany came out with a new term called
industry 4.0 and here are the enablers
now therefore the new word for
manufacturing is is called digital
manufacture and I think an answer is
obvious that anything that we do in our
own area and computer
whether it is mobile pervasive computing
right it's sitting in a factory floor
and I will give you some example cloud
well back-end has to be a plow level all
the data go you can't put it on the fog
you can you certainly can't put an IOT
so you gotta put the data and the cloud
private or public you need to leverage
social media I'll come to that you need
big data analytics every time you are
gathering data you need to do semi
real-time analytics is not real time
okay and finally AI and robotics uh
playing a huge role almost every company
is asking a question how can i leverage
cognition to make my systems smarter so
one of the things i want to share with
our friends today is that I OT world is
the all-knowing like physically IOT that
dumb world if you can add intelligence
on the higher layers the higher layers
are edges could be access points this
talk of their friend this morning and he
said I put intelligence at the edge
which will try to do some wonderful
shaping and and all kinds of things to
your traffic to make it all kind of
intelligence on the edge so if you could
throw some intelligence and define those
algorithms at the edge or at the fog or
even at the IOT devices from extend
that's the novelty of the space that
we're talking about that's the killer
one of the killer areas and everybody's
focusing on not easy but that's the
whole idea so industry 4.0 is all about
leveraging everything we are doing in
our area in computer science and EE and
seeing how can you make the performance
of industry better which me better
products higher quality products higher
throughput and everything better and
therefore you make more money and you
have less losses so you lose you what
minimize your losses able to maximize
your profits and indeed it is turning
out now that if you leverage these
technologies and many more i have this
not exhaustive you will definitely come
out with smarter and better products
that's why it's called smart
manufacturing okay so smart
manufacturing is a superposition of all
these technologies and many companies
are now trying to see how do you explore
explore all these technologies in the
manufacturing context all right so with
that let me come to some interesting
experimental results in either side is
the work in progress and then many
experiment that we've done I thought
share with you one of the experiments so
let us look at the industrial Internet
of Things
and let's see some results from some
early experiments alright so here was a
question that we are so what we asked
what look what is IOT so you want to put
so we're talking about manufacturing
right so I'll deploy IOT all over my
factory flow let's say I'm making a car
I'll put I OTO everywhere wherever i can
write at each stage of the manufacturing
process but the problem is that if I OT
does all the computation and
communication i am going to kill the
poor fellow it is highly
resource-constrained these small devices
right and I'll show ya I will come to
this all these small devices whatever
they may be they could be your whisk
modes that are is he works on they could
be Berkeley most they could be in tags
they hardly have any the resource the
the processing power and memory is very
limited so you really want to outsource
you want to offload as much as possible
but you can offload to your neighbors
because you are you're killing your
neighbors so you really want to offer it
to a higher layer which presumably has
more intelligence because that layer has
more resources so what's the premise of
the story that we are trying to
understand which I know I otra is a
smart manufacturing plant and we are
trying to understand how can we make it
as safe a safer or more efficient and a
more optimized point through IOT and if
I can give you some percentage number
that convince you read it indeed does
better then I've done my job hopefully
it'll excite the audience to take it
further in a real setting ok now they're
all kind of sensor so one of the
questions we grapple with in our
environment that we work in now all
kinds of multimodal sensors so they're a
vibration sensor this of course rfid
rectum RFID right that's because
counting this temperature this humidity
there's hazardous gas with monitoring
pressure and the list goes on and on law
is that now if they're one sensor that
gives you all know it does not you
really go to buy all flick them in an
arduino board i'll show you the figure
that i'll show you the experiments so
it's a lot of work by our software
engineers but they're really smart these
days so they can get away with all that
they can you know resolve all this but
the whole point is that you don't you
can't do with one sensor you will need a
plethora of multimodal sensors to be
able to answer fundamental questions
that we are talking about ok so the
problem is that so it's clear that if
you want to really understand the
factory and take it to the higher order
you really need to eyota I that sohail
example right so so let us define a
vanilla architecture now what's vanilla
vanilla mean that here are these dumb
IOT devices they are placed wherever you
want to place them in a flow let's say
the floor is an assembly plant which
makes the pc votes doesn't matter so you
figured out where to place them this is
stage one stage to take you wherever you
place them in some nice topology right
and so these are all IOT devices now
look at this figure and and all the i/o
devices eventually talk to your ass
berry pie one or two doesn't matter how
many but they eventually talk to the
lightweight base station which is a
raspberry pi so how does it go so now
look at what happens I'm sensing the
machine I'm sensing all kinds of
parameters I shared it in the last slide
and look what's happening and so they're
all sending data to from the rightmost
rightmost to the leftmost column and
it's finally going to the base station
it eventually of course we'll go to the
cloud because you can't do analytics
that deep analytics can only be done at
the clouds right so eventually what's
happening but say the problem with this
solution interestingly when I was
talking to some PG students in ISE it
was interesting but what serendipity
turned out that some of the students
working in some of them working in their
research PhD problems there was some
overlap with what we had done last year
so they are now beginning to think of
these problems which I thought was a
excited a lot of cause of thinking alike
so look at the challenge in this figure
right so let me just finish the picture
and then talk about it so look at the
rightmost site so the right post side
has a few sensors it's sensing
vibrational temperature humidity dot dot
dot there's no congestion here and there
in low energy consumption in a jamming
power so we really measuring the power
so we actually do power measurements
i'll show you the next few slides and as
the data goes on the left side you find
out the network you're getting more and
more congested and these devices are
expending more energy right because they
have more data coming through so there's
they are chugging out more data and so
the net energy consumption per device as
you move from right to left is
increasing yeah just
oh no no no everything right now is
battery-powered everything so that's the
whole idea you don't want my advice you
don't want why the devices for example
let us take our energy meter you just
want to you want to find the right place
where you can just attach it to a to a
machine component you don't want to wire
tonight ideally right now they are but
the whole idea is you want completely
pervasive environment okay because you
know you want to move it around and even
those in idle doesn't change so observe
there as you go from right to left you
are having more and more congestion it
traffic congestion and therefore it's
ready to move power consumption and so
in some sense that's not the best thing
so the IOT systems in this context
really suffer from high and uneven
energy consumption so what's the first
takeaway on the left side you know so
that there is a complete uneven
distribution of energy and the traffic
load okay and that's not surprising at
all it's fairly two tables alright so
the IOT systems tend to suffer from high
congestion at the n nodes the end nodes
or the last mild right side and that's
because of the topology and so it
becomes a nightmare if they know well
load balancing you don't want that it
can lead to serious problems and so it
can result in a non satisfaction of
service or agreements and overall high
energy consumption like a result in
increased carbon footprint if there are
hundreds of devices you don't want to
throw away the resources all right so
what's the solution well so we want to
improve the reliability of these
networks and we really want to reduce
the overall energy consumption now
that's one metric energy not the only
metric but I am focusing on energy right
now you could talk about improving
through port or minimizing the latency
which we will talk about but right now
I'm just focusing on minimizing the
power / energy consumption power energy
related right trivial relations so and
so two things we want to do we want to
minimize we want to minimize the total
energy clubs is Sigma of E I Sigma
across all the devices you want to
minimize it number one number two you
want to load balancing you don't want an
uneven distribution of an of traffic
because that doesn't serve your purpose
right there what will happen is then
some load will fail very quickly and
you're going to replace them and now you
are running helter-skelter you don't
want that to happen yes
so I right so you you read my next you
can have conceived my next few slides
that's right so I am coming to that
partly you answer lies in the next few
slides but partly in a sec so what's the
solution so one of the solution we
propose a holla which is really the
whole aside for heuristics was plural
several heuristics and opportunistically
selecting links at devices and I'll
explain that in just a few seconds from
now okay so let me skip through all that
let me come straight to the picture
bigger picture conveys much more than
what these this stupid text right so
here is a piece of what we did was we
say all right now we know that if you go
to a plan flow you go to any
manufacturing setting right what does
scenario look like every worker has
available right so today when you go to
a GM plant and I'm talking to experience
it's not just a randomly cooked used use
case every worker is carrying a
smartphone and when I use the word
smartphone I include variables so he as
he or she has an ipad or a samsung note
pad or specific devices that are given
to gym workers as they sit in an
assembly plant and by the way so the
tablets are pretty fancy every tablet
tells you exactly what's happening in
the plant or the temperature is higher
there or there is a problem with this
stage because if they don't know that
then you can lead to see this production
problems and if one stage goes down then
the or you can have millions of dollars
of losses you know one hour of shutdown
or for GM plant can lead to can lead to
a havoc in your revenues so you can't
afford that so every worker has smart
devices they are not just smartphones
they're all kinds of devices so that's
the assumption now that's the higher
layer now convince yourself that smart
device is obviously a higher layer to
the IOT devices and so these devices
have much more bandwidth they have
multimodal interfaces so their Wi-Fi
their bluetooth they have cellular LT
name it they have all kinds of nfe NFC's
and so this is the higher layer and then
now they're talking to the IOT device
the dumb my OT devices at the lower
layer now if only we could do that if we
could do
this think about this if we could now
now you know the problem with the with
the legacy figure right with the vanilla
architecture if you could do this
hypothetically if you could define a
cluster right so I don't ask me how to
define a cluster that's the research
problem right so we did define but the
work is goes on the work in progress so
if we could define a cluster and and
then choose the best smart device near
the cluster choose the best I'm not
saying to the nearest choose the best
i'll define what the best is then that's
a nice candidate to serve as an access
point for this cluster similarly you
define this cluster and you define that
cluster and you choose the best smart
devices which running on top of the
ivory devices and now if you try to
offload as much data as possible to the
cluster head which is really the smarter
device because they have more resource
energy they have much more memory and
power then you and then in turn what
these devices will do is that so because
the cloud lets the vaio tease finally
these cluster heads or smarter device
will then send the data
opportunistically to the cloud what do I
mean by opportunistically well there are
many interfaces so at any point of time
you are measuring that the energy
expended on each interface okay so and
then you choose the best interface okay
what's the best interface well it is a
function of the service level agreement
what is the upper bound on delay what's
the packet loss probability so you
really define SLS and that's how you
choose the best interface not from here
from the smart devices and then you
throw out the data from the best
interface to the back end whatever the
back end is so what's the summary of the
slide summary is that you create
cloudlets of these sensor nodes you
opportunistically offload sensor data to
the higher layer and with that in mind
hopefully you will conserve energy now
will you i don't know let's let's see
let's see what we did so here are some
experiments so that summary of the slide
is that hole ah which is the which is
the heuristic reduces the total energy
consumption the Sigma AI and also
distributes the energy evenly across the
diverse IOT device let's take an example
off and then many related work over here
the word you know the literature has
different stuff it it unites it
basically has sleep awake cycles
it has tweaking with the mac layer
literature does not really talk talk
about exploiting diversity across
different layers throwing data across
different layers to minimize your energy
consumption right not that we know all
right so let's go straight to avoid some
of the percentage improvement that we
see but before I do that I like to
remind you this is an experimental study
go back by simulations because you can't
study scalability with the actual
experiment you can simulate it but you
first have to do an experiment if you
don't do experiments then the values
you'll plug in your simulator are going
to be junk because you will be
questioned how you got those values and
there's no way you can validate the data
the values of the parameters and what
their what their exact value is right so
what we said was all right we will go to
the be leveraged the famous arduino
boards Arduino Uno boards so we will
have Arduino boards placed all over the
factory floor these are very good to
good boards because and I'll show you
why so Arduino boards are run by the
atmel atmega processor which is pretty
robust it's a well-known processor the
sensor that we work on other Bluetooth
communication the communication module
is Bluetooth the sensor the RFID
vibration sensors temperature and
humidity sensors we really are working
with several sensors it is a nice
picture so here is what goes to did in
in his experiment so he said I want to
build everything from scratch so here is
my arduino device and look at the number
of sensors the list goes on and on this
is not exhaustive because we are talking
he started had most sensors and i figure
out what sensors do we add let's look at
some other important sensors so rag
right from temperature sensors to
vibration to bluetooth or to rfid this
is rfid reader and you can see that here
is an arduino board which ever look this
insight it's really the size of this a
little bit bigger than the size of a
cell phone okay it's big but you know
you really can't at this stage you can't
further compact it so here is what your
whole our device prototype
implementation looks like and when you
have a large number of these you are now
ready to play games in an actual setting
okay so it's a plug-and-play device you
can remove some sensory we don't want
them you can add if you want them so not
a problem at all and now let's look at a
skip that now let's look at yeah so so
what we did was every time we would
I am submitting a packet or receiving a
packet from the Arduino boards so we
started with one sensor right if just
one sensor measure do all the
measurements the next slide will have
will show you the measurements then you
add the second sensor you repeat the
measurement and then the list goes on
and on and on finally we have the whole
complex ecosystem and you take the
measurements and this then leads to some
interesting observations right so so
think a look at this so when you have
nothing in Arduino it's idle you are
consuming that much milli watt of power
whatever the number it doesn't matter
what the numbers the whole concept is
important not the actual numbers when
you have one sensor activated vibration
sensor you are consuming more and it's a
monitor and increasing which turns out
to be that as you add to censored
obviously you'll consume more power but
the up but this is interesting the
moment you enable bluetooth transceiver
look at the energy that you're expending
it's significantly higher than Brutus
was not there because bluetooth has so
many phases the discovery phase there's
a communication phase right you're
discovering the device and you hope you
have all kind of power measure up our
faces there and finally yeah and
discovery phase it turns out takes
really a significant amount of power so
so these are measurements done using
arduino boards across diff diverse
settings and they led to these values
and these values were repeated many
times it's not just the experiment done
once you I think it appealed in for
months and months till finally convince
themselves these are the right values
and it turns out the radio frequency
emitter receivers do use significant
amount of energy so when you and you
know this because when you switch on
your Wi-Fi on your cell phone or the
rate of brain is is really rapid it'll
kill your battery so it's not surprising
at all right so here is a first figure
that tells you that ever increase the
number of sense this is obvious this
figure is obvious right as I increase
the number of sensors my power
consumption goes up but interestingly it
goes up significantly when you have
bluetooth on or or Wi-Fi enabled right
compare it compares comparative and
brutal not there ok so now what we do is
we all the all the values we get from
that experiment that we did we now have
a simulator ns2 whatever ns3 and in that
simulator we then you know put 700
devices in a factory floor setting
whatever that grid is I don't think it's
uh it's a very
nice streamlined grid it's a grid which
we came out from a factory floor and so
you define that grade you define all the
parameters of the factory you have
obviously of channel model you need a
wireless channel model and so assuming
that we have a fixed wireless channel
model with all the parameters of the
Markov chain a two-state markov chain
you now compare the whole last system
hula hula is our system where you are
leveraging the smart device floor the
variables and you compare it with a
vanilla system the dump system which
only where only IOT devices measure and
send it to the back end and the first
set of results as time goes by and if
you look at the park induction on the
y-axis the vanilla vanilla is the blue
one the vanilla power expended is is
strictly more than the hula okay now now
here the catch we are not measuring the
power of the smart phones we are not so
the results here exclude the energy of
the smart phones why well the assumption
is that the real resource constraint
devices are the IOT devices not this
much of course that experiment has to be
done with smartphones they have it but
the logic is as you go up the layers
there's more and more intelligence so do
we really need to measure but ample do
you want are you worried about the park
attention of your Wi-Fi access point I'm
not worried about our wife access point
I'm worried about the laptops of my cell
phones or smartphone but me did okay
good question so very good work so there
is mobility but the mobility now we do
capture mobility so there is a mobility
model but the mobility in the in the in
the environment i'm talking about is
very constrained mobility nobody is
running in a factory crew so they're
walking around they're checking the
health of the machines they're looking
around and they adding parameter is it
checking so they are walking so it's a
walking speed so even when you walk with
your variables or smart device
performance degradation is not
observable but you start running around
her factory all this will go really go
haywire but then you have to have better
mobility morning yeah yeah
it's dynamic is so you are so you can
have many smartphones on the higher
layer another question which one should
I choose so you use some heuristics to
choose the best one the link quality so
you choose a blink which is the most
robust link and you choose that now that
can change dynamically as you rightly
said so the mobile move that can change
sure so obviously when you start the
experiments you are giving starting
device and then you inject a little bit
of mobility little bit of mobility yes
this cluster right so let me go back to
that yeah right right they directly
transmitted to the best smartphone at
that point in time yeah
no no we did not we did not so now you
are talking about the nuances of the mac
layer no we did not so by the way the
mac is the well-known csma/ca mac now we
didn't week with the mac at this point
in time there is a work that we are now
we are asking ourselves that if we now
there's been some reason to believe that
if you change the csma/ca mac to TDM a
mac you will do better but my am worried
about TD bem mag because how do you
synchronize entire system at you the
large number of devices so my worries
that you you have a lot of energy
overhead and just try to synchronize the
device even though it's a pan personal
ad network but still you go to see
chronometer all the motor on good
question all the modes for all other
side it's our experiment 1 phase 1 a
permutation combination is not what to
look at where amongst these devices
amongst these yeah
yeah you are but then the mac is I mean
that's the mac question right the media
access control will take care of that so
what does Mac tell you max says gay who
will talk at what point in time so
that's not our headache but yeah so to
answer his point they assume all are
active because my we inject sleep you
know the cycles over here sleep or wake
cycle that is itself will take expend
some over so we look let's just put
everything in our ab initio simple mode
and now try to answer some question so
see the thing is we have first trying to
answer how can you leverage benefits by
by offloading data to higher layers now
they could be another layer by the way
the other layer over here or shown that
that layer the layer of small access
points I have shown that because I don't
need to show that that's a very strong
layer except that is a but there you're
moving around right there is a mapping
with Jeremy yeah but keep in my option
that's right but remember that we are
also trying to figure out which is the
best interface at each of this device we
also figuring out what's the best way to
define a cloud layer because if we want
energy as a metric you want to make sure
that whatever you do yields minimum
energy expand our right energy expended
of the minimum but that's why I mean
except that except the one difference is
the scale is much more over here so if
you have n devices over here you
probably have root n smart devices at
the higher layer root and register
random function but of that order of
root n right ok so so let's look at so
it's clear it's intuitively clear that
yeah but me
oh so you have all kinds of measurement
tools so you actually you actually are
so all the words are on all the sensors
are on you actually measuring the power
expended when you transmit off receive
the package that's the that work has
been going on for a long time even in
the Wi-Fi community from the brutal
community you just use you tap your
standard power meters they all kind of
power meters over there so you can of
tap the power meter then you actually
measure so I repeat we are not we are
measuring we taking one Arduino board
and they're measuring power across all
the sensors and actuators when after
another and seeing the change is there
so you're really starting from scratch
with nothing there was only an RFID
reader I don't remember that can share I
can show that ok side of the paper yeah
I'll dig it out now off the top yeah
no no no no no no no it's only the power
the total power consumed in sending the
data from the IOT devices to the
opportunity to the nearest smart device
nothing to do with the smart device does
not include a smart device it is
offloading absolutely it is that it's
exactly that well let's look at this
figure so this is interesting so some of
the question will be answered now
because you know I let me just come to
the point so look at the vanilla figure
so look at the figure carefully right so
don't worry about evolution of time this
tells you about you know this the
convergence no matter what time you are
and let's look at after certain time
that we are measuring the distribution
of power is very skewed right says
remember that the extreme right had a
you know you are starting to measure the
is trying to measure extreme right and
there is sending data in the in the
legacy system in the vanilla system when
Ella means there is no smart devices
right and then the entire data goes on
to the access point to the Raspberry Pi
not surprising that your power
distribution is skewed so the highest
part consumed is devices are close to
the Raspberry Pi and the lowest by
expendables devices that a further
support indras paper not surprising at
all we know this from the networking
world right to the time you started
Network my ad hoc networks because
you're human and data towards the
raspberry PI's going only in one
direction right but this is not a good
thing to do because what will happen is
the consequences or this will die very
quickly you don't want a uneven you know
random distribution or unbalanced
distribution and now look at this figure
just look at this figure carefully now I
don't want to look at these but trust us
and I'll be happy to send you a paper or
set of papers that these values are
significantly lower now this is the hola
par consumption villa is the proposed
when you are leveraging the smart
devices when you are offloading data
from the IOT devices to the smart
devices this is the sum of the energy
across all the IOT devices look at what
you see you see that the first
observation fairly nice distribution of
far-right distribution energy fairly
nice it's not completely even it cannot
be but it's much better than the
previous in a previous crazy figure the
number two opposition is that the power
levels
sigma e AI is strictly lower which you
can't see from here but you can gather
from over here so if you if you map this
figure right then you will be able to
convince yourself that when you leverage
the smarter devices the report variables
and they all kind of variables in the
market now you will do much better in
terms of total energy expended by the
iot system okay so that's the key
takeaway of leveraging smarter devices
in an IOT words so the model of the
stories this once so the modular stories
do not use do not end your work or do
not just focus only on the IOT layered
which i call it the lowest physical
layer because it may not give you it may
not yield much dividends because it's a
highly resource constrained layer and
what if God forbid a few IOT devices
conch off you know they just die out now
you are in further trouble yeah no not
really well what's happening it's
stabilizing with time because well
initial transients died out with time
that's why you saw that gap also is
increasing a little bit with time now
that just because when you start
measuring you know with time that's why
we had we had this extended period of
time see when you measure over an
extended period of time you are able to
get much better but much better averages
and so there's a there's that you're
just moving the transient flight and the
process could be because of many reason
so just showing that at the end of the
day the difference is not that much but
at the end of the day you are
stabilizing at a very nice even
distribution and the and if you compare
this figure or any figure with the
vanilla figure the power is strictly
lower it's a strict inequality all right
so what are we doing now well so now the
work that we extending is well let's
look at some some more relevant indo
propagation models let's introduce so
one of the things that we are grappling
with is how i OT in an environment that
i am talking about is a harsh
environment and so modeling of your RF
radio frequency the challenge what you
mean by that the channel model is not
your standard ha kagame channel or all
the kind of channel you've got to figure
out what the right channel modulus
number one number two you have a lot of
metallic surfaces this huge attenuation
there's water there's all kind of
chemical
they all kind of metallic surfaces we
need to understand the performance of
IOT devices in this new environment
which the world has woken up to in the
last few years so please don't just take
a paper from production or wireless
networks and just map it to your
environment over here because may not
work you could figure out what that
gentleman and among if you remember that
and I'm going to share something what we
did when we went to the Goya factory and
under his team you actually be deployed
the sensors and we saw that you know
it's horrible deployment because the
activation is terrible so even the right
place where you put your sensor and then
we use the user simulator to figure out
which is right placement and how many
IOT nodes so even the question about how
many and where is not a trivial question
the research question in the environment
that I'm talking about okay be available
after the talk to talk to you at length
about our experiments that we did along
with ifsc value okay and finally let's
mimic a factory environment as much as
possible and what better than to go to a
factory so my current endeavor is to
plead to go to a Tata Motors plant or a
plant near bang load a Titan plant and
to actually and this is work in progress
and talking to colleagues and Aston low
give us a day where we will go with ISC
bangalore and colleagues will actually
try to model a plant and put it in a
simulator so there's a lot of work going
on in digital twin because you can't you
can't go to real factories in your life
beyond the point you nobody will allow
you but can you go and capture the
nuances in a digital twin which is a
simulator and if the simulation is
correct I tell you can come out with
central action papers some number a
plethora of good papers because the
model has to be right so what are we
doing now so I'm going to wind up my
talk in that this probably take 10
moment we started about seven minutes
late so in it okay if I wind up a free
10 right so here what we're doing now
something very interesting now let's
move on to something more exciting so we
are see we don't have access to a
factory can we make happy with our home
so we said all right in u.s. every home
as a washer-dryer complex refrigerators
fancy dishwashers and the list goes on
and on and on so let's put these Arduino
boards and here is the figures i'll come
back to fix so there are many by the way
they are many at this shown you four
plus the old one
there are about tens of these and each
of these we put them on each of the
machines all right and each machine has
a signature now I'm sure you'll agree
with me that the signature of the
refrigerator is different from that of a
dryer or a dishwasher right so the
signatures vibration are different so
now what we are doing is that each of
the Arduino board which has multimodal
sensors is measuring data and it's
creating a time series and this is a
visa multiple time series right so
temperature time series tau to eat
pressure pressure P I humidity a chive I
bration VI VI and so we now have n time
series and we are fusing all these time
series at the rest berry pie and we are
learning some nice lessons now let us
see what lesson we are learning the
challenge is what do you do when you
fuse these time series I'm going to
leave that as an open question because I
can't share everything over here what do
you do with these multiple time series
of the access point or other Raspberry
Pi it's something you could do with
analytics to answer some fundamental
questions okay so that's a very
interesting question that we are tempted
answer as I talk here yeah but that that
is true but the question that we taught
or dress is that each of your mechanical
device has a signature and therefore
they've there n devices i have n
signatures each device has multimodal
sensors for have and if they are let's
say m sense of an M time series you're
fusing all MN time series on an eye at
an access point and the question try to
answer now can you do some predictive
dot dot dot dot can you predict
something about failure or about
malfunction and something what probably
that's a great point where that's a
great question probably not because many
of these devices are right are right
next to each other severe whereas so you
know you can of yeah that is a great
point so probably not because one of the
objective is to exploit spatio temporal
correlations so we are deliberately
trying to have similar devices together
and even when the devices are identical
the signatures are different now
it is good to be significantly different
and so the question that eventually at
the second order advances what do you do
with this patio temporal correlations so
that answers the question so the devices
are not that dissimilar there are
similarities because we are we are there
many washes their many refrigerators
okay so so hopefully this mimics a
factory environment closer than just
putting them in your lap because lab
really doesn't do much all right all
right and again we repeat experiments
with Park assumption across these
devices now these are devices by the way
these devices have now we have your more
components so we have more devices like
ni RF so there's a new RF interface
zigbee is all kinds of protocols and
links you can keep adding and measuring
the PI expended and repeat the
experiments that we have all right and
again when you repeat the venue for this
patio temporary distributed network when
you repeat the experiments you do the
same thing you see the same observation
that energy is evenly distributed and
its signal significantly lower than if
you were not to leverage a smart smart
set above you which is a set of smart
device all right and the work goes on
and on and on so what's the what's the
summary i'm not going to repeat this
because this is really a really kind of
being repetitive and in the interest of
time I'm going to tell you what's the
what's awesome what is not some of the
exciting research problems that are
likely to keep many of us in this room
busy so I'm going to skip that that
summary of my talk and you know what
talking about but just one somebody that
if you don't have a POC if you don't
have a proof of concept and if you only
do simulations I will I don't think many
of us will ever accept the paper at all
you've got to have some proof of concept
doesn't matter what the environment you
got to mimic it if you can't visit her
car manufacturing plant but you can't
visit a big plant mimic it and see how
to mimic it along with the university
partners all along with your colleagues
in the industry right so that's an
important point to make so what's the
future landscape where are we going from
now what's the future going to look like
first thing is that the smart factories
plants and assembly line will heavily
depend upon emerging technologies and
novel services my friends the killer
thing today that everyone is talking
about is what are the killers
services and my favorite example is to
one is general motors on star so if you
if you subscribe to an OnStar service in
a car OnStar know their everything about
your car everything diagnostics
prognostics everything and my other
favorite example is the favorite
insurance in the u.s. progressive
insurance so I remember that you know if
you buy a dongle in the u.s. you buy a
USB called progressive from a company
called progressive and put it inside
your car's dashboard your insurance can
dynamically change depending upon how
you drive if you drive well if you're a
good boy and if you're a good girl let's
not talk about what good means your
insurance goes down and if you are a bad
boy you visit many bars late at night in
mg road right and let's not elaborate
then your insurance goes up and if you
drive you know if you take random turns
if you don't if you're not a good driver
your insurance goes up what and what an
example of a killer service on top of a
setup like a car and I suspect that in
every mechanical setup in the times to
come we'll have services which will play
a big role and I think a lot of us but
that's Microsoft or whether it's TCS or
IBM or any other company are really
looking at what are the killer services
because technology of the lower layer
has become it's become really a
commodity you can't play much role in
Mackley and physical layer only doing
the physical was talking to my colleague
here Shiva what do you do in physical
layer it's it's owned by Cisco it's
owned by junipers can do anything they
even Cisco car do anything they're
looking at services at the higher layer
so the summary is that in course of time
in the years to come you will find that
technically you in the technical
landscape there will be a lot of talk
about big data analytics distributed
analytics I was talking about cooling
the Microsoft about distributed machine
learning and big data analytics in IOT
devices all pervasive systems leveraging
cloud but I think in my view the two
biggest areas that will keep us busy at
least in our lifetime I don't know about
the next after 100 years but in the next
20-30 years if you can define algorithm
which are going to provide cognition
which means self-healing networks
self-learning networks and improve and
make a system more intelligent you're
going to make big bucks and going to
have the name and fame
and cybersecurity oh I tell you this
area is keeping us busy awake all the
nights and cybersecurity the nightmare
in the car and what do you know that
last year charlie miller broke the car
sitting one mile apart from his laptop
Charlie Miller in Chris valasek and they
have become celebrity than they've
joined over research labs in California
now so so all kinds of things in
cybersecurity are emerging in IOT I have
no clue about how security would look
like in IOT it's an open question I also
know that if you work on cybersecurity
in IOT you can have 50 papers in the
next few years the space is so wide open
finally since we are all in industry
many of us are industry the business
landscape we need to define some great
use cases that benefit industry and that
in turn will define new platforms and
services and one of the endeavor that we
are looking at is defined new platform
that we can sell to customers to our
partners including University and look
use the platform it gives you end to end
cybersecurity or gives you n 2 and
reliability so if you could do that then
you really you know no it's really going
to take you great heights and finally
you need to actually play with
deployments of IOT devices in an
environment which is realistic doesn't
matter what the environment if it's
hospitals and go to the hospital deploy
IOT devices retrofit them with in
patients go to a manufacturing plant or
go to a Boeing plant or a GM plant if
you can because if you don't I or ties
if you are not realistic about
deployment in other words if you don't
go to an actual environment your model
will be incorrect and nobody is going to
accept your vino value proposition so
I'm going to end here because it's so
much to talk about this area industry
4.0 and I IOT is exploding and everyone
whether it's the car manufacturers or
now Tesla so my favorite example is
Tesla please have a look at Tesla cars
the all-electric cars they go to the
game changes in the world now because
I've been hearing that the next few
years self-driving cars are going to be
all over the world so just wait for next
few years and everything we talked about
here in IOT will be in those cards it
will be call m2m communications I
machine-to-machine but will be a variant
of IOT okay so I'm going to stop here
thanks for your attention but I love to
take questions if you have any any
questions for a g1 at the back at the
back
what I mean how you mean how often they
form a cluster you form a cluster
organically right so it depends upon the
algorithm goes running over there so you
you define a cluster organically you
grow the cluster depending upon how many
nearby how many what kind of sensors so
you really define that right you can
define what the best means you got to
put that down no no so let me repeat
nothing happens automatically eager to
define it right so when you say best
link so suppose you have k links you
have to define what is the best of the K
or how often oh that you can you can
fine-tune that parameter so for example
in our case it's once every 60 seconds I
got so that's your software defined the
paradigm so you can define how often in
our case I believe it's every 60 seconds
we're discovering yeah that is absolute
right so there's a trade-off so the more
you discover the more the more you know
frequency with which you are trying to
do things the more your overheads
absolutely and therefore the more and
that's the question that you asked about
the sleep-wake cycles similar so you got
to figure out what's the right what's
the right parameter so that you don't
miss something number one and and you
don't you know it's not overkill for
your system you got to figure it out and
that's where we are also looking at
software-defined IOT because in my view
it's such a complex world that if you
don't have a software-defined controller
there you can do nothing with IOT what
will you do you will have 100 probes you
100 measurements 100 multitude it won't
work so this has to be some controller
which talks to all the IOT clusters not
the million i will device about cluster
wise that's what the cluster is
important over here and tells you the
kind of question that you are okay so
yeah
can you please repeat the question
louder static routing devices when you
mean so give an example of size no
devices we just took what's available
off the shelf no no no so the question
we asked was let's pick an let's pick
and choose whatever is available as
accessible to everybody so even a person
who's a layman here can buy the Arduino
board can buy with molds has smartphones
can do this experiment so that was the
whole idea you could do that sure but
it's a is a simplistic setting which is
repeatable no we have we have it's not
only it's also also Wi-Fi the show
result for bluetooth we have because all
the Arduino boards have multiple
interfaces you could tap Wi-Fi just that
means realize that with Wi-Fi you go to
just deplete the devices in no time so
the price that you want to pay is going
to be significantly higher user drain
the battery and it is always on because
i am not doing the intelligence sleep
awake psychos right right so that's the
reason absolutely
if you attack the smart device no ma'am
we not look at security at all in this
experiment that's a whole new world now
if I talk about security I'll probably
need another four or five hours to just
talk about how we are handling IOT
security no no no no that's a totally
different world together in fact in my
view security and the IOT layer is
killer security I won't worry much about
security of the smoke of the smart
devices because by definition they have
much tighter policies and controls and
IOT devices I mean look at i/o devices
they're completely open right everything
is open is open source open source
software you can buy them off the
shelves we've done some work another you
probably could also you know remember
the whole discussion IOT security at
that layer that night way I do not even
know what the perimeter is forget about
a security so I won't worry about
security as the higher layers I will
worry about the lower list not that it's
it is there but I relative relatively
lower layers are critical yeah you take
one last question no I no problem
well that's a great question so so the
question is if IOT device they use only
for sensing so here the answer no
they're not only used for sensing
because many are there not i sensing is
the most demo fresh see bit sensing with
all kinds of sensing sensors at each i/o
device I have data and that data could
be critical so if i have a if not me and
that's the wrong example if a patient
has a pacemaker and i'm generating data
about the about the heart systolic
diastolic beats i want to make sure that
data doesn't go to anyone except the
doctor or the personal physician and and
the list of and so this is one example
the health care but personally the body
area networks data privacy is critical
so you don't want you want to be very
careful if the data especially if you
are in a US territory and the data is
leaked you could be in deep deep trouble
because the regulatory aspects are very
stringent over there right so it is not
only sensing its data you go to protect
the data how you do that is anybody's
push efficient okay last question make
it very quick
yeah absolutely great wait what yeah
that's many of us doing I'm you know I
know that microsoft also working in that
absolutely we do examine trade-offs so
you don't want to send everything to the
backhand because there's a there's a
latency issue there you won't do that so
you really figure out what data will you
will you offload to the higher layers
and what you will keep at the lower Liz
so let's say you keep X data here 1
minus X to the higher layers could
figure out what that X is absolute so
the more you of the more data that goes
to the fog of the cloud the more the SLA
issues so you got to figure that out
though that's a trade-off which is an
open question and there's no clear
answer because depends upon the
application depends upon the use case
dip another type of sensor yeah we will
talk offline let's thank Raji for the
interesting talk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
