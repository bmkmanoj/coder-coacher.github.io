you
it was my great pressure and yet also
was a bit gloomy to introduce Tom's
concluding talk for his internship here
so tom was originally coming from month
mountain and Videl like month with a
uruguay the country was to me originally
associated with walk up on the soccer so
i think after interacting with tongue
then this thing will change and short
time will tell you more about his
country and I I'm Tom I saw a lot of
mixture stuff so he said he's a PhD
candidate with dr alvaro in University
of Tokyo and yet himself is a faculty
member of University of Republic Uruguay
so and he's a computer engineer
researcher in human-computer interaction
and yet himself is a artist at heart so
he claims he's doing an internship here
with me but on the other hand I feel I'm
just I'm the one who's entering the
internship I learned quite a lot from
him so last not the least he's also the
co-founder of MSR media lab upstairs so
in the case you have a chance and go
visit so without further ado let's let
Tom talk about face and interactions
thank you so hi everyone thank you for
coming I osteen Sarah I'm flipping my
internship here ah chin was my mentor
and within the rope Mike which is mutiny
interaction communication the manager is
sings you thank you I'd never know how
to say I learned I have one more day to
tonight so yeah i'll start by
introducing myself still said i will
come from your way I work for the
University the public university in
revised called Universal Republic and
Spanish I am associate professor at the
engineer school where I run a small lab
in we focus in HCI cumin coriander
and also in media arts so most of the
things that do are related with art and
with interactive art I also work with
people from the School of Psychology
where I'm associate researcher I'm also
visiting professor there detector school
because a human interaction and media
arts are quite multidisciplinary so we
tend to collaborate with different
groups and different lessons I'm also
the game researcher at the National
system researcher with a public funding
system for outstanding researchers of
sorts and here at MSR I'm one of the
research fellows our DS I got the award
last year and this is my second
internship the first one worth was with
leeway in San Francisco now i'm here
with attend and this is called doing
things backwards was a phrase of undie
was there when he was we were talking
about myself and you're doing things
backwards because i'm doing an
internship after walking which has been
quite an unusual career path but the way
it's been done I started my PhD after
being appointed us as you see professor
and my advisor is Alberto cassinelli who
was given a talk here some years some
days ago from the University of Tokyo so
and i'm pretty sure everybody knows
everything about my university of my
country but just in case you did not the
university's is not very well known
internationally buys the biggest
university in he's from your wife kisses
I do or the I it's it's the biggest
university in my country I was founded
in 18-49 it's free its public we have
more than 82,000 active students ah just
to give an example almost 20,000 new
students in 2006 about 8,000 teachers
and researchers in 19 schools and this
is in your white which everybody knows
is this a small country than South
America it's quite small is about are
the 4d Americans is the about the size
of misery the state of Missouri
it's about 2% the size of Brazil and
it's to twice the size of Portugal four
times Switzerland and half of Germany so
it looks really small it's quite big in
Europe it's really small in the US or in
version and people as tinsel also said
tends to know our country because
football I don't know if you guys follow
the the soccer world cup at this we were
quite famous because we we got ganna out
of the world cup where they were hosting
it and one of the guys stop a ball with
the hands and we also organized the
first world cup and we want it went
twice and quite quite strange to me
lately I people I've been trying to love
lasts almost ten years and people as
well you're from Urijah football their
food well and some people talk about
some beaches and lately they talk about
our president because it's been named
the world poorest president he donates
about ninety percent of his salary to
try it in and that's his car and thats
he's actually going in and like to work
Tony so somehow he became kind of famous
so that's the new thing now we know by
because of him and because football and
this is my city this is my school over
there and this couple of pictures of so
when you guys want to visit me going
somewhere and do not do it in winter
well yes some is now you guys should be
there it's really nice to me to be here
no in this beautiful seattle weather
I so the things i do a 34 are mainly in
this for areas in new media art also
called media arts I'm more interested
perhaps in the art party in new media
about new media it's and it's kind of a
natural way for me to to do art also a
TI or interaction design and pretty much
interested in the interaction part and
designing interactions I think I and not
that much concerned about the actual
apparatus that we create but the design
of interactions thing that happens in
time Fred person trying to solve a
problem within a specific context also
in music by 10 to the computer music by
interested in music than computers and
in cognitive psychology special in
perception so we work a little bit
perhaps not that little in new ways of
perception and applying what we can
learn from perception on to art orange
interaction I have a couple of pictures
of Edwards mind this is how I interact
installation with LED late balloons was
quite big 200 square meters and the
balloons reacted people to sound too to
music and also we have a web interface
this is an African I mean I really like
this I this is interact installation
that people could burn a virtually a
picture of a girl who was killed by for
political reasons this is a screenshot
of a audio-visual instrument that I used
for some years to perform with bjs and
with bands and solo pieces in the world
and all these things i do some people
call it i created computing which its
kind of misleading name but it's also
interesting because it is computing it
we do create software we do create
electronics the things we do i fall
within normal things that engineering
researcher does that's why we work at
the engineer school that's why i got
invited to come here at massage but it's
create a computing in the sense that
all the things we create have this
intention of being a tool to reflect on
different things I i I'm gonna talk
about this a little bit more later but I
I I conceptualized art as I told to
reflect about meaning to create meaning
and to think about what things do mean
so his creative computing we create our
technological artifacts as ways to
actually reflect on what things in the
world can mean or do mean I'm going to
be back to that now I'm going to talk a
little bit what I actually did here we
call this talk face interaction it's
going to be quite obvious because we
created interactive things and they are
all based on face tracking we started
working uh in with this idea we asked
ourselves how can we communicate
sensation and emotional states in a
nonverbal ways that that was our main
question okay we want to communicate
things that are not variable in nature
because they can be emotional emotional
states or sensations and we also want to
communicate them in nonverbal way so
that was the first question and then we
thought okay but the natural thing to to
wonder is okay one person communicating
things to another person but that's
quite restrictive it could be like make
want to communicate it to other persons
or to ourselves or two things or two
places or two spaces so that the basic
question is quite broad okay how can we
communicate nonverbal things in
nonverbal ways to whatever
and then again I come back to this and
what would that mean what if we are
communicating some feeling to another
person or to this camp what does it mean
in terms of what we think about the
thing that we are communicating and the
communication act itself so we're
talking about a sensations and emotional
states and to be able to communicate
that we somehow need to measure that so
hard with we need to have a
representation of that so we it's okay
build it on to this idea of like the
eyes are windows to the soul I read that
many times what okay the face is quite a
reasonable way to estimate emotional
states or feelings or nonverbal
communication so if we and we also have
the Kinect face tracker which is quite
handy so if we if we can track faces and
we can recognize some gestures and
facial gestures then we have some
information that we can work with well
there's this a phrase a better to sell
my John remember that he said that
mirrors are the first interactive odd
pieces or they wear the first
interactive pieces and mirrors are also
like kind of a design patterns in media
arts you you guys have seen like bunch
of interactive art pieces that are
actually this kind of magical mirrors I
have one piece there and it has one
piece there that they're kind of mirrors
so we said okay if we have this fits
tracker and mirrors are kind of this
design pattern what what we can do and
we decided to create this which is also
similar to think that the 22 ND and
these pieces that we said to create a
mirror where you're always somebody else
so how how it works if you face the
mirror the mirror take a snapshot of you
we have the fish tracker so we know the
head position hair rotation and we know
some or we can estimate some things
about the gestures like the eyebrows
erase or their mouth is open
also the face tracker gives you some
things called animation units which are
estimations of justice would they don't
really work yet but in the future new
iterations of the fish tracker that they
could be used and this this idea of this
mirror that you're somebody else comes
I've been working with this for for a
couple of years ready with these ideas I
also work with this in on my first
internship and I call them walrus
because of I am the walrus the Beatles
song that starts with this phrase I am
here as your here's your meal we are all
together which is kind of sauce this
idea so I have a small video of this
running
there is no audio reason
it stopped all you think
so here we only have two subjects with
were seen and I but but you get an idea
and the powerpoint is not very happy
with the video I think if I close it and
open again it works I'm going to do that
sorry
but good could you see the video or
so I continued so that that was our
first prototype creating something that
again reflects on this idea of using the
face and what they face means and what
the face means for the user what what is
it we also always associate our faces or
faces with one personal okay this this
this prototype tries to reflect on that
on separate our image our preconceived
image and also and that idea that we
only had two subjects if that will run
for for a longer time then you will
always get somebody else so the second
idea was okay we have this face and this
weight tracker how can we communicate
with places or with things and for
example can we assign using the face
tracker some kind of behavior some kind
of feeling to it to a thing so we create
this this small prototype called us look
at me using the gays are some measure
okay where the user is looking at we
created some kind of networking system
so that the things that react are not
actually the computer but they
communicate over the network using a
protocol called osc2 the computer who's
doing the processor and we could have
many things that react so I again have
small video hope it works so I created
this little game that is called a look
at me and when I saw this little system
it really wants me to look at it sophie
Turner and I and its focus if it's only
done and I look at it I'm going to cover
the LED light versus too bright so if i
look at it everything is fine but if i
stop the money yeah it goes crazy if i
look close to it it just turns light on
I thought it stops for the way I don't
know and if I look either way
start by writing and it forces me to
look at it I've been trying it for a
little while and it really points really
makes me look at it say yeah and I said
no thank you for what I know the videos
used to work alright half an hour ago
but now now they don't I've been told
that that's they way it's a feature I so
the idea was okay that was also a small
prototype it has an LED light and a
vibrating motor and it's a thing that if
you're not looking at it reacts if you
start to your gaze so go away it turns
the light on and if it if you actually
look further away it vibrates make sound
everything again it's only a prototype
but the idea is ok we know how to face
how to track faces we we can estimate
things out of the face tracking for
example what the user is paying
attention to and then things can react
and again that that is interesting as a
tool to react as a tool to reflect on
and to think of what things actually
mean how what does it mean if we if we
put behavior into a specific thing but
also it cannot it can be not only things
but places so we did another is it's
more of an adversary's it's it's more
than a prototype we actually submitted
it to an art festival and i'm pretty
sure it's going to be accepted so we're
going to be showing it next year so we
have more questions if instead of
thinking about things we think about
places spaces rooms one natural thing
then i think that that I've been
reflecting on for quite a long time is
is this this room is different after we
used it if we if you come back here and
you and you know that I know Albert
Einstein was giving a lecture here do
you think this room is different or if
you know if you know that that you
yourself did a lecture here this
displays different
so do we change that the ways we think
about places because somebody was there
do we leave some kind of trace I know
it's also related with with a very very
common theme in media arts which is
surveillance I with there's probably a
camera well I'm I'm being filmed so of
course it's a camera I have Mike I sign
for it but everywhere on many places
will go to their cameras and we're not
actually aware even if we rationally
know that you're there we're not aware
of them so that's does another thing
that are often do I 2x make things
explicit by by using them as as part of
network artists can take things that we
know that they're it or perhaps we done
and show him back and again reflect on
what those things mean what does it mean
that we've been filmed everywhere what
does it mean in terms of Rights wasn't
mean in terms privacy what what does it
mean in samos I synthetics so for for
this I'm going to explain it later but
for this we created a small blink
detection system so using the Kinect
camera we can know when the user blinks
so I have a small video showing that I
just enjoyed you know if it's chocolate
then the portion of the SS cemented and
just to add if with what I know I'm
gonna blink on the screens gonna turn
white faces turned and when I blink as
you see all the screen turns white
because it's the chapter so we did that
and we created this artwork all traces
which also has some some poetry in it as
that's another aspect that is very
interesting to me what's the poetry of
the deploy tech aspects of the things
that I or that we can create so this is
on a network that captures when users of
a space blink takes a snapshot of the
face with the eyes closed and project
the faces on to that place so that is
that you go to somewhere
and you see some blurry faces that are
fading away with the ice hey guys close
and then you you think okay what what's
happening here and you blink and your
face gets capture and your face is one
of the faces that are there so how yet
another video
so here this is a screen capture so all
the faces are going to be the same place
because I'm sitting in front of computer
but when I blink they get captured and
projected
and they start to fade slowly away with
time and this is uh this is just my
office here with a projector and how
they look projected on the wall
and this is small in one of the big
monitors that we have just
one one thing that we want to do in the
future with this is to actually use the
recognition so its user gets snapshots
only ones on you how like one phase per
person that visit that space and it's
not going to be shown in in in in a in a
screen like this and it's going to be
projected onto a big place we probably
will need to use more than one camera
because I don't like the idea of all the
faces quite frankly together now I have
a snapshot here to showing how the faces
look with a as closed I'm fading away
but I this communication as I said
O'Kane the natural thing is is to ask
how to users can communicate how can we
use this thing of nonverbal face based
communication playful communication
between two users so we started thinking
okay we can use vibrating motors to
communicate things we can use tactile
feedback from the system to one user and
try to send some information that so
when we thought about the Redeemers one
of the things that we wanted to do that
we are not implementing it but this is
we have everything done for it it was
for example having some some vibrating
motors in the joints that react to music
so for some deaf person could dance or
could be helped to dance or somebody who
wants to learn to dance could teach how
to learn how to dance using that but
after we had these joints by brain joins
I said okay but we can't communicate
things we did another prototype for
which I have another video wait here are
the gays tool batteries motors so
okay so tom has some power let me look
at this direction gets modal vibrates
and look at this direction this one by
grace it's too close up currently it
this thing is why reading can't see him
the tag and then can't feel which
direction is looking at by these two
Mulder's if you like this yo gays so
again uh here we are communicating where
one user is looking at to some tactile
feedback but then we said okay we have
music that can turn into vibration or
get some contain vibration what happens
if the things we're sensing can they
turn into music so we did the other
thing which was to track the face and to
create some sounds so this little demo
what it so first one of the first things
I did so I talked about we have here as
mine but I don't like it it started just
it explains it's a system because we
worked a lot into how to use our system
within successional sound making
software today which was some kind of a
hard prone to watch video to see that it
works what I've added is a media
communication with alkali yeah you have
it here which is some production
software we have to MIDI instruments
here and one audio instrument so if we
are here in this mode in my software we
can map the hell on to some parameters
so you see here that that's a software
in my hand is reacting to the users that
has been applied to this scent was it a
parameter
my hair like this we can see here that
this changes this parameter and if I
open my mouth it would trigger a meeting
on so let's try of course it also works
with other unless it was quite
interesting for people outside my office
sing one diver a second mode that has is
to some trigger samples also enable to
life these samples can be can be here
can be warped or not can be on time or
not it exists with the notes on so okay
let's just more whenever my mouth is
going to trigger a new sample and yeah
that's the readable thank you for
watching one yeah actually did it so
that chains kids could play with it but
and okay that was kind of a brief
concept of Monica lighting sound in real
time using the face as an input
controller but it can also be more
musical or or kind of music our tunnel
of more of our real controlling system
so i created this I rata tight if I roll
retain my hair like this I can choose or
one note of the a minor pentatonic scale
and if I roll my hair like this I can
choose a different on tape so bad when i
open my face whenever my mouth will
trigger note in the outer live
instruments so this is an early maybe
the ice again after though i think not
so this without using my hands allows me
to play some basic tears some missing
maladies such as
the trucker's sometimes has problems are
following whether mouth is open or not
especially when they have is rotated
let's see how it works
this kind of handless interface allows
me to for example to play my ear and try
to make a melody with my head when I'm
playing the you at the same time uh so
let's try that I'm gonna shoot the video
off I'm gonna tell mom another silly I
Association on let's see how it goes
it's not gonna go very well
you
you
and it is not working very well let's
stop oh yes I can do they do s I know
it's gonna add weight there I really
like it actually but did you have the
practice of all know that's one that's
one good thing at this was absolutely no
practice at all it was the first take
and it I mean it is very very very bad
music very simple as this I'm I a minor
pentatonic scale and they're like the
Blues notes so sorry a e + + + D or F
but anyways with basic musical skills
its immediate how to play this but its
immediate us useless and it's like a toy
yeah of course so this this goes to our
life like late like this last last but
not least prototype which was ok now
trying to trying to I was making
everything come together of sorts so
this is what we are working on it will
probably keep on working in the future
which okay from the face go to vibration
go to music and also here is what we
call a the virtual choir which is taking
this idea of one mirror that you're
always somebody else but replicating it
into several different phases so we
built a matrix of nine faces when it's
the real mirror in the center and then
always somebody else on the other eight
and when you open your mouth those other
eight persons create sound and that
sound is specialized so it teen has a
system of specializing sound I never can
I've been trying to say that word for
two months already anyway to do that
with sound and again it's
it has nonverbal communication because
we design it I vibrating a vest of sorts
it's a facial controller and a
specialist and so here's just a
screenshot of my face coming back with
different faces from the database this
is one test running in the really bad
picture in the monitor with the faces
there and all this all this sound system
here with a special light ring yeah and
this is this is chain I and this is our
vibrating best so I took a break here I
was going to but for what so it's a
backpack with our 12 motors that they
can vibrate and we can't control them
with they react to sound but you can
control them again with the head
rotation engage I met I met one artist
in in Japan a semi was there that he is
a media artist he works with his kind of
things so he went through security here
in the US and his bag was full of these
kind of things so he got stopped and
when we hit and then he got like went
through all the scanners and everything
and then when we finally was waiting for
his back he bus has been taken to a room
and exploded say this thing sorry
top leg no no no I mean a security
personnel put it there and bombed it
they made explode just in case I was
talking about this vest ya know saying
that imagine going through this with
this to your front like I have this back
pocket so this is a close-up of of the
best with the motors and this is a video
of them kind of this a video of me doing
more city things sounds good
huh
okay i also have those videos working in
a real better way so uh what this is
this is what what we ended up doing from
from the face communicating the face and
God we can estimate or we think they can
estimate about the internal state of the
user or the performer or the desires of
performing into several things we could
map it into things or into the space or
here or into the user himself or into
different users or into music or have
the user react or from the music in this
kind of self reflecting system that the
best the best are vibrates uh we've been
trying different ways of having it react
we still don't know and that which is
kind of interesting which would be the
best and we still don't know what will
it be the best for after we know it's
the best but we only know that we trying
to communicate something but this kind
of of big system is we still don't have
a specific purpose for it it's an it's
an interesting art installation it's an
interesting performance if you see
somebody using it but we still need to
reflect them to think about what does it
point to model we did we created some
some different patterns so for example
when the user looks up right the the
models can vibrate in this I start by
brain here than there and to create a
pattern they can also react to music so
so different frequencies of the
different intensity so this motor can be
associated with I don't know
high-pitched sounds and then if the user
is looking this way and there's a high
pitch sound and the pattern will change
depending of them of the sound and yeah
so what yeah what are we going to do
next within this I this work I or at
least chin because I tomorrow's my last
day but I ok we have a tech fest a
presentation in March March or April to
remember so we're going to be showing
the last version or the next version of
this virtual choir the virtual choir is
going to have a director so we we've
been thinking about having the user
point with this his or her hand one of
the faces and making that face react in
a different way for example make it make
it louder or make it brighter or make it
something or make it that face control
the vibrating motors we I also want to
try a kind of a sequence sequencer that
you can point to one phase use your head
or your other hand or something to store
a melody and then have that face repeat
that melody so you can start creating a
different patterns of music and then you
can have adjusted to start or stop it so
it's kind of a musical instrument more
elaborate musical instrument that you
can use it in real time we've been told
that some of the things we've been doing
can be created can be ported to products
basically for the Xbox having the users
play with some things we've also been
working with slit scan in I don't know
if you guys know what's listen but it's
a way of reproducing videos or sequences
of pictures where you show different
pictures in different time stamps so it
creates some kind of wavy effects and we
want to see if we can use that with the
traces and see what happens there we
also want to try like remote
communication not it been in the same
place we have an ultimate system of the
vibration motors using Arduino switch is
wireless and it works so we might switch
to that also bi-directional
communication not only one user come in
saying things but another one user
receiving them but something more by the
directional
and of course all these things it they
really fun to do and they really find to
you so use it you use it for five
minutes and I'll what if we do this or
what if we do that so that the ideas are
are plentiful and it would be fun to to
try them out I'm and for me I want to
come back for a second to this because
for me all these are belong to my art
practice and and I've been thinking I
have to talk with Andy the other day I
I've been thinking more about why am i
am at MSR and why I work at a
engineering school I've been thinking
about this for the last and i worked at
school for 10 years and before that i
was an engineering student so I've been
thinking about what what am I actually
trying to do what am i doing for less
another 15-20 years and and I I I still
think that it makes a lot of sense and
it makes a lot of sense from
philosophical point of view and from a
practical point of view from a
philosophical point of view okay I still
think that and I'm not going to go into
what art is I really like what because
so they asked him was what what is
what's hard and he said I don't know but
if I knew I will not tell you which is
it's kind of a reasonable answer because
everybody knows and nobody knows and
everybody has his or her own conception
let's not make any sense to discuss it
but it's interesting to think of ways of
seeing art and one way of seeing art of
CR is I it's the construction of meaning
this reflection of what think from from
a semiotic and a point of view what what
things can mean if you don't have that
everything is meaningless everything has
not makes no sense at all so to have
somebody who tries to to to reflect on
what they did what's the meaning or what
the things that we create from a
technological point of view cam or
should mean I think it's really
interesting but also uh and and this is
not the same that golden Living was was
saying he was saying it better but he
was saying in that
he gave here some days ago I it sits and
it goes with this idea of creative
coding it is a creative activity that
immediately pushes the boundaries of the
technological artifacts that we have so
it's it only takes you a little bit of
work to start thinking it'd be awesome
if with this software of the hardware
could do this or go do that and and
that's I think that's that's very
important for any research institute to
try to push the boundaries of what would
you expect from any technological
artifact being it software or hardware
or both it with the face racket was a
minute I'd be awesome interface tracker
could recognize persons or we could
actually measure uh I don't know
emotional states from facial expressions
or I don't know my mansion say she's
from Lithuania and if you read any any
travel guide about Lithuania one of the
things you read this do not smile
because people don't smile there so if
you smile to people they think you are
making fun of them or that your you have
mental problems it will be interesting
to okay if you if you two to have
software or have an appliance that helps
you not to smile in lithonia or what
happens if you think about an appliance
that only works when you when you smile
I don't know your phone you're a person
with with emotional depression with
anger management problems okay why don't
you buy a phone that only allows you to
pick pick it up when you're smiling wait
we all know that are plentiful
psychology research studies that if you
smile a lot you actually get happier so
why not i mean it's it's immediate after
you start trying if you start reflecting
on what the things can mean how to how
to take that into our know several loop
of feedback of creating things
so r 2 n I would really like to to thank
team this be really fun to work with her
these three months and sing you and
everybody I love you world peace and
within our we created the MSR minilab as
we also we have sign for it which is I
our our workspace in the sauce floor so
I still said before you are all welcome
to 20 up and see what what we enjoin and
to play with things um yeah and that's
it thank you let's talk about him I also
have a website with some things I've
been doing for the last decade or so so
you're all welcome to take a look at
them and watch I missing and we have
time to talk you can see the videos or
whatever or any questions what yes I
have the videos
your be smart so uh hello this is well
what sorry I'm just curious how you are
connected to the bass tracker Monsieur
the article the audio well that's that's
quite interesting because I forget the
to make sound what I did was to just to
to send midi midi its musical instrument
device interconnections it's a standard
protocol to to connect musical
instruments so every standard
synthesizer or or electrical instrument
understands midi so my software it we
have like a look back midi connection
it's like a virtual cable so my software
outputs meaty and and the scenes listens
to me d &amp;amp; n outputs the sound but to
make to connect it with the species 3d
i'm going to say 3d with a 3d system of
tin I if it it was quite of a tinkering
interesting problem because my my
software are outputs nine different
media channels then the the synthesizer
listens to that and outputs nine
different audio streams to virtual audio
cables which is a third vendor software
that emulates a cable that goes but it
on one actually an audio cable that goes
out and in and we also installed some
something called Asia which is a also
third vendor / a driver for real-time
sound that that allows us to to send
nine different audio streams to chin
software that creates then different
outputs and then that is captured with
with a mic and turn into the to the
vibration let's took us like Anna was
not easy bad windows
it does not does not provide any kind of
of real-time audio system for more than
two channels so it depends on the driver
of the sound card or some software that
you need to make make it work
here
so here is that what actually look for
the video so this without using my hands
allows me to play some this kind of
handlers interface allows me to for
example to play my uke and try to make a
melody with my head when I'm playing
that you at the same time oh so let's
try that I'm gonna shoot the video off
I'm gonna turn down another silly I
Association and let's see how it goes
it's not gonna go very well
so yeah I'm sorry about the bad music
but that was my small a video and Jamie
thanks for watching and the you should
cause you are you tube yeah I've been
told that I'm not allowed to because
everything everything else I thought
belongs to Microsoft some I ask you a
question of course so basically we are
designed to use this part to sense the
word rather than working and your work
is trying to use this part of the work
and my question is a natural way oh well
it is it is and it's not for example
this way of making music is absolutely
not natural I mean you're like doing
this one thing that that while testing
my my my different prototypes I got this
a lot of times I take them to blink
detector then these and then shaking my
head to save it if it work in different
conditions you like so it's really not
natural to use but at the same time it
is because you're making a facial
expression that it's telling me that
you're actually paying attention to what
it is you are communicating without
saying anything yeah me you're something
you're sending yes you're not shaking
your head jumbly but the art sending
something without actually talking so
that that that was pretty much the idea
to take that idea and also say user it's
really interesting that when you open
your mouth it makes sounds which is
something you're used to but you're not
actually making it it's really weird
because it feels like you singing but
you're singing with some with the voice
that comes from all right it's natural
and it's not and that that happens a lot
when you when you work in these things
you want to do things that feel natural
from an HCI point of view you
to take a natural interaction natural
user interfaces but you also want to do
things that are no natural that are
disruptive that situates the user no
different so it works both ways
do you think explicitly about how best
to comment the limitations of the
technologies so for example and you're
singing there you arranged it so the
head pointed octaves so the thing made a
mistake on an octave it actually didn't
sound bad like if you would pay some
other big load of some terrible so and
there are other editions I wonder if you
if you sort of consciously try to yes no
or at the this this has many aspects I
in the musical part it was on purpose
and it was by design because it's that
as a minor pentatonic so everything was
going to son all right you can shake
your head without any kind of of
meanings and a song pretty much right so
that was taking into account I and but
also okay when you create create an
interactive art piece you want to take
that the border case into into account
and to know that the user is not it's
going to have like a police and or
interesting or artistic experience all
the time but also you're extremely open
to to serendipity your simile open to
see what happens there's one author that
caused happy mistakes so it doesn't
really matter and from from one point of
view if it does not sound the right
anything and that happens a lot and you
know in my classes I teach a course on
HCI one of the one this one class that
that I open it asking the students what
what's better as a musical instrument a
CD player or a violin and okay discuss
and I don't know it's a rich discussion
so the CD player does not allow you to
make any mistake and if you take a
violin you never not a violin is it's
going to sound terrible so if you're
creating a tool for for expression you
are always always playing with this with
balance between giving freedom to the
user and trying to help him in his
performance Anderson a third aspect that
I I do come from euro so I'm extremely
used to working with
a limited I hardware and so the idea of
taking something like that the connect
face tracker which is kind of a basic
tool and trying to make the most out of
it systematically it is to pretty much
the way I'm used to work which is I
think it's a good way to work do you see
the possibility there for maybe being
something around like when I think of
anything that does text to speech or
anything that guys like translating of
language because there's a lot of
assumption of like you can't really
understand the toe or anything like that
there's a way that you could like
capture the person's motion as they're
writing or something like that and they
can display that and the output I don't
know yeah that's a way yeah perhaps i'm
short days i have no idea did it but
whites yeah absolutely very
phase basic versions motions to music
what if you have all that I can bring a
coat over on this to music oh yes yes
it's it's it's interesting it it's an
algorithmic our composition it's a very
rich area as a bunch of people organ
that module or you can vary week old
yeah yeah yeah and that I can show you
it's awesome things I've been doing
thank you very much okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
