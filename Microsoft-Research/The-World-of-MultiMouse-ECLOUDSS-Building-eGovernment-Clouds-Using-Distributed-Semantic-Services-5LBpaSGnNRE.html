hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
let's start with the problem in the last
17 years I'm working in how to transform
the classroom experience I my first
motivation was this one basically the
classroom hasn't changed for over 500
years the classroom is one where the
teacher is an active element and the
students are completely passive and the
consequences of this we measure this
last year and we got this data which is
really amazing this was measured in five
schools with 172 kids at the end of 3rd
year and what you have here is the
national curriculum of Chile of the
first second third and fourth year that
means that the Chilean government
indicates the schools that they have to
teach this contents ordered in this way
so the four years this is basic
mathematics these kids were assessed at
the end of 3rd year and what you see in
the vertical axis is the number of
children that achieved that contents
that means that 20 20 kids really knows
the contents of the second trimester or
first grade they don't know anything
from here on only they know this at the
end of 3rd year so what you have here if
you make some conclusions is that sick
around 60 kids should be sitting in
first grade and not at the end of third
grade and around 100 kids should be
sitting at second grade and not at the
end of third grade what happens here is
basically that these kids are
progressing in the school but they're
really not learning anything and this is
real data only six kids really follow
what the teacher is teaching and this is
terrible because all these kids at the
end of school won't know anything and
also what these kids are they're very
annoyed because they go to day to school
and they know they won't learn anything
and they want to understand anything so
one solution was give these kids
computer
computers will be miracles and you will
change everything so a lot of countries
especially Peru another way both
computers are now in Argentina they
bought a couple of millions of computers
believing what negroponte they say give
them a computer and something miracle
will happen however today we know there
is no miracle The Economist a month ago
on average seventh said error message
disappointing return from invested in
computing and this was based on a report
of the inter-american Development Bank
on the work done in Peru of over 350,000
kids that show that it was even worse
given computers than not giving
computers so what I say is what can we
do i think in 2006 in the conference
like this I met can't i wrote uyama of
Microsoft Research India and that made
the change for me so I'm really grateful
to Microsoft what made Quintero and to
be in conference like this and going to
kintaro he invited me to Bangalore ones
and what we did is to work with the with
a driver they developed that allowed to
put more than one mouse to machine what
microsoft bangalore wanted to do is to
have a lot of kids working on one
machine so to diminish the cost of
technology so we started first one
machine three kids that was our first
step in 2007 and what we did there is
the stuff we were doing from 2001 where
we were working in collaborative
environments where each kid had one
machine at that time we were working
with pocket pcs so the type of study we
were doing is basically four small kids
from kindergarten up to second and third
grade in basic math and basic language
what we saw base what we saw is that
interaction was great the kids
interacted among them and with the
virtual world and the type of activity
that we were doing where the type that
you will see here where you have for
example a common output each kid owns a
space and each kid is marked by a
pointer of a given color and that
pointer can only choose the objects in
the same color space and what they have
to do is to sort these elements so
basically they are collaborating through
the interactions in this virtual space
and communication and coordination is
key in this type of work what we obtain
basically is really a very important
improvement in learning and with the
support of pregnancy learning we have
today / 10 schools in Guatemala and in
Chile we also have around that number
little more of schools that work in this
type of technology what we saw is
afterwards the value of games also with
the support of Microsoft Research we
were engaged in the game so learning
institute where we began working with
games and one of the things we looked
for was first person shooting doom why
don't we bring doom to school you say
you're crazy yeah we don't have to kill
people but the concept behind is very
attractive especially for boys so what
we did is instead of keeping persons we
began capturing numbers capturing
objects and here you have the three
students that have to order these
numbers over here and these numbers are
in these cubes that they have to find in
the maze and and in a given sequence try
to capture them so to sort these numbers
accordingly we just finish this game and
the first studies that the involvement
and engagement of the kids is really
incredible we also use this type of
technology for science teaching also
with games is also part of the games for
Learning Institute already there coolum
what's more difficult to learn than
Coulomb and what we did with high school
kids we teach coulombs through games and
the game that we did he
was the following one you have always
with collaboration for because form in
collaboration is key when you try when
you can't do collaboration do it so you
have these three kids over here and each
kid can select the charge which is
positive or negative and the magnitude
of the charge and what they have to do
is to move this object is also charged
with their astronauts and bring this
object to a given portal so to really
achieve the rain the problem is that the
others are these elements here this
asteroids that are moving and there to
take care that the object don't collide
with the asteroid and really reach the
port what we really saw was amazing
first they really learned a lot here I
have to make a click I'm sorry not only
they learned but the engagement was
incredible a couple of kids I think
three boys and one girl asked us if this
was available in the web so they could
download it they really wanted to
continue working on electric charges and
the secret here basically is that when
the rules of the game collide with the
rules of the pedagogue then the game is
really extremely attractive and here
what's interesting is that we're always
using a very cheap technology just one
machine for three kids we are now also
working now in a collective language lab
where the idea is that we not only have
mouths but now we have an earphone and a
microphone and idea is that the kids
learn to spell and understand foreign
language also collaboratively the idea
here is that for example they have to
sort these words to build a phrase over
here but now there's no mouse what they
have is a microphone so what they have
to do they have to talk they click I
want to talk so this guy for example
says day and if the system understands
the word he accepts the words however if
the spirits pay the speech recognition
system don't understand the word what
will happen is that the system will say
did you mean are so with this a
threshold which cases for the word and
if the words not spell accordingly what
happens is that the system will tell the
person please spell it as it is and he
gets also feedback from the earphones
what we saw here is that comparing with
the system which was not collaborative
and another system which was a control
without technology what we saw is that
the pronunciation got a significant
impact course with the non a collective
one and the control group was less and
not a significant in listening and
pronunciation so the value of corrupted
collaborative technology was especially
important in pronunciation which is very
difficult to achieve in LA in a
classroom with a lot of students then we
move to 1 to 10 you went to 10 things
get a little more complicated it's not
just plugging three mice to one machine
here you have now one computer when
projector and also you have now a lot of
cables you have a HAP and the cables
that connect this mouse and these happy
I'll connects to another half until you
reach the number of students you want
what we did here basically was I would
say a technology enhanced learning
environments he were talking more of an
environment where the kids are
interacting within them and interacting
with the virtual world what's
interesting here that the kids really
interacted among them and really
collaborated in a very difficult problem
what we did here was their food chain
and there was a diff a a sequence of
object if it's a sequence of goals that
they had to achieve and we really
obtained a very interesting engagement
of the kids the idea behind was to
follow the MMOG type of games
but instead of having a massive
multiplayer online game what we had is a
classroom multiplayer potential game
because there was a face-to-face
experience but we really achieved an
incredible engagement of the kids we
publish a paper where we followed a
series of guidelines or how to develop
these face-to-face collaborative games
this is really not easy to achieve
because what you have compared with
regular games is that the kids are now
collaborating a lot of kids
collaborating and they're also face to
face and not a distance as are in the
games which are in the web if somebody
wants the paper just let me know I will
send it to you in any case this is
uploaded and you can have it and then we
move to the limit a whole classroom full
of mouse what you have here is a
photograph in Chile this is in Costa
Rica this was Alexei project where we
worked in Chile Brazil and Costa Rica
last year we just finished this project
this is in Costa Rica this is in Brazil
and this is in India we did this with
also with Quintero the yam a couple of
years ago when we just started with the
one mouse with child we named this one
Mouse per child is not one laptop per
child is one Mouse per child and it got
it cannot get cheaper because the cost
of a system like this is less than its
around one dollar per child per year so
cheaper than this you cannot really get
the type of things we did here at the
following words each kid owns a small
piece of the screen you see it here and
the mouse cannot move out of this space
for example here each child is isn't
identified by an icon and the children
get an intelligent tutoring system where
they can work at their own speed and the
system as
sistance in this in the way that between
lectures the system remembers the state
of the kid so the kid advances at their
own pace the type of feedback that the
kids get is the following one this kid
did it right this kid did it wrong this
kid is sleeping that means this kid has
done anything in the last minute this
kid is in deep sleep that means that
this kid hasn't done anything in the
last three minutes and this is important
feedback information for the teacher so
the teachers know who he should address
on the other side since this is an
intelligent tutoring system the kids
receive different type of rules for
example the simplest rules is this one
then it gets a little more complicated
like this ones and then more and more
complicated and here you see how the
different kids are advancing here you
have the number of the rules where the
kids are in green they the exercises
that it right yellow they did one
mistake and read the two or more
mistakes and to finish one of these
rules and go to the next rule like for
example this kid which just finished a
rule they have to have at least eight
correct answers from which the last five
have to be in a sequence of correct
exercises so that we know they are
really not guessing we compared this one
mouse with child system with a
one-to-one system what we did we used
this intelligent tutoring system which
is just this rule based system exactly
with the same interface and ported to a
netbook and we worked in 15 weeks in one
school with three groups a group with
which had the one most child a group
which had the netbook using the same a
intelligent tutoring system and a group
with paper and pencil and what we
observe was really very interesting the
paper is the green the red one is the
interpersonal computer or the one mouse
per child
and the blue one are the netbooks and
what you see here is the number of
students the level that the percentage
of students the level they achieved
after 15 weeks of work interesting is
that the kids with paper and pencil
advance much much faster than the
technological ones and both
technological ones are around the same
the kids in the one mouse which I were a
little faster but there's no significant
difference however we were really afraid
when we saw this and say hey look to the
kids in paper and pencil they're working
much faster than the other ones each of
the groups always had a teacher that was
helping and supporting the different
kids however when we finished the
post-test what we saw was that the
improvement in learning of the inter
personal computers 21 miles per child
was around the same as the netbook
however paper and pencil was much less
and the reason is that in paper and
pencil once they finish the sequence of
exercises they had to go to the answer
sheet look which exercises had wrong and
made them again and if the teacher
really didn't go into detail with the
kids the kids didn't learn from their
mistakes however in the technological
ones the kids couldn't advance if
they're really didn't overcome the
problems and that make a huge difference
so here we saw and we're ere we
submitted this paper which is now in the
second review and the importance here is
to show that not only technological
system are much more efficient at paper
and pencil we already knew but at the
one smart one mouse per child had a
similar efficiency as a one-to-one
technology now the project we had now
with lexie r which i mentioned before
was to introduce games into the one
mouse per child and what we did here
used very
simple games because the space we have
is religious small you will see it in a
couple of seconds and we use very simple
games like for example building a bridge
capturing chickens capturing fish which
is very similar to the other one and how
you say eldorado a general Darrow how
you say it in English huh darts exactly
darts hey it looks like this when you
have a lot of kids working
simultaneously the engagement what we
measured we just finished the paper we
just really finishing now the paper
because we had a huge delay because as
you may remember last year there was
striking chili and it wasn't easy to
make a an experiment with schools which
I don't strike a note on strike so we
had to delay the stelians goals to the
beginning of this year and we just
finished so we are now fishing the paper
so what we so basically is the following
one if you remember and I'm going back
that's an important learning is that
here the kids are constructing their
answers here the kids cannot guess they
have to construct the answers but for
simplicity and of course after the words
everybody's general we just didn't
construct the answers here by the kids
choose the answer so the guessing factor
was much higher than on the other one
and I were principal learning experience
here is that and we are now developing
the new type of games exactly with what
as we did in with the other non-gaming
games on constructing the answer and not
guessing the answer we didn't saw any
difference in learning between their
games they the one must be a child with
games and without games and for us the
difference is that basically here the
guessing factor was really important so
what we're doing now is the new
generation where the kids have to
construct the answer and not selecting
the answer that's the main a lesson that
we obtain from that experience the
engagement was much much higher and the
other thing is that we also saw that in
rural
areas where kids have no connection with
technology or very little connection
with technology the engagement was much
higher than in urban areas and the last
thing we have done is the collaborative
one 249 since as you remember for me
collaboration is key the question is how
can kids collaborate when they are in an
environment like this and what you have
here is four groups who have to take up
to 10 kids where each kid owns a point
the aim here is to construct a triangle
and this since each child owns a point
what they get initially is a polygon and
the teacher Tenten this is a polygon but
this is not a triangle what you have to
do is to build from this polygon a
triangle so the kids and they're not
sitting one besides the other the kids
the composition of the groups is
completely random so they really cannot
speak to each other even they begin to
shout and the teacher tries to shut to
to stop them so they have to find how to
really collide these points in two
different vertices up to three vertices
to build this triangle and they get
immediate feedback from the system from
his face which is not smiley to a face
that increasingly more smiley until the
end which the face is happy and I'll
tend them that's okay what we saw here
that the kids learn they have to really
have some time to understand how this
works but the kids learn how to build
these triangles and the important thing
is that they're learning by doing and
this immediate feedback of the system
and the teachers of course a key element
that supports the through mediation the
work inside the classroom let me finish
and I did it in 20 minutes a let me
finish with an epilogue for me we are in
a very important moment I was 25 years
ago in my
international conference in Melbourne in
the pearl in a parallel conference it
was a program in the logic programming
conference and her a galera remember if
it were today told the conference people
don't let miss the boat and we're
exactly in the same moment I think that
negroponte was very important to bring
up that technology can make a point but
results like this what I doing is
showing that if we don't integrate
digital and non digital resources
accordingly politicians won't believe us
anymore we have to be very careful
because examples like this are abundant
where happening now in Argentina for
example the kids want to learn if this
really clear pedagogue behind we are now
working with the plan civil in other way
we're working also in Colombia where the
government's really understand that they
have to be a clear pedagogy but what's
really missing that the important issue
here is that up to now this only one big
project that has shown significant
results are they at the size of 100
schools and that Ben s arrived menlo
park in a project in if i'm not wrong in
texas which around 130 schools they
showed that for fraction insert and
fourth grade if i'm not wrong they
really showed significant results but
there are no other examples in the world
that has shown that technology can make
a difference i have moved up to 10
schools but going up 200 schools it's
really difficult because you have to be
engaged with the government and those
things get much more difficult i would
say that's really the next step to show
that technology can make a change and
show people like this that if you do it
right technology can really change where
they showed at the beginning kids that
don't learn anything thank you very much
okay we have time to type some questions
five minutes CEO / modesto a celebrant
on a panel a que pasa la la okay
experiencia San hecho de aplicar at the
depot soluciones n Ã¡mbito hey Lucas in
superior I will answer in English the
question was a if we have experience in
at university level we have worked from
kindergarten up to university students
we have worked in computer science in
chemistry and in other engineering
courses and here the key point is that
it's not free to really change the way
you teach the engagement of the teachers
is very difficult the students like it
because the tunes get engaging what
they're doing however preparing material
for the teacher is a very a hard labor
work and the universities where we have
worked even in my own University my own
school didn't give the teachers and
support so it was just the will of the
teachers to make this new content and at
the end there are so many other
obligations that he just didn't use it
so if there's really no support behind
the change of weather way you teach
nothing will happen that's the key
element because technology is there at
the university level you did the problem
is the developing of contents the case
of the schools we do the content because
it's a standard curriculum but the
university level we cannot do the
contents the teachers to the context
thank you I am curious about the
assessment that am a person learns by
doing and then there's maybe classic
exams where people you know you have the
problem and then you have to answer and
how is this gap shortened with your
approach that's a very good answer what
we have done up to now is always a pre
and post it on paper but what we saw
specially now with the games project
that the kids that were working with
games through around for weeks and then
we did the posters on paper they didn't
a perform as good a step as the data we
saw on the computer and the point here
is how do they transfer the knowledge
they did electronically to paper that's
really an important issue that we now
observe and now we have to deal with but
that's a very important issue how do you
transfer from one media to the other yes
but i would say before we haven't saw
that we just made saw this when we began
working with games as the one we showed
yes i am curious about a the engagement
of girls in games because most of the
boys are really engaged on that but what
about girls have you checked about it
yes we have worked with different
technology and i would say the one
that's what that was most out of the
sequence was without mented reality
games when we were working with the
games for learning institute dare we saw
a real clear difference with boys
between boys and girls the girls didn't
like documented reality games because
they didn't understand them because what
in the eye when did reality they got a
netbook with a camera so they look to
the screen and what they were looking
was the real word plus the virtual word
that was added and they really had
problems in engaging this pro in this
games they didn't like it i would say in
these games the date that we have makes
shows no diff
friends between boys and girls even in
this first-person shooting the games
like it very much because they were not
killing anybody there was no killing
there was no blood it's just a the same
type of dynamics but there was no
difference the only the only way the
only type of games were we saw a
difference was in this how mented
reality games there the girls definitely
didn't like it they express didn't like
this type of games one last question
okay thank you very much sure so this is
another example that shows that we are
not considered to which technology we
don't wear pants and I have to do to
have a thing here I thank you very much
i am going to change focus from users to
a kind of lumping exercise concerning
information management but this is not
yet another information management
presentation because in this work we try
to consider the user in the process of
integrating information and particularly
what we are willing to do is to try to
provide integration tools that can be
used very easily by users without having
to deal with engineers in order to build
their solutions well this is the
ultimate objective of our work and today
i'm going to show some results
concerning the integration and the
querying of information which is largely
distributed and in order i don't know
how to use this yes in order to do that
I'm going to introduce the concept of
mashups and for doing this let's
consider the following scenario consider
that we are going to build a system in
order to provision groceries around the
world and these groceries are provided
by different use
for instance in Europe they are willing
to provide directly from the producers
in bio farms that people can go to and
as for the products in other countries
they are a provided by grocery store and
in other countries like in Mexico we
have this global market in the in Mexico
City that wants to make decisions on the
way the groceries should be sent to
different countries in order to provide
users with their groceries and imagine
that in this context in order to access
to all this information these providers
are grabbed as services and service
understood as an application that
provides an APA on a network and using
these interfaces the people willing to
access to information about these
groceries can express queries for
instance this lady would like to have
continuous information about the
location of the providers of grey of
fresh groceries with a description of
the daily production that are located no
further than eight kilometres of her
current position she likes to move a lot
and that are open in the afternoon but
this query is quite a complex one it
deals with special temporal aspects with
continuous data but as I said we don't
want a programmer every programmer to do
that rather we would like her to be able
to use a tablet and then define in a
very easy way this integration aspect
another user would like to have a bigger
intervals of information access for
instance he wants to access information
weekly but here the important thing is
that he wants to be sure that the
groceries that come to his home are
produced by responsible economy and
again he will
use a computer in order to mash up this
information and be aware of these
information weekly and then we have the
producers that have to make very
important decisions in order to be sure
that the groceries will arrive on time
to the to the consumers and they have to
track the trucks and that are in there
in the area and they have to be sure
that the groceries do not brought
according to the to the type of
groceries they are selling and also that
the conditions of refrigeration are well
assured in order that the groceries have
enough quality and again they want to
build their applications in an easy way
as I said in the beginning this is not
only the issue like defining queries and
mashes but we have to consider the
difference of of quality of service
associated to the way the information
will be delivered for instance if I'm on
my phone or if I'm going around the city
i would like to spare the battery that
is used in order to integrate this
information and i would also like to
avoid make a lot of magog that's running
to my to my phone because then the cost
the economic cost of the query will be
very high so there's the requirements of
the user do not also only concern the
type of information in order to be mesh
at up but also the cost of the query
that will help integrate this
information are there are two ways of
doing this there's the classic way where
that we are all used to to use and this
implies that we have specific servers
and amount of computing resources in
order to build this application this is
a clearly a global integration
applications will we have to access
different databases in order to into
great the information and this
information can be stored in different
persistent supports and access our own
servers and here if we adopt this
classic way of doing this the objective
is to efficiently manage and exploit the
datasets according to given specific
storage memory and computing resources
but as you see in this large distributed
environment it is very difficult to have
control on the type of computing
resources that we have access to and
therefore there's another new way of
seeing things that was introduced by
this architecture named the cloud that
provides us with the possibility of
sharing server storage support and also
applications and there the objective of
integrating and providing results to
integration is to provide costly manage
and exploit datasets according to
unlimited storage memory and computation
resources and the only limit that we
will have to consider is the cost of
access to these resources in the in
different moments in the project that we
run we adopt this a vision and we try to
see how to solve the problem of
integration according to this context
and the challenges are stated as follows
we would like to see that everything
even the devices and the information
providers are seen as services that have
to be combined and coordinated in order
to evaluate the queries and since we
would like to see the process of
retrieving the information we would like
to combine these services and have
partial results of the a of the queries
and present them in a friendly manner
since we are dealing with quality of
service issues then we would like to
optimize the queries according to the
restrictions that different users have
and then prop
a space in order to to address the
solutions and also another important
hypothesis that we have is that we do
not suppose that there is a dbms of the
chef that can deal with these queries
and so the there are different
challenges to be addressed in our
context we would like of course to
provide very easy languages in order to
specify the requirements that will deal
with the services and with special
temporal elements in order to be aware
of the location of data and also and
very important the way the data will be
presented then when we have a proposed
languages in order to deal with these
expressions another important thing is
quality of service so we would like to
associate contracts of quality of
service to the expressions that deal
with the integration of information and
then normally in my example people know
that which are the services they want to
use in order to integrate their data but
in a very distributed context it is rare
to really know which are the services
and it is important to know that there
are other services that can probably be
used in order to address our queries so
we address a problem of services look up
considering semantics and recommendation
systems and then comes the problem of
doing this efficiently but in instead of
meaning efficiently with respect to time
response we think that efficient means
having the pertinent information in the
same in the good moment and in the good
context adapted to the context ah so the
objective is kind of do a little aplomb
being in order to put services new
services on the cloud in order to help
applications to be built in an easy
um of course there's a lot of things to
be said I'm going to focus on the
efficiently efficiency expects and I'm
going to deal with query evaluations in
this context and I'm going to address
three a point of view that we deal with
in the inner project first is the notion
of a breed query second is how to
optimize these queries in order to
address the Equality of service
requirements and finally how this can be
deployed on a cloud architecture in
order to build these applications first
of all the notion of a Brit query
normally when we have dealt with SQL
like expressions and languages and there
are solutions dealing with continuous
data and there are other solutions
dealing with spatial temporal data and
other solutions dealing with continuous
queries and none of them consider
services as a first citizens in the in
their models what we are doing is that
we suppose that we have the APS
accessible in some networks and what we
will do in order to answer the query is
coordinate the calls in order to fetch
the information and then have other
activities in order to aggregate this
information and to process it in order
to provide results and so this is a a
coordination problem that should be
addressed dealing with special temporal
aspects with the fact that we will
consume data on demand or continuously
from static or mobile devices and that
this should be evaluated continuously or
in batch depending on the requirements
of the users and then but this is not
all because there's the quality of
service involved in this coordination
and the quality of service deals with
all the infrastructure that will be you
in order to evaluate this kind of
queries and this concerns the network
this concerns the number of mega octet
that are going around in order to
produce results and this concerns also
the battery used in order to evaluate
these processes so there's a bunch of
infrastructure that needs to be observed
in order to ensure that the quality of
service will be will be a fulfilled and
so these elements are these observation
elements have to guide the way each of
the coordination czar being done and the
process of the data is being in our
project we had this this challenge and
we have a partial results that help us
to answer this type of queries first of
all we have of course the query and in
order everybody knows that in order to
address with information and of course
of integrated information that is
produced in different formats it is
important to have a better pilot model
that helps us to to integrate this
information we use a classic approach of
that data modeling that is well known
today and on the web and that is Jason
so the representation of data being
exchanged and produced by services is
Jason and behind the Jason model in fact
that what we have is a data model that
includes a simple data types and complex
data types and we include included in
these data types the fact the notion we
use the notion of double the notion of
sets in order to represent the fact that
there are continuous data being produced
and we also define a set of operators
that help us to deal and process this
data for instance if this is the kind of
of off structure that we use in order to
represent it there are containers that
have sensors in order to determine
whether the groceries are being
distributed with the conditions that
they require
we will have this type of description
but the data is not everything in our
approach because the services are also
important services interfaces are also
important in order to deal with our
queries so we use the same model in
order to represent the services
interfaces that are a participating in
the evaluation of the aquarium once we
have this then we have to deal with a
query mode as i said the query will be a
services coordination so it's a workflow
that should be represented a under a
model we used a well-known formalism
used in services coordination approaches
which is called a esm and we also use
the associated language in order to deal
with coordination so the formalism is
based on abstract state machines and we
use these abstract state machines in
order to implement the queries which is
what is very interesting and is that
services coordination solutions are used
in Microsoft for instance use a CML so
the language in order to have engines
that can deal with this kind of a
workflow executions and finally there's
the on the top of their of of the
solutions we have languages that
integrate not only the special temporal
and the a aspects and the continuous
aspects of the data but they also
integrate the quality of service and the
way the data will be presented on the
screen and depending on the type of
screen that they will it will be used in
order to show the data the presentation
will be adapted to them and of course we
have a protocol that is called ipatea
and this prototype is able to evaluate
these kind of workers ah so if we go
down deeper in the solution once you
have the e breed query it is implemented
as a query workflow and the query
workflow must be
generated so we provide algorithms in
order to go from a high level
description of the integration to a
lower level which concerns the problem
that the program that will be evaluated
in order to solve the query so to give
you an idea of how it is presented we
have a classic workflow composed of
activities some of the activities will
be directly connected to the services
that provide the information and other
activities will implement and coordinate
other kind of services that will help us
to uh to deal with the data to process
the data for instance in my query I
wanted to know which are the providers
that are three kilometers from my
current position this is a classic
operation of KN n this is a key in an
operation that we implemented and what
we did is we used services on the cloud
in order to implement small coordination
that we could control in order to
process this data and we did the same
with different filters and other classic
operators that were adapted to the
context once you have the program that
implements your query you are not sure
that this is the best way to do that so
there's the optimization challenge to be
addressed and generally speaking the
this problem is stated as follows in
fact what we want is to find the query
workflows that implement the ebriefed
query and the best conveys to the
quality of service contract according to
the available services and this has
three main elements in order to be
addressed first we have to figure out a
cost function that integrates the the
quality of service of the expression of
the query with the real cost of the
services and will
a measures associated to the services
that provide the data and once we have
that then we can expect to produce a
solution space that will help us to
decide which is the best query at a
given moment that should be executed in
order to provide results first of all I
will show the intuition of the
associated with from the service level
agreement to the so the quality of
service expression to the breath query
and this goes as follows in order to
determine the cost of the query we need
to have observation measures of the
services that provide the data and of
the platform that is being used in order
to solve the query we decided to choose
five measures in order to start we
consider the throughput of the network
we consider the latency in order to have
responses of the services and the
latency considered in order to get the
data we also consider the fact that
services are in general not all the time
available so we would like to know how
the percentage of availability of the
services the execution time that a of
once a service call and the price the
price is acquired a big challenge
because services in general can export
the price but for instance if you are
using a network it is very difficult to
figure out the price of a certain bunch
of mega pets with respect to the real
economic costs that you are going to to
get by transferring this date and then
on the other side we have the expression
of quality of service requirements and
we consider three aspects we considered
the battery we consider the time with
the response time and the economic cost
and the objective was to provide a cost
function that will deal with this with
this correlation of a
of measures we haven't a clearly a multi
dimensional optimization problem and as
everybody knows this is a very difficult
thing to solve and initially what we did
is we try to represent under will
combine the different preferences of the
measures expressed in the quality of
service contract and have a one
threshold value that will help us to
guide our optimization and the intuition
is that we are going to have to ponder
eight the different measures that are
implied in the quality of service
requirement contract against the
services available to solve a query that
can really be combined and have and
respect this this value and with this
threshold then we are going to suppose
that this value represents the maximum
cost that I can accept from equity in
order to be executed and that's the
threshold but now I have the problem of
really building the workflows that will
respond to the query and intuitively the
idea is that I can do everything one in
sequence all the all the operations in
sequence or I can try to paralyze some
of the of the operations in order to
avoid a time cost the problem with that
is that i will have a lot of
communication costs so i really have to
have the balance between parallelizing
the activities or making them in
sequence so that I can respect the
threshold that I competed in using my
function so this is a rewriting problem
that we address considering the
structural constraints of any workflow
this means that I need to build
workflows that terminate and that do not
have that looks and also considering the
characteristics of the data processing
operators that are implied in the
workflows and the quality of service
requirements and using this
three elements I will decide I will
generate a solution space that it will
be organized as follows I have my
solution space I have the threshold and
in fact what gives my solution space is
a set of possible possible queries that
can be executed that respect the
expected quality of service and in order
to decide which of those are pertinent
in order to respond the query what I
built is a multi-dimensional space using
niche acts all the dimensions that I
express in my in my quality of service
contract i will put the objective is
there a black dot which is computed
using the update a cost function and the
other dots represent the possible
queries that I can aim that I can use in
order to answer the query and i will
slope for that region that is composed
of of the query workflows that are not a
deterrent a certain distance with
respect to the object and then using a
top K classic algorithm used in
information research engines I will get
when I will classify them and then
decide which of them will be computed
then the deployment as I said there are
a lot of there's been a lot of research
done in order to deploy these kind of
solutions either centralized or either
using distributed or parallel
architectures the problem with them is
that services are not quite exploited as
for citizens in this context and that
query evaluations really are not
services compositions they are
translated to programs and then
evaluated what we did is we built a full
service oriented evaluate query
evaluation that was then integrated in a
platform that could serve as square inch
and it looks like this we have a set of
services deployed in a cloud
infrastructure some of the services used
for dealing with computations are done
on Amazon Cloud and the other services
are deployed in Azure then we have the
query engine that which is called the
party that really a computes the a
computing services and then at the top
of the of this tag we have the
application level with web browsers that
can be used in order to mash up the
information so and then we for the
mobile acquiring we use the link in
order to express some of the queries
that deal with the azure services that
were deployed then we have a party which
is the real a execution query and we
also used a level in order to build
applications using a methodology that
exists in order to build mashups this is
one of the aspects of our project but
there were a lot of aspects involved
there's the problem of looking up for
services that was addressed mainly by
Regina mods who's a specialist in
service semantic service description and
that has also service recommendation
systems in order to look for services
there are the quality of service
concerning functional functional aspects
and the expression of them that were
addressed by Martin music contain
Alberto Pardo and a spatial temporal
query language is another the data
management issues on the cloud addressed
by jose luis achiness in in order to sum
up the results an impact of our of our
work this of course that we consolidate
and enhance research information
integration through data services
coordination
we did with very interesting aspects in
a normal manner as some of the papers
that we have published have shown but
one of the important thing is that these
kind of solutions were addressed in
order were used in order to address any
government problems and other
methodological problems that done in
other projects with a Latin American
group and I think that this is the most
important thing that we managed to put
together our experiences and expertise
in order to dress this interesting
problem thank you very much and I'm
ready to get questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
