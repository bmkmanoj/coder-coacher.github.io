alright ladies and gentlemen we're going
to reconvene here getting towards the
end of the day but still ception alee
valuable material to cover this section
we'll look at case study examples of
coastal engineering and hand where it's
and David Michaelson will be given us a
talk and then a panel discussion please
thank you and thanks for inviting Dave
Michaelson and myself to present to you
today about some of the infrastructure
requirements we have to meet with Corps
of Engineers the outline will be five
elements to this talk two of the
elements will be an introduction dealing
with first what is the mission of the
Corps of Engineers does for our nation's
infrastructure requirements for civil
works and then our culture and how we
can align for alignment of collaboration
then the next three elements will go
through the activities that the Corps of
Engineers has relevant to the costal
margin and newest new pack Northwest for
Portland district and Seattle district
court offices then we'll address the
challenges that we face along our costal
margin dealing with coastal navigation
infrastructure specifically the aging
infrastructure and then we'll summarize
with some opportunities our civil works
program Corps of Engineers is supported
by about five is supported by about five
billion dollars annually it's a diverse
portfolio of seven missions but today
I'll be specifically talking to you
about navigation along in our costal
margin over all the ports and waterways
that the core core is involved with have
a lot to do with our nation's economic
health and waterborne Commerce is by far
the most efficient way to move
commodities the core offices are
represented by regional commands named
divisions and each division has a number
of districts that support the division
also shown here are the regional
associations for I use in this part of
the world the regional command for the
Corps of Engineers is the northwestern
division and will be addressing the
Seattle and Portland districts
infrastructure today for you
our culture the core is mission oriented
and project felt focused the core
obtains data for immediate project needs
and we're somewhat limited from
attaining other types of data that don't
fall within our immediate needs in this
case call supporting coastal navigation
infrastructure I want to emphasize that
sometimes the core does not fully
exploit or advertise the data that we
collect however on the good side is that
we're execution driven we're very good
at line aligning resources to complete
the task at hand we can use this energy
to collaborate with others when they're
when they're tasks / / overlap with our
tasks we are going undergoing a cultural
shift in the core though we're trying to
leverage resources across projects
looking at a systems-based approach
bottom line today for today's talk
though I want to emphasize is our
coastal navigation infrastructure has
increased vulnerability we need to
address this by improving our adaptive
management decision making to do that we
need a good data feed so bottom line is
we need to share and utilize existing
data sets as much as possible and the
combined capabilities for observing
collecting and analyzing future data
sets Portland district has 11 jetty two
inlets along its coast and we also
operate 20 dams here's what the what a
damn looks like it's a complicated
system of infrastructure and then in
inland this is a new port it is also a
system of infrastructure these two
business lines end up competing for
rescare Sri source maintenance dollars
so we have to make some hard decisions
the synopsis of our coastal navigation
infrastructure is that through portland
districts ports we convey 18 billion
dollars in water commerce waterborne
Commerce each year 11 jetty and inlets
compose 30 miles of structures out into
the ocean 2 billion dollars of
investment and we're basically having to
adaptively manage these these elements
by basically doing just-in-time repairs
to keep things from failing we want to
keep the function but we don't want to
fail and to do this requires frequent
observation of forcing processes and
respond
so when we take an inlet from its
natural condition to an engineered Inlet
we're basically investing a lot of money
upfront to construct jetties and
training structures and then follow on
dredging maintenance activities it ends
up being a system with the channel as of
as the centerpiece offices of the system
however the morphology at the inlet is
really what's going on and we're working
with nature to maintain the morphology
which supports the jetties and sustains
the navigation channel as a system this
these sorts of systems are subjected to
severe loading every year we get in the
pack Northwest what is equivalent to a
hurricane same scale the bottom panel is
a hurricane that's hitting Louisiana
wave modeling and data it's essential
for understanding how our coastal
infrastructure adapts to its life cycle
in addition we need wave data I think
all of us we need wave data but the core
also to make informed decisions
regarding navigation utility and safety
we highly utilize the sea dippin and DBC
wave buoy data real-time observations
and we really really make the best use
of shelf and nearshore bathymetry data
we can't do wave modeling without good
with imagery data here's a comparison of
three different models wave models to
estimate wave height and in some places
the wave models agree in other places
they do not now this this diversity in
model results is actually helpful
because by comparing models we can
reduce risk and uncertainty it informs
us about processes we may not be having
fully defined and it improves
collaboration especially when different
groups are doing the wave modeling when
comparing results jetty loading waves it
can be very severe we can go from the
very condition jetty to a threatened
condition jetty in just a matter of a
year or two so we have to maintain
surveillance in addition where the
jetties connect to shore water level
comes up storm surge those vulnerable
parts of the jetties can fail as you see
here a small bridge opening
resulted in the release of a significant
amount of morphology into the inlet and
then the last slide before I transition
over to to David Michaelson is this this
is a time varying reliability plot for
the MS for a given jetty and it starts
basically when the jetty was begun and
then it's going through time to the
present day and you can see that the
reliability has changed through time
different repair scenarios different
times when the morphology came out and
respond to the jet response to the jetty
construction it protected the jetty now
that were followed to use receding
exposing the jetty to more important
more vigorous lotion ocean loading and
now we're in a state where the
reliability is not so good it's poor and
we are dealing with vulnerable
infrastructure this type of evaluation
requires extensive integration of
observed wave data water levels wave
model results with inventory and topic
topographic data jetty design equations
it all comes together from different
elements core elements and different
data suppliers that we use David
Michaelson I'll take over David's with
Seattle district
thank you rod so there's a rod mention
it's part of our maintenance we do need
to continue oh and I'm dredging from
annual year-to-year operations so this
is just an example of our dredging at
our MCR Columbia River and basically are
in lights on the coast who is a
combination dredging by government
hopper dredges as well as I'm sorry is
that better okay so as I was saying
we're required to dredge annually at are
at our inlets and here's a schematic of
a private dredge and a hot government
hopper dredge and in order to make
educated decisions about what the
shoaling is in our harbors we need
advanced knowledge on the these complex
processes how channels shoal in and
where we should be placed in our
judgment aerial to make most beneficial
use of the sediment and to do that we
need environmental forcing data such as
tides waves currents and wind wind data
this is an example of a split whole
hopper placing dredged material at by
the north jetty at the Columbia River
here and these type of data help inform
this decision making to still maintain
safe navigation and minimize impacts on
ecological species so as I said we are
all stewards of the environment and in
order to to work within that environment
and minimize the challenges we face with
accomplishing our mission of maintaining
our navigation channels we need to work
together collectively with our our
resource agencies and fisheries to
minimize these impacts to
two equal ecology and and at the end of
the day it's going to benefit everyone
I'll transition into seattle district
infrastructure now we have projects that
are on outer coast mainly three at
Westat Grays Harbor cooley and also
Willapa Bay to the south and the two in
the Strait of Juan de Fuca and then 17
in Puget Sound on this graph on the
right hand corner just describes a
general break out of commercial cargo
fisheries and Recreation seattle-tacoma
are the main economic commercial cargo
ports but it's important to note that
commercial fisheries on outer coast at
grays harbor and other harbors bullet
bob a are also important contributors
and these are all stakeholders at our
projects is tie into what rod talked
about earlier our infrastructure is
aging and also the processes that are
forcing on this infrastructure are
changing its non-stationary this is just
an example of some of a wave model Grays
Harbor from nineteen ninety nine to two
thousand eight that ten-year period the
channel morphology in the harbor throat
scoured out a very large degree as a
result of this Damon spit recruiting and
growing to the south as a result it
refocused some of the wave energy on our
own I'm infrastructure scene here at
West board and we've noticed a quite a
bit more wave energy hitting the
structure that it was originally not
designed to withstand so these are the
type of issues we're facing and we need
to evolve along with the processes that
are forced on our structures other
missions we deal with our flood damage
reduction here's a project it will look
the bay that we were working with with
our off with the stakeholder the show
water Indian Reservation well it's a
small
area here and they've seen massive
erosion to their protective barrier
islands out in front of the reservation
and we engage in a multi-agency study
here with USGS ecology and our
engineering research development center
out of Vicksburg to to look at if there
was an actually feasible plan to where
we could minimize this flooding risk to
the reservation and erosion of their
their on their land and we determined
that the geology did prove to be in fact
capable of providing this through this
hardpoint act as an anchor here and
determine that barrier island
restoration could could um have a
positive impact on the reservation and
in order to make these type of decisions
we need geological dedos along with
hydro dynamic data namely water levels
at Oak Point where key in determining
what the storm surges were and waves
offshore at the seeded buoys and we were
able to look at scenarios and just look
at different risks reduction scenarios
where we we could have a positive impact
on on flooding in the reservation one
thing to also point out is that coastal
observations also serve a broader user
base inland flooding as well one key
then was a crisis that we had at one of
our dams howard hansen just two years
ago after a large january storm a
depression was found in the abutment and
we had to have a better data to make
decisions on how to operate the down so
there was a crisis with the dam failure
itself we needed to know what was coming
so we can make better decisions about
how to operate the dam to meant to
reduce the risk of a catastrophic impact
to the infrastructure so there was a
spheric River observation station put
out at westport and this was a key
collaboration between the coors
meteorologist and National Weather
Service and Noah's Environmental
Research Group out of Boulder Colorado
and they install this to get better wind
profiles on these atmospheric River
events that's just an example of of this
so just the key key data products and
needs that the core works with wave
buoys water levels are key ones Argus
webcams give us more information about
how that offshore wave data that set the
the buoys comes in and how it impacts
the actual coastlines in the harbors
like people have said we've watched
three ET surge all these monies models
capable of providing real close time
data to make decisions on how if we need
to respond to some type of event
beforehand to prevent a more
catastrophic failure scenario what data
is needed more water level data more
spatial temporal coverage this is going
to be an issue as sea level change
issues become more at play I would say
this network needs to be expanded more
into inland waters puget sound
particularly where vertical and movement
is highly variable same thing for an
ecosystem restoration where a title
rusty hot title hydrology restoration is
a driving factor of the management
measures we've wave buoys similar
expanding the network short term
instrumentation for tactical deployments
and then just understanding episodic
events that drive sediment transport
these are all regional sediment
management type of quit answers and
questions that we have and we can learn
from examples at the mouth of the
Columbia River to implement to other
systems such as Puget Sound and other
harbors on the outer coast Grays Harbor
Willapa Bay
this is just more more detail here of
data needs basically the main themes or
hydrodynamic sediment transport climate
change and temporal and spatial
resolution I'm not going to go through
all these but they're here so just in
summary opportunities to collaborate
with the core we have in tours in-house
resources that we that US Army Corps
staff can interact directly with
stakeholders we have contracts where you
can work with private industry with
government orders that allows us to work
with other federal agencies and
cooperative agreements that allows us to
work with universities and state
entities local governments concluding
remarks the core has been active in
partnering with nannies principal
investigators on various projects we
have a diverse set of stakeholders both
federal tribes state local private
industry ports research resource
agencies and NGOs as rod mentioned where
execution driven and a lot of the data
that we we have collected may not be
known to a lot of our stakeholders and
nannies can be a good segue on how to
incorporate that to a broader use so I
think we need to look at some of that
how we can you know feed some of that
data that we've collected into the the
network and then coastal engineering
feature focus areas and opportunities
think planning and adaptive management
for a coastal infrastructure is really
key we have prime examples on how it's
going to look and we need to engage and
make sure we have the data in place to
do that effectively a nun renewable
energy we I just want to state that the
Corps does have a lot of knowledge and
historic knowledge about morphology and
inlets and we've dynamics and we can
work together potentially to reduce some
of that duplication of effort so that's
that's all I have so thank you
ons and David thank you very much for
that very illuminating discussion of of
Army Corps of Engineers attributes
capabilities and needs and now I'd like
to open it up for four questions for
these two gentlemen I have one as a
regional representatives the Army Corps
is there do you believe that there is is
is strong bye n bye bye Senior Corps
leadership to in fact encourage the
Pacific Northwest entities in the Corps
to become more actively involved with
this particular RA and in general is
that something that the Corps wants to
do nationwide well we're here actually
let me introduce ya Brad Bird who is our
division leadership for all hydraulic
engineering in in northwestern division
is your Brad can you ID yourself
yes we that's why we're here commitment
from senior leadership and the general
is aware but really unavailable next
best thing fantastic i congratulate the
army corps on that that's the kind of
leadership that speaks well for our
federal agencies sir in our US national
office it's our only other federal
partner and general temple and general
Walsh who are at headquarters at Army
Corps are on board with this and I have
the opportunity to speak with them
regularly so it's been a tremendous
partnership and I'm glad to see that you
know that's been the aim of the Army
Corps to have their members fully
involved in the regions I just have one
of these it's not this was not a geeky
question it's one of those admin
questions that on a comment you made
that I've and that we've always
understand the Corps of Engineers has
always been mission-based and project
oriented and you said that you're trying
to go to a more systems approach to and
could you illuminate us on what does
that mean yeah I could I could try to
answer that question well are we have a
art regional sediment management program
which basically looks at systems more
holistically versus project-based a
prime example and in this area's the
mall to the columbia river literal cell
demonstration project where rod and the
lower columbia solutions group have
really interacted with various
stakeholders to you know really take a
better look at how we manage sediment at
that Inlet and look at things on a more
system based approach than just you know
you have to dredge the channel here
where we work
we put this material so yeah it's
viewing sediment as something that's
moving regardless of what project we're
dredging or where we need to place it
and viewing it as a system as a sediment
shed rather than a project we're
starting to move that way with some of
the operation of other business line
elements too but it's slow one thing
about the core is that the adage about
carpenter is to measure twice and cut
once while the core lacks the measure
about four times but we're getting there
in the spirit of the system's approach
is a quarry interested in relatively
real-time wave and current instead of a
transport capability on an hour to hour
or day to day basis I think Dave and I
and most of the core districts utilize
the real-time observations for in this
case coastal elements waves yes we are
very much interested in that and we
during the winter time we're always
looking at the end ebc regional assets
and see dip assets to seeing what's
going on we're looking at the the wave
watch 3 forecast for looking at forecast
55 days ahead of us we do the same thing
for the managing the rivers we're
looking at we coordinate with regional
meteorologists and seeing what the
10-day forecast is we because a lot of
our things are we have to be able to
respond real-time and so we that's why
it's a good view of viewpoint of the
systems management is that the
meteorological systems affecting our
infrastructure we have a big picture
view on that it's just in terms of the
funding the resourcing for specific
projects and if we have to fix a project
element and we have the opportunity we
have a contractor on site can we go
ahead and fix another project element
that's separately funded at the same
time it's very hard to do and then data
collection new types of data that are
coming on online let's say we want to
collect some wave data till them
offshore tillamook is there a
possibility we could bridge that with
some other things going on that we know
about we can't put a wave buoy offshore
neskowin because we don't have a project
there but maybe if we could share that
asset at Tillamook for six months and
then relocated as a tactical wave buoy
tanesco in we can we can go collaborate
and get two things done thank you for
such a full answer any other questions
let me ask what a follow-up to Chris
Morris question that on the on the slide
you had with the the various data types
which would be of extreme value to the
core a lot of those are collected by
other agencies does the core then
maintain an investment in observations
like water level or do you rely on Nos
to provide those would you want them to
increase their investment or nanus or
other entities or can the core do that
and keep them there for the long term
I'm going to bring in bill burr kamyer
bill bill is a he's a he's a agency
asset for the core and Bill it was that
is that can bring you in to answer
that's how we maintain our our wave
gauging yeah so let me try to answer
that in first for this audience I think
one of the things that you guys are very
fortunate to have in the northwest here
is some really great knowledgeable folks
within the core that care about this
Northwest coastline and a real
knowledgeable group here so it's great
it's great for us to present and and
realize you have here are some really
dedicated folks the question on data is
is we have a program which I manage
which sustains wave observations we fund
part of the CD program and independent
of projects in and so yes we and we've
sort of focused on way so we don't do
water levels we do waves you could hear
we'd like ways we're sort of a one
variable but we'll throw our wave
information in but we do need all these
other data types and one of the reasons
we've been promoting I use for a long
time is because we
we look to people who know these other
data types much better than us to to
help with that so we'll put some on the
table but we hope there's some other
things on the table to take away and and
we're trying to sustain our wave
information and even that's tough under
this tough budget things but but finding
users and applications that really helps
justify it within our structure as well
thank you Bill I could just add on top
of that locally poke or districts work
with the USGS and we they do a lot of
our river gauging forests and some water
levels turbidity assessments and so they
do a very good job at that and we bridge
on to that there's other opportunities
where we do cooperative agreements or
government orders with local agencies to
collect data for us well this might be a
the opportunity to say that perhaps news
and the other ras could serve as a handy
venue for regional entities of various
federal agencies to come together and
explore what these two fine gentlemen
just said about about data sharing and
opportunities for collaboration I hope
that that would come to pass any further
questions for our army corps
professionals here then thank you very
much guys
are our last case study example of the
day but by far not the least deals with
hazard hazard response and marine
operations and we are pleased today to
welcome commander Michael schoonover and
Captain Dan Jourdan captain from the
Columbia River Bar parts Association and
then Amy McFadden and are you can do
this together or just do it sequentially
here okay all yours
ok
well good afternoon everyone I guess we
are up for the final session I think
you'll see a transition here with this
last session many of the talks up till
now have been very theoretically based a
lot of large words and lots of data up
on the screen many of which were over my
head as an as an operator not a
scientist where I'm going to bring it
down to with my talk here is a
discussion about the tactical use of a
lot of the data that's out there that's
being produced the Coast Guard
specifically is a great consumer of data
for a lot of our Coast Guard operations
we produce very little of it but that
data is critical for the ongoing Coast
Guard operations that we run every day
so I'm going to talk specifically about
sector Puget Sound and I'll cover a
little bit this region that that
actually encompasses but the topics that
I cover also apply to our to Coast Guard
sectors that make that are to the south
of here that also make up the Pacific
Northwest region those would be sectors
Columbia River and soon-to-be sector
north bend right now Group North Bend so
again I'm the response chief at Coast
Guard Sector Puget Sound we run all of
the Coast Guard missions up here in
Puget Sound with the exception of ice
breaking unless things change here soon
which I hear they're not getting any
more ice we're getting less ice not
going to be a lot of ice breaking up
here but other than that we do search
and rescue maritime homeland security
protection of natural resources which
also includes oil and hazmat response
maritime safety and national defense the
environmental prod products that are out
there the data that's out there
contributes to the Coast Guard's ability
to execute all of these missions just a
little bit about the unique AOR up here
and for any of you that operate on the
water you definitely know that this is a
very diverse geographical environment
from offshore the area off of la push
into the straits of Juan de Fuca Puget
Sound up in the sand
juan islands the operating conditions in
any of those areas are completely
different and so when we're running
missions out on the coast the
information that we need and what assets
we're going to be sending differ greatly
than when we are responding to a case up
in the Swinomish channel this slide also
just shows how large of an area it is
this is an overlay of the different
captain of the port zones for some
larger ports in the Coast Guard and you
really get to see certainly not a
indication of volume because all of
these other ports run a lot of volume
but Pierre size-wise this area
encompasses a very large area and how we
overcome that large area is
consolidating all of our operations into
one command control and communications
center which is located at pier 36 in
Seattle the Puget Sound join hauber
operation center for those of you that
have not had the opportunity to come
down there we routinely host tours for
all different types of groups industry
groups government groups as well as
different just general organizations so
my contact information should be with
the netnews point of contacts if you
ever want to come in for a tour we love
to have we'd love to have groups come
down there as you see here lots of
computer screens lots of sensors kind of
information overload and so our job
there is really how do we consolidate
all of that data into a usable product
one of the ways we do that is through
our what's called the common operating
picture we integrate visual sensors with
the cameras you see on the left and the
right infrared radar satellite imagery
weather data and all of that comes into
kind of one consolidated picture that
gives us an idea of what's going on in
the region and then how do we respond so
with that as background I could have
used any of our missions as an example
of how we integrate environmental data I
thought a search-and-rescue would be an
interesting one because generally a lot
of folks here and see that on the news
day today we run a lot of search and
rescue operations in this region general
genuine anywhere from six to seven
hundred cases a year so how we use
environmental data for search and rescue
kind of varies depending on what
the case it is but I really divided
search-and-rescue into two phases the
search phase and the rescue phase rope
really named the rescue phase is
actually pretty straightforward it may
be the most dangerous phase but once you
know where the person is the boat is or
exactly what it is that you're looking
for going out and rescuing it is just a
matter of selecting the best asset and
so really what we're using the
environmental data therefore is to
determine based upon the prevailing
conditions wave height sea conditions
visibility current whether or not we
need to send one of our small boats
whether or not we need to send one of
our larger cutters our helicopters or
some of our fixed-wing aircraft really
because our sole mission there is we
want to be able to safely pull that
person out of distress or that vessel
out of distress without unduly dangerous
our Coast Guard members so with that
really it's just a matter of getting
real-time information as well as good
forecast and information so we can send
our crews out there with all the right
information the search phase is actually
a little bit more complicated and we use
some pretty sophisticated modeling
software it uses a Monte Carlo
simulation technique to do just that to
project based upon our known assumptions
sometimes we may know in this case this
is actually a run using our modeling
tool where we had a person fall off a
ferry and so we had a pretty good idea
of where the initial datum was the
initial start of that search was but
then there were when current conditions
pushing that possible person in the
water and so as we did subsequent
searches the system or the software
basically modeled where that object in
the water would drift that's very
different than what we often see
offshore which is a vessel that's
reported leaving one place not arriving
somewhere else what we call and overdue
there's a large degree of uncertainty in
there because we actually don't know
when that vessel went into distress and
so sometimes the area that will be
modeling might be 20 square miles 50
square miles 100 square miles and
uncertainty grows exponentially as the
search area increases and so there the
data that we're feeding into that model
which to a large part is all of the
historical environmental data we have
plays a critical role in our ability to
locate whatever object we happen to be
searching for but once basically we have
that drift rate and the the software
model is exactly where those the object
that we're searching for with drift to
then what it does through an
optimization process is determined
basically based upon what assets we have
out there searching the best search grid
to go on in order to find whatever it is
you're looking for and that's what you
see here with those patterns back and
forth those would be the type of
patterns that are aircraft and our small
boats and our cutters on scene would
have been searching so I could talk
forever about search and rescue that's
what I grew up in the Coast Guard doing
I love it but just real quick here oil
spills oil laws near and dear of course
to protecting the area here in puget
sound very sensitive area and so so as
we use the environmental data to do our
oil or excuse me our search and rescue
analysis we also use it for our oil
spill analysis leaning heavily on NOAA
and our scientific support coordinators
to determine trajectories of oil as well
as fate of oil for the larger spills
this happened to be just a very small
spill off of west seattle but good
visual with that I'll turn it over to my
panel members here but just ending this
is off of La Push that buoy that people
talked about earlier today critical buoy
for our surf stations there actually
they get to go out and have fun when
everyone else is staying in I had the
opportunity last Thursday of being the
guy on the front boat with a big smile
on his face as we were shooting through
that wave but they're one of the few
teams that when things get nasty that's
when they like to go out and have fun
hey David announcer next speakers
captain damn Jordan good afternoon
everyone I'm a firm believer in picture
tells a thousand words if you'd rather
read there's a fact sheet in the back of
the room so the Columbia River Bar is
where I work I have fun in those waves
as well it's worth noting before I go on
with this that Columbia river's the
third largest grain export gateway in
the world number one in wheat exports in
the nation handles 42 million tons of
international cargo valued at 20 billion
dollars annually so quite quite an
economic engine when we have rough
weather out here it shuts it all down
trains barges to Idaho shuts the whole
system down and costs a lot of money so
that's where we rely on your data to
keep keep it going there's also vibrant
crab industry and fishing industry as
well there can shut them down as well so
so the Columbia River a hundred miles
for competing independent ports yeah
from Portland Vancouver on down to the
river in order for us to sail a ship out
of Portland we have to have ten hours
lead time to set up tugboat to mine
handers coming down the river before it
crosses the bar so we use real-time data
off the wave buoys and discussions with
the National Weather Service as well to
make that decision to sell the ships
down the river but once they go there
are no suitable Anchorage's in the river
to stop a deeply loaded ship so so those
forecasts are really important to us you
know that the wave height can be off a
little bit and which it is quite often
but the timing is critical and that
coastal radar the new Doppler radars is
really improved the timing of the
forecast we're really thankful to have
that there so here's all the buoys
you've probably seen lots of different
slides of these these are rough numbers
that we look at though I was a ship's
captain before I was a pilot and such
captain's always have to second-guess
forecasters it's just in our nature so
we look at the wave boys as well
and and you can look at a buoy and
saying well roughly 18 hours from the
wave at this buoy it's going to be at
the bar and it gets to the next buoy is
it really happening so so the NDDC buoys
they were critical to us but for a lot
of years there they weren't survive in
the winter rod showed you the hurricane
for storms that came here and and either
they would not transmit their data or
they break loose their moorings and
disappear and then we couldn't get him
back on station until the summer so
we're all winter the most critical time
with no data so in june of 2009 we had
and i've heard a lot of conversation
today about collaborative partnerships
we had a wonderful collaborative
partnership 2009 we got together and
tried to identify what's going on with
these buoys and what can we do the
outcome of that was wonderful ND bc
modified the moorings of their buoys and
the communications packages on their
buoys and they've been surviving the
winter now that's great the Corps of
Engineers funded a sea dip Waverider
buoy that we put in really close to the
bar I'm giving us real time data for the
bar very helpful there and and they were
wonderful I've kudos to the Corps of
Engineers on that they had funding for
the projects that rod spoke of today the
regional sediment management the jetties
the infrastructure but they talked to
all the interested parties ourselves the
fishing fleets the crabbing fleets we
were able to place that buoy in a
position that worked for them and for us
so that was very helpful here's a before
and after storm so and these are the
seat up way Ryder buoys which we have
two out there now the Corps of Engineers
funded the inner one and a bar pilots
got now we got a grant and funded the
outer one off the continental shelf
there so that the idea is the data from
both of them one majors waves where it
feels the bottom of the other measures
of waves where doesn't feel the bottom
and you can come up with a better way
forecast that way now I don't come up
with a wave forecast but you have
National Weather Service if this helps
them then wonder
so the placement of that out or Bowie we
funded it but we let them choose where
to put it and hopefully we get better
forecast so we've been seeing some some
great improvements from that so here's
another placement idea that the one
issue that we have that the inshore wave
rider boo either the currents out of the
Columbia River can be extreme at times
six seven knots now that plume goes out
11 miles from the Columbia River
entrance any more than a two-knot
current in that way buoy goes underwater
doesn't transmit anymore so we're not
getting actual waves on the bar from
that buoy getting as close as possible
and then letting the modelers and try
and model it which also takes real-time
current to be able to do that which we
don't have either so for those of you
that would like to model the real-time
current or major real-time currents out
there and we're all open for it so
here's here's from the NDB see site they
have this available for all the all the
buoys that are out there and we look at
the peaks we watch the storm coming in
like that and at a certain point we
decide we can't take a ship out we don't
operate the ships and all the trains and
barges upriver start complaining when we
watch the storm drop off on the other
side when waves get back into our
operating levels then we can start
running ships again but remember we have
to give them 10 hours notice for that so
that's a that's a real challenge
forecasts are real important and this
this is just a great slide because there
were two storms we had a little window
we could move ships in a second second
storm came in we had to stop moving
ships again we've um scripts and a
National Weather Service have done great
jobs of tailoring their products to us
on the web sites this is off the scripts
website for the seed of bowie program
it's a 30 minute sample of all the waves
that occurred at that buoy so now we get
significant wave heights from indy bc
buoys but we can get this shows the
upper ten percent in the maximum wave
and for the full spectrum so before i
get on a ship and cross the bar i can
see what what I'm going to encounter
if the maximum wave like in this case is
30 feet yeah I looking are there a lot
of waves near it do I have to worry
about a whole lot of big waves or 30
foot and then the 22-foot was the next
lower one helps helps me decide we have
what I'm going to get involved in this
is another slide from the script site
that outer wave buoy not only is it off
the continental shelf to do that
comparison but it's also right on the
border of the wave watch three model in
the swaddle so it helps the transition
from one model to the other which is
providing a lot better modeling for us
on the bar and we you can see there's
differences there but it's fairly close
now we get into the visuals this is true
to scale a coming down the Columbia
River 33 foot between the bottom of the
ship and the and the bottom of the
channel so we really pay attention to
the tides as well so what this is a
lead-in for is another collaborative
partnership that we did part of that
grant we've started what's called a
dynamic under keel clearance program so
you can tell looking at that picture you
really don't want the ship to move it
all hit the bottom if it does you want
to know how much it moves so so this is
what we're doing now we're currently in
the process of this study and bringing
in lots of collaborative efforts on it
we're measuring each component that
makes the ship move water density tied
the squat which is how the ship settles
when it's moving heel and the waiver
response I'm running out of time ok I'll
move on so there a lot of people are
leading into that and we've also learned
different tied atoms are a lot of
different tied atoms on the river and
this is a bar forecast model that osu is
done for us the top when they're showing
the blue line is at the Waverider buoy
the red line is ma
for the bar taking the currents into
effect each one of those dotted lines is
now three hours from now six hours from
now and 12 hours from now and we get
something like this from each one of
those dotted lines which is very helpful
and wave response is the largest thing
so I'll leave you one last thing that's
a picture of a ship going across the bar
and you can tell you how much under keel
clearance we're losing on that one
pretty easily thank you and Amy's next
thank you Amy thanks thanks Jen and
thanks for inviting me to be a part of
this today it's been really interesting
and happy that you all stayed for this
final session I'm here representing the
emergency response division of Noah's
office of response and restoration which
is part of the National Ocean service
we're also known by our old name which
is still used frequently which is no
hazmat may be more familiar to many of
you the origins of our program are in
this figure in the upper right the Argo
merchant which was a spill which
threatened the Georges Bank fishing area
in back in the 1970s obviously it was a
very there's a lot of attention on it
and a lot of sensitivity and a lot of
conflicting information so i believe the
Coast Guard asked Noah to engage and be
their scientific liaison on that spill
and since then that relationship has
been more formalized and under the
National contingency plan NOAA has a
responsibility for providing scientific
support to the federal on-scene
coordinator for oil and hazardous
material spills and in the case of
marine oil spills the federal on-scene
coordinators of the Coast Guard so in
support of that mandate the emergency
response division provides 24 hours a
day 7 day a week response scientific
support for response during spills the
scope encompasses the entire coastline
including the Great Lakes Alaska Hawaii
and US territories so whether the spill
is
in the gulf of alaska the gulf of mexico
or the gulf of maine we need to provide
that scientific support so it's really
important for us to engage with the
regional experts through things like the
regional associations those scientific
support roles there's a numerous variety
of scientific support roles that some
scientists from the emergency response
division might serve in from flying in /
flights over the over the oil to map out
the surface oil distribution to looking
at the resources at risk for their
natural resources or human use resources
shoreline assessments data management
looking at protection priorities and
cleanup recommendations and then the one
I skipped over which is oil movement
forecast which wear myself as an
oceanographer usually helps out and that
from the big spills like these ones
which are relatively infrequent to the
much smaller spills like the one we saw
in the slide a few minutes ago in Puget
Sound the oil movement forecasts are
pretty much our most often our most
frequently requests for for scientific
support the Coast Guard needs to know
where where's the oil going to go is it
can impact a shoreline what do we need
to do to to react just a cartoon here
summarizing some of the physical or some
of the processes that are important in
predicting oil trajectory or a movement
of oil and so the main processes being
spreading of the oil on the surface due
to gravity initially and then the
horizontal I wish in turbulence a
weathering of the oil which is a
biological chemical and physical
transformations that take place after
the oil spilled and then transport by
the ocean currents the point here is
that all these processes are highly
dependent on the environmental
conditions when the oil is spilled so
our key variables for looking at all
these processes are the win
those wishing currents and then
temperature other variables are
important too i just listed a few to
give you a flavor of the observational
data that is important to us and then
most so what's it lost my train of
thought there so it's really the
forecasts of ocean currents and ocean or
in the winds that we're using to predict
the the oil movement so we can use
forecasts of the winds and the ocean
currents to run trajectories of oil
particle or of oil in our trajectory
model which is known the general noah
operation a modeling environment I don't
want to go into detail about the model
right now in the limited time here but
one of the points is that in addition to
using our in-house models we can use xyn
currents from external models Navy
operational models Noah models state
agency run models or models some of the
high res regional models that are run
through the ice regional associations
like the one shown here on the right
which is Alex crops model for the Oregon
shelf which you've heard of already
today and that is a screenshot showing
it with being used in our trajectory
model to simulate a hypothetical spill
off of Oregon and as far as the wind
forecast we rely on our friends at the
National Weather Service for the
forecast winds and we have a great
relationship with them or we can call
and get spot forecasts tailored for an
incident so I think I can just leave it
at that obviously we've heard a lot
about the value of observations for
improving forecasts and so we use
observations directly in addition to the
model forecast fields to validate the
models that were using with data it's
used for the assimilation for
constraining the forecast uncertainty
and also for looking at past movement of
oil to again to validate models and our
big requirement because we
have a scope that encompasses all these
different areas really the idea this
one-stop shopping for observational data
is really important when you get a call
at two in the morning you are not going
to spend time looking at a broad you
know spectrum of different sites for
data you really want to be able to pull
it all together quickly and I'm going to
stop there thank you all a very fitting
way to to end our discussion sessions of
the day with a very operationally
focused panel from search and rescue to
to crossing what is clearly a demanding
riverine bar system to actually how do
we go about protecting lives and
property from oil spills and other
hazardous materials that we can model
thank you all very much for that very
good discussion some questions please
for our panel Chris Morris in the back
the Coast Guard has done very well with
quantifying their requirements for
environmental information for search and
rescue is your group ready to do that
because that'd be a big help in
designing the evolution of IU's if that
was the case
I think it would be very tough because
of the broad spectrum of events that we
deal with from I mean not that search
and rescue applications aren't diverse
but with the different oil types and
chemical spills and I'm not sure what
that would look like it might be worth
looking at what the Coast Guard does to
make to quantify their requirements and
I bet you could make a stab at it with
the understanding that it'll improve as
you evolve it over time to absolutely I
have a general search and rescue
question sorry bill real quick super the
commander or stenka or might cause row
or some combination thereof but on the
East Coast the feasibility studies that
looked at at code our information and
improving search and rescue trajectory
tracks is that going is that going to be
exported nationwide or is that going to
be yes stink hold on so the answer is
yes under development from I use on the
short-term prediction system which is
that forecast thats our ops needs has
been developed for the regions where we
have hf radar and we work with our Talan
who is at their research center in
Connecticut the art in Connecticut who
developed saw ops so what has to happen
in an operational mission visits on the
developmental service server and then
the Coast Guard will bring that into
their operational system by releases and
then the training has to occur now as a
Coast Guard area commander they have
access to the environmental data server
that is not the operational and they can
get to that but we are close to bringing
the entire where we have hf radar this
sdp a short term prediction system into
the operational
honor for the Coast Guard so you'll have
access to it from saurabh's because
right now here in the West Coast you
still have to go to your developmental
server so that's what we're doing at the
national level let you take for what
you're doing Thanks thangka sure so I
think that's actually great to hear
because for us every step we can take in
the direction of getting more accurate
data and better representation that feed
or better data that feeds into the model
which then represents where whatever
object we're searching for word drift it
just makes our searches that much
shorter and especially here in the
Pacific Northwest where I was actually
on the nanny's iphone application a
little while ago which is great i hadn't
downloaded that before today that
fantastic but looking at the water
temperature at the La Push buoy and I
think it was 43 degrees right now the
survivability rate unless you're in a
life raft or even a even an ex ante
exposure coveralls or Gumby suit is
pretty short and so the quicker we can
find someone the better just from my
observations out here I've been out here
about seven months now are our offshore
data is actually very good when we're
searching generally what we end where we
end up finding it is where the models
are telling us where we run into
challenges is inside of Puget Sound and
part of that is just the lack of data
but part of it it's also it's just a
very geographically diverse area and
trying to model the hood canal or the
areas up in the San Juan Islands where
there's just so many inlets and
diverging currents winds and everything
else is challenging I don't know I'm not
certainly a scientist but I don't know
that we're ever going to be able to
crack that nut but we're certainly
getting better bill bill Berkman with a
core of just for Dan the the compelling
tale because of observing with an
applicator echt application one question
is how close are we to the right result
in other words you said you know you got
to have ten hours how often do you blow
it with
information that's a good question well
we haven't hit the bottom in a lot of
years so so we haven't blown it I'm in
my memory anyways if anything I think
we're blowing it on the conservative
side so ships that could sail and
they're losing a little bit of money
because we're being too conservative but
I'd rather err that way the study that
we're doing right now we should have
results out on that this fall and it'll
actually generate a computer program
that that will give us better tool to
work with
hi david jones from APL eww this is for
Captain Jordan just curious on where
does that decision get made is it made
first by just the pilot that's going to
be going out with that ship or is it
done at a center because I was wondering
you have a lot of different data and
there's probably some experience and
putting all that together I mean have
you been able to fuse all that in a kind
of a fusion center well it's it's both
the pilot going out and a center but the
pilot going out is at that center we're
a really small group there's only 14 of
us seven on duty at a time when a storms
approaching we usually have at least a
day sometimes more notice that it's
coming and as it gets close a few of us
will get together and make that decision
but once the ship sailed you're pretty
much committed to go there have been a
few ships that have anchored because a
storm is stalled but the ship was going
and yeah you have to err err on the side
of safety so you can't anchor in the
channel but the Coast Guard is it like
that thanks captain you sir and then
you're next Jerry joyous mood joyous
resources you you meant there's been a
lot of discussion about getting
real-time data how valuable it is to see
it immediately but for example when we
have an oil spill your modeling away but
those things aren't out to the public
they're out to the joint information
center who releases it and maybe we'll
get it that day or maybe we'll get it a
day later shouldn't if you're using all
this data you know real-time that's
coming from all these different
organizations shouldn't be result your
products be available also freely rather
than have it censored through the joint
command I i agree with you and I think
that was the case in deepwater horizon
after the first few weeks I think that
in a lot of cases with things like the
surface oil forecasts the events /
within for the typical spills that we do
by the time
it's it's asked for basically the
incident is over the oils on the beach
we're not producing them anymore but I
think because of the attention and the
roux and the demand for those products
during deepwater horizon I think that
they will be publicly available after in
the future and then certainly the
satellite analysis that was done by Noah
nez dis they were putting that out as
well in near real time I think the
public was getting it at the same time
as us later in the spill so I think it
was it was one of those questions
weren't no one had asked for it before
but I'm fairly new to haz mat so I don't
know okay well York you know Deborah
like you said you need the information
within the first few days but it took
weeks for that I if it's not
institutionalized now it's going to take
weeks again before it gets released out
to the public so I mean I hope that it
becomes institutionalized so that we can
have it we have our own you know I work
with a lot of on so we put people out to
scope out where the birds are and it
report that actually back to the
agencies and without having the
real-time data will never know where to
go so I hope it becomes
institutionalized and I could provide
one perspective from the fos see the
federal on-scene coordinator for an a
for an event I mean we don't even have
access to real-time there's no real time
click a button get a beautiful model
system at least that we use right now I
mean the when there's an event or an oil
spill that's going to require the stand
up of an incident command or even one of
the smaller events we actually use
scientific support from NOAA for the
landing craft Justin that slide I showed
they actually sent someone down to our
our command center we actually as a
federal on-scene commander will submit
the request for a specific analysis to
Noah they have to do that analysis once
we receive that analysis back and
oftentimes they are in the command
center or the incident command with the
Coast Guard the state the responsible
party everyone then that immediately
gets
released out as part of either press
release or just for larger events will
actually have there'll be some sort of a
website stood up for that so I would say
it's released as close to real time or
near time as the person that's going to
be using that for actual operational
command and control is getting it so in
especially for future large-scale events
I think you'll see much better reporting
in the future thank you hi I'm Brian
slinky here with Noah and question for
Captain Jordan you mentioned an interest
in currents in the Columbia River Bar
and I was wondering if you could comment
on the utility of the code RC sond hf
radar surface currents measured in that
area I'm not aware that they're doing
that on the Columbia River Bar yeah you
are is it on the net eshe site i'll look
for it yes the microphone character my
car oh yeah we we are making we are
making measurements of the Columbia
River outflow there the technique the
the hf technique has trouble when the
currents get as large as they do right
at the mouth so we don't do a good job
when they get up at three meters a
second but not not it takes it doesn't
take long for them to come down below to
where we are able to measure them and
that's the region that the waves pass
through where you need to write to do
the wave showing so the modeling that
I'm aware of that we're doing is using
the currents through the co op Center
Antonio Batista's work but I'm not aware
of what you're doing so I'd like to talk
to you more about that absolutely love
to yeah this is a and E linear with
Oregon coastal management program and I
guess I was thinking after hearing you
guys talk that I didn't hear anything
about vessel traffic monitoring and
wondering if you guys how you do that
how you account for patterns of movement
over time if you if you keep track of
that or if you use automated
systems to basically monitor to the
ship's as they're moving up and down the
coast or in and out of the river
channels I can cover part of that I can
at least cover that for puget sound so
Puget Sound is one of the areas where
there is an established vessel traffic
service which is essentially similar to
an air traffic control tower on the
water although they give less direction
than air traffic controllers would give
two aircraft they only intervene if
there's an imminent collision or
something that's going to happen so for
vessels that are above a certain size
that are required to be part of that
vessel traffic scheme coming in and out
of the straits and puget sound they do
track data on those vessel movements and
because they are all have automatic
identification system a is on board we
have a series of radars and AIS
receivers that essentially allow the
Coast Guard to track those vessels from
far offshore and it's it's a partnership
between the u.s. and Canada because the
vessels are handed off as they come in
through the Straits they they shift
between Canadian waters US waters and so
it's a joint vessel traffic service so
we share the data between the Canadians
and the in the US on those larger
vessels for smaller vessels that aren't
required to be part of the vessel
traffic system we don't have any
specific way to track them other than if
they happen to fall into some of our
other sensors that our Jayhawk happens
to have on the water for homeland
security purposes but it's not nearly as
robust as with the larger vessels thanks
commander and with that I'm going to
have to draw this particular session to
a close I asked to it we thank not just
these panel members but all our panel
members it gave such exciting and
informative talks today
great well thank you everyone I'm
actually wired for sound already and so
I'm happy to say that I'm standing in
between you and a wonderful reception
that's about to begin but I do want to
share some words with you I have three
things that I would like to say in for
quick announcements and and and they're
really important to me and the first one
is is um the sense of gratitude and I
extend what David said and I on behalf
of all of nannies I thank you all 150
individuals who chose to spend your time
today with us in this room talking about
this and and giving us your input and
your insights I really thank you for
making that decision we know how busy
people are and I echo what David said
about all of the speakers who spoke it
was an incredibly talented bunch of
people that we had we have a beautiful
program that is in the lobby that has
their speaker bios in it so I encourage
you to get to know these people better
because they bring an enormous amount of
talent to the region and I thank them
for their participation and then also we
mentioned our our organizing committee
that put this this event on and they are
also listed in this in this program and
i'm going to read their names because it
is these people who every two weeks got
on a phone call this this event did not
happen because oh there's a cookie
cutter way to do it it was because of
people's really good ideas of how to put
that together bill dewey with Taylor
shellfish Jack Dunnigan of the army

Steve rumrill with its state of Oregon
Joe Schumacher from the quinault indians
Rick spin Matt spinrad from osu steve
oosik hi from The Boeing Company and
Timmy van from our Noah office here at
montlake they were joined this is our
local group they were joined by Jessica
Snowden from the the I us office out of
DC with stanka Willis and also hard our
leaders in putting this on through the
IOC the interagency ocean observing
committee Ralph Raynor Nick Rome and
Josh young this has been a fantastic
team to work with and I thank you so
much ok that was message number one
message number two we've heard some
really excellent feedback today two
nanos and and what I've heard our are
some feedback of about our successes and
I can't tell you as as someone involved
in enanos how how wonderful it is to
hear those things but i really want to
underscore that it is the diverse people
some of whom you've heard their names
mentioned today some many of whom you
have not and i want to make a point here
because the people of manners i think
they sort of self select these are not
people who are out for fame or ego or
money or power you don't join an ocean
observing system for those reasons
because those things don't exist you
join an ocean observing system because
you think that you might have ideas
about how to solve problems because you
think that you might have ideas about
how to bring things that are desperately
separate and bringing them together and
and because you're creative and that you
might have good ideas and that you're
willing to work well with others and
I've been involved in a lot of projects
some leaders some as a as a partner and
i have to tell you that being the
director of nannies is one of the things
that gives me the best pleasure in terms
of working with people we have good
people and that's what makes nannies
what it is and so I want to thank them
and I want to welcome you all into the
collective nany's family as you as you
see fit and as we go forward
okay we also heard a lot about
challenges and to be quite frank some of
our most difficult challenges came right
in that first discussion money problems
of data quality and how to assure these
things and and then also that crevasse
with science policy in the struggle
there okay these are not new new
problems these are pervasive problems
globally but these are problems that I
have heard from the IOC leadership
co-chairs from Stanko Willis director of
IOUs and from nanos that okay you know
in a way I say damn the torpedoes you
know we can't just give up so what kind
of a nation do you want to live and what
kind of a nation do you want to build
and so these are real problems they're
difficult to address but we have to do
our best okay so so we're going forward
with those and what's exhilarating to me
is that I'm hearing that from the
highest levels down and I really want to
thank the IOC for their leadership in
that all right there's other challenges
though that are maybe the next level
down and we heard some of those today
things like the time scales differences
and the connections how to better reach
our audience how we can improve on our
products both in the short term sorts of
things that we can be doing now and in
the long-term things that we can be
doing now and those are really exciting
to me because those are some things that
we can put some great creative energy
into this this workshop is not a one-off
it's not a one and done as what I meant
this is the start okay and and for many
of you about 50 of you you've chosen to
spend another day with us tomorrow we're
going to start having those
conversations but we're not going to end
there okay this is an iterative process
we need your constant input to it and
nurturing so I'm excited so that's my
third message is is that we've we've
heard about our successes we've heard
about our challenges and I summarized
that this last part up by
saying that despite what the calendar
says this is not Groundhog Day in the
sense of that silly movie we're all
thinking about this is definitely not
sticking in our mode and and just doing
status quo so so I I thank you for that
energy and I and I know it's going to
continue so well I've got your mention
on friday i want to call your attention
it is also in the lovely program we have
two things going on tomorrow we're going
to be in a different building this is
building 33 there's a building 99 right
yes and we're going to be in building 99
and and you've all got the in directions
on how to get there we're going to start
at eight thirty once again with Rob
fought length with Microsoft Research
starting a session on new collaborations
we heard a lot of really cool ideas and
and and this is a wonderful pink tank
let's let's think about some of these
new things that we could maybe do
together alright so that's our first
session from 832 1030 then um we're
going to take a little break and from
eleven to one we want your your ideas on
enhancing observations we've heard a lot
of ideas thrown out today and we've
heard some things that I know people are
sitting on and they're thinking about
things about how to achieve optimum
integration things about how to
encourage wider participation and things
about how to secure and sustain the
improved engagement of all users so so
that's what we're going to focus on
tomorrow in our friday morning and then
we're going to really get a treat
because one of our co-sponsors of this
event siebert electronics who has a
wonderful display in the back there is
going to have a lunch and open house at
their facility which is very close by
