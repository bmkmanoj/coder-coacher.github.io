lectures freely available
let me take you around the world and
never bring you back to University of
Washington and our last presentation for
today all right good afternoon we have
students from the University of
Washington that is our pleasure to
introduce you to community slate a
project on improving public
participation in urban planning today's
urban planning process is inconvenient
and inaccessible because of high
barriers for participation only a small
vocal minority end up getting hard
platforms like neighborhood blogs and
forums are able to engage thousands or
more people than the community meetings
that are drawn by the city but because
these platforms aren't directly
connected to the city there's no
guarantee that the people's voices are
being heard by city officials but this
kind of feedback is important because it
leads to an improvement in the quality
of decisions made by the government and
it minimizes the costs and delays so
what if you could so what if we could
use social media technologies to guide
this discussion what if you could take
part in this planning process from your
living room or even a sidewalk we
propose community state it's a cross
connected platform or city planners are
able to inform neighborhoods a bad
development projects and then make
better decisions based on the feedback
they receive throughout a projects
timeline now we're going to present to
your video showing a fictionalized
account of what the future could be with
community slate
public involvement and urban planning is
always needed but it can sometimes be a
long and frustrating process and the
planning field and city development has
traditionally been very antiquated you
know it's an area that's been slow to
catch up with technology we didn't
really understand how much more
inclusive it can be until we use the new
system we decided to first try a
community slate on an urban rest stop
project in Seattle it's a laundry shower
facility for the homeless there is
several located in the city and they've
been serving the homeless without
disturbing nearby businesses attendance
because this site is in a residential
area we knew we needed to engage the
public early to make sure their concerns
were being heard and responded to
community slate has helped us make
communication and back and forth much
more transparent it was easy for the
public to see what others in their
community were saying and it was easy
for us to track the numbers on specific
issues I think what's unique about
community slate is that it's able to
generate curiosity and people about
what's going on in their neighborhood
the two biggest concerns we observed for
the overall safety and people worrying
with rest stop would attract more
homeless to the area based on the
feedback we received early in the
process we were able to organize the
information and propose alternatives the
adjustments that one over the largest
amount of public support were limiting
the rest stops hours and making sure
that there was someone working security
whenever the facility would be open it's
much easier to discover and participate
in all these projects that are happening
in the city you can be involved from
anywhere the construction cranes are the
only indicators the European rest stop
is a great example it was something that
had to be done on the city's part but
with the public's input we were able to
actively respond to the neighborhood's
concerns the move forward with the
project and that's the goal working
together with communities to create a
better city
so something that we observed when we
are watching the movie is that the goal
of community slate is to create
accessibility between the public as well
as city planners and it accomplishes
this and three different entry points
the first is a development sign next is
the mobile application and finally the
website itself and what I'd like to do
is go into more detail on each of these
entry points starting off with the
development sign the current signs that
we use within the city are often these
static and impersonal signs that the
city plan that we actually interviewed
kind of refer to them as these
bureaucratic signs that just collected
graffiti but the ones the signs that
were actually most successful were more
colorful and more visually appealing and
we wanted to take those as an influence
in developing a sign of our own
community slate has a portrait style
sign that incorporates color and is
visually dynamic having clear
information that people in the streets
can follow also it includes two basic
interactive elements the first of which
is a removable portion of the sign which
allows the city planner to update
information along the way this keeps
people that are on the streets up to
date the next is an NFC tag locate at
the bottom left hand side which allows
people to connect directly to
communities late the next entry point is
the mobile application using the mobile
application users that engage in the NFC
tag are taken directly to a project
information they're able to browse info
posted by the city planners as well as
questions that the city planners wish to
receive feedback the public is able to
disagree or agree or even bring up
issues of their own they are also given
a visual data visualization of what
other members within their community are
saying on the certain topics and finally
another portion of the mobile
application is in map view using this
map individuals are able to discover
more projects within their area that
they can visit or monitor the final
entry point is the website this is
provides the most comprehensive
information as well as a visual of a
timeline and structured conversation on
the development projects themselves upon
entering the website they're given a
description much like the mobile
application locate on the left hand side
a vertical timeline showcases what stage
in the development project a certain
site is at and they're able to follow
along as it progresses in the center
much like the mobile app there is a
questionnaire that is posted by the city
planners as more people begin to
generate content and more activities
visualized on the website the most hits
are the ones that are generating the
most popularity are brought directly to
the top to generate some more
transparency between public the public
and the city planners the information
that's most active or generating the
most concern can actually be addressed
directly by a forum that the city
planner can connect with now development
signs that face a lot of public
opposition can be frustrating in
grassley but by allowing city planners
to engage with the public right from the
beginning and then throughout a project
we open up their transparency on
government decisions and sorry we
increase transparency in government
decisions and then improved development
part of the development projects thereby
minimizing cost and time now we
understand that engaging users in these
kind of planning processes is difficult
and we've been talking to a lot of city
officials to validate our concept
through the city's eyes but we're moving
forward we need to better understand the
various contexts in which our users are
going to be interacted with these
prototypes we hope that community slate
not only helps the public and the
planners work together to improve their
cities but they can but then it can also
serve as a model for better democratic
participation in other government issues
thank you
the difficult aspects of getting the
information why don't you think sexists
at the moment and where do you think the
real resistance is to having something
that it's working well I don't think
that currently anything works right now
is because they haven't really looked at
the models that are currently in being
used by city planners right now there's
a lot of forums online there's a lot of
end of it independent blogs and there's
like city planning meetings that they
offer and I think what they need to do
is kind of observe how those are being
effective and kind of transferred to a
system such as this one or consider
something that follows a very similar
guidelines yeah they're like different
ways that the city has are constructed
for people to engage with planners but
they're not by you know they're not very
effective like they have these community
meetings that are you know these long
drawn-out things in the evenings where
you know people are kinda reluctant to
go to them it takes time you know away
from their families and not only that
people just aren't the city kind of
feels in communicating when you should
be giving what kind of feedback so
people are just generally confused about
or do I talk about design or do I talk
about zoning because the city does want
very specific or types of feedback in
specific phases and there's a lot of
communication on in you know in that
drum make also to qualify this is really
difficult like to have community members
get together and really discuss what
they want to see from city planners and
vice versa and there is definitely a
disengaged population to this difficult
to connect with so it's just a matter of
like how can we start the conversation
that's what can you say it's trying to
do
I was going to say to actually I think
one of the things that's difficult right
now in the process is sort of a public
open-ended forums that the city uses
where people assume that they can come
and say whatever they want when we
talked to city officials it seemed like
they were they really like the idea of
having a more structured conversation
where they get asked really specific
questions hey just a quick question
because you you said earlier on that you
were trying to address kind of an
imbalance that it was a high threshold
to have influence and it was dominated
by special interest groups and
individual had didn't have such a voice
and this would bring it so the question
is have how he thought about dealing
with the potential for this to be gained
by those very same special interest
groups so that again your voice is
overwhelmed by those that are already
have a voice just it just louder I think
we're assuming that there would have to
be some sort of identification
identification and login process so that
for specific projects you would know who
the queen who the community members are
and where they live in proximity to
whatever the development is and that
would make it almost like like a more
complex form of voting and that would
make it hopefully a more democratic
process yeah and more accountable do you
have an honest question they found you
do you have something you wanna clay
yeah I can see the law a lot of politics
is trade-offs right if I can vote for
something that costs no money or
something that cost some money why not
just go ahead and vote for the thing
that cost some money and in the choices
you showed the expensive choice right
have that have a guard station there
during during business hours loads costs
onto the project that I don't feel as a
taxpayer because it's such a small piece
of my tax revenues but how do you
introduce the public to the idea that
there are trade-offs in the choices
they're making so you don't just get
people running up the bill
every project they're asked to ask to
comment on well I think with every
initiative I like this is not a way that
people are having direct absolute say in
it they're bringing up these questions
and what we're doing is giving them a
voice if they say that they want to
security guard and I voted on it there
is no we haven't tested anything that's
going to you know guarantee that's
something that they can implement right
away that's something that would come
with more research but at least they
didn't feel like this as being you know
the way that this particular product
actually is going about in the City of
Seattle it is just being in place and
its abrupt and so this is a method that
we can give them this information and
start more conversations on it and maybe
come to an agreement that isn't as you
know loading on so much cost I mean it's
it's all so hopefully that the planners
would maybe rearrange budgets or there's
also the part of the website where the
planners can respond to what the
audiences are the you know that these
are saying so they could say like you
know it was good effort but we might not
be able to work this into the project
well right well thank you guys
so that's it you guys Mike you want to
be awesome like I'm gonna make him come
out because he is making this all happen
so thank you so much thanks you guys for
coming pretty inspiring awesome great
projects stick around ask students
questions thanks to all the professors
and all the liaisons and yay thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
