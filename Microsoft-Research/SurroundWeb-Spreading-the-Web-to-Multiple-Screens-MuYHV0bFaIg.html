researcher at Microsoft Research in the
area of computer vision and natural
interaction hi I'm David Molnar I work
at Microsoft in the areas of security
and privacy today we'd like to show you
surround web surround web is a way to
bring immersive room experiences to
everyone's home without compromising
privacy we believe the world is moving
towards these immersive room experiences
based in part on what we've been able to
do right here at Microsoft with surround
web every single surface in your home
becomes a way to interact with the web
so for instance this table becomes
another screen for web pages to show
content now I'd like to show you an
example web page that makes use of
multiple screens so here this web page
is dedicated to car racing the main
screen on my TV shows the actual event
itself whereas these additional
projected screens show some content for
Wikipedia about standings some of my
friends chatting about car racing and
then some picture and picture to show me
what else I could be watching right now
we aren't limited to projectors we
actually can take over tablets as well
like this Microsoft Surface and we can
take over phones like this phone I'm
using to control this presentation now
what's interesting about all of this is
that each of these pieces is just part
of the same web page each of these is
just an element that can be manipulated
using standard web technologies in
addition to what was shown the web page
has an ability to react to actual events
that happen in the room for example I
might put my drink on the table and
website reminds me that this is 155
calories all this interaction with the
room can enable a lot of scenarios for
example you can think of a website for
recipes that look at the kitchen and can
tell us what is the next step that we
need to do as well as remind us to take
the pot from the stove because it's
going to get burned the additional
functionality that we enables website
doesn't come at the cost of the privacy
for the users
in fact we don't send any information
back to the website website can
subscribe to events and give us
additional information about what to do
in case of an event happened but they
will never know if such event happened
they don't look at me they don't see the
room in fact the level of privacy it's
much higher than there is exist today
with all that additional functionality
we've now shown you surround web an
extension to the web browser that allows
any web page to spill out into the real
world and adapt to real world objects we
believe these immersive experiences are
the future based in part on the work
we've done here at Microsoft and we
built surround web to let you and
everyone else access these immersive
experiences with confidence from any web
page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
