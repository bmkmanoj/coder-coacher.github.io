exif research Michelle Carrasco from
Microsoft Research and I'm gee too bad
the economics of research and our
project is called 399 and the idea of
the project is to allow large
corporations like Microsoft to save
energy so in typically in a large
corporation like Microsoft we have
thousands of desktop PCs and these
species are left on even when the user
is not present typically when the user
goes home people turn off lights in
their offices but people learn people
never turn their PCs off and the reason
for this is that they might want to
access the data from home or they might
the IT department won't want to access
their machines remotely they might want
to patch their machines or they might
want to update it or anything of that
sort so the aim of our project is to
make this process completely seamless
even when the machine is asleep and the
way this works is that we deploy a sleep
proxy which takes over from a sleeping
machine and then it watches for any
traffic that's destined for that machine
anytime important traffic arrives the
machine is woken up and this process is
completely seamless to the user or any
other applications in addition we also
give you we allow you to wake up the
machine by simply swiping your card so
let's say when you enter the building in
the morning your machine is your desktop
is woken up for you and we also give you
a mobile app which you can use to wake
up your machine and now let me show you
how this works so here are two machines
one of them is asleep already and one of
them is awake and you can see that the
machine that is awake is consuming a
good 9200 watts of power and when the
Machine goes to sleep is going to
consume far less power typically roughly
about to watch once the mirror settles
here and now let me show you how our
system works you come into the office in
the morning you swipe your badge and as
you can see this machine here which was
set to wake up is going to wake up so
this is your desktop you came into the
office in the morning and your desktop
is all ready for you in fact our system
is even more seamless typic you know if
you came in here and let's say you
machine now this machine i just put
sleep he wanted to access file let us
say a music file that you are stored on
this machine and you wanted to play it
all you do is your double click on the
music file and our system detects that
your you are trying to play the music
file it wakes up your machine your
machine is here is getting ready to wake
up and the music has started playing
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
