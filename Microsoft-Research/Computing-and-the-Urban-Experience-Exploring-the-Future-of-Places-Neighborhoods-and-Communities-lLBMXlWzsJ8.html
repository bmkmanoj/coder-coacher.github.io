you
thanks everybody and really thank you
for coming it's really great to come
back and speak to you all and it's an
honor to be here so thanks so as andreas
mentioned them from Carnegie Mellon if
you don't know me and I'm going to be
speaking today about computing and the
urban experience I I wasn't sure what
the audience would be but so I figured
I'd talk about my own research interests
just in case you don't know me I think
maybe at least half of you do but in any
case the work that I do is kind of
cross-disciplinary and it touches many
different subject areas in general i
tend to identify myself most as a social
computing researcher and by that what I
mean is that in my work I design I build
and I research social computing systems
but in the process of that I also tend
to touch other areas including
ubiquitous computing specifically with
relation to analysis of social data and
also with relation to locate location
and mobility and urban environments so
that's kind of an overview of the types
of things that I like to touch with my
research so one kind of folk observation
that can be made about mobile and social
computing is that much of the way we
interact with and experience the people
in places immediately around us is kind
of mediated by our devices and so we use
our phones to tell us when the bus is
coming or to hail a cab we take photos
of our meals and we share them with
people that are far away we navigate
both the new and and both new and the
familiar with the aid of computer
synthesized voices and so it seems that
these kind of mobile and social apps are
blurring the lines between things that
were once quite distinct and these these
include things like the digital and the
physical the public and private between
anonymity and identity between solitude
and togetherness and between near and
far what's what's interesting about this
is that this kind of blurring is kind of
bi-directional and so on the one hand
the mobile and social software that we
as an industry are developing is
affecting and changing how we
racked with the physical world but on
the other hand our physical world
behavior can be sensed and analyzed
through the software that we use and the
smartphone's that we carry and so I
think this kind of it's an interesting
kind of I guess duality that you know
we're that these lines are being blurred
and that we're in this moment where we
can study people through the mobile
phones that they're carrying now this
blurring of lines is is more apparent I
would argue in kind of urban
environments and so in the last few
years i've been i've been interested in
a new area of research called urban
computing which looks at the
intersection of cities social and sensor
data and mobile and ubiquitous computing
so why cities right so what makes city
is so different so special or so
interesting what is it that that makes
them study worthy well CDs have a number
of interesting properties that make for
unique design affordances for new
technologies and I'll take a moment to
briefly talk about a few that matter
most to me I would say that the chief
property of cities that distinguishes
them both in terms of is density and
that's both in terms of the density of
the built environment so the physical
buildings and the infrastructure but
also the density of people so the
density of people that live in the city
and people that work and travel in
cities so cities are dense and density
creates an extraordinary design
opportunity for applications and
services that connect us to the Nexus of
people of places and ideas that surround
us in a city and so for example ventures
like uber they they just simply would be
very difficult to implement into scale
in in environments that are not urban
and so it's the density that makes
something like uber as valuable as use
CDs also have public spaces cities are
full of public spaces and these are
places where people congregate openly
where they're surrounded by large
largely by what are essentially
strangers and what's interesting about
public spaces is that the flow and the
diversity of people that pass through
them and the sort of serendipity of the
actions and interactions that occur
in public spaces make that make a urban
public spaces a truly fascinating realm
for deploying new sensors and new
technologies so it's just it's a really
interesting space to work in anonymity
and privacy concepts of privacy and
anonymity are fascinating to me
especially in cities because really a
they frame one of the kind of central
paradoxes of the urban experience that
that is despite being surrounded by
millions of people within a few square
miles cities are places that afford an
enormous amount of privacy and so to
paraphrase something that Jane Jacobs
said she said that privacy is precious
in cities and is precious simply because
you can't get it anywhere else and so in
small settlement people know your
affairs in cities people don't and
that's that's an interesting it's an
interesting way to frame a kind of
privacy in an environment like a city so
when I think about this I I really
believe that understanding privacy and
anonymity in cities is one of the main
factors to being able to design
successful social urban technologies and
finally another kind of feature of
cities that makes them interesting from
this perspective is their infrastructure
so cities have intricate centralized
infrastructures and they present
countless opportunities where
technological innovation can enrich the
lives of city dwellers that rely on this
this infrastructure so given all of that
we might ask well what is the goal of
something like urban computing well it's
hard to say that it has a single goal
because I think it's really define best
as computing for and about cities but I
would say there are several trends and
byproducts of this new discipline that
have emerged and these are our goals
like designing more efficient cities
designing more livable cities designing
more healthy cities more safe cities and
more productive cities and some of the
examples of kind of new services and
applications that we see that they try
to tackle things like this include
applications for example
computer froze include applications for
example like see click fix which empower
citizens to take collective action in
improving their sitting so these are in
this application basically you you're a
citizen with a smartphone and if there's
for example if there's some problem that
you see that you'd like your city
government to take care of you can take
a picture of it and send it to to the
correct municipality
I'm frozen here
hi welcome you came just in time for my
computer to freeze
yes something it's loading or something
okay another example is the pure economy
so the pier economy it's you know peer
economy or the sharing economy we think
of this as releasing valuable excess
capacity and I think this is especially
apparent in cities and so much so that I
would even argue that that this this
phenomenon I really don't know why these
keep the record I'll skip all of these
slides because I think there's something
wrong with them this phenomenon of the
the sharing economy or the pure economy
I would I would consider it in urban
phenomenon that I think that a lot of
these systems they said they simply
wouldn't exist in the way that they do
exist if if they weren't deployed in
urban environments I'm going to pause
and try to fix this technical glitch
because something is wrong with my
computer its a Mac yeah that's why it
stopped you guys have associate yeah
hmm
yeah I think I might have to
alright let me reboot and we'll sit and
chat for a second while I do that
yeah yeah I think that's hard to answer
for all services right and I don't think
that there's one silver bullet that
would that would be the key to kind of
success in all of these domains but I
mean I think that what the common
denominator that you're seeing is that
they are hitting policy issues right and
these policy issues are hugely complex
because they're different in every
different city and so it is hard to
scale but I think the strategy that
they're taking is that they seem to be
kind of ignoring policy and then just
trying to fight it as it as it happens
or as they need to I don't know that
that's necessarily the best way but it
seems to be working for them and they
seem to be changing and affecting policy
in their favor in part because i think
the the market is driving it right that
that uber despite like the controversy
it's incredibly efficient and it works
really well they've built a good product
and and that the market aspect of that
is driving the policy change and so
governments are adapting because it
works so well I think that's part of it
yeah and and having having the right
product for the right time yeah I don't
know if that necessarily answers it but
I guess I don't have an exact answer for
your question because it's I think it's
a little hard to grasp every every
scenario
yeah really specific the city of the
city for the first place where they yeah
some sort of this is more of a guest
policy question but I know that Sweden
rolled out like on a government level
their fiber optic infrastructure where
they targeted the rural areas they're
the ones morning and I'm kind of
wondering what are the yeah I I mean
well the obvious downside is that things
get left behind right that you know it
seems to be that the market is is
favoring at least for scale reasons this
type of deployment and that means that
just a second that means that probably
like your startups are designing for
deploying in these urban settings
because it's often easier to scale that
way and that might mean that that
certain populations are left behind and
it might mean that you need government
initiatives to work against perhaps the
market to develop innovations for these
populations and I don't I don't
necessarily know the right strategy for
that but I think it sounds like Sweden
is taking some some innovative measure
so what's the specific I see I see
yeah yeah sure sure yeah I I don't think
I've made an assertion that it's that
strong that it requires data to be back
to yet but what I'm saying is
anecdotally yes Airbnb works in for
vacations but so did other companies
like vbr o was almost strictly vacation
based right but that didn't see the same
sort of kind of growth and I think we're
the the assertions that I'm making is
that the kind of that even though
something like Airbnb works very well in
vacation spots and in rural spots it
works perfectly well it's changing a lot
in cities it's changing real estate
prices is changing the way people think
about property and ownership of things
and it's possible that they could have
deployed a product that works entirely
in non dense areas but it would be an
entirely different product that's my
assertion I don't have data necessarily
to back that yeah
okay it would work the same yes probably
but it like in terms of the cultural
entity that it is and so I'm making
something a little bit more softer I'm
not making a heart claim I'm making a
claim about this the culture of this
particular product and how it's
affecting what we think of property and
what we think of ownership is that is
that fair or convincing okay yeah yeah I
mean so there is there is data that
looks at that particular question and
that might be something that we can talk
about offline but yes I do have data to
back that up yeah but in terms of like
my statements about Airbnb yeah you're
right but what I'm talking about is more
cultural perceptions about about
ownership and space and and it's having
a profound cultural effect on vent areas
it's a soft claim I don't have data to
back that up but yeah okay this working
maybe these slides are broken that would
suck
I think there's something to do with the
projector what I'm going to do is skip
these particular slides and move on to
something else because I think there's
something broken here sorry guys yeah
anyway that wasn't wasn't that critical
so let's move on to the type of work
that I like to do so in my work what I
like to do is I I look at things at like
how does computing help us understand
the urban experience how is computing
changing the urban experience how is
computing impacting notions of place
neighborhood and community in cities and
how can the collective local knowledge
and actions of the urban crowd enrich
the understanding of the physical world
and so these are the kinds of I guess
motivating ideas that kind of drive the
work that I like to do today i'll be
presenting three research projects that
have been working on recently the first
is called live foods and it's about
discovering city neighborhood boundaries
through social media the second project
is called curated city and this is a
work where i built a system that it's
about building city guides through
social curation and the third project is
something that started here infused this
summer it's called journeys and notes
it's an ongoing piece of research that's
about designing social software for when
we're in in commute all three of these
works they concern the interplay between
online and offline hyper local
communities and they illustrate ways in
which the collective local knowledge and
actions of the urban crowd can be
leveraged to enrich our understanding of
the physical world so with that I'll
start and i'll talk about live foods
this is work that was done in
collaboration with rosh warts Jason Hong
and normans today and it was published
in icy wsm 2012 before i talk about live
foods i want to talk about neighborhoods
so neighborhoods they play a number of
essential roles in the daily lives of
city dwellers and by virtue of our sort
of everyday experience with them most
people have an intuitive grasp on the
idea of a neighborhood
but it can be difficult for one to kind
of describe concretely exactly what a
neighborhood is let alone specify with
exact precision where one neighborhood
starts and another ends so to kind of
get a sense of what a neighborhood is we
can start by enumerated some of the
things that they do and some of the
roles that they play so to start
neighborhoods they sort of provide a in
order to the chaos and complexity of the
city cities are big and complex and
neighborhoods help us organize them they
provide a sort of common ground that let
us talk about the same places and no for
you to talk about one neighborhood and
me to know what you're talking about
it's this common ground that's an
organizational principle they help us
where did they help us determine where
to live where to work and where to play
they can provide an area of safe haven
from unfamiliar territory they're also
an organizational unit that are used by
city governments they don't necessarily
serve a political purpose but they help
governments / determine where to provide
services for people they can also be
engines of economic growth and activity
as these sort of cultural entities they
can be brands so for example the Capitol
Hill neighborhood in Seattle is a
neighborhood that I think has a fairly
well established brand in the city most
importantly to me they also provide a
sense of identity to their residents so
given all that I think you know we can
enumerate all of these things that they
do but they're much more complicated
than the enumeration of services that
they provide and that's because
neighborhoods are actually cultural
entities they're collectively and
socially defined by the people that live
there and go there and so because of
that we each sort of carry around our
own personal biases of how we view the
city and its neighborhoods and for
example my view of this might differ
from your view of this and so we have
these sort of slight variant variation
in how we kind of you view and perceive
these areas and so in addition to that
aspect neighborhoods because there are
these cultural entities they can evolve
fast both in terms of how cities develop
and evolve but also in terms of how
people perceive
the action and consequence of these
developments and that fast evolution can
be much faster than the official
boundaries that delineate them so cities
will develop these these Official
municipal boundaries but the city can
evolve much faster than these boundaries
do and so that that motivates two
perspectives on the neighborhoods of the
city on the one hand you know they are
these kind of politically constructed
things there are a set of boundaries
that are often defined by by local urban
planning departments and yeah and on the
other hand there are also these kind of
socially constructed things that are
defined from the bottom up these
cultural entities and so we have these
two different perspectives the goal of
this work is we want to see can we use
the footprints of the urban crowd as
revealed through social media to shed
light on the socially defined view of
neighborhoods and so it's this
underlying the underlying hypothesis
that kind of drives this effort is that
the character of an urban area is
defined not just by the types of places
found there but also by the people that
who make that area part of their daily
routine and and so therefore given that
hypothesis to discover the unique
discover areas of unique character we
should look for clusters of nearby
venues that are visited by many of the
same people and so we have this sort of
clustering goal now so we we want to
find areas of a city these kind of
spatially contiguous areas of the city
that are uniquely defined but how do we
do that well we can do that by looking
at the people that visit these areas so
let me give a little bit of intuition of
how this process works so if you you
know if you watch people's movement over
time you'll notice groups of like-minded
people tend to stay in the same areas
and so for example the the orange smiley
and the green smiley tend to stay to the
west side of this this picture and the
pink and the purple tend to stay in the
east we can sort of look at these
patterns and aggregate this collective
behavior over time 24
pairwise relationships between the
places between the venues that people
are visiting so that nearby venues are
are strongly related if they're visited
by many of the same people and weakly
related if they're visited by different
sets of people and so by looking at this
this sort of data this data of movement
patterns we can start formulating these
kind of relationships between places and
given these kind of pairwise
relationships what we can then do is use
kind of standard clustering algorithms
to segment the city into regions we call
these regions live hoods and that's
meant to reflect the idea that they're
not quite neighborhoods but they're
still reflecting some sense of
commonality enough kind of collective
behavior and what's going to happen is
you're going to have spatially
contiguous areas that reflect these
collective movement patterns of the
people that visit them so they pause
here may be questions is everyone on the
same page yep yeah I'll get to that in a
second but the data that we're going to
look at is is from foursquare yeah
there there are some cases where there
it where there is a jump but there is a
continuity that happens so it it's I'll
explain as to why that happens there's a
strong geographic preference that we put
inside the bottle so they're in some
boundary cases that might happen but
it's very unlikely yeah yeah so to dance
question the data that we used here are
from foursquare so Foursquare check-ins
they're there by default there these
private their private data they're not
necessarily publicly shared or public
lease capable but some people can elect
to share their check-ins publicly
through Twitter and so what we did is we
we kind of crawled Twitter for these
kinds of chickens and we built a data
set that consisted of approximately 17
million or so check-ins that were shared
on Twitter and then up then aligned and
reconstructed via the Foursquare API and
so at the end of the day we have
basically a user ID a timestamp of venue
ID latitude longitude and a venue
category for about 17 million chickens
worldwide worldwide yeah so it's a much
smaller data set when you start to look
in a single City but yeah this is 17
million worldwide just I'm going to
gloss over a lot of the details of the
the method up the method used but I'll
kind of touch on some things so how how
do we measure the sort of social
affinity between two venues in order for
this approach to work we need to have
this kind of measure of what makes one
venue similar to another and just to
kind of not use jargon so a venue is is
what a person checks into in foursquare
it's a place it's a place that they go
and they check into the venue to share
with other people so the goal is to
develop some sort of similarity between
two venues that reflects the kind of
social overlap of the people that visit
them so we took a pretty natural
approach to this so we modeled these
kinds of venues as the kind of bag of
check-ins so we look at
the set of users that have checked into
each of these venues and so if we think
of each venue as a vector each component
of the vector counts the number of times
a particular user has checked into that
venue and once you do that you can then
use kind of standard vector similarity
measure measures between venues to get a
sense of of what what is the similarity
of the people that are visiting these
places and so in our work we're using
cosine similarity once we have that
though nessa this gets to Johannes
question if you just use this kind of
social similarity you will get these
kind of strange topologies in the
clusters you will get lots of spatial
non-contiguous and the reason is is
because you have sort of hub venues so
New York you have like Grand Central
Station or you have like the airport
that everybody goes to and so what we
what we decided to do to kind of smooth
that out is we added a kind of
geographic constraint so we we only
measure the social similarity between
venues that are close to each other so
thinking in terms of a graph where the
nodes are the venues we connect each
node to its nearest neighbors and then
we weigh the edges by their social
similarity and so this kind of enforces
a kind of geographic constraint while
also trying to cluster based on these
social patterns then once you have this
kind of this graph form do you have a
nice kind of sparse graph that works
really well we can do some standard
graph clustering techniques to form
these segments in our work we use
spectral clustering there are other
things that also work fairly well but we
found this this to work quite well I'm
again I'm glossing over the technical
details we can talk about them offline
if if you're curious the other thing
that we did is that once we had these
clusters we wanted to measure
relationships between the clusters
themselves to get a sense of how two
different clusters how two different
neighborhoods are related to each other
and so what we did is we developed
another similarity measure between the
clusters and this was very similar to
the measure that we use between venues
it's again looking at the people that
have been
these neighborhoods to these clusters
and developing some sort of bag of
chickens of these people so that two
neighborhoods would be strongly related
two clusters would be strongly related
if many of the same people visit these
clusters what's nice about this is that
it allows you to explore relationships
among not just among the individual
venues but among sort of hierarchically
among the clusters themselves allowing
you to see kind of movement patterns of
the populace on a regional scale once we
had all of that in place we we decided
to show Kate this showcase this work by
building an interactive website that
lets you actually explore the clusters
that we discovered so you can kind of
explore your own Geographic intuitions
about a place in relation to the kinds
of clusters that that that our technique
discovered and I think this is it's a
nice way to kind of explore the data by
kind of testing your own intuition so
that's on life woods org feel free to
check it out we have quite a maybe seven
or eight different cities that we that
we built maps for I'm kind of I'll move
on to evaluation but I'll again pause
for questions about the method and and
the goals about this work is everyone
yeah
yeah absolutely i'll get to that in the
evaluation for sure yeah i think that's
one way to look at it i would
replacement as a strong word right but
but as a kind of way to see kind of
trends and movement patterns you can
also you'll see in the evaluation
through the the kind of interviews that
we conducted it kind of teases out some
of the factors that are kind of shaping
the way these clusters are formed look
and I think that that gives a lot more
meaning to kind of what they are it'll
kind of make a little bit more sense but
in general I mean I think of it for
example in in computer vision right a
lot of times the first thing that you'll
do when you're trying to like processing
images you'll try to cluster it to find
some underlying structure and you'll use
that structure to do other tasks and so
I tend to think about this work as like
maybe a pre-processing step that other
services might lie on top of so you
first are our debt are identifying this
kind of structure of the city and then
you might try to do additional things
with that structure afterwards and it's
it's yes you can kind of directly use it
in kind of maybe a social or policy type
setting I think there's a lot of work
that needs to be done before that's
actually feasible but I think it's also
I tend to think of it in the context of
a system that you might build where this
is kind of a one component of that
system
yeah I similarity of people I didn't
quite look at because I didn't kind of
dig into foursquare profiles but yeah
you could start building like a
demographic profile of people and start
to measure kind of and model that as
well okay that's that's the interesting
part and I'll touch on that on the
evaluation a little bit because it gets
into the question of like how do you
evaluate something like this which is a
non-trivial thing to think about because
this is I wouldn't consider this a kind
of traditional kind of data mining task
it's very it's a very different task and
I think it requires a different way of
thinking about when you're trying to
evaluate it because I mean even the
question of like considering another
metric what does that even mean and how
would I compare these two it's yeah
there's some interesting questions there
yeah yeah I thought of that yeah I I've
yes yeah I think a bit there's some
great like network measures that could
be used in things like this that you
know is one neighborhood more insular
than another or is one when neighborhood
more like they kind of spread out or
they they they go to other neighborhoods
or do they kissed it in Pittsburgh like
squirrel hill i'm sure you're familiar
right squirrel hill is kind of like a
small town right you have everything
that you need there and people that live
there tend to stay in squirrel hill
right you don't need to kind of go out i
think it will be interesting to start
defining these kinds of metrics for
different places and four regions yeah
so on to evaluation actually before I
get to evaluation I want to pause on
this image because i'm actually really
kind of proud of it this is downtown
Pittsburgh from the perspective of the
city government downtown Pittsburgh is
one neighborhood and that neighborhood
starts at the highway and goes to the
entire triangle it's this entire
monolithic kind of maybe
good notice these are the clusters that
we found and we found five different
clusters if you know if you bend a
downtown Pittsburgh you'll know that the
the character of these these regions are
very different they correspond to
different land uses and different kind
of the function of the different types
of entities that you see there why I'm
proud of this particular image is
because you can actually look at the
building type of the aerial image and
kind of try to overlay it on top of the
clusters and you your start to see these
visual variations and so you see these
skyscrapers roughly correspond to this
yellow area and if knowing Pittsburgh
that these skyscrapers are there it's
the financial and the lawyer industries
that that fits really nicely into here
the red is this kind of mid rises over
here this is the cultural district
there's hotels there's theaters down
here this is city government these are
kind of low-rises and this is a this is
this is this is a school I think yeah
this is a school and some kind of other
commerce area there's like a Macy's here
and things and then this is primarily
residential and again you see the
building structures are different I just
think that's not really an evaluation
but I think it's interesting to see how
the physical form maps on to the the
structure that the algorithm to discover
and so I know John you know Pittsburgh
red anyone else know Pittsburgh yeah
genesis so how do we evaluate this so
that's let's go back to this question I
think it's a really interesting question
and we thought about it for a long time
and usually when you develop some sort
of clustering algorithm or you develop
some sort of data mining technique you
have some quantitative way of evaluating
it you have some objective that you want
to optimize in this case for this
problem we didn't have such an objective
really what we were looking for is we're
looking for regions of the city that
have social meaning for people right
that people identify with these regions
and that they can they can impart some
sort of meaning onto them and so we
wanted to ask ya do
do residents derive meaning from the
clusters that we discovered and can
these clusters actually be used as a way
to kind of elucidate the various forces
that shape and define the city and so
again for these types of goals it's very
difficult to design some sort of
quantitative metric of measuring this
and so what we did is we decided to
approach the evaluation qualitatively so
we interviewed 27 residents of
Pittsburgh the residents were recruited
through a social media campaign and
through various like contacting various
neighborhood groups and each interview
it lasted approximately one hour it
began with a discussion of the
participants background in relation that
their to their neighborhood we asked
them to draw the boundaries of their
neighborhood as they perceive them
that's a that's a key qualifier right as
they perceived them so we asked we're
asking directly for their perception of
their own neighborhood we asked if they
could identify anywhere in their
neighborhood where they felt there's a
shift in feel or change in character we
asked if if there's anywhere in the
whole city where they felt that
municipal borders were changing or were
in flux and we next should we showed
them a map of the official neighborhood
boundaries of that are defined by the
city and we asked for their their
specific feedback on what they saw so
that's a way to kind of test their
perceptions of the official boundaries
in addition to their own perceptions of
the city and finally it was only after
getting all of that data did we show
them the actual clusters that we we
discovered and we asked for their
reaction to those and so it's we didn't
want to kind of top load the interview
with showing what we had discovered we
wanted to get as much data as we could
prior to them so there's a lot of like
we discussed a lot of interesting
results and findings in the paper I
don't have time to discuss much of them
but what I do is what I do have time for
is to give a small case study of a
single neighborhood in Pittsburgh this
is the south side so let's take a quick
look into south side Pittsburgh so maybe
the three or four of you that know South
Side this this will sound familiar the
rest of you I'll try to give you a sense
of what this is like
so here's kind of my cognitive map of
what South Side Pittsburgh looks like
you have one long strip that's the red
the red area here this is largely
commercial it's it's an area where
there's a lots of a lot of bars and
restaurants kind of independent small
bars and restaurants it's kind of it's
very dense and then you have this area
at the end to the east in purple that is
actually a shopping mall it's kind of
this newer outdoor mixed-use shopping
mall development called southside works
super fancy the green areas on either
side of this Carson Street are
residential and then you have this blue
area here that kind of sits in the
middle this is a small strip mall with a
grocery store and a few other things
like a liquor store and a dollar store
maybe maybe one restaurant anyway that's
that's south side Pittsburgh here are
the clusters that we discovered you'll
notice some interesting things right off
the bat this this one on the right
actually goes across the river and I'll
talk about why why that is in a second
but then you see 22 along this kind of
commercial strip Carson Street and then
you have this kind of blue area here so
I'll talk about what our participants
thought about this area and and what
they thought about how how the cluster
is what the cluster is meant to them
first let me talk about the distinction
between this green area and the red area
life would aid and life would nine
almost everyone that we interviewed felt
that there was a distinction between
live hooded and live hood nine and this
is because largely live hood nine again
it's this outdoor shopping mall it's
very different in character from the
rest of the city and this was described
as being a different mix of people that
come and chop here usually people that
come to shop in this area are coming for
the destination they're coming from
outside of the neighborhood to shop in
these larger kind of national stores
whereas the rest of the neighborhood is
kind of smaller independent shops and
restaurants and although you know again
south side is all one large
lithic neighborhood in terms of the city
and so a lot of people when we showed
them the neighborhood boundaries they
were surprised because they felt that
this should be something different that
this red area should be something
different and in particular one
participant was disappointed that there
wasn't a boundary here they felt that
this really should be a different
neighborhood it's not like south side at
all and then when she saw that our
cluster she was excited and she said hey
yes here's the division that I put in
yay Thank You algorithm and it it's it's
roughly it's a reflection of the fact
that she felt that this area was
demographically different and served a
different purpose than the rest of the
city now I'll comment again as to why
why this cluster crosses the river
usually neighborhoods don't cross river
city planners don't typically draw
boundaries like that but activity
patterns can and in this particular case
on the northern side of the river is a
an industrial park so there's there's
offices but nothing else so there's no
other restaurants that serve these
offices and so what you see is you see
this pattern of people that work on the
northern side of the city come back to
go to lunch for example in this kind of
shopping mall districts now I'll talk
about the distinction between the brown
and the green now many participants
actually felt that there shouldn't be a
distinction that you know that this area
has the same character and that this
should be one neighborhood but quite a
few actually thought that they are
different and one person said from an
architectural standpoint it's a lot
tighter on the western part once you get
west of 17th or 18th what's interesting
is that is precisely where the boundary
is it's at 18th so you see the lot sizes
get much much smaller on in life would
seven it's much more dense there's much
more bars and what's what what the
patterns that that are our participants
indicated is that they think that people
are coming across the bridge from the
Duquesne University which is in the
north and then they come in a bar hop in
this brown area
they don't they don't keep proceeding
East so they think that this there's
this unique culture of kind of
bar-hopping that exists in life would
seven that doesn't exist in life would
say and kind of in line with that idea
with the density is is a distinction
between safety and so we talked to one
participant who actually lived in both
areas and she said actually I feel that
they are distinct she said whenever I
was living on fifteenth Street which is
in the brown area she said I had to
worry about drunk people following me
home but on 23rd which is the green she
said I had to worry about people trying
to mug me and so it's different it's not
something I anticipated um that's that's
also in line with density right it's
it's a kind of well known principle and
urban design that dense streets our safe
streets where there's people it's tends
to be more safe than when there's not
people at least in terms of kind of
violent crimes another interesting
observation is this shopping district
Janice you you know what have you been
here yeah this the Giant Eagle right
yeah what's interesting what people said
is that people who live in south side
they said that the people that they see
in life would six are a different mix
than ones that they see elsewhere in
south side one I guess because it's a
grocery store grocery stores tend to
bring in people from the outside but
what the perceptions that they had was
that they assume that the people coming
here came from up the hill what I mean
by that is to the south there's a hill
to the south and the hill to the south
is largely a kind of lower income
neighborhood that doesn't have very many
resources so they actually don't have a
grocery store of their own and so their
assumption in seeing the mix of people
that they see at this grocery store was
that they're actually coming from far
away to come get groceries what's
interesting is that this notion is
supported from the data so when you
again remember I told you that we also
looked at the relationship between the
clusters when you look at the top five
most closely related clusters to that
one tiny grocery store cluster you see
that there's a wide area of people that
are coming in to show
they're these are people from downtown
which is the yellow but then again from
up that large area that large Hill where
there aren't very many resources so just
I think it's interesting to see both
that these perceptions exist in people
and that the data can kind of can help
lend support to these kinds of
perceptions that people make a lot of
places so that's that's the last that i
have for live food so i'm going to pause
and take some discussion and questions
and thoughts it'sit's a kind of
non-traditional kind of research and it
takes some some thought to let it sink
in but I'd love to discuss about it yeah
yeah well that's right yeah but there's
actually a tension there right I mean
yes you can that you can you know define
kind of clusters with mixed memberships
right and yes there is a gradient really
but on the other hand there in terms of
being useful to have this kind of common
understanding in terms of an
organizational structure we kind of do
need these sharp boundaries right so
there there is this tension to kind of
like Explorer I think it's an
interesting research question like how
what could you do with kind of soft
boundary clusters and how would people
use it yeah yeah I guess my other
question is for squared earlier this
year changed it right they got rid of
having people check in yeah do you feel
like that has
oh I don't know that I'm qualified to
answer that ma I mean if you're still
scraping I'm not I've stopped that but I
will say this that I i think the
foursquare has started to pay attention
to neighborhoods more so in the design
of swarm the neighborhood is kind of
front and center so he does this kind of
automatic check-in thing but not two
venues to neighborhoods so it'll show
you that it'll share with your friends
the neighborhood that you're in but not
the actual venue that you're in unless
you check in I think that's an
interesting design decision right
because one it's making the assumption
that that's not necessarily private
right that it's you know fourth career
was in a privacy nice because privacy
friendly because you had to take action
to check in right but they're making the
assumption that the neighborhood level
sharing is like is granular enough that
they can kind of automatically do that
for you I think it's an interesting
design decision I don't think people
have really run from it I think maybe
it's so transparent that it's because it
really does kind of just happen yeah
yeah
yeah I mean I have a lot of thoughts
about this and you know for whatever
reason so there's work got some press
and after the press like we were getting
contacted from like city planning
departments I was kind of resistive to
resisting that kind of interaction I
mean we it's nice to learn from them but
yeah the data is very biased and I you
know it's only showing like how one
segment of the population how is kind of
their collective views and activity
patterns and so it's leaving people out
for sure yeah I mean so I mean one
concrete example is that you in some
cases you can actually see the people
that are being left out right so in in
Pittsburgh's specifically there's one
neighborhood called the Hill District
that we kind of hardly had any data for
and it's because this population that
lives here generally isn't using the
service and so they're not reflected in
the maps and that's it's it's really an
obvious example there's a big kind of
donut hole in the map yeah
for I mean for cases when like things
are left out or four cases when it's not
entirely sure
hi
in one case yes I mean a the problem is
there's a sampling bias and so that the
participants that we sampled often
tended not to be familiar with the
neighborhoods that I felt we didn't have
good data from so there is there are
some weakness to that but we actually
did have some participants from these
underrepresented areas on it we
purposefully tried to recruit from them
and yeah they reflected that yeah the
boundaries are not as strong and don't
necessarily reflect the data in the
right way yeah but that mean it's a hard
problem yeah I I think that the question
though is really interesting right if
you know it's an interesting and
conceptual idea to think about how one
demographic group views the boundaries
and how another demographic group
reviews the boundaries i think that's
that isn't as a research question i
think did you explore that a little bit
right you looked at like how gender
effects boundaries yeah yeah yeah I I
think it's a fascinating idea in the
temporal as well like city boundaries
change over time right like the central
business district almost ceases to exist
at night right I mean in almost every
city right and you see these different
kinds of temporal rhythms that come to
come into play and so yeah this really
lots of fascinating like next steps okay
I'll move on and no more questions so
the next work is from KY 2014 it's about
a system that I built with colleagues
crit Luther Patrick Kelly and norm today
called curated city so yeah so let me
talk about curated city first I want to
I want to start with a short discussion
about city guides so here's the cover of
a New York City guidebook it was first
published in 1939 as an artifact of the
federal writers project does anyone know
what the federal writers project is this
is a WPA initiatives it's a
depression-era initiative where art of
work writers were paid to write about
places
so they developed guides for all over
the country and so yeah so it's
basically a way it's a stimulus program
I mentioned this because I think that
the fact that the government took this
initiative just to kind of document
place it indicates how important local
guides are like this much resources were
this was felt like an important enough
resource to kind of to devote national
attention to so we might ask then what
makes them so important of course you
know there are lots of answers to this
but my two opinions are one I think
there's an intrinsic value to
documenting an understanding human
culture and of course much of human
culture is kind of centered around the
concept of place place places are after
all where culture is produced and where
it kind of evolves and they're also kind
of a critical aspect for understanding
culture so local guides are then kind of
one way to document our culture is by
focusing on documenting places but
secondly I think guides encourage
economic activity and so bye-bye kind of
revealing and describing local secrets
for example the best view or a quiet
walk or a safe street or the best tacos
guides help lower the burden for
exploration costs and for finding
desired places and activities and so
it's perhaps the second aspect the kind
of economic aspect of social guide of
local guides that drives kind of a lot
of the activity that we see in terms of
online social guides so you see lots of
really familiar and big companies such
as tripadvisor is a tripadvisor page of
the belgian cafe in pittsburgh and a
google maps page about a pittsburgh
seafood restaurant a lot of my research
is pittsburgh-based here's a Yelp page
that highlights a restaurant
specializing in cured meats now a lot of
these have a very similar form and to
the common two of the most common
features of online social guides our
user contributed venue ratings and user
contribute reviews
so ratings are great because they're the
reviews are good because they they allow
people to be maximally expressive in
their personal experiences at a venue so
you can write exactly what you feel and
that's that's good it's good to allow
people to be expressive they can
highlight what they like and what they
don't like ratings are good for the
opposite reason they kind of allow
minimal expressiveness but they allow
kind of us to easily aggregate and make
an assessment about the quality of
services at a particular place and so
it's nice I think that's why you see
this kind of equilibrium that these are
the two components that you see at on
these typically typical review sites
because they're kind of opposite
functions so I highlighted why they're
useful but i think they also have a lot
of flaws and so let me talk about the
problems that I that I feel the problems
that are that exist with reviews the
first is tldr too long didn't read this
kind of giving people maximum expressive
is good but people like to write a lot
right and so they often write long
paragraphs about exactly the experience
that they had and if you're a consumer
trying to make a decision about going to
a place that can be overwhelming it can
be overwhelming and it doesn't
necessarily generalize to the experience
that you will have right that reviews
can be over critical of generalizability
fork they also have a lot of duplicated
efforts so if people will write the same
things over and over again because we
have similar experiences at the places
we go that's a good thing right that
means that we can start to kind of see a
trend in the kind of reviews that people
are writing but it means that you have
to put effort in to kind of see what
that trend is and yeah so there's a
significant amount of redundancy here
now what about ratings what is the
problem with ratings well again by
design i guess they're not very
expressive and so the full variability
of the local experience is projected
onto kind of an arbitrary numeric scale
a kind of behavioral problem with
ratings is that they often tend to be
bimodal and distribution so people will
either love a place or they'll hey
place and this has to do with the kind
of motivations that that exists behind
leaving or rating on a restaurant or a
venue it makes it kind of hard to
discriminate and so often these websites
will show an average of all ratings and
the averages of most places tend to be
around like three and a half right or
three stars and so it's hard to say why
I should pick one place over another and
and finally having one uniform rating
system induces comparisons between
incomparable things so for example a
michelin-rated restaurant and a
fast-food restaurant might both end up
with four and a half stars but clearly
you're going to find different
experiences at both right and so that's
an extreme example but you'll see you'll
see the same type of in compare
incomparable venues getting similar
ratings in much more or less extreme
situations so what we asked in this
research and this is kind of a design
motivated research is can we build a
social city guide where user
contributions are not centered around
rating or reviewing that was that was
the motivation so we wanted to take this
problem and see what we could design so
the the prototype that we came up with
is a system called curated City curated
city is a social website the tasks each
user with creating their own personal
guide to a city and in the process as
they do this it exposes a kind of social
and collective view of the city's
experience and I'll make clear what it
what that means exactly but let me just
say that the prototype has two
components the first component is a map
page that's on the left and the second
component is the users home page or
their own personal guide that's on the
right here this this gives their
presentation of how they view the city
this is like their personal guide to to
Pittsburgh or their personal guide to
Seattle let me start with the map page
the map page is designed with two
segments on the left of course there is
a map and the map has an interactive
overlay of the city's neighborhoods
these are so the users can click on
these neighborhoods and
drill down to get more information about
venues and activities there on the right
hand side as a social feed displaying
activity and content from all the users
in the study and so when you actually
drill down and you click on a
neighborhood you'll see the feed appear
for that particular neighborhood and you
can further drill down to a particular
venue you'll see the feed appear for
that venue and so you'll see things on
the right you'll see there's actually
the we've designed it in these sort of
cards where you see a hierarchy between
the city the neighborhood and the venue
so there's three different granularities
of the feed content that users share
comes into in two forms they can share
Instagram photos or they can share
something that we call experiences now
experience are short experiences are
short free text descriptions of of a
particular venue now all of this content
can be tagged at a venue right so I can
tag a venue with an Instagram photo or I
can tag it with this kind of short free
text description next to each pair of
each piece of content is a little plus
button that that that is a way for users
to reshare the elements that other users
leave and so this works like a reshare
and facebook or retweet and Twitter or a
repayment Pinterest and it it was
designed as a way to kind of let content
be remix abul and so if I'm looking at
Andreas's guide to Pittsburgh or to
Seattle and I see something that he
created that I like I can add it to my
own personal guide and so it's it
creates this kind of reshare able remix
of both set of content so again the goal
of users is to build their own personal
guide and these are kind of reshare evil
the motivation is that you might there's
both this self present presentation
motivation that I might like to kind of
show off the places that i like but
there's also a motivation of i might
like to share this with my friends who
are visiting from out of town so there
are different ways or and different
reasons why people might like to build
something like this
we wanted to design a system where
people could build this in a really
efficient and fast manner and so on the
right hand side it indexed by the
neighborhoods and so you can drill into
a particular neighborhood to see the
content that you left for that
particular neighborhood so again
self-presentation is an important
motivator here and there's this kind of
research that backs up the idea that
this actually is a motivator and
location sharing its I want to I want to
share with others the locations that I
bet that I have been to as a way of
presenting Who I am to the world so what
I think a system like this does is
instead of encouraging people to be
critics of a place which is I think how
a Yelp works I know Janice is a super
Yelp user I'm curious to get your
feedback yeah yeah and so I'll get into
our evaluation but that actually happens
quite a lot so a lot of the participants
that we had for the system said that
that happens to them so much they have
people visiting from out of town they
want to give them advice they wish they
had a system like this that they could
just pass along yeah right right right
yeah
yeah so let me let me drill into what
exactly this the kind of key ingredient
of this whole system is this experience
what is an experience now I described it
as a short free text description of a
venue but it's a little bit it's
actually a lot more structured than that
experiences are answers to this prompt
this venue is my favorite place in the
neighborhood for blank and all of users
whenever they input this experience at a
venue they're given this prompt and they
have to complete the prompt now what I
love about this idea is that it's really
deceptively simple I mean it's a simple
idea that there's a lot of design packed
into it for example the word favorite
nudges people towards making positive
sentiment statements right it's not like
a yelp review or you're leaving
something totally nasty about a venue
because it did something that you didn't
like you're saying something that you
liked about the place the word favorite
also implicitly forces people to rank
nearby venues so favorite implies that
it's the top of the stack right so it
implies this implicit ordering of the
actual experience that they're tagging
the word neighborhood limits the range
of comparison so they're saying that
this particular venue is the best at
what it does in this particular region
and finally the fact that it's free text
encourages people to be creative but the
fact that it's limited to be very short
it's only I think it's 50 characters it
encourages maximum reusability of this
kind of content and so if we go back to
this idea that content is reshare able
and remix abul this means that by
limiting the size of this kind of free
text it means that people will have
similar sentiments that they'd like to
express there's a lot large overlap in
the types of things that people would
like to leave let me make that a little
bit more concrete so here you know
everybody is contributing short textual
answers to the same prompt and so
they're all thinking about solving the
same problem and and they're all
annotating the same set of venues
because the city is this kind of closed
environment that means it's easy to
aggregate along these
experiences and so here two people each
have their own individual views of the
city they each have their own individual
set of experiences but there's an
overlap here both of them think that
butter joint is their favorite place in
the neighborhood for craft cocktails and
because of this overlap you see this
aggregation and you see that that the
the positive experiences will start to
bubble up to the top and that's that's
an intentional design element that was
built into the system that uses remixes
this idea of remixes a way to curate
these kinds of sentiment these kind of
statement and so guides are remix abul
to highlight the common urban experience
what I like about this I like a lot of
things about this design but what I like
is that it highlights the fact that
cities are both individual places and
they're kind of collective places their
places of collective experiences we we
have these shared experiences and this
lets us express both so we designed a
qualitative study of this work what we
did is we we recruited 20 people to use
the system simultaneously so that they
can be embedded in this kind of
collaborative social setting for two
weeks and we use that experience as a
kind of technological probe to explore
their perceptions of this kind of
activity and their perceptions of how
they might use a system system like this
what they liked what they didn't like
things things like that we also wanted
to look at you know do people
collaborate do they pay attention to
other people's content or do they focus
only solely on their own guides again
collaboration was a key part of the
design we wanted to see if actually it
actually happened in practice let me
talk about what people did in total
there were 1,200 experiences that were
shared 259 reshares and so there was
actually some remix and even in this
small like controlled setting they
weren't required to reshare or require
to necessarily look at other people's
guides but they did that anyway it was
this kind of natural curiosity in
addition they weren't required to share
any photos but people really liked
sharing photos that's a lesson of this
we did require them to share three
experiences a day they weren't required
to share any photos but because they
like this this self presentation they
like making their guys look pretty and
so they added photos to their guides and
it yeah yeah so it's it connected to the
instagram api and added to the to the
system okay so let me just show some of
the things that they shared because they
were kind of pretty yeah things like
sports teams and and businesses and
interiors and cityscapes lots of food
it'sit's Instagram lots of drink
concerts and other pretty random things
this is what some of the actual guides
that they looked they built to look like
since they were very expressive they
showed you know highlighted interesting
neighborhoods and interesting activities
really what I think is one of the most
inspiring things about this work and I'm
for time I'm going to have to gloss over
some of the findings what I think is
most inspiring is the type of
experiences that people shared because I
think these are things that are very
difficult to find in any other kind of
local search any other kind of local
guide system things like a night view of
downtown or forgetting that you live in
a city or locally brewed beer or
watching a soccer game or views of
Market Square or watching kids run
around the fountain memory the I think
you've done some work in Twitter that
tries to extract things like this here's
a way to kind of design a system that
intentionally tries to get these these
activities out I did I think it's very
inspiring that these things came out and
and yeah I think it's cool I don't know
there's a there's apparently a brothel
downtown yeah yeah it's very specific
no I haven't actually that's a good idea
yeah I I mean so that's one point is
that you know yelp has started to kind
of pull out these kind of overlapping
commonalities so that happened kind of
simultaneously to the study happening I
think that's a very good start but I
think where this differs is again the
motivation and Yelp you're motivated to
be a critic here you're just motivated
to say things that you like let me just
say one thing about yeah people like to
read some people like to be sharing some
people didn't I'm going to skip over
lots of this and talk about this idea of
like leaving only positive sentiment
statements so this prompt favorite and
encourage people to share experiences
with positive sentiment and people
really responded very well to this they
like this design element and they
contrasted it with things like Yelp
which can be overly like bipolar and
overly negative one person said I
thought it was the best part of curated
city you had to really think about what
in particular it is you liked so much
about a place and it makes you
concentrate solely on what makes it good
another person said it's like if you
don't have anything nice to say you
don't use it at all what was interesting
is some people didn't like it they
wanted to say something negative but
they found a way to do it in the system
with working with the prompt and they
would just do it in a sarcastic way and
so one person tagged a venue with
favourite worst smelling dumpster in the
city and another place with favorite
place to get hit by a car sits and other
participants actually responded really
positively to this they thought it was
fun and interesting and a great way to
kind of be playful with these kinds of
designs so just some final thoughts and
again I skipped over some things because
I want to get to the last project I view
this as a way to kind of democratize
city guides and because it's often
privileged neighborhoods in privileged
cities that get documented most and so
this is a way to kind of have a
bottom-up way to give community as a way
to describe themselves what they like
best
and I think that's our kind of nice
message to end with on this let me take
one question on the curated City work
and then I'll move on to the last
section if there's no questions that's
fine okay so I don't have very much time
and I'd like to have some discussion for
this as well but I want to talk about
journeys and notes which is a project I
did at my internship here this is work
joint with Sarah and andreas and in this
work we looked at this question we
looked we wanted to know do people that
share common trips constitute a
community and you know one way to think
about this is that we're always kind of
going somewhere you know it's part of
maybe the modern human condition that
we're always in charge segmented people
are always in transit it's because of
the jobs that we have because of the
demands that we have we're either like
in stuck in limbo at an airport
somewhere or on a bus kind of surrounded
by the same familiar strangers we see
every day and it's really an interesting
kind of strange moment that has not
really been designed for very kind of
intentionally before and so we wanted to
kind of take this and see what we could
do with it so we decided to build this
system I apologize for skipping over a
lot I want to kind of take some
questions we decided to build a system
where we would connect people that have
common paths so they're on trips that
that have a common origin and a common
destination and given this kind of
commonality build a kind of social
experience around that and so the idea
is that prior to taking your trip or
during your trip or after your trip you
would check into that trip by specifying
the origin and the destination and that
unlocks this social experience where you
can connect with other travelers share
messages with them and kind of learn
from them and maybe just feel connected
to them we didn't really want to kind of
assign too much structure to it beyond
that we wanted to see what people would
do with it we did want to have this be
useful both for longer trips and for
shorter trips and so we accomplish that
by having
a variable radius that connects people
so for longer trips if I'm traveling
from New York to San Francisco maybe the
radius is the entire city but if shorter
trips maybe it's like my block so I'm
connected with people to start near my
block and end near in the same block
that I'm ending and so it's a way to
create these kind of virtual spaces
around the commonalities that we have in
our movements so I I don't have much
time to talk about too much of the
design other two than to say that you
know we we designed it to really connect
with the natural experience of travel
right so travel is there is a strange
kind of anonymity of you know being
maybe you recognize the people around
you but you don't necessarily know who
they are and we're not trying to
necessarily connect you with them as a
friend but as a fellow traveler and so
we designed kind of a system where
you're given these pseudonyms your
identity is it's attached to these
system assigned pseudonyms and we build
this social experience where it just
kind of suit seamlessly happens around
that that kind of identity so let me
just talk about the types of things that
people have left in this system so we
did release this about a month ago and
we have we have a decent amount of usage
already and there's been some really
inspiring things that people have left
so for example here's a message that a
person left he's saying he or she is
saying I'm waiting to leave from New
Jersey to the air force boot camp in
lackland Texas and so again we didn't
want to kind of prescribe what it is
people should write about or even who
the exact audience was that they were
writing to yeah it's it's probably like
30 miles is yeah 30 miles is 30 miles is
the maximum so there's like a cut does
it cut off yeah so that roughly I wanted
the maximum to be like a city level
well no possible but so what no but what
it means is that someone that's that
starts within 30 miles of where I start
and ends within 30 miles of where I end
yeah no no this is just one person so
far yeah but the point I wanted to make
is that we didn't want to tell
necessarily people who it was their
talking to or what it is they should say
we wanted to create this environment
where it's okay to kind of leave a note
that you don't know necessarily who's
going to read it and there's kind of a
mystery to that and so that here's a
person who's in this kind of really
personal moment and they don't
necessarily have someone to talk to but
there's this idea of leaving this
message behind right so this is probably
that they're probably feeling really
anxious and really there's all kinds of
complicated emotions with this moment
but we created a space where they can
leave this behind and maybe someone else
might see it and respond to it so that's
that's a lot we put a lot of thought
into designing that moment and it was
inspiring that these the exact type of
messages that we had hoped would come
out are actually kind of emerging in it
I think it's really cool to see we also
like design some kind of poetics in the
system to kind of try to nudge people to
leave kind of beautiful things rather
than kind of nasty things so here's
something that said the path from
desolation to public poverty to
synthetic happiness and wealth is like
transcending world entirely that's
pretty pretty deep but again it's not
clear who the audience is but it's like
it's it's kind of like leaving a message
in a bottle right so you have this I
you're you're in this state of transit
you want to find people to connect with
this is a way to kind of do it and dig
to have a form of expression that you
can this one is particularly poetic the
train is empty teach Creek the guard
approaches silently gliding like he's
done for years I have no ticket to show
him I am NOT here anyway there's also
like a lot more factual things no no
these that I yeah I I didn't have time
to make that look nice sorry yeah I know
they're not the same person
yeah good question but anyway so yeah
yes yes so you can leave a note and
comment on notes and and so our hope is
is that we will start to see these kinds
of community structures emerged over
time I think it's really too early to
say that that's exactly happening we are
seeing some commenting behavior but it's
I think that the numbers are too small
to say that that's happening but the
intention of the system is that you know
it would work not knowing necessarily
who's going to respond that I could
leave a note to myself and there would
be some value attached to that and some
value received from that and so it's
both kind of social and anti-social at
the same time yeah so I think we had a
lot of fun playing with those kinds of
ideas and design elements but yeah I
mean that that's a long-term hope is
that you might see these kinds of
community structures emerged and you
might see discussions that have them
back and forth we need a lot more usage
to actually have that happen but yeah
you would be surprised I mean I think we
played a lot with the radius and and so
we looked a lot actually a data prior to
designing this of we looked at card ago
data to see that this significant
overlap in the trips that people are
taking and it turns out that there
actually is like there's a lot of
redundancy and a lot of commonalities in
the trips that people take not just
spatially but also a spatiotemporal II
like there's a significant amount of
trips in cart ago will start near each
other and near each other at roughly the
same time like maybe like translated by
half an hour or something aside from
commuting yeah but again it's the
regularity of the earth of the schedule
right that you know you probably take
the same commute every day and we were
hoping to create a habit where you would
check into this experience every day and
even if you're writing to yourself at
first that's still okay right it can be
used as kind of a journal where you can
keep track of your travel thoughts and
and maybe someone else might come along
and start interacting with you and that
would be awesome and so yes on the
surface it might seem exponentially
harder but only if you're talking about
the exact point if you start to soften
it a little bit it actually becomes
feasible
yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeahs or even like looking at
categories of places like bars to like
homes I don't think we've considered
exactly that scenario but that's really
fascinating yeah okay last question
each year microsoft research helps
hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
