tonight ashwin is going to tell us how
to build apps which are both awesome and
we go down faster ashman we can take it
from here thank you good evening
everybody so it's a great time to build
apps right can somebody tell me why I
mean phone apps but in fact Windows
Phone apps can somebody tell me why a
few good reasons then we need them okay
first move is Vienna good the time
something about numbers that are very
encouraging in 4.4 million nokia phone
sales seven yeah good hardwood yes
exactly that's a good piece of hardware
after a long time right were anything
more about number of apps 75,000 apps on
windows phone just last year 150,000
apps total in the marketplace or Windows
Phone store we would call it you're
getting that faster so basically if we
look back at the at the trend we are
very close to I think we missed Android
by two months in our race to get 200,000
apps faster so we beat iOS actually and
so keep in mind that iOS required folks
to learn objective-c Android had the
advantage because people could just use
Java and start building apps right for
us it was easier like c-sharp 10 years
dotnet has been out there people have
been using C sharp and what's great news
in Windows Phone 8 you can build using
C++ to so pouring that physics engine of
you don't have to really pour it now you
can just use that right you can build
hybrid apps so what are we going to talk
about here today that was just just to
give you some numbers and get you
excited building apps always fun right
so a quick little humor from Dilbert but
seriously I mean actually so it's a it's
a it's a good time and there are much
many more reasons than just the numbers
out there to build apps and building
apps are easy but probably building good
apps that people like or love is going
to be
so what is this talk about but before
going about I want to throw an
disclaimer or that I am NOT from the
Windows Phone team so I have been one of
their partner teams I work on I work in
dev dev I mean the clr team so we worked
help build the runtime engine for
windows phone 8 core clr and i have used
to own the diagnostics pieces of that so
help them with some of the tooling for
diagnostics and all that stuff
performance of some of that but this
stock is not from the Windows Phone team
so this is for me a newbie developer
learning how to build apps and after all
the talks all that stuff I learned from
that what I realized was that everybody
has so many talks that talks about
performance talks about design talks
about the OS but as a developer what I
found was missing is what are all these
tools that help me get to the market
faster what are all these tools that let
me find my issues faster what are these
things that are all scattered lying
around nobody speaks about those if I
have never found a talk or anything that
talks about these I just want to make I
started building a catalogue of these
things and I forever you know what i
should start sharing this out so those
are some of the things I'm going to talk
about this is not a performance talk and
if you want to ask me questions about
performance or specifically fixing a
design thing ins amylose and they have
not the expert but I can mean I can
forward your questions or take you to
the right set of folks who can answer
those so the talk will be about what are
those tools what are those tricks what
are those stuff that I need to know and
so I can when I share this slide deck to
you most likely will have all the links
in that and you learn probably you will
learn a thing or two from this so which
one of this is you this is one set of
guys we know like time to market is very
critical right if you have this awesome
idea isaac i know i can i can get there
faster and i go and check on google play
and i go and check on the you know apple
store and say wow it's not it's there
but there is no app on windows phone i
were to start building this so you want
to get to their you want to get to the
market faster right so yeah I want to
build a quick and dirty app but you know
after that I going to start improving it
but I want to get there faster
time-to-market is this one of those guys
if you go to one of the startup weakens
how many if you guys go into a startup
weekend or something hackathon or
anything okay there are folks good so if
you go there it's all about time 54
hours 24 hours you need to build
app you need to build an impression you
need to you know in fact there are
people who have said oh you know what
you want first and you won second prize
because the other guys design was better
so even in 24 hours time frames
sometimes the impression the Arab makes
has been but I have been to at least two
of those and one of them we missed I am
dragging here but one of one of them may
be missed because the judge said your UI
doesnt look that you awesome idea your
UI doesn't look good so even in 24 hours
things such as this matter right the
other set of folks focus on experience
seriously all these apps out there is
doing X suck I want to make I can
definitely make something much better
than this and so you want to start he's
knows he has an idea that somebody
something has already done and so you
want to say I want to make this a better
I want to make a better on oh there is
no push notification I I hate that guy's
particular you know scrolling this app
crashes all the time I can make
something much better than this so
that's the other set of folks i have
seen who who are like serious and who
want to jump right in building apps so
you can be either of those but whatever
talk i am giving here applies to both
both these categories so so you can you
think you can build awesome apps right
what are awesome apps these are actually
words i picked from the top-rated apps
on windows phone store every single word
of every single word you find here
actually has something hidden in them
everything really means a lot it tells
he just more than just single word
flawless i could consider that at this
app never crashes this is awesome
somebody tells buttery smooth that means
probably is like smooth i can have great
scrolling experience the app their UI
responsiveness is great it doesn't get
stuck I feel like it's so beautiful
brilliant bringing could be an idea that
I could have never thought of right and
somebody build it into a phone app
that's awesome so every single word how
much time have you really spent before
building and like I want to build a
great how much time have you spent
looking at apps out there in the app
store and seeing think what our
customers giving a you know feedback to
these guys too and as just just just
just just one data point out that i have
i have been finding as i looked at these
apps most likely at the most only ten
percent of you uses at the most ten
percent of users are going to come and
rate your apps period 100,000 downloads
you will get probably 10,000 reviews
that's it so keep in mind only those
folks who really love your apps or
probably they do not care about your
apps and go and come and write your apps
right
yeah that's why I say either loggia
wraps or they hate it to come and give
you so this is where you want to you
wanna you want to get to right so this
is real data from the app store so what
are the hurdles first thing is like I
said time to market what's slowing me
down from getting there and building
those apps faster right so I want to
build these apps and get it out there
faster delivering great experience so
what are the tools right resources so
that I can start making sure my app gets
that great experience right so so those
are the two things you're going to focus
on and so what is what was my strategy
or what is the thing I want to share
with us we want you know divide this
into two step two main thing this is
what the stock will be about actually
you can take those proactive measures
right to make sure that before i submit
map for the first time itself that and i
have taken care of all the things i can
do so those are my proactive measures
and the next is my react images of
course you are human you are developers
like you learn things will you know
things will go wrong I will get bad
reviews I'll get crashes then I should
be ready to take advantage of whatever
data it is you know I'm being being fed
from the store or from the developer
from my customers that I should be
immediately able to you know you know
make improvements on on my on my app so
the first set of thing I want to talk
about is proactive measures what are the
things I need to know why our apps
getting rejected you guys have any idea
on why do apps get related okay okay
before that how many of you huh guys
have got your app at least rejected once
okay that's that's that's that's fair
actually I got Maya projected I tried
two apps am I both may have to got
rejected right I mean then you learn you
find out so that's costing your time
right you wish like oh shoot and there's
a silly silly mistake is it or should I
should have I should have fixed that I
should have caught that and so we've
been looking at some of this some of
that data and I can't give you exact
numbers or anything but I've been
talking to some of the folks on the
phone team I've been talking to some of
the customers actually developers who
actually 11 some of our employee
developer contest and ask them like SAT
SAT with them to find out hey wyd why
did he raps get rejected and they came
up with a list of things so that's
something for us to share so if you can
make this make a checklist and keep an
eye on those common issues then you can
actually fix them proactively before you
even submit it for the first time
language validation it's easy for
everybody to go and select all the
language I support all these languages
people said it's so stupid at least when
you are doing that at least give the
description of your app in those
languages you you you you are publishing
to don't just go and just randomly
select any single language okay country
is a different thing but language is
another right you can still have your
app in English and still submit at all
AB closer this is unhandled exceptions
now we will walk you through as a next
step in my demo I will walk you through
some of the tools but i'm just going to
list down some of this these common
scenarios how are you making sure that
you can catch as many exceptions as you
can so what are the testing tools that
you can use so as to catch all the
exemption app closure is a thing that
app closes for some reason when they try
the random set of things it just closes
network valuation this is the silliest
bug ever like the first thing the the
store team did when they when I submit
brap is that they put the phone on
airplane mode tested it boom crash
tested it for every single page of my
book start a clashing and I missed one
page and submitted it again boom it
crashed at that exact page so how many
of you have done that in the first time
probably not right but there is going to
be a tool now to help you do that what
about crappy network what if the network
is like varying from 4G 2 3g to 2g how
are you going to test whether your app
is going to have a better experience or
it or is it well designed to work only
for 4G or well is it well designed to
work for 3g or 2g what about in other
countries where all countries don't have
4G network
right so think about the scenario so
that's the network validation there is a
exact class for that I forget the name
somebody remembers ease network
available or something there is a class
you can do and you run that function or
you're a method that does your web
requests or anything that that you want
to do you know contacting a network only
if a network is valid I mean network is
available so if you as long as you say
network dot I have to go and look at it
but network dot is I can send you the
link to that does anybody know network
available yes exactly so that's the
thing you have to check it's like a bull
right it's a boolean is look for that
and then you write the whole thing in
that that's so easy you saved somebody
from crashing other is imagine some of
your customer using the app somewhere
else where the network goes away and
this app start crashing that alone is
enough for you to get your one star
invalid Thailand image is something that
the store folks say oh my god we see
this a lot please there are enough tools
to let you take good screenshots how
many folks have discovered and their
first attempt how to take the
screenshots I i I'd into and I got
rejected for taking probably ignore the
right to there are emulator tools that
can help you take the right screenshots
for 11 i will show you that so icon
screenshot there is a cool icon creator
that that doesn't even take you time to
go and create all these different icon
sizes you know the 99 by ninety nine 70
75 by certified now there is a long one
there is a simple cool i concluded it
took me two hours to get to that I make
for to actually find out oh I should
have done it this way instead of using
paint or blend or Photoshop and that's
to ours right so there is one on
codeplex just pick it up and there was I
just had to do one drag and drop and
boom it created all the icons for also
all the different sizes I needed right
sorry what is it called i'm going to
show you i'm going to give you the link
responsiveness this next one so start
scrolling or you click on a button boom
do not block the UI thread try to do
everything I synchronously in fact in by
default you will be doing everything is
synchronously using web client or any of
those things is all asynchronous
reversed please if and the the good
thing is with the new tools that you
have it there are things that are going
to show you whether your responsiveness
went to zero
whether your response since when 200 i
am going to show you that so that new
set of Diagnostics tool are more than
enough for you to get it so it's up to
you that you whether like you decide to
ignore it and still publish it right the
next one is memory consumption people
have told that oh my app has crashed a
ton of times for out of memory but this
has happened more during the mango
timeframe but that doesn't mean you can
just ignore memory growth and just start
putting out there so there are tools
again to show you if you have when you
when you when you run your app and when
you start testing it if it's showing a
steady growth in your in your in your
memory usage then what will happen let's
say if it's a game what will happen if
the app reaches 10th level is it going
to still continue and grow and finally
crash so you want to be you want to look
at those patterns so i'm going to show
you the tool again to show you Jake to
find out those patterns location
awareness the emulator is getting better
and better so there is a location
awareness in your emulator so you can
fake your real location so i have heard
reports from the store team that people
have put location awareness app and it
just doesn't work it's just get it's
just hangs it doesn't work at all this
is one of the common cases right so
there is an emulator tool not that
there's an emulator emulator has a
location awareness that you should take
advantage and i will show you that
multiple devices support so how many
resolutions do we have for the new
windows phones do you guys know 3w vga
wxga and 720p so all three are different
already have different screen
resolutions so if you want to just
publish an app out there and the new say
okay support all the resolutions please
do test because the your tiles your
icons your graph your graphics are going
to look much different in all these
different three so in fact the good news
is the tools the SDK that the emulator
supports all three of these right and so
you can definitely you'll have to test
on all three of us if you want if you
want if you want published a nap good
app awesome app for all these three
impact on incoming calls this is real
world right when you're when you are
using a wrap your customers can receive
an incoming call or can can get an
reminder pop-up or so what happens what
if your game just yet you know get stuck
when an incoming call comes or when
there is a reminder that pop
sir how will you test for that scenario
good news there is support for that and
the emulator now really there is a
real-world simulator support for that so
that's some of the startup time has been
one of the issues during the mango
timeframe but the other good news to
talk about what clr and the Windows
Phone did during is that we moved the
compliation to the cloud so the new
compile on the cloud happens so that
your app is pre-compiled and so it just
runs instead of getting you know on the
fly on the device so that saves you a
lot of time so you have to try really
hard to make the startup time bad right
unless you get over the first grade I am
showing it has to go and fetch all these
RSS feeds anywhere out there and that's
the first thing i will show you so i
will not show you anything until their
RSS feed comes that's the bad thing to
do so why are you putting that in your
initialization of startup path right so
think about some of these things so last
one is I have been told like there is a
back button test so you are any in no
matter any page you are within your app
there are the store folks they keep
pressing the back button until finally
the app exits gracefully have you tested
that simple scenarios right so anyway so
the whole list the whole list of things
that you want these are like the common
things I have heard from customers as
well as from the story so the car the
full list is out there by the way the
full list was always there during the
mango time frame because they were
manual test most of us ignored it
because again for us time to market
mattered we want to get there first
right so again so what was the what are
the tips use this build measure and
learn methodology right you keep
building keep measuring and there are
the good tools to help you do that debug
your apps on emulator as well as device
right and there is a reason the code
technically the code that runs on your
device slightly different from what
actually runs sonya emulator in somebody
tell me why
so we are emulator is x86 and the the
device is armed it should be same for
all practical purposes but I am just
saying that you still want to try it out
on that it's you I I don't have a list
of devices you test on arm and x86 you
test in pick any device that you own
probably i would just test on my nokia
device why do you ask specifically sorry
oh I I don't know about that information
so like I said I this is all public
information I am aware of if somebody
knows please feel free to say that was a
quick the question was about does the
store team publish anything other other
devices that they test it on I don't
know about that you're at face
certification a user you should put in
save all the devices
that was tested on
okay okay so in the report you get I
wonder what yeah yeah the proactive
steps so what r Abby's asking is a
Probot at the proact except to make sure
I test it on well there are a few
devices out there you can buy one of
each 100 bucks each probably or I don't
know I don't know the honest answer so
the the the answer from the audience was
we could get when we get a report from
the store that my app has crashed and
failed then they will publish what
device it was so that could be a an
information but again you lost a few
days by then right so debug your apps on
emulator on device test your apps on
different screen resolutions again that
gives you only lemme later though
because you can change the resolution
and I will show you that perform CPU
profiling okay now we are getting a
little more serious here with stuff and
diagnostics so CPU profiling I'm going
to walk you through this memory
profiling CPU profiling taste you like
how much time your CPU saving how much
easier see is this app going to let you
drain out your battery life pretty soon
how much you know what's the CPU cost of
using this app or testing this app so
you want to test those things out and I
will walk you through those memory
profiling of course like I said whether
your app is trying to consume memory is
the app doing a lot of garbage
collections number of Jesus abscess like
emitting all the time if you have like
so many GC is happening you've been
loading so many pictures you've been
loading so many temporary string
operations and you're doing crazy stuff
then you need to know at least from
using a simple tool out there app
monitoring is a new new thing that
Windows Phone team has introduced the
SDK team has introduced in Windows Phone
8 so I will show you what all things it
shows it shows you stuff such as what's
your startup time what's your battery
life in fact it estimates and gives you
if you use your app in this pattern for
xrs then it will drain your battery life
hundred percent so that's good enough
information for italy most likely for
folks who do game development or
graphics developments then i spoke to
you about the real life scenarios which
is the simulator or where you get those
incoming calls and text messages and you
know reminders and you need to actually
test whether your app behaves bad when
some of these come up lastly her
also test for appt responsiveness so let
us could take a look at the some of
these tools I have been talking to you
about for a while so let's pick a nap I
mean this is my tiny lab just published
you can just go and say Oracle let's see
if it works oh no network connectivity
my a plane crash say it's limited you
have wired but actually see my apt in
crash that is because I must have used
this thing they go first time first time
i have got rejected I didn't have that
and my app crashed so I didn't think
that at that happened on purpose only
that happened without innings knowing it
right so here I go again they go so I
get the earnings release date I get the
dividend date I get paid eight I can add
to my fate is a simple app ok I can
click here I can go and see okay what's
the what's the thing so first and
foremost feature the emulator the new
emulator supports multi-touch actually I
can I'm not able to do it from here so
it supports multi dress or something to
think so if you have guys have apps
which make use of zooming pinching
multi-touch gestures so you can use a
Windows 8 touch tablet and start testing
a wrap on I mean start using the windows
8 touch feature so as to test the app it
multi touch on the emulator if you don't
have a device yet so the first thing i
want to show is debugging let me stop
this debugging on different screen
resolution so you have 512mb you have
the vga you have XXX GA xga and the 720p
so if i change this it's gonna I could
probably just try the tower just to show
you if I change this it's going to
actually launch separate
vm which has more screen resolution so
this is different the previous one which
is the vga and this is the x GH going to
launch a separate one which is has
higher screen resolution just to let you
know i'm not going to run that so so
essentially the thing to keep in mind is
that you when you test on each of these
remember before submitting your app this
is going to this is be hard to discover
and find out with me just trying to
submit your app you will be asked to
submit screenshots particular for each
resolution and so make sure that you go
and take the screenshots for each of
these resolutions by running them yes so
here is a screenshot that is I haven't
wanted to LIF somebody finds that please
let me know but you can't write your
it's a picture for one resolution how
are you upgrading I haven't so if you
have to let me know but this is what I
did I just learn it in different in
these different options and then I can
take a screenshot boom there is an epi
to take screenshots so if you call the
very well in your car take automatically
some screenshots when you get into a
page and automatically saves into your
unto the phone and then you grab ok is
that is that a new API few times for all
the different language is it because
it's a wrong thing good ok so that is a
API for taking screenshots is what the
gentleman said okay good that's good no
thank you do you know the API will
search for garden msdn cook so this is
how we take the screenshot right when
you can go and the other thing in the
emulator you can see is that you can
fake the location you can go and set a
location and then try to feed the
location into your emulator for your
location aware app that is axel row
meter this is always there and then
there is network oh this is just this is
just network information now let's go to
the let's go to one of the interesting
ones which is I need to probably release
one more appt
well that loads ok so let us look at a
simple simulator example which I spoke
to you about is tools so there is a
little discoverability problem so this
there is you go to tools you find
something called simulator dashboard
right and so this is the one where I can
fake my network right so i can say
enable network simulation and i will
show you the difference actually so let
me close this guy oh the wrong thing I
close the vm which was running and so
now it has to tell the debugger that
your session is terminated that's fine
so go back to vital mb vga just this and
where is the simulator simulator ok soon
where the app i am going to say enable
network simulation i am going to keep it
as 2g and i am going to keep the signal
strength as very poor ok and say apply
let me see how long it takes
okay slowly that is how you test for a
bad network condition right so you still
know what is the worst-case scenario
even if the network is slow and if I
click on this page see how long it takes
still okay but the first one to bring
all this data because I'm mining it from
different data sources right I could
stop this I haven't figured out an easy
way but I could stop this and I could go
and steal some tiny little bugs if I go
and say Wi-Fi and say force a 4g and say
great good apply will still run it again
that's fast
yeah so you are able to simulate those
conditions right the next one you can
see what happens to the app when this is
a simple a prep but you get the concept
you can do it for game in game apps we
usually have to make sure yours your
your experience is not bad when you try
out this you can get the app locked you
can get a lock screen what happens to
the app weather app resumes carefully
when you lock the app you can say
reminders there you go your app got
remind us whether the app gets whether
you lose a level you lose some you know
when you are in between a game little
you lose a level or you lose some
settings or something like that you know
that your application really needs a
decent shape 3g connection so you know
it's not going to be well on 2g is there
there na VI you check for never quality
or something you put in the store
registration um honestly I haven't hit
that use case i'm not sure if somebody
knows let's see what this one gives oh I
have to there's no editon continue so I
should go and say that this is the only
one I have a network interface so I
haven't found that yet I don't know
honestly but this is something I have a
test to see what is my worst-case
scenario so I could maybe optimized to
make my web access better in the worst
case right so that's one let me take
another app to probably show a better
case of app monitoring and app cpu
profiling so taking another app call it
smasher just going to run that so this
is an app that gives i want to really
finish this ad before i come here but
this is an app that helps you give
real-time feedback to say even my talk
or something right so so this is a nap
we try it so I could try to connect to
like Facebook logging right so it's
going to connect and then for now I will
just say don't do it I just want to try
out with a different setting so that's
the apps i have been completed but the
thing i want to show you is how to do
performance analysis or that's the thing
i called up monitoring and cpu analysis
but this is some app which will do a lot
of data fetching from the from the cloud
or should
images like bring our RSS feed so what
are the live events happening around use
then then I pick the same event and I
start doing stuff so if you look at the
the sub this is the option to use
remember there are other performance and
I'll if you have visual studio pro or we
should studio ultimate you will have
start performance analysis start
performance analysis paused that's not
the one you're going to use you're going
to use the Windows Phone application
analysis button right or alt f1 that's a
specific one for windows phone so you
see you have three options the first one
is completely new for windows phone 8 it
says app analysis right and it analyzes
different aspects of your app so let's
see what it does and I can say launch
with that and say started so my app is
launching so I should just start using
my app just like i said i would use it
in real life honestly i would start just
trying it once with emulator then i will
connect my phone and i will start
spending more time with the phone i
can't show you hear from the phone that
so i am showing you the emulator but
really start doing it on your phone
because that is where you will get the
real aspects of you know what is the
hardware with this hardware what can i
expect we have to do so let us say I
login I want to smash an event i find
the live events happening around me and
this is all fake data though then i am
going to find some event and so it's
trying to fight some data from the cloud
ok so i can scroll if i want right and i
can say amazing awesome whatever so
there is some response issues right i
can say okay WTF I don't like this and
so I can keep doing that or I can see a
live report of what's happening in real
time like what my customers feedback is
so this is my abs I mean just trying to
play with it I can go back and it's
collecting still data and I can say let
me end it right so it's connecting it
got all the data it used it it it looks
som some of the data the diagnostic data
and then it came up and gave me a report
it showed me three alerts and see it
took into account my startup time
responsiveness of the app the total data
uploaded downloaded data battery charged
domain this is a this is a cool one so
imagine you are testing a game with this
it's going to tell you that it's
estimating with some i think ms our
research team i think probably came up
with an algorithm for
and they have used that to estimate like
how do you look at a battery life
consumption so it tells you if you use
it like this then your battery is going
to last for this this is going to be
really useful for game developers so
maximum memory and what's your average
memory through its they use it so it
shows you this and then it gives you
read because the apps responsiveness is
poor this is what I said that means
remember when I clicked on some of those
buttons it was just like kind of like
getting stuck kind of so when I click
here on the alerts I can go and see
these graphs and it tells me okay the
app responsiveness is poor from what
time to what time in this timeline right
and if I scroll down I can see the
framerate cpu usage and if I hover over
here it tells me what is the what is
consumed by what user interface thread
or by the app app or by the system idle
and shows me the network you say and if
you can see here see this this is the
time where actually I use the network
right so you give you some quick stats
battery usage and who is using the
battery actually is the display using it
or is the CPU using it right and memory
used all the stuff so it shows me 33
issues and it told me my responsiveness
was poor betweens this sec this time and
42 and 44 let me go and see what that is
42 and 44 somewhere over here oops what
was I doing does it I think double click
here will select the whole thing like it
can select or sunday or double click no
doesn't take me that so what was it
rings this gives the events what I was
doing I was doing some tap so probably I
was clicking on a button at that time
and so it tells me that this is the
button blah blah blah targets something
that but and I was clicking out there in
that list box item so let me go out
there and stupid thing which i had done
there because I was trying to fake some
something you will do not laugh at what
I have done here but let me show you so
I was just sleeping here right because I
want to try and see okay if I didn't
want to let the customer click two or
three times immediately on the same
button that's a bad thing to do I have
to find some other asynchronous way of
solving it so I comment that rebuild
so I shouldn't have not I should have
gone ahead and said this is start again
fast first clicking okay you go back
pretty sure this time it will not show
me in alerts because the responsiveness
should be good they go responsive it's
bad so so remember there in that graph
the previous graph the previous graph is
here you saw that you can see the
response in is right it's one hundred
percent responsive and the app whenever
I click on the button for a second there
was the app is not responsive so that's
when you're imagine the same situation
when you are when you have a lot of RSS
feed or data coming through and you're
scrolling right ways and boom there is
like no the whole thing is stuck because
the you is not rendered yet kind of so
that's the way this app response in this
bar is going to help you so the other
option you have there is execution which
is exactly almost the same as the app
performance and the memory one memory
will make you look at your memory usage
of the app I can quickly show you that
as well okay so quickly just to give you
an idea and here it's going to show you
it's pretty fast by the way the emulator
now
okay so this is showing you the number
of image loads the number of GCS there
are number of garbage collections that
happened and the kind of graph your apps
memory has grown too so you can select
anywhere out here and say start and
announce let us say you had a very bad
peak i'm not going to walk you through
the whole thing you will figure it out
neuron you can say start and in theory
okay there are no warnings and i could
click here and i can go and say heap
summary right and i can click here i can
show me the types and then you can sort
by the types and you can dig down say
okay what are the methods or what are
the types that are taking the most of
the memory then you can try and get to
the whole chain of the whole graph of
all the objects right so you can do all
the deep stuff now that's for the so we
looked at cpu cpus will be in the in the
in the interest of time I am just trying
to skip the CP one but you can imagine
that will be almost similar to the app
responsiveness so this is for all the
managed apps so for game developers or
the native developers there is another
tricky thing to keep in mind you will
want to test similarly for your native
apps or games right you don't get all
these options unfortunately for just in
Windows Phone 8 you don't get all these
options for your native apps games so i
think i have a let me close this guy and
i can show you a new app no
or maybe I can open a new one sure is
easy so this is a native direct3d game
and sim said the basic out of the box a
pie I just created if i open the debug
options for that game so if it's a
native game you will get only one option
you're not going to get all the app app
monitoring execution profiling as well
as CP program you just get one option
and you can just do just a basic stuff I
will tell you why so let's say you start
this is a basic game see if it starts so
very simple game I mean that just
showing the and drink this right I can
stop collecting the data all the symbols
this is much different from the other
one this is actually just showing you
base because native doesn't have enough
support yet for a profiling and app
won't ring as much as the management but
it will show you the the key things
required for your CPU which is basically
like show the CPU usage and show you the
hot pot the functions two things the hot
hottest path in your app and then the
functions doing the most individual work
which is basically same thing that you
get today out of the box and we shall
studio profiler for even for a desktop
and server apps ok so we covered that we
covered similar to be covered screenshot
and spoke about that this has multiple
multiple multi-touch works for different
resolution you need to try it out app
monitoring and the right is selecting
the right profiling option and this is
and this is the same case for hybrid
apps too so if so you can write hybrid
apps you have some tea shop as well as
C++ so even for hybrid apps only this
option will work for profiling so these
are the tools that are going to help you
find out all these problems earlier
ahead of time before you submit to see
your weather app is a responsive and
it's consuming like you're less memory
and it's not crashing at least so let me
go back to the slide and see where we
are so using the right tools and being
smart so how many times you build an app
that is never connected to the cloud
most of the apps which you will delay
connected to either cloud or consuming
some service
the Windows Phone team and the marketing
team has partnered with the with the
with lot of folks out there in the
ecosystem and enabled lot of plugins
controls what would you say add add SDKs
back end as a service so this this new
term will bass or bas bas a bag and as a
service guys and all this you need to so
you don't want to start from scratch I
will send you this link and this is this
is available in the Windows Phone
developer blog and so I took a picture
from them for all these or at least for
most of these there is support available
so you don't want to start from scratch
trying to you know build a set of jump
list controls or something telerik I
think telerik gives free support for the
free controls for a year for all
Microsoft employees or something so you
can just go and grab most of these
things and you know start building apps
faster don't try to create oh I want to
create an awesome control that fast and
fluid rather go and just pick from these
right so this link I'm going to Vanessa
send you the slider you can just pick
the links and go find out what other
things that you need next one is mobile
services how many of you guys have used
Windows Azure mobile services good did
you guys try out the authentication
services yeah so if anybody most of the
stuff out there requires like
authentication service like I me you you
want you want to create a good app that
says okay I wanna you know use my use
facebook login or twitter login or
Google login or even Microsoft Live ID
right guess what super easy all four of
these come in Windows Azure mobile
services and that's free all the music
is sort of till where is in Microsoft
production good
in Fourier like your office work apps I
for from window mobile services or are
you talking about the third parties
sorry I don't know it so these are just
nuke and coming up I think we have the
question we could take it up with the
phone marketing team to find out what's
the can we use the third party controls
directly in microsoft production code
for the phone yes so we might need
approval what's the process and all that
so we should probably if that is the
question we should hook up you with the
phone marketing folks to find out what's
there for product team with the what's
their guidance we need a see ya yeah i
mean i don't know the process even put
you in jail yet to get exact yeah
probably tell rick has like hello rick
is probably used so they may already
have something like a blanket approval
who knows i'm not i can't speak to that
okay so a quick note on Azure mobile
services its trust me i am not a lie i
don't develop a lot but i just needed to
use authentication just for my silly app
it was super easy so getting
authentication service from Windows
Azure mobile services very easy push
notifications easy I'm not try though
yet but I've seen the demo super easy as
well as adding to a database so and this
is these are the azure mobile services
uses as your websites which is actually
a free offering from the azure team so
you're not probably going to be paying
for that so this is the you using the
earth so the you don't have to write the
code for Earth from scratch for these
four right i mean i don't have enough
time to walk you through that but maybe
I can take it offline and show you that
you're just going to go so how do you
get a twitter you know how do you how do
you get ass to twitter login oh you go
to theater site and go and get the app
key and the secret key whatever and then
you come to the window sash website
forever yours and say hey I want to set
up a mobile site and just you just go
and paste those keys and then you
download the sdk from the azure website
and then it's super easy like few steps
from there you can just start calling it
directly so you are you the whole whole
whole process of writing the OAuth
libraries from scratch
is this master a free meal so that's the
use of the azure mobile services turns
your database will allow you to create
tables and yeah for us is yes yep so it
allows you to easily create add stuff to
your database right and gives you the
rest interfaces for doing that yeah so
so yeah so they have also added a
SendGrid or is like a third party
emailing service support in Azure mobile
server which you can consume from your
Windows Phone apps too so then some of
the school tools so if you are doing all
these common things those 10 things
which almost all apps do there is no
need to write from scratch that you're
going to get all these things for free
or from some of these third parties has
a second assistant so is it X they don't
have a free tier think Alexis column A&amp;amp;A
one
is it is it a free I'm not sure that
people long time at least yeah I have no
idea about a breakup free tier separate
one today alright so codeplex so be
friends with codeplex right i mean the
community is also powering windows phone
a lot so there are some of those things
I spoke about there is a phone toolkit I
think most of the phone toolkit stuff
was something that you had to go and
download for Mango but now I think a lot
of this thing for example long list
selector is one of the things which is
more preferred for your for your you
know the instead of the old list view
that's something that's already
available on the Windows Phone 8 right
now but there are other controls which
you can probably go and download from
the toolkit add rotator how many of you
have seen this ad that kind of like you
know like Springs out so as to grab
attention I think one of a couple of I
think it's my stocks portfolio or the
tech news we were a couple of those apps
have this very beautiful absolutely come
and you know showing your screen and
like in a blink and all the sink grabs
more attention so they're like good add
controls actually that you can go and
download this one is a tile creator kit
which will let you create the 37
actually I let you create like beautiful
tiles that looks just like native tiles
that's something that you can go and
create for your you know the smart tiles
on your on your home screen power tools
actually gives you option to go and you
know download the tools that lets you
inspect your isolated storage one of the
most common exceptions that we have seen
that a crashes we have seen is like
people probably not knowing what's
happening in the isolated storage and
when I update a nap my isolated storage
the previous files that I saved were
overwritten and lost so you can actually
test it in your local using this tool
and see what happens in your isolate
storage for your app makes sense so
that's the power tools has one of this
as one of the very cool features the
icon creator is the one which I told you
you could easily go and create icons in
just one go let me just go and pull this
out think I have those open this is the
icon creator so one picture it gives you
all the images all you want that's it
ten seconds this is the power tools I
can go and navigate my apps isolated
storage and all the other things is a
sum of some of the things that it lets
you do this is the smart tile creator
like it really like a native tile add
rotator control everything is there is a
pretty good support on pretty good
healthy contribution on codeplex for
windows phone so don't omit codeplex
right so what's next so ready to publish
keep keep track of all your monetizing
options so go to pub center or you want
to make sure you've every rap is paid in
a purchase or add based set up for trial
scenarios one of the things which you
have always seen is that when you say
yeah I want to push it to all countries
keep in mind there was a silly issue
like you know it happened a couple of my
friends they said the apps were crashing
outside US I don't know why it's the
same thing it's English it's pretty much
the same thing but they started crashing
guess what some of them couldn't
actually parts the the URL for the RSS
feeds because let's say it goes to some
other country it was instead of com it
was co dot in or / co dot u K or
something that they were not aware of
even that situation because this is just
the the site's URL decide she also
completely different so they didn't know
that these countries they were going to
publish to I mean there is a definite
set of countries they want to publish to
but they just just didn't know that the
URLs were going to be different for
these things so kind of like keeping in
mind that even simply publishing even if
it's english only and if you publish in
different countries if you are consuming
RSS feeds or something from the web you
want to make sure that i'm not talking
about globalization a localization what
I'm just saying keep in mind that all
these aspects could change like you are
simple you are you RSS feed might not
just work period and it could lead to a
crash last thing have you tested like
ever thought of doing a beta testing for
your app before you say oh my app is
awesome and I want to get it out there
for everybody so the new beta testing
support i think lasts
mango it was probably 10 uses of the
most now it's supposed up to 10,000
people so you can almost give it to
almost all your friends and tested and
we were like imagine the guy who are
saying this app sucks I want to create a
better life than this he can probably
use this this particular feature to go
and give it two hundred of his friends
all over his facebook friends and then
by the way that's a good feature right
people said I want to I want to feature
to send my app beta test it to all my
Facebook friends we don't have that yet
but that still be a good feature they
need to pass restitution I don't know as
soon as you publish it becomes the
within 24 hours the link goes to all the
people who mean so you have to put their
live IDs or their emails only I think
Microsoft emails will work and you put
their inner inner text box in the text
box you put all their comma separated
version or something and then it goes to
all these friends they can download it
so they get the secret link they can
download it test it and then give you
the feedback right and i will tell you
so you don't really have to use the
store to get the to get the the crash
reports or something from them you could
use third-party tools free tools to go
into San I am going to show you that
anyway so these are some of the tools
right can we get the email addresses of
the people who left reviews oh no that's
that's personal information right now
you will not get that the sender
messages over the zune clients before if
they loved using there I don't think so
yeah that's something you will have to
figure out give a text box and say if
you really want to send me a message
give me your email ID right yeah
consuming customers PII is personal
information without their you no
permission is bad so anyway we're
running short of time so let's go to
that so those are some of the proactive
measures right you could have done all
these things in the beginning to save
time and to get build awesome apps to
use all these tools and plugins and all
these things to proactively publish your
apps faster but again like I said
crashes happen as things will go wrong
you want to make sure that you are
keeping track of what is happening and
you know take the right measures to hoe
to go and make it up better so reactive
measures what are the common exceptions
almost everybody knows you just want to
throw it out there so that you guys can
test at least for this exception i'm not
going to walk you through what
exception each mean simple right all the
top exceptions are maybe maybe the
interesting one is to keep in mind that
the isolated storage exception is one of
the top ones that means people are still
messing around that is why you have to
go and probably download that power tool
to make sure you test test it for an
update test like you have an existing
app running in the marketplace and you
want to update the app what happens if
if I were updating the app so so what
will my file get overwritten they accept
because your customers are saving some
data right if the file the file get
overwritten or will it replace it will
it crash all those things so isolated
storage exception happens all the time
we spoke about some of this already so
these are some of the common things you
should keep an eye on so whaddya
measures again will measured learn dev
center has a download count download
report an appt crash report i think i
have my app crash report i can show you
look for your own feedback and reviews
keep like you know you are the dev test
p.m. for your for your for your app
right so we keep keep an eye on what's
like in what the feedback is and what
the reviews are and also keep an eye on
the competitors app I mean you want to
know what others are talking what people
like about their app so that you know
you can make your app your app on Sodor
search somebody told me there are
nineteen hundred flashlight apps on iOS
store so how will how does one app shine
across all the others right so so again
you can go it's okay to go and if your
friend or somebody has and an iphone or
you have a android tablet go check out
for a similar app on their store and see
what customers are talking about in the
review like spend time like do the
competitive research if you get serious
about this and start using probably some
if Yuri want real-time feedback for your
app if you want real-time crash report
analysis for your app then you want to
use some probably third-party software
and I have found one free one so I am
going to talk to you about so these are
some of these tools out there bug sense
hockey app body calm these are also body
calm is a does lot of things it gives
you like your photo editing AP is for
free you know like build your inner on
instagram app
quickly so he gives you some photo
editing API Ferb is like a back-end as a
service thing but it also gives you like
crash diagnostics and analysis service
real-time a bug sense hockey app telerik
also gives you some diagnostic service
so these are some of these things you
can add already into your into your
phone app so as to get some analytics
data and I can quickly show you maybe a
short demo so let me go to this app we
call it bug sense right how easy is it
to add real-time crash data so i go to
bug sense calm this is a simple one i
have been using they have a free tier so
that's the reason why I Menton tried it
so buck sense calm I went and created an
account right and it says hey that's why
you got an account go and download this
particular assembly so I go to New get
you get packages and I say bug sense
they didn't have this last year when i
checked with this pretty cool they are
innovating a lot so bug sense for
windows phone bucks and so Windows Phone
8 so I installed it right so what I did
I just selected it and said boom
installed for my simple little app out
there i installed it so what happened as
soon as I did that in my references it
added bug since the vp8 right so it's
it's there and only thing I had to do
now to catch my exceptions unhandled
exception is I go to app dot sam'l dot
CS and I oh don't look at my code you
can copy it if it's nothing it's going
to happen yeah that's the secret code
they gave me when I created a login say
go to the website created this is your
number that's your API key i could say
this is my api key right and so that's
one line of code i had to write that's
it and i saved it right and then I go
and if I run it in debugger then the
debugger will catch my exception what I
am doing here is a simple silly little
thing right I am saying / 0 I make I'm
throwing a divided by 0 exception just
to give you a prove the point if I don't
even debugger yeah it's going to the
debugger is going to catch it and say
yeah you're throwing a stupid you're
trying to divide by zero but it happens
in the wild or for any reason any crash
happens in the wild so instead of doing
that let us see I'm i think i have
already run this so let me say i run it
from here okay so i'm going to run this
and say crash me
app crashed okay let's go back to the
bug sunscreen and so this is I already
tried once before coming here so that is
that one crash did not publish it
something has to go wrong it to demo
let's say goes wrong and so it is pretty
fast it like pretty real time so let's
see maybe every minute or something it
publishes huh anyway so when I click on
that I'm going to get this detail in
real time right again report cuz you're
just coming here well isn't able to
upload today doesn't it catch it catch
this guy doesn't sense it just sends it
right i mean that's it I mean I at the
time of the appt so what is happening
there as I understood it at the time of
the crash this bug since deal will
handle your exception it just sent it
and then it passed on the crash back to
the phone so the crash no no first first
it so once you have you hand you can
what has happened there is like they
have there is the bug since dealer has
handled the first crash and then it says
just sent it and then it's really thrown
the exception so that then the rest of
the exception flows through the pipeline
because you don't want to change the way
regular crash happens on the phone right
they just catch it ahead throw it and
then they send the exception back
exactly exactly exactly so so they are
they follow some of this principle right
i mean so they don't change the entire
experience they throw it and then but
there are some of the others like
telerik they can say oops an exception
happen and you can really show you the
custom screen sorry an exception
happened so that comes out of the box OH
telerik does that yeah reach the server
will thank you and so next time you run
your app some of them do that so that's
that I think telerik and how k up dust
that and so the next time it opens up
the ansari we couldn't reach the server
so these are the buttons and tools and
screens that you get out of the box
without you writing any code make sense
that helps you get your your customer
have a great experience as like it
prints a nice sorry last time your appt
you scratch do you want to send this but
probably even for my mom I don't want to
show that to her so this is fine it
crashed that's it but without she
knowing anything about it I got the data
so let me just show you what I found
from the
what I got assuming it worked I got a
nice little you know attempted / 0 it
gave me the class it gave me what button
click led to it I got the stack trace I
got the details such as the app country
what what device it was for example I
have tried it on NH HTC versus no
clearer than i tells me what device it
was it gives me all the information I
could care about it wasn't fake gsm
network gives me the manufacturer and
all the things have which I care or not
care about right so I got this day and I
think this is there free tier you can
you can try out any of those guys out
there i think flurry flurry start
supporting maybe you can use flurry to
criticism is another one so the for the
images i showed there on the on that
screen you could use any of those dish
for tells the crash calm and also the
exceptions as well who has it oh yeah so
so the phone phone team okay so yeah so
so phone team gives you this this guy so
this is this is the this is the right
close it no so this is the phone dev
center this is the crashes for my app
from a long time okay so this is this is
why the app was crashing in different
countries and it was desktop and i
figured out afterward oh the URL was bad
in different countries so appcrash like
crazy and so there so it shows you so
each of my apps are crashing like this
and it shows you by color and you can
hover over it and these are all new
things that they added and i'm going to
click here it opens an excel file a csv
and it shows you the same thing but the
only point I was trying to say is that
you don't get it real time right right
so you're going to get the same thing
you're going to get a stack trace here
and what you do is lie copy paste it on
text pad or something and then go and
look at the whole stack trace so this is
your free out-of-the-box offering from
the dev center you want to go one more
step ahead you can go and get one of the
stools if you are serious about making
money and making sure that the apps
crash get fixed immediately then you can
go to a paid version guess what the paid
version is the 10 bucks a month so if
you are making a few hundred dollars a
month then you want to make more money
and you want to say experience is what
matters I want to fix those bugs faster
and get the analytics faster then you
can probably pay ten bucks to get that
additional privacy perspective i believe
the validation failure we're sending is
out or they're sending uneaten food in
my very good question so from a consent
wise i think so these companies pass it
on to the developer right so to say so
honestly that's something that I haven't
really you know i had the same concern
but i haven't try to find the answer
what I know for sure is there is
something called capabilities right so
most of us ignore that right when you go
and install when you are ready about
install an app if you scroll down a
little more you can see what
capabilities this app has so it says
network usage if this app can use
network then it can send pretty much
even your credit card number from your
from your app right so you are accepting
to the terms and condition by default by
installing it but yeah I mean so it
looks to me like that but that's a good
question I don't honestly know the
answer these tools are out there their
terms and use says that it's the
developer has to take the responsibility
of making sure like like yeah if with
this crash this is a good question he
would this crash I could say comma my
email address maybe my email address
could go but that's not the right thing
to do right so developer has to
developer has to take responsibility for
making she won't fill your windows 8
store will well fail you doing any
analytic tracking and you don't pop up a
privacy policy exactly they go so it's
it's actually good practice like why do
you want to put yourself in jail if you
are doing analytics it could be good to
good to good to actually call it out
anyways to say that you know for better
analytics do you want to allow and maybe
there is a if if else logic that you can
say if that is allowed then start
collecting crashes like this the good
question though so those are those are
some of the things that you could do I
sing Kia so they are Leia last but not
least okay this is something I want to
tell all developers are not designers we
try to believe that and so I've been to
the startup weekend somebody with folks
will know everybody's comes to the comes
to the podium and says hey I am blah
blah blah I am looking for a designer
the ten people who came there said I am
looking for a designer the design
designers are scarce and all the reports
are not designer so
you're really really serious of building
a great app so then probably do you know
somebody who's a designer do you need to
hire a designer I know somebody who has
said i am going to outsource my
designing to somebody in you know in
some other country and it was very cheap
and i was able to get my beautiful
beautifully designed game actually
beautifully designing should they
actually came and showed me like in
which one do you think is better of
course this one oh yes that's the one I
got designed from a developer this was
this was mine and his apps got better
reviews because look beautiful like that
beautiful comes with the cost probably i
don't know so yeah i can i can probably
exams so that depends on your need and
the your seriousness right i mean you so
that the point is that don't assume that
i can design everything on my own and i
am a designer some of you some of us
maybe but usually not so i want to throw
out a good references if you guys are
building apps for the phone so this was
not a perv talk right I would not do
justice to the performance if I am just
going to repeat some of the talks made
by some of these awesome guys out there
and build so highly recommended perf
what this is from somebody Oren on the
Windows Phone team and this is from
Stefan wig on the second one is from C
Fenwick from Windows Phone and so sorry
Stefan was here yeah Stefan was he ok
yeah so this is good talks on
performance and they talked about what
controls to use why one control versus
that mass matters how to make sure your
frame rate and other things are better
and then you can have a list of all the
talks to build a phone bill 2012 here
and then please keep an eye on the
developer blog very good resource like
there was a blog actually on the
simulator right which I showed you
earlier there was a blog on how to use
the performance analyst CPU and memory
profiling and if you want to learn about
how the whole compile on the cloud
worked if you are curious to know what
is the dotnet team did so as to make
sure your startup time and performance
is faster the last link is from somebody
in my own team who's who gives a talk
about how we make that magic happen on
the cloud so those are some of those
things I wanted share with you guys
about thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
