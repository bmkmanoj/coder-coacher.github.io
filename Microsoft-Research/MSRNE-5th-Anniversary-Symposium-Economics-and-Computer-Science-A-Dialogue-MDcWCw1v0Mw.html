the afternoon session the first one will
be led by Nicola Malika nikhyl is a
researcher and I couldn't game theory in
our lab Thank You Christian so as you
know this lab was built with the idea of
bridging the gaps between computer
science and related disciplines like
economics and so I thought for this
session it would be a good idea to take
a sort of step back and ask the meta
question of what does it mean to do
research at the intersection of computer
science and economics and how does it
impact the research agendas and the way
research is performed in each of these
fields so I thought to myself okay I
need two prominent thought leaders one
from economics and one from computer
science they should be you know eloquent
and outspoken and entertaining
personalities that can enlighten us on
this and this question and immediately
Sergio and christos came to mind and if
you know them I think you know why um I
have a lot of respect for them our first
speaker will be Sergio he's from
economics he's from the Hebrew
University and has a lot of very
important work in game theory and so I
would like to introduce Sergio who will
tell us his perspective on this
intersection between computer science
and economics thank you yeah I'm afraid
you are going to be disappointed I mean
I'm not sure that this is the kind at
least I gave yesterday a real talk so
now I feel that I can you know I did I
did my duty and now you know it's so
economics and computer science so first
of all I'm not an economist okay so but
anyway when you talk about economics and
computer science it's really a subset of
economics I mean if this works oh ok so
that's really economic theory yes and we
are not talking about econometrics we
are not talking about labor economics or
general economics or whatever
different kind of labor yes so it's a
sub it's a subset in fact I'm going to
talk about the superset of that and
that's gained Tory okay which so I'm
going to talk about game theory and
computer science that's really do you
have something that works without the
real pressure I don't know h oh ok now
ok I just I just once I said it it
started working you see ok so so i
thought that i will start i started
listing in my mind some connections
between the two fields I mean game
theory and computer science and I
started making a list and it's quite a
list yes so let's start with the obvious
which is computing solutions and the
computational complexity in computer
science that's an old connection I think
I would hate a paper right in the very
very old days you know when this
connections were so that's clear
connection ok so now next thing ok would
be repeated games and what's called
bounded rationality so repeated games
means repeated interaction collection
that goes over time in more than one
period and then questions that are
raised is where strategies in such
models are extremely complicated
creatures and extremely complicated
creatures are well you may prove
tolerance with them but they are not
very useful sometime so we want to limit
ourselves to simple strategies that's
bounded rationality and that's where
computer science came in fourth and
computable strategies automata boundary
called bounded memory lots of lots of
water exists the crystals had some early
work in fact again it's before those
connections really existed ok so there
is here a whole whole big field that's
really big thing ok ok then there is
something that in general is called
cheap talk cheap talk just means
communication where you can say anything
and it doesn't cost you anything that's
different than what's called signaling
which you can send a signal but it may
cost
you it may affect things so that's
called cheap talk and there is a very
strong connection to cryptography in
computer science but this is a place
where is there is really a missing link
okay there are results in game theory
there are results in photography okay
and I must tell you I once with a
colleague we sat down for one week a
whole week 15 days okay whole workweek
with some expert in the area computer
science expert in the area in Jerusalem
we set for one week and we tried to
understand what exactly computer science
people know that is useful for getting
towed okay well the end result of that
one week we could not get even one
theorem okay will always get something
like okay if this is true then you can
reduce it to this then we can reduce it
to this then you can do this and then
you do you get that ok now let's trace
it back and try to get a telegram or you
can make assumptions about the game
about the strategy something we could
not get it i'm sorry to say and there is
still a gap here I think there are
important results in computer science in
cryptography that have not been
translated into game theory and there is
there is what to be done okay I so
invitation for somebody to to get into
that I think it's an important area okay
well okay again the order here is not
just the order it came things came to my
mind it's not any significance or
importance or chronological just some
order there is the area in Game Tori
known as common knowledge interactive
epistemology computer science is
reasoning about knowledge in
distributive systems so I don't have to
tell you what those things are here of
course and again there are extremely
strong connections here and and work in
both areas going back and forth okay
okay okay then there is another hole
yeah you have another one ok ok I can do
it with then there is the area of
inventory of dynamics
learning adaptive heuristics for casting
I mean those are all it's a huge area
with lots and lots of things and there
are many parallels let's see okay so
there are many parallels in the computer
science community so on one hand there
is machine learning what's what comes
under the label of machine learning and
AI all the what's called competitive
analysis offline versus online where you
start comparing things that you can do
when you know everything advanced or
when you know it period by period and so
on then the notions of compact
computational complexity becomes very
important in order to get bounds on how
fast dynamics or how slow dynamics
converge or don't converge to whatever
you want okay again there are many
connections here it's a huge area okay
then we have the price of anarchy that
many of you is no offer you know which
talks about the calabria and efficiency
or inefficiency of equilibria and what
you have to pay for that is mekinese
design okay what in some crowd like this
one is called economic commerce or just
ec which by now I think no longer stands
for economic commerce but for economics
and computer or something yes so anyway
easy yes whatever which again it's a
huge error and i must say i remember in
the in the 90s when suddenly the center
for rationality no I metal center in
Jerusalem which has people from lots of
areas including computer science
economics psychology lots of other thing
so Saturday there was a seminar in Nam
Nissan and multi pelle started having a
seminal something on mekinese design
computer side not no clue what they were
talking about why was it like water any
connections that and so on so that was
but that is developed into quite a
fruitful connection and wet again okay
then there is a topic of collision
formation in game theory and the
parallel of social networks again it's a
very very active topic i think in
computer science it's also very active
still in game theory i think i have more
things let's see voting and social
choice yes which
well as norm how is it cold in computer
scientist that computational social
choice okay so you can ok I think that's
yeah so again this was this is just a
list as you see there are really many
connections and very different
connections yes it's not just take a
problem in Game Torre and say okay how
long does it take to compute no no there
are much more deeper connections here
and each one of those is worse you know
one hour lecture at least or two hours
or something so don't worry hey okay was
my clock oh I see that's how long I have
left okay okay okay good so now I want
to tell you some some some stories okay
I have let's see how much time I have
there is a difference between the two
disciplines okay there is definitely the
difference between the two disciplines
and I want to talk a little about that
but I want to start with one story or
two let's see how at the time permits so
first story is who needs another proof
okay and this the story is about collar
little equilibria and dynamics okay so
what's a call early to the equilibrium
okay well doesn't matter if you know or
doesn't know at this point I mean we are
looking now from it's a matter of view
it's a map view from above so forget
details you just want to see what's
going on so call so there is a question
if you take a finite game does it have a
correlated equilibrium okay so the
answer that everybody gives of course
because Nash already proved in his
thesis in 1950 that every finite game
has a Nash equilibrium and all Nash
equilibria are correlated equilibria so
there exists correlated equilibria okay
now of course the proof that Nash
equilibria exists uses fixed point O and
browser or kakutani whatever but that
requires a relatively heavy mathematical
tool on the other hand collected
equilibrium is given by a bunch of
linear inequalities okay so proving
existence of a solution of a linear
probing probe
i'm using fixed points sounds like an
overkill okay and in fact I remember
almond used to make for many years used
to say you know there should be a simple
proof okay but there wasn't a simple
proof okay that was not that that there
was no simple argument giving existence
of correlated equilibria and then
finally such a proof was found I mean I
was involved in it with David Meyler I
think in the late 80s and that proof was
there is a reason for the story you'll
see it's not just to tell you what I did
yes there is a that's not the point but
of course I'm telling us things that
I've been involved so that proof was a
proof that used duality okay I mean
linear also use do ality but was not a
simple proof I mean there was some there
was some some trick there they'll come
to it in a moment so but and also we
decided well it's a game tori problem
and used wallet e from linear
programming why not use the minimax
sternum which is equivalent to it and
it's much nicer for for a game theoretic
community let's use the minimax story
it's all again wouldn't matter if you do
that work that way and that's what we
did okay so essentially what what we did
we define an auxiliary two-person
zero-sum game and we prove some property
about that game okay and that property
was that the value of that game the
minimax value is 0 and that was exactly
equivalent existence of college weekly
be ok but then and it was put aside then
then ok then came a new thought and then
now comes another collaborate of mine
and Rome escola story should be here ok
so unrealistic wait a minute now that we
have a two-person zero-sum game from
which you get collected equilibria
two-person zero-sum games are nice
creatures for example in terms of
dynamics there are nice dynamics that
converge to optimal strategies for
two-person zero-sum game the famous
fictitious play which is a very very
simple dynamic converges to optimal
strategies which means we have a nice
dynamic that comes
just to collect the calabria because
turns out that the collector they can it
be our exactly the optimal strategies is
this auxiliary game okay so we have a
nice dynamic a simple dynamic so out of
this thing came a simple dynamic
converging to collated equilibria well
not so simple the reason was not so
simple and that took another five years
or so to simplify it to the point where
we wanted to get it was that this worked
in the space of n tuples of actions
which means all end players had to act
together in some sense and that's not a
kosher dynamic in Game three kosher
dynamic or an acceptable dynamic has to
have every player doing his own you
cannot force everybody here you know I
mean maybe Jennifer and not even them I
don't think you can fold them to do
anything no no sorry the wrong example
okay okay so you know you don't have
coordinated dynamics yes you want to
have dynamics that are decoupled I think
we use the word d couple then but later
it became unpopular dynamics across the
players okay and and that took some time
and to do it and we finally at the end
of the story after that that took some
years yes and that's work with Andrew
yes I knew is there but came a little
late yes so that's a veil which
eventually led to a very nice glass of
dynamics of simple dynamics which we
call regret matching and generally grade
based dynamics which is a special which
which are all uncoupled and this notion
of uncoupled nests which it all came out
from this okay so as I said we started
from who needs another proof so we
really proved gave another proof to a
turn on that was already proved who
cares for another mathematical proof
okay but that proof in the end led to
really very very interesting stuff okay
so that's that's one thing I ok so
that's one story I want to tell you now
a second story crystals may remember
that I asked him a question at dougs
tool some years ago okay and you
promised me an email statewide for that
email
but you'll see that that I no longer
waiting for it okay so here is the
question how difficult is it to compute
correlated equilibrium very simple
question okay now we already know it's
near programming problem so what can one
say about this is the trivial question
right well okay let's make it a little
more precise and see how trivial it is
okay so we have n players and for
simplicity assume that every player just
to pure strategies just again to make it
simple so that means that the number of
strategy combinations is to the power n
is exponential in n okay so in
particular the date of the problem which
is the payoff for every player for each
one of those two to the power n
combinations is n x to the power n times
whatever number of bits you need to
present it so its explanation in n okay
so the date of the program is
exponentially name okay now to compute a
correlated equilibrium we have 2 to the
power n unknowns those are the
probabilities you assign to each cell in
the to each action combination okay and
the number of constraints for every
player there are two constraints when
it's supposed to play action one it
doesn't switch 22 doesn't matter if you
don't know call it believe me two
constraints okay i won't go into it also
know anyway i'm not going to add
anything and also don't i'm not going to
add anything either so with this one
Center so every player's two constraints
then some probability is 1 so 2 n plus 1
okay anyway so it's linear in n number
of constraints exponential in a number
of unknowns a linear programming problem
of this size can be solved in time that
is exponential in n okay and in
polynomial in 2 to the power n which
means exponential in n okay now can be
solved can be done in any better way
okay so that's a question has Christos I
don't if you remember what it was some
after a lot of glasses of wine i think
was some evening there ok it actually no
no they've good wine there that was that
good winder no no you didn't come you
see that's what it means ok so is the
computation of ecology libya an easier
problem ok so
okay so now here is something some some
interesting fact okay that exists
randomized algorithms for examples also
get matching that I talked told you in
the previous slide they can find an
approximate correlated equilibrium
approximate college material means that
you satisfy all the constraints within
Epsilon okay like an approximate
solution of the LP program find this
high probability in a number of steps
that is polynomial in n ok now that at
first sight should be a big surprise the
date of the problem is exponential in n
and you find a solution in time that is
polynomial in n in fact you are only
checking polynomially many cells many
entries in your in your matrix that that
sounds wrong but then you realize that
for LP problems that is always a basic
solution that has no more than the
number of constraints nonzero elements
so then you realize that that's not such
a big surprise but it's still a surprise
because if you look at a linear
programming problems of this size they
don't have this property ok we do not
have approximate random I sorry do not
have randomized approximate algorithms
for linear programming problems that are
of exponential in n size that can find
that approximate can find an approximate
solution in polynomial time there are no
such things ok i'm not sure if there is
a totem saying that cannot be such
things but or should I want anyone no no
I think that it's a good question so the
question is okay so kinetic if you have
something special going about them now
how about finding exactly two equilibria
how about finding it's not the battery
it's just then I never mind i can i can
keep pressing but ok how about
deterministic algorithms for a rather
than randomized algorithms I kept asking
in fact Nico problem members at the the
half a year that we had in Jerusalem and
the other instances I kept asking and
everyone said I it's a good question so
what's the answer ok I didn't get any
answer
so then no I'm and I decided we have to
look at this problem seriously and we
did in fact what I visited MSR in
mountain view okay so that was a useful
visit just to connect it to two MSR and
then ok so here is ok ok so we have we
have a two by two table now approximate
collected equilibria and exact related
equipment that's what you want to get to
and then algorithm can be randomized or
deterministic and as I said this cell is
Polly n and turns out that all the other
cells are exponential in n there is no
way to get it faster than exponentially
name ok so all the other cells behave
like standard in a program of this size
again I'm not sure about the constants
but doesn't so what we are really doing
is counting queries queries means you
are looking at the cell in the matrix
and asking what the payoff is there so
it's counting it's a query complexity if
you want to be precise if we want to be
precise it's not you just do ok anyway
what happens is that so the question is
why is there sorry ok so the big
question is why is this cell different
then why is it so special ok I think I
understand why it is different and that
is exactly to the fact that the duel is
uncoupled name when you looked at dual
problem that you can uncouple the
problem across the players and christos
also knows this from his work on
computing correlated equilibria it's
exactly that dead tree however the big
question which is still I don't
understand is why does it help only in
this cell and not in the other cells ok
that's still a mystery why is this
uncoupled property of the dual helpful
only here and not in the other sense ok
it's still a mystery so there is still
something to do ok ok now I want to
throw that in fact i think was why
Nicole invited me here he just helped me
made some comment in Dutch tool and then
she said ok you have to come and make
the
again okay so complexity is something
that is a very common buzz word here yes
so there is computational complexity
there is communication complexity and
I'm sure there are lots of other
complexities complex complexities I
don't know whatever but so you take a
problem and you say look this problem
that complexity of this problem is NP or
pee pad or you know there are lots of
classes I stop it so I'm sorry to say NP
is where I stop there beyond that I
don't really know but anyway there are
one can say exactly what class it is one
can say exactly as a function of the
data how fast or how slow the
computation of the solution goes okay
but is that all so I think that there
may be something beyond that which I and
I want to propose something that I call
conceptual complexity so even if you
have so does the computational
complexity capture all the difficulty of
a problem and and what I want to suggest
that maybe not then even after you have
a precise solution you may have a
precise solution but you may have no
understanding of what the solution mean
okay what it represents what the
structure is how does it change what
does it do okay and here I have a simple
example those that were yesterday at my
talk will will will will sure you
understand what I'm talking about but
even that suppose that there is there
are two goods there is one seller one
buyer and two goods and the seller wants
to sell those goods and get Maxima
revenue okay and suppose that each goal
just has 10 possible values 10 possible
values of some probabilities okay then
the solution is going to be three
hundred numbers okay it's a probability
of each one of those ten by ten
combinations probability of getting good
one probability of getting good too and
how much the payment is so you're going
to get three hundred numbers beautiful
those numbers are going to be something
like even if you start with very very
simple data are going to be something
like seven million 233 something / 17
millions or something okay that's a
probability of getting good one now
somebody help you to give them the
answer you come to with this answer of
course you know what's going to happen
okay I mean go away what is
I mean you want me to sell with
probability 17 million / 23 million 27
and this is ridiculous okay so we get
precise answers may take a long time or
a short time in fact in fact people have
got very nice results on how to do this
in a very efficient way but we still do
not understand the answer we don't
understand the structure of the answer
yes which is which is in some sense now
one could say if it is difficult to
compute it's probably also difficult to
understand but there doesn't always go
in hand it may be easy to compute and
you get a very complicated answer that
you don't understand the structure so
you can just give numbers but you don't
know what it means you don't know how to
use it okay it's not very useful okay so
maybe it's connected also is how
difficult is to represent the solution I
don't know it's some some again it's a
some conceptual thoughts on some
complexities that may go beyond how
difficult it is to compute okay it's how
difficult is to understand the structure
of the problem okay okay so now I only
have one minute okay sorry so as I said
computer science and economics are very
different disciplines okay they work at
very different in very different ways
and again economics or game tori and so
on different search pattern strategies
so just give you a quote from nonsense
blog ok nama son you know as a blog so
that is that was written in 2010 and he
quotes me correctly that's what I told
him so we had some nicely some nice
results and ruin me and so when I was
asked how it should be fair to that I
said look if I mean computer scientists
will be no confidence by now since the
economist it will take a couple of years
until these are preliminary thoughts so
what happened norm wrote them wrote the
thorium and the proof in his blog it's
already what's already there in 2010 I
must I will tell you now the good news
sep tember 2013 which means a few weeks
ago it finally came out as a discussion
paper okay so it now it exists well
there'll be some changes and some
improvements and so on but that shows
you something about the difference in
the pace of the two disciplines okay and
and that that is that is not just how
fast things are moving it's also so well
i only have
can I have one more minute or you take
it out of the extra time to respond yes
so no no you get your 25 minutes you get
don't know you you get you a tea or 25 I
will not reply to you this okay okay so
so for example I mean what that I've
been doing with normally son lately so
I'll tell you another story slowly I
mean so we did the work immediately oh
this goes to this conference you already
had the box which conference it goes yes
because you have to send it to a
conference and so okay there is a
deadline have one week to write this
okay so write it then I say no I'm no no
this week on census anywhere i mean this
i'm ashamed we have to work on this this
is not okay work for one week in the end
of one way or that wake norm said look
this is the most i ever spent on writing
something that is too bitter to a
conference and i said this doesn't even
start to look like a paper i'm willing
to send anywhere okay that tells you so
I said okay you send it to the
conference now i'm going to rewrite this
from scratch as I think they should be
written well that was a year and a half
ago I started ok so at some point it
will come but so so those disciplines
really move a different pace now there
are advantages and disadvantages yes I
won't say that that one model is better
than the other there are some advantages
in the computer science especially given
that the large number of people in
students and so on so when I snom said
if that's something even though there
are 10 students that will work on it
when I don't offend students yes so
things that I'm not going to do I may
have one student or two sometimes will
never be done so one should really get
into it by the way normal so said that
that extra week that you worked was not
a waste of time at the end because they
got some new things out of it ok so I
just let me just say ok I'll just end I
mean I have lots of stories to tell
about this but I must in any case the
summary is that this has been and i
think is going to be an extremely
extremely fruitful interface ok and i
think that we are we are talking much
better that communities are talking much
better at one another of course each one
has its own thing and i think that you
know this person i think that probably
he's ok he's a proud father right of the
two disciplines ok questions for the
round table at the end we'll have ten
minutes of a chit chat between the two
of them and the rest of you so our next
speaker is Christos Papa to me true I
think he doesn't really need any
introduction in this community but he's
a computer scientist from Berkeley and
has worked a lot on the complexity of
computing equilibria and various other
foundational things in computer science
all right so many things involved I I'll
do I'll do what what about Cal keep
doing or her celcius dood press this
button and nothing happens ok so that
way all right ah great oops ok all right
so worse than nothing oh yeah it's the
length of my name you know it did it it
distorts everything it goes into it all
machines Louvre that sense of scale so
uh so let me let me start let me know so
I what I want to start with is I want to
tell you my path to this business how I
started on algorithmic game here as you
color discipline and that's not that's
that that's a very interesting story
it's not that exactly 30 years ago ago
almost to the day during a lunch with
famous man Cannizzaro so we were
colleagues at Stanford that operations
research department and the environment
to lunch and we you know it was it was a
fascinating lunch I had they had the
great time trying to keep up with what
he was telling me
and at some point he took out of his
briefcase a paper and gave it to me and
told me I think you should read this and
I had it just here I almost told him you
know I'm not your graduate student body
okay better but then I said he looks
like an ex clever man so I better a
better I better listen to what he tells
you so and it was not a good paper so
i'm not going to tell you which paper it
was okay you know but but but it was an
ingeniously selected paper it's the kind
of bad paper that makes you what draws
you in okay make mail makes you want to
put to work on this area okay so and
that's that sort of my my path you know
after that I started talking Nimrod
Megiddo a computer scientist and game
theorist who was who was sort of in an
intersection of this field we started
thinking about equilibria then then I
had a student who was interested in game
theory banksia okay he wrote his thesis
at Stanford on computational aspects
could Blake status of collaborative game
theory then as Sergio was kind of kind
to mention i worked on bounded
rationality and this story gets to a
point where it's like this this famous
interview by by a billionaire you know
the you know the journalist asked him
how do you get here and he said well i
started as a poor orphan in brooklyn and
i had five cents i bought an apple I
cleaned it I polished it i sold it for
twenty cents i got five apples for sale
for centuries with the result I polish
them I clean them I had sold two and
then I found out that my uncle had died
and left me three million bucks so
here's okay so so so this so I mean when
the reason is that the tasa was doing
this this this work something completely
tectonic was happening okay you know and
and of course I'm talking about the
internet okay and this another story
this a book I just threw a wave I mean I
find hunt in my library right I'm going
it is
humbling to realize that in 1994 I
thought that is worth buying a book it's
like again it's probably more humbling
for all righty okay you know well well
now I it's it's it's worth buying a book
whose title is the whole internet okay
no so either yeah in any event they
internet and immediately sort of you
know I realized that the game had
changed okay my life had changed okay
that that the computer was no longer
worth studying okay the cool computer
was a gadget that brought us this
monster okay so and now we have to study
this all right let me know and and and
to study the internet you really have to
understand people incentives and so on I
mean oh so to put it in their local
words of my colleague Scott schenker the
International colibri okay you just have
to identify the game alright so up and
speaking of equilibria that's a good
place to start that's where we started
because what's equilibrium is also here
in equilibrium the mango would love to
be at the bottom of the bowl okay but
since nobody's moving you say there ok
so the lab this is exactly what the
colibri so and the stellar calibra is
rich and old it started with one moment
you know our Father and they always
exist in 20 some games and of course
famously Nash proved the hysteresis that
even in nonzero-sum multiplayer games
and I mean inspired by this wonderful
result which in some sense change not
only came here about all of mathematical
economics are on the bread prove that
the markets or item 9 has newcomer
computer scientist okay there is an
obvious question to our skokie but can't
they be computed efficiently okay and
this is of course I understand
understand tamura flex for somebody like
me put my and of course everybody the
right mind all economies you know
certainly the beginning some of them
still now that's but why should you care
about our brains work will you be all
right and I think that there is a reason
okay that it's a call economics should
care about our words for
colibri oh and here is why because
equilibria are predictions of behavior
and when you proposed and purdy a kind
way to predict behavior computational
ability is important okay is essential
is necessary to put it in relevant words
of Commerce Jane if your laptop can find
it neither can be market okay so for a
game you know if if you if you tell me
that your your your market is going to
solve such ability I really want to see
your market okay so uh and here's what
I'm saying let me know that that in some
sense game theory in many ways was a
beauty contest among solution concepts
okay what am all I'm saying is that
computational complexity should be one
of the judges okay alright cool so and a
few a few years back with Kostas and
Paul Goldberg we proved that finding a
colibri which indeed intractable a Nash
equilibrium all right now it's still
that Roger Myerson 15 years ago I wrote
wrote that the Nash equilibrium and its
universality in other words mashes
theorem that every game has one lie at
the foundations of modern economic
thought okay so this is something about
the marriage of computer science and
economics okay mathematical economics
okay you know that it starts with
trouble okay because there seems to be a
computational hole in the foundation of
modern economic thought okay you know so
so so so we have to we have to we have
to fix this okay but even before
equilibria so this is with with co 2 p.s
we were we came up with this concept
which now it's called the price of
anarchy and this is the ratio between
social optimum the social optimum cost
and the cost of the words equilibrium
all right in other words you have a
bunch of people doing something
if they were a well-organized discipline
society they will do something which
optimizes social costs they want okay
they will do they will try to optimize
its around and they're going to end up
with a Nash equilibrium how bad can this
be all right that's that's that's the
question and here is a classical example
many of you have shown it came up in in
traffic you know in coming in killeen in
transportation research few years back
and basically it says that you know it
might have this network it's a road
network or item no these are the delays
this is one hour this is a strange Road
okay you know if basically a thousand
cars going to go from here to there and
the delay here is going to be
proportional to the to the you know if
half the cars take it it's going to be
half an hour if three-quarters of the
car to take it is going to be 45 minutes
all right I mean oh so is its and you
make up the story about this zero link
okay so up the point is that if you want
optimized to find the social optimum you
should instruct half the drivers to go
this way and have the drivers to go this
way and this way they're going to arrive
in one hour and a half if you let on to
their own devices believe me they're
going to do this and are going to arrive
after two hours okay so it turns out
that the price of an arc in this
situation this is the worst possible
example right and the price of Anarchy
be situation it is four-thirds all right
which is 2/1 a half all right i mean
when this is a wonderful result by raf
gather the tab those that popularized
this this this concept and the question
is why did computer science have to come
and come up with this concept right a
minute there is an explanation here's
makes the National economists had always
had to live with honor kill game no soap
and they are not aware of it end of its
end of its price all right let me know
and only CS with remember nostalgia to
the to the good old days where you could
design things arena soap and and of
course you love register okay Megan's
design okay so this is a very important
field and it's another wonderful you
know what also said you talked talked
eloquently about it it's a wonderful
arena for
for interface between computer science
and economics and design the game you
want to design the game so that selfish
players do what you want okay and in
some sense this story is a wonderful
example of mechanized design because
Leon Hall which have a century ago came
up with a model so deep so elegant so
open-ended so full of wonderful problems
so relevant that it was basically an
incentive for all clever mathematical
economist to start competing who is
going to prove them all over the more
important theorems in its early in the
end the winners emerged ok you know so
that in this game ok so and of course
these three people got the eric maskin
and anna roger maris on the shared the
nobel prize few years back and of course
the great example of megan is a nice
auctions and we all know that second
prize Vickrey auction is truthful in
other words you always are incentivized
to represent your interests accurately
and optimize the social welfare and also
generalizes and it was it was it was
observed a few a few years later Kate or
so later and then amazing result Myerson
showed that if you want to sell a single
item and you have independent priors of
the how much this is worth to your
bidders you can maximize revenue by a
single protocol okay which basically
reduces to probe the problem to vcg but
there are some gaps there were some gaps
in this in this in this theory and what
i want to point out is that is that in
some sense there were gaps that that
require the kind of collaboration
between economists and computer
scientists for them to be to be filled
and then in 1998 missing noir
and you know nom nice an aronan came up
with with algorithmic mega in design
okay so you know that was I believe that
was the Contras the title of the paper
they basically rubbed this problem to
our faces okay know that there is there
are computational wonderful algorithmic
complexity computational questions in
mechanism design okay and that we should
we should work on them and had some
wonderful fresh trees out there and we
didn't need nice and runnin you know
because because they were they were in
there ok the auctions were in there
because ebay was online and other
auctions had started or item no so this
was about the same time and a lot of
many computer scientists went to work
but of course I will I will I will show
my work ok had recorded been related
bidders were solved we know we figured
it out with with George P Rocco's Sergio
and norm have done amazing work and
others amazing work on Dwight emotions
and as extra bonus a new theory has has
has algorithmic theory of mechanism has
emerged from all this due to cost us and
his group at MIT alright if you are
nearly as old as I am your first the
first program you wrote was not hello
world it was this program right on you
it was hurting you compute the maximum
array all right let me know so so you're
all friend Max okay you shouldn't forget
him okay so why am I saying this okay
the world has changed all right you know
remember that you know Alan Turing told
us what what our what you know what
computation is right i mean oh but since
then there have been a lot of friendly
amendments okay people said no
computation is parallel no it's actually
react if there is not input output it's
not deterministic distributed quantum
and sewn right so what I'm saying is
that this this interface and the
internet has brought us in front of a
really different
different kind of computation and your
form of computation incentive compatible
computation you wish your input even
your gates okay but let us to talk about
this our selfish agent and these are
these agents are keenly interested in
outcome of your computation okay life is
not simple okay you get it so we know
your inputs are selfish agents who want
you to you know if you have have a sale
what do you they want you to compute so
there is another way but to give them
incentives to tell you or not to lie to
much okay incentives are now an integral
part of computation right quick reaction
is the new max okay you know if you want
to find that maximum of n numbers what
do you do you bribe the buttons okay you
know you Europe you give them incentives
to tell the truth right okay and here is
a question okay now now now now I'm
appealing to my fellow theoreticians
what happens for familiar categories
like a PNP complete and so on okay it
turns out that because of BCG of the
visitor generalize of the corruption the
incentive compatible variant of P is the
same as SP ok nothing changes for the
same reason the complication of
combative of incentives is not going to
make any problem is okay so so happy
complete stays under complete here is a
surprise something does change apx which
is the class of all optimization
problems for which you can deliver a
constant factor approximation sharings
okay there is a problem which if you
have if you don't need to have incentive
compatible computation you can
approximate fine but if you have an
incentive compatible kavita computation
you can and that's that work with single
and superior back in five years ago and
there are many
there is an array of important problems
here which are summarized here what cap
what happens outside this very specific
domain environment which is where where
Vickrey auction is is is possible okay
ah alright so I have a few minutes so I
want to tell you something else okay
that the other great dividend from
working in a new area for working in the
interface between two disciplines is
that you enrich your obsessions okay you
know you know that the things that you
are absolutely upsetting you sort of see
around you no matter where you look okay
you know so for example now games are
one of my obsessions right let me know
because before they were ok so and this
gives you it's you know it's basically
underneath it you as a scientist well
let me let me let me give you tell you a
story okay in the past 67 years have
been also very interested in evolution
okay in understanding evolution how we
came to be in other words you know here
is my favorite my favorite
computationally way of pinpointing the
mystery of evolution okay look around
you okay what algorithm could have
produced all this in a mere trillion
steps trillion okay trillion sounds like
a big number okay but everything about
it your cell phone has done a trillion
steps since the beginning of my talk
okay you know so and has accomplished
much or item europe so so it's it's you
know so believe it or not we have the
answer we know which algorithm has
produced all this in a trillion step
okay should i skip it okay yeah i'll
show you
alright so here's the theorem so let
before okay let me read label that we
proceeded to you know so there is a very
standard mathematical model initiated by
by Fisher right and Haldane in the 1920s
all right I'm no will wear by
geneticists and cold how we came about
okay how how populations of all right i
mean basically it is a mathematical
framework it's called population
genetics it's if you wish at some point
it's a differential equation all right i
mean it's it's it's a differential
equation tells you how population's
basically how our natural selection
leads populations to change or item your
essential to change their genetic makeup
if you wish to change the alleles in the
population mix or item you know so
that's that's what and the point is that
if you look at this equation long enough
and you make the right simplifications
and you are in the same frame of mind
the right frame of mind you end up with
a really interesting connection so here
is the fear the theorem is that joint
work with live not sustained and
measures irani evolution of population
in other words how the genetic mix of
population evolves over time can be seen
is a is mathematically identical to a
coordination game coronation games are
the simplest most boring kind of game
where there is no conflict but everybody
has the same utility all right and it so
coordination games are interesting only
in cases where the players are
cognitively challenged okay like jeans
or item you know so because the players
here are jeans ok and the strategies of
the genes have are the alleles okay
every strive a region has a few a lil
and the probabilities we saw there is a
game right and people are randomized to
play games the jeans are demise and the
randomization is the frequency of
dollars in the population okay and the
common utility I told you warn you
that's a
ordination game it's a boring kind of
game okay there is no conflict the
common utility that everybody is
aspiring to buy this sort of groping way
increase is the organist fitness okay so
it is not a selfish gene I mean oh it's
a game but it's not joking selfish gene
it's the community minded gene okay I
mean oh it's a gene that sort of that
only cares about the organ is fitness
are you ready for this the game is
played through multiplicative weights
update agua okay what what sometimes
it's called bushes okay so it's it's
dumb but machine learning okay you know
can you believe this i mean also so it's
it's this is this is this is the
algorithm that that brought us all here
okay so that's in any event so the
algorithmic game theory i believe is
thriving okay it has there is a lot of
excitement there are a lot of great
results all the time okay so you know
what you know because because we're a
new field where of course we are we know
we are of course insecure Sorvino once a
while get together and say are we done
is this the end will there be something
oh and then the then boom sort of know a
new result in here so and and we have we
have both senior researchers and the
young people we have both economists and
theoretical Peterson's work on this they
we have both better and style I think we
have conferences we have a generally
have Thank You hood and poke actually it
has it also has a an institutional
champion ok you know so have got it
right
for that great pair of talks I'd like to
invite Sergio back up and both of you to
come to the front of the room we have
here yeah table and chairs for you and I
just wanted to give you an opportunity
to discuss with each other and comments
sure foods my comment on each other's
talks and when I must say that I very
strongly agree with everything you said
hey sorry yeah I mean you didn't say
anything the typhoon I can argue about
oh okay that's that's that's not all the
surprises is precision that's always
surprising so uh I mean uh actually I
think I think that that that norms norms
admiration for me went up by ten ten
times when I came to give a talk at the
Center for rationality and i finished my
talk without being interrupted away at
the third slide my bed so this is a
policy I me know if we did we don't have
things to fight about them you know
maybe maybe you can help or we can have
questions from the audience right we can
take audience questions yes oh it's
precisely the fit the expected fitness
of each a lil in the current population
mix no no only only the frequencies the
system memory are only the frequencies
so the population keeps keeps it state
the state is only the frequency okay and
and of course there is the hidden state
which is which is the
the fitness sort of you know the the
they sell the natural selection value of
each of its genome Oh Jenna type I know
if you are interested where is that
should there you know varies anarki the
paper on this would buy the right Papa
Demeter who have varied a table for 4 30
years ago no no so so so listen okay
sort of you know nothing you know the
nothing can really explain so I think
that this is a productive new way of
understanding what happened okay you
know 22 so since since you are focusing
on that okay okay I a couple a couple of
a couple of warnings this is amino in
some sense this is what a bragging about
this is about about about evolution
between mutations okay we write so so
there are mutations and everybody's
focusing on in to endure modeling
mutations but I me know what happens
between mutations and this actual actual
II happens between mutations mutations
are important okay they provide the
diversity the another thing about
boosting is the following right i mean
know that if you analyze method you can
analyze mathematical busca mathematical
boosting ins and call it and see that
they essentially it is it is gradient
descent for solving a convex programming
problem okay and the convex programming
problem solves is basically the
optimizer projective is a combination
between regret and the entropy of the
order of the of the of the distribution
and in some sense it is this algorithm
that keeps variants around it keeps
genetic very high variation around okay
so you know because in some sense in
most classical models of evolution you
go to the hill this means that variance
is lost variation is lost okay so
another that you have one allele from
its gina they got start from the
beginning
madhu was about the like the fact that
Nash equilibria is hard to compute in
some sense has deflated the enthusiasm
for it and what sort of alternate how do
you feel about this I guess well yeah
I'm on so there was a point on my last
slide one before last slide I mean that
you talk about and that's one of the one
of the I would say one of the in game
theory there is gentle is a discipline
okay and this in the discipline at least
44 not for everyone but for many people
and I belong I subscribe to this school
it's a discipline in saying look you are
not inventing a new solution concept for
each problem okay one can always take a
problem you know and say okay we have
duopoly you have the solution we have
monopoly there is not suppose we have
options that is not so sure and so on
what do you want you want a solution
concept you want universal solution
concept that is a good one and then you
apply it all across and then you see
what you get okay now Nash equilibrium
is definitely such a solution concept by
the way they've been in game theory
seems various refinements okay you may
know sub game perfect equilibria perfect
equilibria trembling hand proper
sequential and so on some of those thing
I mean there was a period where lots of
people worked on it some of those things
survived those that are really very
basic others you never hear about them
anymore okay because they're very much
tailored to specific problems okay so
naturally librium is there to stay now
the fact that it is difficult to reach
that's also there to stay that says
something about the problem okay doesn't
say something about the solution concept
it's a sunset in some cases it is indeed
very difficult to reach equilibrium
which means the dynamical system may
well wonder around very long time and
will not allow and leach iquili-brium
you know like we heard the talk this
morning at the age that is more than the
that it takes to factor the two numbers
right the two-factor enterprise yes may
take longer which means that perhaps the
Nash equilibrium is is the wrong concept
because it's not going to happen okay
but it's there it's there to be now then
of course call it a decree by that other
notions so it is important to know the
computational properties of that but
that doesn't say it becomes less
interesting yeah I agree you know I I
that's embarrassing her so she was
expecting she was expecting a knife
fight and I'm sorry you can't provide
that so we I mean when you proved that
to you know we did when we were trying
to prove this i mean no we we thought
that it makes not it makes a nice
equilibrium less of that sort of less of
a an immaculate you know my more
interesting less he might let concert so
you know so actually you know i gave a
talk at the the Institute for Advanced
Studies a couple of years ago about that
and the John Nash was in the talk and
then we had lunch there tell me but
that's exactly his position okay so you
know that that that that that the Nash
equilibrium will stay and serene and
what what I prove what you proved the
mix makes this more more interesting
awesome I think we have time maybe for
one more question
I come from a mathematical background so
I kind of favor with economic strategy
which is right or result of carefully
trying to write place to put it and
publish it versus writing to the
contrast yeah so I mean oh that is so I
know I hate to say this but I totally
agree surgery so you know that that's
that that we are we are we are jumping
to the compress the design sort of way
too much okay so we know that now your
question was sociological so the
question is why all right I'm know what
makes what makes us do that okay so so I
mean we are not we are not teenagers
anymore okay you know but but the field
is young so you know so so so it's so it
has sort of you know some some some
energy it also has paradigm from you
know which witch is which is above which
is that that speed is vitally important
okay so we know that most lo que you
know so uh and and and it it attracts
people but but but you know what when I
first asked Russia to change without I
don't buy don't go any further okay you
know but but when I first when i first
started rubbing shoulders to game here
is what amazed me ok this is the
similarity of the two communities CTCs
and game theory it's okay so you know
you know if even down down to the to the
to the to the lunch jokes sort of you
know a sort of density in israeli sort
of you know so you know you know you
know so you know it's it's it's a you
know all these all these you know it's
you I felt I felt like sort of my heart
I got stepped in to endure soda or stock
or something you know when
when I when I started going to meetings
of of of game theory yeah so so you know
it's it's very surprising then what what
tradition you know what power
traditional has okay so we know that
that one tradition the young people in
game theory obviously there are every
bit as a crazy aggressive and ambitious
as we are as our young people are and
yet so we know they abide by by by the
by the older generations of habits of of
of sitting on the paper sorry you know
I'm not I've been waiting for his papers
to come out you know for far too long
I'm you know but you know yeah I know
yeah so to his credit he you know I
always you know when we become available
he doesn't mean email I think so yeah
yeah so let me know there are there are
there are several results several major
results in theory that would be
impossible with this with this
television for example the Samiran you
know just to name one yep on the other
hand yes on the other hand I one so we
have to disagree little yeah yeah so I
reminded me that there was a quote about
last night about economist so there was
we talked about this well of a true man
I think one president looking for a
one-handed economist because he had
enough of those economies saying on the
one hand that on the other hand dead in
wonder they're so so on the other hand
yes so sometimes so I think there is
another facet another another aspect of
that which is that sometimes it's it
looks like okay there is only one final
epsilon that one looks at I mean you
know it can only epsilon sometimes the
most important thing is that last
epsilon okay sometimes the the real
understanding and lots of new things
come out from from that last epsilon now
I must confess and that I've seen it
enough times in computer science leaving
that last epsilon as it is and not
getting into it
and and and missing really unimportant
things okay so and that's part of it
that you know you wrote a paper and they
went to the comfort that's it what's the
next subject yes and people don't have
the patience to really get deep and
really try to understand really what's
going on okay and there is a difference
now i must say that probably i'm an
example of a very extremely i mean i'm
at the extreme of being extremely slow
in this respect and I don't think that's
a right strategy either but I think that
one should again at least after you have
tenure yes once you take the time to
take the problem and really try to
understand it not just get a few more
turns okay and that's very important and
I think that the conference papers the
conference's is not good for that I
agree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
