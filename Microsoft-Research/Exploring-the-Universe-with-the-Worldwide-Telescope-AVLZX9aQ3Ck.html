because the interface is so visual and
the way that you find things is visual
it just looks great it's beautiful and
in its ability to tell the story and
narrative and between looking good and
being able to tell this narrative it's a
very powerful way to describe science to
the public it was a sense of a profound
kind of experiential truth that left me
you know the state of all one of the
things we really wanted to do with the
worldwide telescope was to make it an
application that was as beautiful as the
night sky is we have just gorgeous
mosaics of the night sky images from
Hubble and we didn't want to take away
from that by creating a busy user
interface a part of that was to make
that make the design of it fairly
innocuous fairly intuitive and to allow
you to browse as easily as you could
just by dragging the sky around and
using something as simple as the scroll
wheel to zoom in anywhere it really
feels like you're using a browser you
know it's the web browser for the night
sky in science education I think that
worldwide telescope is incredibly useful
because it really gives us this unified
perspective on the university allows us
to see the relationships between things
what's near what's far what's the size
and scale of things how are they related
to look at the night sky as you would
see it with your own eyes and then move
out to and zoom in on planets stars
nebulae galaxies has never been
available to people before what pops out
in my mind about the design of this
world wide telescope is the dashboard
nature of it the clarity with which it
presents its possibilities there's no
end to the way in which the elements on
this dashboard can be combined to take
you into new places you can easily
browse these thumbnails find out more
information and see where they're
located as things come into view that
look interesting you could look at a
thumbnail and say wow what's that click
on that and it takes you to that object
in the
sky you can have two images from
different wave lights and you can then
you know if has little slider bar and
you move it around and you see how these
images Alai to each other now that is so
useful it's just an engaging beautiful
experience that pulls you into it it
makes you want to spend time with it
it's a really really unobtrusive design
I think it lets people really explore
the universe in a very freeform way that
I think visually is incredibly powerful
the presentation of the world wide
telescope through its interactivity is
one of the most sophisticated and yet
one of the most simple to use of any
I've seen I've studied a lot of these
kinds of learning systems online and
this one happens to have the most clear
the most obvious pathways to learning
suddenly there was a sense of the cosmos
sense of the universe if we brought so
much alive kind of touched me in so many
different ways that you know I was left
with a feeling by god I'd forgotten that
sense of awe had been years since I've
experienced the all that I experienced
there
