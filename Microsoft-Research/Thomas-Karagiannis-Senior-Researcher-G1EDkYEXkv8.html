probably covered all the stages so I did
an internship and after the internship I
joint as a postdoc and after that every
time they became a regular full-time
employee obviously the beginning as a
researcher and now i'm a senior
researcher so I've been with Microsoft
for over nine years now and I've been
through all the stages from intern to a
full-time senior researcher now I
believe Microsoft Research is one of the
most exciting places to be in I have the
opportunity to save the future I work on
cutting and technologies with some of
the top minds in the research community
and also in Microsoft products teams so
I believe it's kind of one of the most
exciting place to be if you want to
change the technology is an advanced
state of the art thing their computing
so our group systems and networking
mainly focuses on building systems for
important real world problems so we like
to build systems test them at scale they
are focused on changing the way that
millions of people interacting with
computers and technologies so we focus
on things like the internet data centers
we do work on distributed systems
security so basically the whole spectrum
on networking intense systems research
my current focus is on improving data
center network performance but I have
worked in the past on intern internet
measurements monitoring I have worked on
a peer-to-peer networks social networks
but in general my my goal is to improve
networks make them easier to use and
also make them more predictable and
efficient for for normal date users my
proudest achievement would be the work
that we did on a predictable data
centers project which actually part of
the algorithms and abstractions that we
developed are actually sleeping with the
windows server in the next version of
windows server so this is quite exciting
because
we will be able to allow for a lot of
people that are using microsoft's
enterprise cloud networks to have
predictable performance in cause when
they're using the cloud network so this
will offer quality of service guarantees
for a lot of cloud tenant users and it's
very exciting because you know some of
our work some of our research and some
of the code that we developed as part of
the three series i could going to be in
one of these microsoft products so i
think that's kind of my proudest moment
each year microsoft research house
of influential speakers from around the
world including leading scientists
renowned experts in technology book
authors and leading academics and makes
videos of these lectures freely
available
