hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading

academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
and welcome so it's a great pleasure to
introduce Dan land who's gonna be
talking today about Madoka so let me say
a few things about Dan before we start
so Dan joined Microsoft research in 2006
and he's been all the time has been here
he's really been interested in type
systems and the kinds of things you can
express and types and in particular he's
generated some very useful technology
along the way so in particular if you
use a c-sharp and write parallel code
you probably just a test parallel
library which he was a primary designer
for if you write code in Visual Studio
online you might use the online editor
the browser-based editor i'm monaco and
in fact the syntax highlighting you'll
see in Monaco is is do the Dan's great
work so he's done really interesting
things across the board here and today
he's going to talk about something based
on another language he created called
coca and in particular a very useful
replacement for a lot tech I consider it
the la tech of the the 21st century so
you'll see why in a minute
madoka so with that oh and by the way if
you have questions this is for the
online people you have questions there
is a ask questions online and so if you
type it in to ResNet it'll show up on
this this tablet of mine and I can and I
can ask the question in the room so
thanks man awesome yeah so so I'm Dan
and I'm gonna talk today with Madoka
it's not really a science talk it's more
a tool demonstration talk and I hope
it'll be sweetened and not in short so
that would be great and normally I I do
a lot of like like Ben already said a
lot of type systems design and and
recently I've been working especially on
thinking about side effects and how to
track that in a type system so I was
writing all these papers with lots of
unintelligible math in it and I thought
oh it's a great type system and then the
reviewers came back to me and they said
yeah we like it but but you know doesn't
really work in practice right the in
theory we see it work so I thought I
have to write a few bigger programs with
my new language khoka that does this
side effect inference but what kind of
great example program should have
right so I thought normally people write
their own compiler in their own language
but I thought I'll do something else and
hey why not do a word processor right
well I want to follow in the footsteps
of Knuth and our esteemed colleague
Leslie Lamport and maybe get a Turing
award too in the future so that would be
a great great thing to do so nowadays
when people think about word processors
what's really popular online we take the
young kids is marked down and markdown
is kind of persuasive throughout the
internet and the biggest users are like
github and Stack Overflow but it's been
invented a while ago by a writer called
John Gruber and and he wrote a lot of
blog posts and he wanted a nicer way to
write his blog posts and he just needed
HTML out of it but but he was really
thinking about how can I write something
that looks like a text email and then
formats nicely and as a writer he just
wanted the world to really concentrate
on his writing and his content and not
not on anything else so he loved like
you know playing text editing and he
wanted it to look like a very readable
documents on its own in the plain text
but then format nicely and it became
very popular so there's many many places
where markdown is used and also in and
it's may be most surprising in very
non-technical communities where people
like the lot like there's a special
markdown variant for writing movie
scripts for example and and people use
that all the time so I thought hey let's
let's write a a markdown processor in my
new language coca to show that my type
my side effects type system really works
and that's what I've been doing and of
course once I started doing that then it
became bigger and bigger I thought well
I can almost write my own papers in this
new markdown that would be cool so I
made something that I call now madoka
and it's basically an extension of
markdown that makes it great for more
serious use
specifically for a stylist so yeah some
markdown is so John Gruber invented
markdown the the the style of writing
these kind of documents so you write
stars for a list and then it it it
renders nicely as a list and he made
also a little program called markdown
but then in the wild many people made
extensions and markdown processors and
so markdown is now this this common
denominator of you know documents would
look like this but it's not officially
there's no official standard for it
another working on it so so when I say
madoka I want to kind of stress that
it's a variant of markdown that makes it
good for serious use so one of the big
problems with markdown is it's too
simple like it's great for if you want
to write something really simple but if
you want to write a an article and an
academic paper a big technical documents
you need many things like course
referencing and tables and figures and
and all these things and standard
markdown doesn't do that so Motoko is
you know markdown on steroids and I and
I made some you dish judicious
extensions such that you can actually
define your own behavior
so in particular so with Motoko you can
create beautiful HTML and PDF which is
really nice so your paper comes out in
both HTML and in PDF it's really nice to
read and write because it's it's
basically markdown so so when you're
writing your content it looks nicer than
if you would write low-tech and you can
do still all the complex stuff that you
would like to do like you know numbering
stuff and references citations and
mathematics and all kinds of funny
transformations on your text that that
people like us like to do a lot and I'll
give a lot of examples of that later on
when I demoed the thing for real and I'm
trying to avoid all the things that make
latech hard right actually so I'll show
an example of that so here's a paper I
recently submitted on on a Coco type
system actually but
so it's all generated from one Madoka
source and so this is the the PDF
version that comes out if I wouldn't be
in F 11 you would see pop up here yeah
so just a a you know it's a regular ll
NCS paper and you wouldn't be able to
distinguish it because it's it's
generated by lab tech in the end as the
backend so it's it's just a real paper
of course you know it has things that
make you think oh it's kind of nice look
at all this code it looks nicely typeset
with colors and everything and you
wouldn't usually do that in low tech
because it's a lot of work to do that
but as you will see later like this
alignment nicely right it's usually hard
stuff to do in code you know there's
still a lot of math in it let me see if
I can find out you know here's some
there's math later it all and there will
be a lot of math don't worry
lots of code there there's a lot of math
there's like you know a bunch of type
rules in a figure and yeah you can do
all these things it's all generated from
Madoka source and if you want to write a
read this paper in your phone you're not
happy because it's like PDF and you're
like zooming in and out they look like
scrolling through it I don't know if
you've ever done it so actually there's
also an HTML version it generated at the
same time here's the HTML version hey it
looks kind of you know like hey it is
the same paper you see the the code it's
a slightly different fall because it's
it's HTML but yeah it's it's the same
paper with the same map in there let me
see if I can find the math again there
we go there you know the same math rules
and and it's a real HTML thing you can
like make it bigger you know it smaller
so let's go and yeah it's it's it's all
there right so it's actually in three
different ways to generate it yeah
you're too advanced already so they're
actually they're actually in this one
they're images but
done in a nice place as you can see they
look there look sharp it's not like the
old Wikipedia stuff and I think it looks
the best but you can also use other
backends and then you can generate math
amount but it doesn't it's not there yet
right maybe one day it will look good
but now the nice thing about this is it
looks exactly like the low-tech there's
no you know no difference there I'll
show a show a lot more of it yeah other
things well you you sorted already like
there's lots of things like references
and people the other fee stuff and of
course in the HTML you can do more right
it's easier to link and easier to kind
of like have a little pop-ups like that
and like jump to stuff I was just
happened to be the last one you know in
the HTML I generate these little search
icons so you can search for it nicely on
the web let's use being for that today
right so back to des and so it's all
generated from the same source and later
I'll show you the actual source so first
I think what I want to stress is that
what makes it fun to write in Madoka is
that it's just a little bit more
pleasant than we're used to well you
know you could argue it's not a real
difference like if you write item or two
dots it's not a real but in the end and
your whole document it just feels more
pleasant it is true that you feel more
like you're working with the content
other things that that markdown does is
saying like well if I want to link I
don't want to interrupt the flow so I
put the real link underneath here
underneath my paragraph and then I just
lose these little brackets to say what
what the link means so you you more of
the flow of your text and it's actually
here's a result how it looks like right
right so then you know it's the same
with like code like this is actually
this is actually real code that I was
writing a while ago in you know I'm a
doko you can write the code it's much
more lightweight to write that kind of
stuff but it's your text becomes more
apparent what's going on and it area
this is a rendering in in low-tech of
that particular piece of code yeah
so you see that in in markdown for
example it says well if you indent four
spaces it becomes code or if you put
things between these backwards
it's it's like inline code that's all
it's like this lightweight annotation
mechanism well I'll get to that later
but I think an important part is that in
the end is still text files and one
reason why it's so popular is that it
was very easy to kind of take these
markdown documents or madoka documents
and transform them into something else
and do some processing on it and I think
a this part biotech is also so popular
because you can kind of see it and mess
with it and if that's a really good
thing about madoka so it's much easy to
process it and in contrast to low-tech
I'll give you lots of ways to easily
transform the document inside your own
document so I'll show that later hey I
hope so yeah you're like a rule that
generates your documents right yeah so
in the end though I still use latech for
mathematics because latech is great for
mathematics and and all the papers we do
we love using that so if you want to use
math yeah you still stuck with kind of
difficult commands but then you know
you'll figure out that math is actually
quite it's easier in latech right so
this would look like this if I would
write this in my presentation and you
know you can do crazy tag too which is
important because if you
writing your paper and you're like on
your deadline and suddenly you need
something amazing hey you can actually
do it you can just put in this is like
PS tricks magic you know how did they
copy and paste it so it's all it's all
supported right there I should have
shown the source it's kind of fun so
another big thing is like the code we
write a lot of code and if you look at
how we wanna we we would love to see
code highlighting in the code or we
would love to put like special
characters in the code and all these
things are usually very hard to do sorry
Madoka I really tried to make that
that's easier to do and so yeah that's
all there there's like a great command
line program that does it but then I
took the little step further by putting
all this in the web and that there was
it was kind of interesting that my my
side effect language really came into
play here so road is this initial
command line program that would process
markdown and I wrote it all in coca and
then I kind of realized that that 95
percent of the program was underneath
this this markdown function that
processes strings and options and and
gives you back a new you know string
that's like HTML output for example and
I saw it only has two effects namely it
may diverge or arrays exceptions and
it's pretty good because that really
means that everything there didn't have
any other side effects like it wouldn't
read from a file or get the options from
the global variable or a wreath includes
file through to the file system or
something which man that could actually
run this program both on the server or
clients so coca generate JavaScript in
the backend and I knew that the
JavaScript word for all this can be
seamlessly transferred between server or
client with exactly the same behavior
and they've kind of opened up the way to
make this whole thing completely online
is an html5 web app and that's what I'm
gonna
demo now and that's that's been really
cool because suddenly I could integrate
with services like like Dropbox or
onedrive and github and now another big
part of writing a paper namely
collaborating with others became much
easier because you can now just just
start writing with someone else on the
same paper you don't have to set up your
your special repository stuff alright
it'll just just work so I'm gonna show
it right now can everybody so the
question was if people wrote a paper and
in madoka that you could actually
publish at a conference so the answer is
clearly yes you can because the the
paper I showed in the beginning their
day is one of those papers right and it
looks exactly like the one you would
generate with low-tech so there's no way
yeah it is the same thing and it's easy
to do actually so already the beautiful
part is you get not only HTML and PDF
output you get tech output you send it
to easy-chair
you press the button saying compile it
and easy-chair it says it's a great
document so so fundamentally there's
many backends and of course I'm the way
to low tech it's going to produce all
the files you need to look at it so with
a publisher and you can drop in your
style filing Dan's been awesome he
understands the fact that we are
publishing and publishers have all these
requirements so yeah it works so maybe I
may be before I show other stuff I
should show that that like like how you
would write paper so here's madoka
dotnet it's actually real demo it's like
madoka dotnet I'm going to you can do
that to your own home computer I'll make
the screen big because I promise that
so here's what you would see but you
could kind of say let me let me look how
would I do it so we could kind of say
here like if I generate low tech I get
some I could maybe say this is the
editor here's like a preview of what
you're seeing is all on the web and I
just generated the PDF file which I will
open now and here it is right there's a
PDF file and it uses a standard article
style right but what I could do is say
oh I want to actually submit to sick
plan for example so what I can actually
do is I can I can open up some I can
have the sick plan conference style here
like it's the class file CLS so I
grabbed it and I drop it here you see it
like says document class sick plan cone
right and it's actually in here in my
files there's like this here is the
style file now and if I now generate the
low-tech let's see if it works
oh my god never do these kind of demos
online but we'll say so now it actually
so it's ended okay it's done so I'd send
it to the server it generated the look
tacko we did it work
nope no but it's right oh right they
work it's just all right there it is
right it's just a single it's two column
format so you can't really see it it you
can see it like shorter if it's like
longer it'll go in the second column you
see here suddenly the ACM stuff and so
suddenly it's like in sick plain Kampf
style and actually I have a bunch maybe
I'll show that too if you do a new
document here they do a new document it
says oh you know you haven't saved your
local document we were less messing with
it but I don't care about it so I'm
gonna discard it and I'm gonna do a new
local document and then actually here
there's a bunch of predefined guys like
like lip-lip ik's
it's funny right there you go
like here's a more you know other kind
of style files so it looks it looks cool
in in the preview but then I generate
that the the look tech you get a real
lip excel file so I'm gonna show that
this is one with pictures and math that
you know it kind of shows more difficult
stuff and there we go yeah right so for
the H so this is the the low-tech one it
generated just section commands and
everything the normal stuff but because
I imported the olympic-style file it
creates these little yellow boxes for
example around the numbers because
that's their style
when I have a list it does little grey
thingies because that's their style so
what I did when you open up like a
standard one in the new I wrote some CSS
for the preview that imitates that style
as much as I wanted to just as a you
know service to the user of course in
the end editor should should really
provide that for us but now it looks
more like the Olympic style for example
with like a sensory foam for the
headings for example but I think that
the big thing is did I show the PDF or
right ok so the big thing is that you do
use whatever the the the the publisher
wants as its style file and it's that's
an important thing so which is that it
prompted you to discard a thing that was
not saved right that's because you
hadn't backed it up with you know
SkyDrive or something like that right
because otherwise if you're in the cloud
then it's a save list world right you're
coming just two stories there it's only
because it was browser local document
that okay right new users know that's
exactly right so hit save save is a
stupid concept that never should have
existed it's alright so tonight right so
the nice thing is if you use your
document on Dropbox or onedrive
it'll be automatically saved all the
time like about every 30 seconds and it
saves continuously
you know your local storage in the
browser so even if I just hit refresh or
close the browser it will still be there
like almost every keystroke right but
this other document was just local if
it's never in a cloud anyway so if there
would be a good thing this I think is
actually important thing something that
that make me realized so when you open
when I started working with someone on
say a Dropbox folder I realized I have a
better backup than normally because
you're in this Web thing but every 30
seconds it's it's sent to the Dropbox
cloud storage it's probably better than
my hard disk and it synchronizes with
all my other devices on all my hard
disks and it saves every version up to a
month of all the articles and it almost
means like every 30 seconds you have a
version on Dropbox that you can go back
to and look at so I would say it's a
very secure way of more secure probably
than how I normally ride my documents so
if you integrated get up though you have
to commit yourself every once in a while
because that's that's the storage model
right so then you're still still a kind
of a safe at that point yeah so so rusyn
osteen I fixed the numbering because it
doesn't like to start at the one it
likes to start at zero and actually I
made a special roost in style so I think
if you do zero here it'll start right
there we go it's special it start with
zero instead right I made the zero style
to do it actually
right you see also it figures see
in sections like actually so let me get
back to it so I'll do a little right
there's also a local document right I'll
do another new default document here I
wanted to show a few more things about
what you can do in markdown right so one
thing we already saw like lace so this
is like simple stuff right two three and
I think the nice thing is though it's
very obvious what to do so if I want to
make this like a Roman numeral list
maybe if I type I oh great right it's a
Roman numeral
list now right or if I maybe do like a
capital A maybe right it's it's ABC said
it's like maybe a slightly more easy
than you normally would would think it
is right or start at six
however so those those are nice things
then other things which are nice it's
like cross referencing this is something
that that's really important for
everyone and we want to be able to
easily do it so big extension in madoka
is that you can add attributes to stuff
like here's the section header madoka i
could say well this is like the
introduction and then everything is like
HTML CSS base right so these attribute
is like an identity I gave to the to the
module go header that's the introduction
and I can say c-section introduction and
it will be like c-section one right and
if I hover on section one it will say
this is the Motoko chapter everyone can
read this by the way right all right
cool so so that's easy stuff then of
course you can name many things like
maybe I'm gonna write some equations
equation let's write a nice low tech
equation what is it limit in deep what
is it mmm
mm I think it's something like this
right probably I don't done so oh right
so actually like so there's a little red
guy over here that tells you about
latech errors oh that's nice like right
it's like well it's still a little
attack or error so it's not amazing but
hey maybe now you can actually find out
what what you should be doing right and
then here you see it's still being
rendered
it's like grayed out it means it's sent
to the server and then it's rendered at
a certain point and then it's right
there and it's it is a nice number and
of course if I now want to refer to this
equation I could say you know see
equation Euler and then I refer to
equation 1 right and similarly I can
make I can make up other blocks right
like theorem blocks or something and
maybe Here I am gonna say it's let's say
theorem Euler and maybe I'm gonna give
you the caption so you can make more and
more little little attributes we are
proving something all right I can make
more and more attributes and it will
like come out like this but the funny
thing is the theorem thing is not
something that's built into Madoka it's
something you can define yourself and
you can kind of look up how I defined it
and then you can do stuff with it for
example you can make little rules here
about theorem blocks so you can say well
if you see a theorem block maybe the
margin on the left should be 1m and then
the whole thing like like jump a little
bit do this to the left right and maybe
other things you want to do is like
saying uh I might want to number them a
little differently well turns out the
actual number it's called the label of
something you could say well instead of
the theorem counter should really be
lower alpha or something right and it's
like theorem a now and maybe you're
gonna do
yeah other stuff you can do a lot of
stuff there you so you can you can
basically define completely how you do
your labeling or numbering taken why is
oh alright so for everything with Ed's
our counters in in those attributes and
then you can set like how they are
display right so actually it turns out
that everything you do here I make up a
counter for you already that's named
after the block there is an equation
counter and a theorem counter in an h1
counter yes and it's really because in
there in the basic style file I said the
label of theorems where you see the
number it's kind of defined like this it
says the label is at theorem like the
counter theorem and plus a dot I think
right oh now it's double dot okay so
it's like the counter theorem and I can
put something in front of it right I
could say oh also do the the section
counter in a little dish and then
oh it's actually h2s here because it's
sections wait h1 maybe anyway right so
you see here why don't this oh wait wait
I like dot yeah well do it right so here
you see now it's like 1 dot a because
I'm I said oh it's really the counter of
the sections plus a little dots plus the
counter of the theorem but you know this
is pretty advanced but I'm glad I want
to say is like it's very flexible in how
you define these attributes and how you
can specify wrong blocks in your own
things like exercises and answers and
those kind of things actually yeah one
other advanced thing I would like to
show is about
code so often we write a lot of code and
one way to write code is between these
little
backticks you could write function hello
learn hi like this and yeah we love
writing code like this
it does look funny where is the high so
it would be right here we could write
you see the code over there and it's not
highlighted well it turns out you can
actually automatically highlight very
it's fenced fancy descriptions code
automatically and this is how you saw in
my papers how the coca code was like
nicely highlighted and another thing you
may want to do is is often in code or
any other kind of block you would like
to kind of make little little
replacements and do transformations on
your code some one one example is if I
write here you know pi is 3.14 I may
want to use the real symbol pi over here
well how do I do that right it's like
because we're inside code and and it
looks just like code well you can escape
back to Madoka using special escape
sequences and and then insert funny
stuff like a piece of math that
evaluates to PI all right so you kind of
sees only that I'm rendering here at
mathematics and then it inserts little
you know PI character but in general you
would like to do it it may be for for
large pieces of code of a code it's
included and you have many kinds of
transformations you might want to do but
you may also have here a little fancy
back arrow for example right so you
would like this back arrow to appear
like a nice back arrow and you may have
many other symbols and it often occurs
in your papers so you can make more
rules to do that kind of thing like you
could say Oh for all the code I want to
do a replacement rule so if I find these
des spec looking arrow then maybe I'm
going to insert some latech that does a
left arrow everywhere and I brought the
little regular expression there to do it
and they didn't work oh there it is
no it is actually working look there we
see the the nice arrow popping up right
and it's this way you can actually write
mathematics or code in really nice ways
and you have it suddenly get a lot of
power to do transformations on basically
any any block you have like there's
there's no I did it now on code but I
can take any piece of code and transform
it in these ways I had multiple
pre-black s--
in my document but I wanted this
particular transformation javascript for
example right right so you could do here
you could say only if it's JavaScript
right so there's many and you know I use
a class rule right some of this right
right oh okay okay like like you know
you can say oh I add a little class my
blocks my block right and then do my
block here nice but you know of course
the whole idea of markdown is you write
this nice sex that you can really read
and it's like pleasant on its own right
so the more you're gonna add like funny
funny attributes the the less you're
like pure in the markdown spirit but
right it would be great so like this pie
stuff is really you know frowned upon
right so so it's great to have a rule at
the beginning that that your code here
will look really nice like I've seen in
a there's a million times people wanted
to play the decision about what their
thing is gonna be called
in the paper right so they give it like
a little Mack remain right behind it so
so yes actually so replace is more for
advanced stuff like all the arrows need
to look like this when you have
something like you know my project you
rather use an entity right just like in
so this is how you write entities like
my project and then anything here that
you defying they'll be replaced so if I
do my project here as a you know my
project yo you'll see it takes that and
puts it right there
it's a four logo stuff it's much easy to
use entities oh yeah you can write
you could you could just enter the
Unicode character actually here instead
of low-tech you could probably you can
also do the the entity right pi it's
like HTML defined and if you know the
Unicode code and are able to type it
then will work too tight I don't know
right I have no idea how to input it but
right it is all utf-8 so there can be
like direct funny characters in there
and it will work out even if you
translate to low-tech it's been very
hard to make work right so actually so
it almost includes my demo stuff I
wanted to share something else which may
be important so I want to open a bigger
document again I'm gonna discard what I
did I want to show like I could go to
Dropbox here and go to my Dropbox
accounts and you see basically all my
Dropbox stuff
it's like Motoko and more stuff and my
samples and there's like a big paper so
you see this paper consists of many
things because it's much bigger right so
it looks less cool because it starts
with a lot of these replacement rules
which which I used to do nice
mathematics
but I want to I'll look here what's it
so I want to show so here's like lots of
includes because the paper consists of
many things right so and if you
double-click on the introduction for
example well if I can click well we can
go there we go to the introduction and
you can see how I write the introduction
and you kind of see it it looks nice
right when I mean when I'm writing it
it's all good and then continues to see
the preview here yeah you know there
works all fine and then when you look at
the mathematics it's of course
complicated because I'll use lots of
math and it's it's what do you say it
that's still a text so you can't remove
that kind of complexity but what you can
do to these replacement rules and
they're used quite heavily so here I
want to show like this particular piece
I have an inference rule here it's like
you know see Sigma Sigma and I actually
write C as : ass in a little turnstile
here just like textual because I have
replacement rules that that make it into
the latech commands and actually found
it really useful because often you have
your own little language and it makes it
much more pleasant to write stuff when
you have these little turn styles
available right and of course you can
still use any funny commands if you
still need that so I've found that that
that ability to transform like how it
looks much more convenient and then
defining many latech commands although
you know you can you can still do it and
and I also do it like I even have like
math definitions there's still a whole
bunch of math stuff right that we do but
it's just in the mathematics so it's a
your documents become sometimes a a you
know the more you write regular regular
text the more it looks good the more you
write the mathematics the more you see
of the low-tech stuff so other big
things are like in this
paper I have a big bibliography and then
you can refer to it so here we refer to
as my own pipe I shouldn't use my own
paper to refer to it but let me see if
another one here like a wobbler right
marriage right there's what Lord with
marriage right and this is how you refer
to it and then you see in the other side
that you know it became a little
reference and there is a big
oh it's again the last one right I did
it before right you know there's like
the list of things that are there and
what Lori's right there and there's a
big big file from which all of this is
generated so if we find our what lore
what lore entry right there it is what's
it and I later think maybe I made a
little mistake in my my VIP entries al
Butler is really like waddler then
you'll see that like it will be detected
that that I'm changing my stuff and it
will automatically re-render all the
stuff on the server and you know run
they've tagged I don't know what it does
for me and then certain point this guy
will will change back right right
there's wobbler right which is kind of
nice it's you kind of remove this whole
console stuff that we normally do but it
still integrates it's your standard you
know big files that you're using it's
another cool thing which I which I love
is like I will skirt it I will go to
Toco 2015 is here's the presentation I
made today and the nice thing is that
because I'm leveraging all this web
stuff I can use other people's libraries
for doing nice presentations so you'll
see here you'll see here what's up right
so you see here that it's this is the
presentation I've been giving right and
it was like all this
text in it right and it'll show you the
preview and when you think about it yeah
it's still like sections and lists it's
all just a regular markdown it's just
that I stylus really especially now and
this styling is already done by others
that made big libraries to to cool
presentations in HTML so by leveraging
on that you get a lot of stuff back so
other cool stuff it's a good show here
today is you'll see these little like
multiple guy sometimes which means
oh I've shared out this particular
directory with others so you you can
actually if you go here what is a one
that I can show people right this one
for example so it says be sta so
nicholai bjÃ¸rnar shared it with me when
I give when he gave his summer school
presentation and he has a big waited so
you can see there's multiple people in
it it means like Nikolaj works with me
and with many other people on this big
summer school presentation and we can
all work together here
that you saw briefly before it imported
the actual styling how it would look
like and then you have this big
presentation with lots of spelling
errors I can see well Oh
things like Donal Logue right so you
actually you could you could say ignore
dialogue you know in a little yeah
that's right
interpolant I think that's fine too well
theta I see let's Interpol one but I
probably ignore the wrong one before
okay well so it's big it's a big
presentation there's lots of math and
lots of actually so much math I'm glad I
didn't go to death summer school it's
like you know it's really really like
it's out there I think right but hey
that's cool so for them it was great and
everybody can work together and if you
do a little guy will pop up in the
corner and show you who's also
working on it and then we're there
working in real time so you can the
merging is still three-way merges not
not real time but you can see where
someone is working so you can at least
avoid conflicts most of the time so like
the window burger does this is where I'm
currently working there's an implicit
lock and other people cannot come in and
edit it which avoids merge conflicts
right so there's no lock so you can see
where the other person is come see what
he's doing at that moment in time
because the merging happens just with
three very merges on on the Dropbox
shared thing or the get up share thing
and it means you if you can work at the
same time at the same part and then you
saw some of you get a merge conflict and
you have to resolve it yourself and
you'll see it in the text like I showed
both pieces and it renders nice though
and then you you you pick what it
should've been it's not real plans but
you see in real time where the other is
so to do it you have to kind of be a
little bit like evil and go for it or
and this is a big thing right which
which is a real difference from word or
like Google Docs you could both be on
the plane working on the talk right and
then you come back and you both added a
lot of content and now you get like a
just a solid three-way merge but yet
there may be conflict so that's that's
part of it right but it means you your
offline mode works well and in
particular yeah this this whole app is
an html5 app that's cached so it works
even if I unplug it I just won't be able
to save on Dropbox at that point in time
know what it is what do we do right
email me right right so there's this two
thing so first all the standard markdown
stuff there's tons of help everywhere
because many people do this but there's
also like this help guy here like
there's a menu right there's lots of
menus but this is the interesting so
this is a reference manual that's pretty
extensive the menu on the left side oh
you'll like this one
oh right yeah this is actually all right
you want to see right so there's a
reference man there's also this this
menu you can put here and then I don't I
don't know what this is a crazy
documents to be editing but suppose I
have some stuff here like hi and I want
to make it bold you could like select
the thing and it's like bolt right and
you can see it's cultural bean would
work too so now it's ball and again it's
unfolded or you could make it cursive or
code right or you could make lists or
yeah you could insert a picture actually
yeah let's insert the picture here
that's that's fun so you can just drop a
file I think I showed it before with a
big file I do yang Yang and then there's
yin-yang picture right there right and
it automatically like your documents
really more than just your documents
right there's big files CSS files and
also these like images and somehow we
put a picture of me in this presentation
I don't know
all right there's like the dictionary of
words that you're ignoring there's all
this he's popping as C++ so he has the
color highlighter they're all these
things right which are important in the
end for the final documents so these are
all there is text files in there all top
book synchronized also on your your
local machine you could run the command
line program it would work too anyway
but I think I want to conclude my talk
where's yeah I wanted to say more I
think yeah I want to say more about
khoka experience with being great like
how I implemented all of this in in this
language with side effect trekking but I
think yeah we spent enough time so I'll
I'll skip it and I'll just go to the
questions right thanks a lot for your
attention and I hope you're going to use
use it and I'll help you I always
running and somebody funding it right so
so the question is if I use it for my
documents what if madoka dotnet stops
existing right well so the good part is
there's the command line program which
does exactly the same thing so you
always have all your files you can
always run that command line program and
it'll translate to standard tech right
and standard HTML so you get I would
tell you you're pretty safe right it
would be bad if I died but in many ways
so actually it builds quite easily so
many people have done this so it's at
these open source you can just build it
so you're actually better off right see
Donuts to build it right you could just
npm install the thing it's very easy to
install but if you want to like if you
want to kind of like if I die you want
to make your own extensions you can so
maybe this is a general things and
nodejs is a environment that uses
chromium in the v8 engine to run java
scripts locally on your platform and
it's mostly used to make web servers so
people think of web servers but
really just giving you an operating
system API like a POSIX API and it's
very easy so many platforms and it's my
target platform normally for coca
because coca generate JavaScript code
and it means they have a package manager
called NPM
so once you've no GS installed is easy
then you can do NPM install Motoko and
Madoka's there so it's modular engine
yes and that's all you have to do to
install it you have the visual
experience no no I wish you had that too
but you have to go to the website with
the visual experience so you have you
have the command-line experience right
and there would be like using latech you
would have to of course for all the
formulas yourself in solar tech yourself
which is a hassle and this is why the
the website is nice because there's like
no install you just go and write point
is presenting large tables of data all
right
what is what do tables look like they
look kind of nice and let me see I think
there we have it well here's a complex
table it is my challenge thing like do
it in latech because normally people
have a hard time I think I know
multi-column is our first or or two
first three and then like double lines
and South or no line that kind of stuff
but yeah they on the other hand they're
all so simple so let me see what how
don't well you can't do it and they look
kind of nice over here I'll insert the
table right here and let's do it here at
3 column table
so here's a table that is how it'll look
like there it is right and you I give
you editor support so when you you can
like - laughs - blah blah and then you
know like reformat it like nicely for
you they're pretty powerful
I can do a lot of stuff so yeah it works
well like like what can I say like like
maybe I don't like it so never do
vertical lines in the table it's like
considered bad so this would be a better
table and then you can you can have
little attributes here like book table
oh it was still updating right so I'm
now in a really big document this is
like a 100 page math heavy presentation
right so the automatically the website's
throttles how how fast it updates so if
your document is smallish it's like
immediate it's larger in weights little
so if a typing pause so now you see all
the vertical lines are gone and it's
like just horizontal lines right so then
you need to learn about markdown like
how it works so this is centering and
the other ones are right aligned semi
standard markdown right so all the other
ones do it similarly like this like so
it works in pen doc for example and
cramdown so you can make large tables
and I do have supports also for long
long tables that break over pages in the
PDF etc I want to write the book and
then I want features for both for
example what thanks for playing
I want sidebars I want bar that our link
it should be placed in simply enclosed
to where like to reference and all that
nice stuff right so this is cool because
so what you can do in my in madoka is so
you make these these these custom blocks
like you saw a lot like math or or what
did I have theorem an equation there's a
role you can define yourself so it would
do one that says like side margin and
then you can write pieces of low tech
you see if tech roblox that you can
write you can just do your own tech and
you can hook into
that particular environment and then say
oh use this allele a tech environment
and commands HML so in the HTML you have
to do something else so you would write
a bunch of CSS rules they write the
little style you just start writing
style like like for example I could just
start here with like a style or a tech
role block and then the math for example
here it has the math class so you would
do Martin maybe background color
background color is gray right and it
would it would when it updates I think
and it's a important oh : gray right so
you know you know it'll just insert this
in the HTML but not in the in the Pete
in the tech right and then for tech you
can write another rule that is a little
more like saying CSS on class Mac and
then you do your special commands so of
course at that point you need to know
what you're doing because if you write
the wrong low tech it'll it'll break the
low tech right but yeah it's possible
and this is how most of these things are
defined like figures they're not like
well the built in because I've wrote
them but they're not building some
edokko they're just built in rules by
the way I shoot if side margin is a
building rule that's nice if you if you
share using what do you give access to
ah right so everything which is a bad
thing but like like when you do don't
box madoka can see your entire door
books all your folders everything but I
rather had then it was like an app that
you could only see your madoka approved
folder but that's not your box doesn't
support it yet so one right does
support anything like that yet because
they onedrive also doesn't support
sharing at this point but maybe in the
future just create an account which is
Oh share your folder with that account
and then that folder is what that
account has access to sure yes you the
same with no box it could make us fit
your own account and then yeah do it now
right no problem right you can do that
right of course you know the Madoka
server doesn't do anything with this
right it's just so it's you know I'm
like a good guy too more future
questions
so basically reviewing things like for
collaboration but you do annotations and
highlighting and whatever and the other
one is revision history how do I see
what's changed so yeah I I would love to
see like we like trekking of Commons
inside your documents right so I don't
know how or what would be the best way
oh sure yeah yeah so we can use that for
leaving notes for my yes so yeah that's
really easy to do people do it all the
time like a you made that you know maybe
I'll show that one here like you often
you see this kind of stuff right so this
is what people do now which works pretty
well where's the F star there is f star
tutorial and a whole bunch of people
worked on that and then there's a bunch
of they made their own author notes well
so here you see like NS is Nick Swamy
right so it's a to do block but in red
and it will be with Nick and etc right
so every time someone writes one of
these to do blocks you know it'll pop up
in the text and you can see it and then
you know that that works well enough I
don't know if you see any here
I think someone they don't brag many so
you want to show it in the preview you
don't want to show it in the final
output so it's a do block takes care of
that and the other thing what would be
really great is if you could somehow now
I can see so if you could somehow do
revision history still so currently
that's just not there so one there's two
things you can do one of them is you can
take snapshots and give it a message so
if you do a snapshot it saves the whole
thing with a message so that's pretty
good and a date like like everything
needed to regenerate your documents
everything else right that you did at
that point in time so there will be
that's a good snapshot right you do it
before you publish it or something and
then you can of course look in your
Dropbox history to see every 30 seconds
you know what your document looked like
but it's and then if you integrate with
github you see all your commits like
normally so then you you get this but
then it's a regular hip-hop work style
and I kind of like the more real-time
sharing on Thor box or onedrive because
that that's you know you see everyone
working but then you like this this
revision history yeah if you have a
great idea on how to do this that would
be great and especially we can piggyback
on existing technology yes well right
I'm changing it it grew really big the
undo buffer so I got into trouble don't
know now indeed I clear it on refresh
but I want to change that but right
there is there is a limit to how much
you can undo and it's always within one
file right so often there's a whole
bunch of files and includes it you
really want
revisions of everything the snapshot is
best at this point how do you transfer
ah right right so I just happen to have
the menu open it does have an import
feature which is still in its initial
stages but it works quite well so you
can basically click on it and then
import a lot a document and you will
have to supply the first document you
have and then drag and drop in all the
includes that you have and it works
pretty well but of course I can't parse
low-tech really so it does a you know
good effort job it turns out that most
of your commands are usually actually
for mathematics and not so much for like
sections and small caps and that kind of
stuff
so it almost documents I try it up till
now it works pretty well
yes right and then till you see still
all these commands and then you can fix
them yeah I've just been trying this on
there yeah I don't know yeah I can
probably showed it on someone's
dissertation and it you know it it
dissertations are very complicated
documents so I was surprised how well it
actually came over here the by meant
it's more safe so this is a document it
was converted automatically from a paper
on the in the vibe group by endru beagle
and it it looks pretty good right so
this is all automatic
that is very few funny stuff left out
right here you see some funny stuff like
still an SI command which I don't
translate this is a some package I don't
know about today you're gonna have to go
in and do your own stuff but most of the
things come out quite well right
anyway thanks a lot for your attention I
hope you're gonna use it and yeah
awesome thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
